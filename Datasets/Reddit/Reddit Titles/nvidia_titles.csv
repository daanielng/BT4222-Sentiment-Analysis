Usually, U.S. stocks will rise in the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year, a phenomenon known as the ""Christmas market. The lower-than-average trading volume, combined with the fact that many investors are closed for the holidays, can lead to increased trading volatility. Some companies are also adjusting their portfolios at the end of the year.

Brent crude oil futures for February delivery on the Intercontinental Exchange in London rose 9 cents, or 0.1 percent, to close at $79.32 a barrel. Brent crude oil futures have risen for four consecutive trading days so far.

5. Thursday gold futures closed 0.5% higher

Gold futures prices closed higher on Thursday despite a stabilizing dollar and higher U.S. stocks.

Investors believe the Omicron mutant strain is less of a threat to economic growth, pushing the dollar to stabilize on Thursday and U.S. stocks to climb, pushing the Dow and S&P 500 to new intraday highs.

6. Year-end U.S. unemployment benefits data released Gold rises U.S. bonds fell

U.S. first-time jobless claims fell unexpectedly last week, indicating that despite the outbreak of a new round of epidemics, but labor demand is still strong.

Data from the U.S. Department of Labor on Thursday showed that in the week ended Dec. 25, the number of first-time jobless claims totaled 198,000, down 8,000 from the revised level in the previous cycle. The median estimate of economists surveyed was 206,000.

**International Macro**

1. The founder of Bridgewater Dalio: the Fed may raise interest rates 4-5 times next year, which will be a sensitive issue

Rui Dalio, founder of the world's largest hedge fund Bridgewater, said in an exclusive interview that the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates 4-5 times next year until it negatively affects the stock market.

Regarding the current inflationary pressure, Dalio pointed out that the U.S. now has two types of inflation: a cyclical inflation that occurs when demand for goods and services exceeds production capacity, and a monetary inflation caused by the over-issuance of money and credit.

For the second type of inflation, he warned that if cash and bond holders were to sell these assets in a big way, the central bank would have to raise interest rates at a faster pace or keep them low by printing money and buying financial assets, and this would exacerbate inflation. This adds difficulty to the Fed's policy making.

2. The United States CDC: regardless of vaccination or not, people should avoid cruise travel

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday advised people not to travel on cruise ships, regardless of their vaccination status, as the Omicron variant swept the world with a recent sharp increase in new positive crown cases.

The CDC raised its travel advisory for cruise ships to the highest level. The agency is currently investigating or observing dozens of cruise ships with New Crown outbreaks.

The CDC warns that the New Crown virus is easily spread from person to person in close proximity on board ships and that the chances of contracting the virus on a cruise ship are very high, even with New Crown vaccinations and booster shots.

3. U.S. Cancellations Exceed 1,000 Again as Chaotic Holiday Travel Season Continues

The number of flight cancellations by U.S. airlines is still growing, with another 1,170 flights cancelled Thursday as a surge in coronavirus cases leads to severe understaffing. And the forecasted snowstorm could further disrupt travel during the New Year's holiday.

According to [FlightAware.com](https://FlightAware.com), JetBlue canceled 175 flights, or 17 percent of its scheduled flights, as of 2:27 p.m. New York time Thursday. Allegiant canceled 93 flights, or 18 percent of its scheduled flights. United Airlines canceled 197, or 9 percent of its schedule. By noon, the number of flights canceled for the day had surpassed the 1,084 canceled for the entire day on Wednesday.

This comes on the heels of thousands of U.S. flight cancellations over the Christmas weekend and into the early part of the week due to winter storms coupled with staffing shortages.

4. U.S. first-time jobless claims unexpectedly fell last week, highlighting that labor demand is still strong

The number of first-time jobless claims fell unexpectedly last week, indicating that labor demand is still strong despite the new outbreak of the epidemic.

The number of first-time jobless claims totaled 198,000 in the week ended Dec. 25, down 8,000 from a revised level in the previous cycle, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 206,000.

The number of continuing claims for unemployment benefits fell to 1.72 million in the week ended Dec. 18, the lowest since March last year.

5. The United States civil servants treatment ""peak""? U.S. media revealed that Fauci's annual pension can be $ 350,000

The report said that the U.S. government has served 55 years of Fauci for two consecutive years to become ""the highest-paid civil servants in the United States"": 2019 income of $417,000, 2020 rose to $434,000. His salary is higher than that of the president of the United States, admirals and some 4.3 million U.S. government employees.

According to Federal Personnel Administration standards, Fauci's pension is calculated as the average of his 3-year maximum earnings, multiplied by 80 percent. If he receives the same salary in 2021 and 2022 as he did in 2020, his pension could reach $347,000.

In addition, his ""long service"" can bring additional government annuity benefits, the amount is at least $ 8,344 per year.

6. Israel officially approved the opening of the fourth dose of the new crown vaccination limited to people with low immunity

In the evening of Dec. 30, local time, Nachman Ash, director general of Israel's Ministry of Health, officially approved the opening of the fourth dose of the new crown vaccination to the country's immunocompromised population, but still has not approved the opening to people over 60 years old and medical workers.

7. The European Central Bank management committee Nott: the end of bond purchases may be raised in early 2023

ECB Governing Council member Nott said the ECB is close to achieving its medium-term inflation target of 2%, and the likelihood of inflation staying above 2% in 2022 is high, although it will not be far above 2%. If prices continue to rise unexpectedly, the central bank could unwind stimulus measures sooner than it plans to now. Policy rates could rise after bond purchases end in early 2023.

8. ECB Governing Council member Vesco: 3% average inflation expected in 2022

ECB Governing Council member Vesco said inflation is expected to average 3% in 2022 and then gradually fall back to a level slightly below 2%; inflation in 2023-24 is expected to be below 2%, facing downside and upside risks.

**Company News**

1. Tesla recalls about 475,000 vehicles in the U.S., close to its total global deliveries last year

Tesla is recalling about 475,000 vehicles in the U.S., almost as many as its total global deliveries last year, due to a technical defect that could increase the risk of accidents.

Tesla plans to recall all Model 3 models built between 2017 and 2020, totaling as many as 356,309 units. The company told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that the wiring harness of the rearview camera can be damaged by opening and closing the trunk, hindering the image display.

Tesla is also recalling as many as 119,009 Model S vehicles assembled since 2014 because of a problem with the front longitudinal beam that could cause the hood to open unexpectedly, according to a separate NHTSA statement posted on its official website Thursday. The company said it will fix both problems for free.

2. The only big winner in the lack of core crisis: Tesla

The global automotive industry is affected by the ""lack of core"", but Tesla's production this year is expected to be about 80% more than last year. Because of its strong self-research chip capability and vertical integration ability, Tesla is not afraid of the ""chip shortage"" and has become the biggest winner in the industry.

3. 2021 global M&A transactions for the first time exceeded the $5 trillion mark Goldman Sachs for the fifth consecutive year to take the lead

Goldman Sachs Group is sitting at the top of the table as global M&A deals set a record in 2021.

For the fifth consecutive year, Goldman Sachs topped the list of M&A advisors based on the total dollar value of deals handled, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Goldman Sachs' top spot comes as global mergers and acquisitions and related transactions surpassed $5 trillion for the first time. The bank advised on more than $1 trillion worth of transactions, with a market share of more than 24 percent, according to the data.

4. The U.S. airline industry faces the test of the epidemic JetBlue Airways announced that it will cancel about 1,280 flights

JetBlue Airways said it is reducing its flight schedule by about 1,280 flights through Jan. 13 due to a significant increase in cases of Omicron strain infection among its crews.

A JetBlue spokesman said the number of new coronavirus cases in the northeast, where most of the company's crews are located, is expected to continue to spike over the next one to two weeks, meaning the likelihood of continued flight cancellations until the number of new cases drops.

5. Samsung denies acquisition does not matter Canaccord Genuity expects limited downside for Baiken

Canaccord Genuity analyst Sumant Kulkarni maintained a ""buy"" rating on Biogen ([BIIB.US](https://BIIB.US)) with a price target of $390.

Earlier, South Korean media reported that Samsung Group was in talks to buy Biogen, saying it was valued at about $42 billion. Subsequently, Samsung Bio, a subsidiary of Samsung, said these were untrue information.

In fairness, this does look like a categorical denial,"" Kulkarni said in a report. However, we lack the relevant language background to figure out the nuances of what was specifically identified as untrue in the Korean-language document.""

6. Employees complained that Amazon is too cold: no compensation after work injury, and not allowed to take leave

Some Amazon employees reportedly complained recently that it was difficult for them to get compensation and leave after being injured on the job.

In June this year, an analysis said that the rate of serious injuries on the job of Amazon warehouse employees is almost twice that of other companies in the industry. The data showed that in 2020, Amazon warehouse employees had an average of 5.9 ""serious"" injuries per 200,000 hours worked.

This compares to an average of 3.3 ""serious"" injuries per 200,000 hours across the warehouse industry. As one of Amazon's largest competitors in the retail industry, Walmart has 2.5 ""serious"" injuries per 200,000 hours, less than half of Amazon's serious injury rate.

Luminar technologies $17.27

Self driving cars have a serious problem that needs to be solved before they are road capable. Self driving cars need to “see” the road and process what they see and then act accordingly to their surroundings. In specific conditions, like fog, rain, and night-time darkness, cameras simply don’t work, this is where LIDAR does well. LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is essentially a high frequency laser radar that is accurate enough to see superior imagery at far distances, like echolocation with high definition. This leads most car manufacturers to trust LIDAR more than traditional cameras to sense their surroundings with some exceptions.

Production of LIDAR for cars is usually outsourced due to the complex nature and high performance needed of LIDAR systems to work properly. The function of LIDAR is so important for self-driving vehicles to work, and perfection of the LIDAR systems has been one of the major bottlenecks of autonomous vehicles rollout. The Cost, quality, and safety are all important things for automotive OEMs. The complete LIDAR system requires CPUs, APUs, complex sensors as well as high frequency laser technology, and advanced software all integrated into a package that Automotive OEMs cannot produce themselves, all the work will be outsourced to LIDAR companies like Luminar and Nvidia.

Luminar signed a major deal with Nvidia on Nov 9, 2021. The company will provide the LIDAR technology components of the Nvidia solution. We feel that this is a major development for Luminar which should drive strong future revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth, pushing the stock higher. This is a large step forward for Luminar in securing a major slot on the Nvidia platform which we feel will be adopted by major OEMs.

Nvidia announced the DRIVE Hyperion system for cars available in Q2 2022, which feature the Iris LIDAR system from Luminar Technologies. Luminars partnership with Nvidia should drastically increase revenues once Nvidia's drive hyperion system is fully released.

The sum of LIDARs current customers include Polestar, Mobileye, Kodiak’s, Embark, Webasto, and Inalfa as global partner businesses that are integrating LIDAR systems into their cars, roofing systems and trucks. Volvo also has a deal to include LIDAR systems in their XC90 2022 standard model. Daimler also acquired a minority stake in the company and intends to stick with Luminar for production of LIDAR technology for their trucks.

The AV (Autonomous Vehicle ) market is expected to grow dramatically that the overall car market. Autonomous trucks, and taxis are going to grow in popularity, and will become a viable option when the technology enables easy installation and cheaper costs than a driver. Luminar wants to become the market leader in the personal AV market and the autonomous trucking industries.

&#x200B;

Luminar currently has a market cap of $5.64 billion, the largest in the LIDAR market. Competitors are all valued at around $900 million to $1.5 billion. All companies are competing to offer a cheap product that can still safely allow for autonomous driving.

Luminar is a few years away from becoming fully profitable as their technology is slowly implemented into the marketplace. In 2020 the company reported revenue of $13.95 million and a loss of $362.3 million and should report a significant operating loss in 2021 but much better than the numbers in 2020. The company has a cash reserve of $500 million from a recent financing, and almost no debt.

Luminar announced a stock buyback of $250 million of their stock on December 14th, 2021, causing the stock to jump 9%. Founder and CEO Austin Russell also bought shares in the open market totaling XXX Luminar Is down around 50% year to date and is around 2 years out from positive revenue through growth in product demand. It's an interesting move at the moment to remove cash and buy stock, this is a good bullish indicator that the management team has faith in their product and expects the stock to increase in the future.

Luminar is set up to benefit the most from market growth due to their products' relative price per unit and superior performance, and larger funding to continue R&D. Luminar products are expected to cost around $1000 per unit and be available for mass market adoption by all OEMs by the second half of 2022. The automotive lidar market is large enough to support multiple different players, and we feel Luminar has carved out a significant beach in both automotives and trucks.

Once concern is market competition from others to produce a LIDAR system more cheaply that could undercut the market for Luminar. A slowdown in the adoption of AVs through technical or legal difficulties could result in a slower timetable for revenue growth and hurt the bottom line.

We believe that Luminar's lidar systems have multiple segments of growth on their side. One is the growing number of AVs in the marketplace due to consumer demand. Another is the deal with Nvidia that increases the amount of LIDAR content per car significantly. Thirdly, the adoption of Lidar in other end markets such as robotics (like robot-taxis), drones, and other segments of the economy will be quick to adopt cheap and reliable systems of lidar. The combination of these three major growth drivers should push Luminar's revenue per share and earnings per share higher driving the stock much higher."

Wh did fADTX is a fidelity technology fund. It crashed 11% on Friday, but looking at its major holdings I can not make sense of this much of a crash. Yes the holdings went down a bit but not this much.
Here are the top holdings 

From booking g at the top holdings of AAPL,MSFT, and NVDA I can not make sense of this fall.  Here is a look at the holdings https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/fadtx/holdings

Maybe I don’t understand how a mutual fund was priced but I thought it was a function of its constituents.

I also took a second to look around and googled to try to find out why it crashed so bad on Friday but I could not find anything.

Any help would be appreciated"

2020 and 2021 have been extraordinary years. They also have been extraordinary for the stock market. After an initial dip in the stock market when COVID broke out everything and anything rallied. Initial dip only lasted 2 months and then sector by sector flew into all time highs and rallied now for a year and a half. There were massive gains to be made in tech, pharmaceuticals, speculative plays, even the old boring financials and even the housing market… I won’t even mention the short squeezes! I myself had some fun with those.
No matter how high the prices looked for the stocks- they just kept getting higher. Critical opinions from analysts and news reporters started disappearing. It just doesn’t look very good if you keep saying that things are overpriced when those prices keep going up, does it? I remember Elon Musk saying that  Tesla prices were too high at $750 pre split- then it reached $1200 post split and now Tesla is trading at 300 PE ratio! And somehow nobody says that it’s that high anymore… Folks, don’t get me wrong, I love Tesla- it’s a great company; and would Elon Musk purpose to me tomorrow I’d say “yes!” without a blink of an eye, but 300 x price per earnings? I suppose Tesla will have to electrify Mars too.
 
I should not single one stock out. Most stocks have gotten into euphoria zone mid pandemic, mid and small caps including. But what no one seems to have noticed is that while blue chips continued to rally- most mid caps (after reaching highs a year ago) have already consolidated. Yes! That’s exactly what I’m saying -market has already corrected leaving only the shiny blue chips at sky high prices. I really don’t want to be this person spewing gloom and doom everywhere, but I do not see a good year coming for Amazon, Tesla, Google, Ford, Zoom, Nvidia, Home Depot, etc. They are exceptional companies, that are currently priced even more exceptionally (if you know what I mean). We won’t be buying computers to start working from home anymore; we have bought extraordinary amount of cars to avoid public transport so there will be little demand for automobiles in the next 5 years, we have already settled with our new subscriptions, housing market is finally slowing and we are not redesigning our home anymore to accommodate a work from home office. There has been an incredible growth in the past few years but now earnings reports will start coming in showing stagnation or downtrend in demand and euphoria will pop very quickly. Our big growth companies will not be growing that fast anymore and can you really justify 50, 100, 300 PE for something that is not extremely high growth? For something that is possibly very strongly affected by inflation?
 
 
So following this thought process what do I think will happen in the stock market? I’ll pretend I’m an oracle here for a second…
Hedge funds need to justify their fees and make some money, most of them do not or are not allowed to go short so they will be looking for opportunities. Possibly stocks that are heavily underpriced with sound fundamentals and that are not that affected by fluctuations in demand. I vouch for the whole pharmaceutical sector to have an amazing year! Data collection agencies, infrastructure, utilities, gold miners should do well. Quite frankly all those beat down forgotten stocks that we were ignoring for the past year should come to life. I believe that after nearly two year stock market euphoria we will come back to fundamentals and conviction plays. Easy money won’t be a thing of the day anymore and things won’t rally “just because”….. here I am with gloom and doom again, but I do think that we need to prepare for more of a whack-a-mole setup in the market for the next few years and stay away from anything that doesn’t appear to be a good deal. I also believe that S&P and Nasdaq will pull back and will make negative gains next year or maybe even a few after, but that doesn’t mean that there won’t be gains made in niches or catalyst plays.
 
 Check out a 20 year Nasdaq yearly chart to see for yourself how desperately it needs to consolidate and it does do consolidate! 

As for myself, I’ll be scouting out the stocks that have strong fundamentals, high growth possibilities (without hitting my wallet with high PE) and positive catalysts in the near future. Happy hunting everyone!"

# Wtf is a Cyxtera?

Cyxtera is a datacenter colocator founded in 2017. In other words, they help maintain and store your data so you can quickly, reliably, and efficiently watch any selection of the archives of poon that you uploaded on the cloud. Other companies in the space include Equinix, DigitalOcean, CoreSite, etc. 

 

# Paper is cheap AF

This is stock is cheaper than I am during a Flea market visit after Black Friday. Cyxtera IPO'd through a spac merger, which is why I think it's relatively under the radar. And by relatively, I mean completely unknown. There hasn't been a single mention of it on WSB. ~~The price at 10.60 is still super close to the NAV price of $10 dollars and the MC is sitting around 1.7 B.~~ Whoops, I procrastinated and the price is now 11.34 atm. mb. Doesn't change the fact that Im bullish AF.

But I think we can definitely infer that big investors/a lot of investors are liking the stock. Cyxtera just had 2 PR events (if you read my MTTR dd, you know how much I like PR), that occurred on  [12/1 and 12/6](https://ir.cyxtera.com/events-and-presentations/). Following those, there is a sudden spike in buying interest and stock price. That's just my guess, so take it with a grain of salt.

Here are a few comparisons with company MC, Revenue, P/E ratios.

&#x200B;

|Company|Mkt Cap|Revenue|P/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Cyxtera|1.72 Billion|177 M|Current Net Loss|
|Equinix|73.3 Billion|1,700 M|172|
|CoreSite|7.5 Billion|164 M|82|
|Digital Realty|47.7 Billion|1,110 M|70|

Cyxtera is currently operating at net revenue loss. I can't hide that fact. If you're gonna get some, you'll probably be holding it for a while, but I do see a lot of upside with the company. They're currently working with [Nvidia](https://ir.cyxtera.com/news/news-details/2021/Cyxtera-Supports-NVIDIA-Inception-Program-for-Technology-Startups/default.aspx)'s inception members (a bunch of tech startups funded by/supported by N f-ing Vidia ) and also with Nutanix and [Intel](https://ir.cyxtera.com/news/news-details/2021/Nutanix-Collaborates-with-Cyxtera-Intel-and-Other-Industry-Leading-Technology-Partners-to-Launch-Federal-Innovation-Lab/default.aspx) on the Federal Innovation Labs.

The Nvidia inception imo is a great way to get more exposure to up and coming companies that are already funded (at least to some degree) by Nvidia. These are predominantly ML/AI companies. If any of yall know about that field, the amount of data and storage needed to train and test models is ridiculous. All that is just gonna be profit for Cyxtera in the future.  

The Nutanix/Intel partnership is no laughing matter either. IT'S FOR THE GOVERNMENT. ask the pltards, they LOVE when companies work with the government.

# TA:

Tbh. I don't really know wtf im doing in this section. But I learned somewhere higher lows and higher highs is a good thing. and I think that's what I'm seeing? The 3 month chart on this looks beautiful. lol correct me if I'm wrong. cuz I honestly have no idea what I'm doing. I just know you draw dots and connect them.

Positions:

\~ 1000 shares total of Cyxt avg price \~ $9.50 ish, 5 $7.5 calls 

I definitely don't recommend FDs on this stock, but if you wanna ape, This aint financial advice so do whatever you want. It's most likely a long term hold, but I just wanted to give it exposure to someone cuz it seems no one knows about it."

The semiconductor industry has grown into a $4.67 trillion aggregate containing an extensive group of companies at the crux of modern technology. Semiconductors are at the foundation of modern life, as they are materials with conductive properties used to manufacture various kinds of electronic devices across all industries. They are the foundation of modern life, as they enable everything from cars to medical devices to appliances. 

	Over the past 30 years, the industry has experienced rapid growth in response to the various technological advancements during this time period. Techn0logical evolutions of PCs in the 1990s, internet services during the 2000s, and smartphones during the 2010s would not have been possible without advanced chip performance from semiconductors. An estimated $3 trillion in global GDP between 1995 to 2015 has been directly attributed to semiconductor innovation… (continued in article)

[Goldman Sachs Group Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US)  strategists said there’s little reason to expect a major retreat in  U.S. stocks in the months ahead, even as the breadth of the rally that  has pushed the S&P 500 index into successive records is getting  increasingly narrow. 

**Just five stocks account for 51% of the U.S.  benchmark’s returns since April,** Goldman’s strategists led by David  Kostin wrote in a note to clients. Those same stocks - [Apple Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US), [Microsoft Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MSFT:US), [Alphabet Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GOOGL:US), [NVIDIA Corp](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/NVDA:US)., and [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US)  \- together account for more than a third of the gauge’s returns this  year and more than a fifth of its total market capitalization, according  to the strategists. 

**The S&P 500 rose to another** [**all-time-high on Friday**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/R3X4IXT0AFB4)**,**  after a swift rebound from a post-Thanksgiving slump triggered by the  spread of the omicron variant. The highest year-over-year U.S. inflation  reading since 1982, and an increasingly hawkish tone from the [Federal Reserve](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/13598Z:US), have not [deterred investors](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-10/dip-buyers-scoring-historic-win-in-stocks-that-defy-bond-warning) from buying the dips. 

The difference between the initial post-pandemic  rebound and the recent gains is that the breadth of the rally has  markedly narrowed, and this has been causing alarm, according to  Goldman. “Following periods of sharply narrowing market breadth –  similar to the recent experience – equities have historically exhibited  weaker-than-average returns and deeper drawdowns,” the strategists  wrote. 

Looking ahead though, there are few  reasons to see why history would repeat itself this time.  **“The macro  environment does not suggest drawdown risk is elevated in the coming  months,” the strategists wrote,** highlighting that earnings and margins  continue to surpass expectations, a low risk of recession, and share  prices already reflecting the likely Fed tightening. 

“Nominal and real rates are expected to rise but  remain low over the coming months, supporting the backdrop for both  valuation and equity demand,” the strategists said, **advising investors  to own stocks with high growth and high margins.**

Now here’s the narrative…

DDR5 is the next evolution of dynamic RAM, and all the investment analysts are super smart and have built reliable models of how system builders slowly transition from one memory standard to the next.  In fact you can find many articles from the past 6 months about how the cyclical DRAM market has entered a slower phase and the combination of inventory and production ramp-up time means we can expect slower growth from chip makers that are heavily DRAM makers. Like Micron.  That’s the sole reason why Micron (PE 14) has not followed Nvidia (PE 114), AMD (PE 47), Broadcom (PE 42), Applied Materials (PE 27), Qualcomm (PE 23) into much higher valuations.

But now there’s a nasty new version of an exploit called RowHammer that hackers can use to disrupt or steal from DDR4 systems, which is most of the worlds current PC and Unix systems.

DDR5 is naturally more resistant to RowHammer.  Intel and AMD motherboards are already scheduled to ship in 2022 with DDR5 support, so the engineering work is done.  The Rowhammer exploit increases the urgency to upgrade systems and will thus shift the demand curve ahead of what the analysts have in their models.

Now DDR5 makers like Micron, instead of being seen as in a more slow-growth phase of their industry compared to other chip makers, will quickly be recognized to be in high-growth phase, maybe emergency high-growth if a couple Rowhammer exploitations get publicized.

Edit:  I know I misspelled RowHammer in the title.  Turns out you can't edit the title.  Total autist here, you're prolly best off ignoring everything I say."

TSMC is the worlds largest semiconductor manufacturer, with total market share at 57%, and high-performance market share of  >70%. They are based in Taiwan, but have recently started construction of new fabs in Arizona and Japan. They supply chips for Apple, AMD, NVDA, INTC.

**Opportunity**

*Large Addressable Market, and Growing*

The semiconductor space is currently a $550B industry, with total market growth of almost 25% YoY. This kind of growth rate for a mature industry is incredible, but semiconductors have a cyclical nature. Total semiconductor share is expected to grow to $800B by 2028, a CAGR of almost 10%.

*Strong Macro Tailwind*

Possible semiconductor legislation, and moves to green energy store, production,and EVs require semiconductors

*Possible semiconductor supercycle*

The age of the Metaverse, AI, 5G, EVs, self-driving, and robotics are upon us. These industries are growing at rapid pace and require custom chips, with TSMC provides. AMD/NVDA have skyrocketed this year on Metaverse news/great earnings, and TSMC is the main supplier of these high performance chips. The reason Micron bounced back recently is because people are realizing this cycle will last longer than they thought. AMD CEO Lisa Su (I love her) recently stated we are in a semiconductor megacycle. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZGwLas0MyY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZGwLas0MyY)

**Strengths**

*Strong Financials*

TSMC is sitting on a PE of 29, and a forward PE of 25. They are currently growing at a CAGR of about 15%, with their gross margin at about 50%, which I suspect will be growing in the coming quarters. TSMC recently raised prices across the board 10-20%, which all their customers accepted. They know they have pricing power, as they sell literally everything they make. Companies fight over capacity. I have a feeling we may see more price increases in the future as their moat widens. They also pay a nice dividend.

*Amazing Products, Wide Moat*

TSMCs moat is widening every year. Frankly, Intel is fucked. They are 1-2 years behind on nodes, and this gap is growing. TSMC will spend more than 100 billion dollars in just the next 3 years on fabs, which they have plans for 3 new fabs this year. TSMC is starting mass production on 5nm nodes, while Intel is on 10nm (about 7nm compared to TSMC). Once you lose the performance crown, it's very difficult to take it back. In fact, Intel started to buy chips from TSMC this year.

**Risks**

*Gyna.* Over 50% of their capacity in based on Taiwan. If China decides to attack, they are fucked.

HOWEVER, tell me. If China attacks Taiwan, what do you think will happen to your stocks? The entire market will take a shit. It will be WW3. So while these are valid concerns, the chances of an invasion are very low, and if they do, money is gonna be the least of my problems. Anyways.

**The Play**

TSM is currently up 20% over the last year (YTD 4%), underperforming the market, with semiconductor ETFs up over 45% in the same period. They’ve traded in a range of 110-125 since February. Last week, they broke above 125 before the market took a fat shit. Options volume has been crazy and IV is on the rise, whales buying up tons of December calls.

The Play will be load up on Jan 23 125 calls. The IV is very low at about 30%, and a breakeven of 138 in 14 months. Just saying, we were over these prices in January. If you want more risk/more reward, Jan/March 125c will probably print. I bought in a 120 and will triple down at 110.

In Conclusion, **TSM Jan 23 125c.** "

According to the U.S. News & World Report reported on Wednesday (June 30), retail investors currently account for roughly 10% of daily trading volume on the Russell 3000, the broadest U.S. stocks index, after peaking at 15% in September as lockdown boredom and extra savings triggered interest in stock markets. 

Since we definitely have a great influence on the overall trading situation, I decided to conduct new research on the most popular companies over the last week based on retail traders’ activity (buying/selling), as well as the sentiment of their tendencies.

Let's drill into this and discover the top 5 companies by percentage of trades by retail traders for the last week:

**1. Tesla (**[**$TSLA**](https://contora.ai/ticker/TSLA)**)**

Even after selling billion worth of shares by Elon Musk, $TSLA remains the most valuable automaker in the world, with a market valuation >$1 trillion.

**2. Lucid Group, Inc. (**[**$LCID**](https://contora.ai/ticker/LCID)**)** \- is a technology and automotive company. It develops the next generation of electric vehicle (EV) technologies.

Btw, $NVDA shares bounced back today from their mini sell-off - it happened after **Nvidia** crushed Wall Street's expectations when it released its fiscal 2022 third-quarter results on November 17th, with its record numbers and impressive guidance sending the stock up 8% to a new all-time high post the release.

**5. AMD (**[**$AMD**](https://contora.ai/ticker/AMD)**)** \- for more than 50 years Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has driven innovation in high-performance computing, graphics, and visualization technologies - the building blocks for gaming, immersive platforms, and the data center.

What are your thoughts about it? I think that it's another brilliant indicator of companies' performance all over the Web which, with a correct approach, will definitely become an additional powerful investment signal."

**Will MU be running in the 90’s? Bullish or bearish; let me know your opinion/analysis in the comments.**

[Part one link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzkdma/mu_micron_technology_deepdive_adderallfueled_dd/)

So first, we are going to look at the past three days of trading. The stock has had solid momentum over the last 30 days, and especially the past three days. Micron shares have gained 27% this month, the last 30 days have brought the annual gain to 34%.

**Why did MU pop on Friday:**

**Micron opened at 78.93, had a high of 83.86, a low of 78.93, closed at 83.03 (7.80% change), and 47.22M volume.**

[Covered in the first DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzkdma/mu_micron_technology_deepdive_adderallfueled_dd/) *Micron climbed a lot on Friday. This was due to an analyst at Evercore ISI adding the memory chip maker to his list of top stock picks. [He anticipates a return to earnings growth next year.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-stock-price-earnings-chip-shortage-51632864045?mod=article_inline).*

(
*‘“In his note, Muse wrote that while shares of chip makers like Micron have lagged behind the PHLX Semiconductor index, or SOX, since early June, the tide may be shifting.*

*“We believe negative sentiment was due to investor concerns over the sustainability of PC, handsets, and cloud demand, which was also compounded by DRAM spot pricing that began to flatten out in May/June 2021,” Muse wrote.’*

[Useful Nasdaq article explaining Friday’s hype ""Why Is Everyone Talking About Micron Stock?”](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-is-everyone-talking-about-micron-stock)

This is also due to the Citi upgrade (see Monday section).

**Why did MU pop on Monday:**

**Micron opened at 83.66, had a high of 87.67, a low of 83.66, closed at 83.86 (1.00% change) and 34.35M volume.**

MU popped again on Monday, with shares rising as much as 5.6%. Monday’s rise was due to a variety of reasons, outlined below.

**An important thing to note is that despite the market slide on Monday, Micron generally held its own and remained green.** The rest of my calls were obliterated, meanwhile the calls I bought pre-market and 5 minutes after open remained in profit. I did not sell these on the peak, I am still holding them. 


*Evercore ISI analyst upgrade from Friday:* 
Again due to the Evercore ISI price upgrade on Friday, MU saw strong momentum on Monday.

*Citi analyst upgrade from Friday:*
*“Citi analyst Christopher Danely said the pricing correction in the DRAM market was ""drawing to a close"" as the PC and server markets stabilized and expanded. As such, he expects Micron to benefit from ""more positive catalysts"" in the coming months and maintains a ""buy"" rating with a price target of $120 -- more than 40% above its current price.”*

*CNBC article released pre-market:*
[An article was released on Monday from CNBC, 7:00AM EST.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/22/micron-stock-has-best-day-in-18-months-traders-see-bigger-breakout.html)  This highlighted the two analyst upgrades, their targets, and the upside. Due to CNBC’s wide reach, this highlighted the stock to other investors and drove momentum. 

One bearish thing to note (not in the article), from CNBC ‘Trading Nation: “On CNBC’s ""Trading Nation,"" Michael Binger of Gradient Investments said semiconductor stocks that have gained sharply in the recent period are likely to pull back.”
However my opinion as of Wednesday is that this has happened to much of the semi-sector Monday/Tuesday, but MU has remained largely unaffected thus far.

*Micron’s LPDDR5X DRAM is going to be used in the MediaTek Dimensity 9000:*

**This is important news, I’m going to cover this later in my DD.** This was also announced pre-market. 
*[“Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) revealed that its low-power double data rate 5X (LPDDR5X) DRAM for MediaTek Inc.’s new Dimensity 9000 5G flagship chipset for smartphones has been validated.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/micron-lpddr5x-dram-to-feature-in-mediatek-dimensity-9000)*
 
*”Built on its 1α (1-alpha) node, the new chipset will help smartphones unlock applications powered by artificial intelligence and 5G innovation. Micron claims LPDDR5X to be the fastest and most advanced mobile memory available. It says that it has shipped the first batch of samples.”*
 
*“Meanwhile, Micron disclosed that it was joining hands with leading smartphone manufacturers and chipset vendors to enable ecosystem innovation with LPDDR5X.*
[*Micron outperformed the general market on Monday*](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/micron-technology-inc-stock-rises-monday-outperforms-market-01637619013)

[*Nasdaq recommended Micron as one of top 4 stock trades for Monday*](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-top-stock-trades-for-monday%3A-lcid-hood-mu-fl-2021-11-19)

[**Furthermore MU was the 3nd (2nd according to other scrapers) most discussed stock on Wallstreetbets Monday**](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/21/11/24215526/gamestop-top-discussed-stock-on-wallstreetbets-heading-into-new-week-micron-tesla-and-th)

**Why did MU pop again on Tuesday:**

**Micron opened at 85.04, had a high of 87.71, a low of 84.33, closed at 85.41 (1.85% change), and had a volume of 31.64M**

Micron again showed strong performance yesterday. Again, much of the semi sector was sliding/underperforming, yet Micron remained strong. 

The primary reason for this was that [Mizuho](https://www.mizuhogroup.com/) upgraded Micron back to a buy (one month after it was downgraded). 

[Link to Marketwatch article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/micron-upgraded-back-to-a-buy-at-mizuho-just-one-month-after-it-was-downgraded-11637672539?mod=mw_latestnews)

Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh again became bullish on Micron. He upgraded it to buy, after downgrading it to neutral on October 20th. He changed his price target to $95 from $75.

*“When Rakesh downgraded Micron last month, he cited expectations of a soft demand outlook for the first half of 2022 for PCs and notebooks, server and handset markets.*

*“However, our recent checks indicate the ‘ACTUAL’ demand is improving across all three markets,” Rakesh wrote in a research note, with first-quarter PC/NB builds “only” flat to down 5% from the previous quarter, compared with expectations of a 10% to 15% decline and handsets flat versus expectations of down 10%. He also believes server demand could improve.”*


[From Barrons:](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-mu-western-digital-wdc-stocks-analyst-buy-51637675537)
“New data indicated actual demand was improving across PCs, servers and handsets that “could support an improved pricing,” prompting [Rakesh to raise the stock to Buy](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-mu-western-digital-wdc-stocks-analyst-buy-51637675537) and boost his price targets. The new target for Micron is $95, up from $75”

*“Rakesh estimates that first-quarter PC and netbook builds will only decrease between 0% and 5% quarter over quarter, up from previous estimates that they would fall between 10% and 15%. PC demand alone could be up as much as 5% year over year, a shift Rakesh said was surprising given Wall Street consensus that demand would be down between 2% and 3%.”*

*”Requests for memory chips in China also could improve compared to previous estimates, as well as orders from server hosts like Amazon ( AMZN ) and Google (GOOGL). An additional boost could come from upcoming investments in the metaverse and virtual reality.”*

*”Micron may be a new darling among analysts. Last week, Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse added Micron to his list of top stock picks, anticipating a return to earnings growth next year.”*

[**Micron was once again one of the top discussed stocks on Wallstreetbets on Tuesday, being in the fourth position.**](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/21/11/24243247/gamestop-remains-top-wallstreetbets-interest-zoom-video-micron-technology-and-these-are-)

**Wednesday outlook:**

MU is currently declining pre-market. Opening at 85.59, with a high (so far) of $86, and a (current) low of 84.62, where it is at right now as I write this segment (13:22PM GMT/08:22 EST/07:23 CST). There is no negative news, so I expect this is due to the current slide of the semi-segment and general market slightly affecting MU (whereas the past two days it has almost-always remained green despite the current market). However it is only down 0.90%, we will see what happens at open. I will update this segment then. I will also include any news that comes out today.

Update: MU is still remaining strong. As of 10:25AM EST, it has so far peaked at 86.72, after opening at 84.65, the current low being 84.65 also. Volume so far is 6.81(M). Current price (10:27AM EST) is 86.15 representing a  0.85% change. 

*Wednesdays news/articles:*
12:36AM EST: [“Micron Rallies Against The Grain” (Investing.com)](https://www.investing.com/analysis/micron-rallies-against-the-grain-200609364)

Approx 8:40AM EST [:”Micron Technology Stock Is at the Middle of an Upswing, Not the End”](https://investorplace.com/2021/11/mu-stock-is-at-the-middle-of-an-upswing-not-the-end/)

An analysis of the MediaTek Dimensity 9000 news [(Micron LPDDR5X DRAM to Feature in MediaTek Dimensity 9000)](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/micron-lpddr5x-dram-to-feature-in-mediatek-dimensity-9000):

“[Micron is the first semiconductor company to sample and validate this fastest, most advanced mobile memory](https://www.mediatek.com/blog/mediatek-and-micron-validate-lpddr5x-for-dimensity-9000) in the industry and has shipped the first batch of samples of LPDDR5X built on its [first-to-market 1α (1-alpha) node.](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-delivers-industrys-first-1a-dram-technology)”

*‘“This 1α node achievement confirms Micron’s excellence in DRAM and is a direct result of Micron’s relentless commitment to cutting-edge design and technology,” said Scott DeBoer, executive vice president of technology and products at Micron. “With a 40% improvement in memory density over our previous 1z DRAM node, this advancement will create a solid foundation for future product and memory innovation.”’*

*‘“Our new 1α DRAM technology will enable the industry’s lowest-power mobile DRAM as well as bring the benefits of our DRAM portfolio to data center, client, consumer, industrial and automotive customers,” said Sumit Sadana, executive vice president and chief business officer at Micron. “With our industry leadership in both DRAM and NAND technology, Micron is in an excellent position to leverage the growth in memory and storage, which are expected to be the fastest growing segments in the semiconductor industry over the next decade.”’*

It is noteworthy that Samsung was the first to announce LPDDR5X DRAM, however Micron was the first to validate it’s LDPDDR5X module DRAM in partnership with MediaTek. **Micron has already shipped the first batch of this DRAM module.**  This is not surprising as Micron has been making GDDR5X and GDDR6X VRAM for Nvidia GPU’s for many years. 

Micron has also revealed that samples of this new memory module for smartphones supports data rates of up to 8.533 Gbps, making it 30% faster than LPDDR5 modules (it is worth noting these are the highest achievable figures for the standard, and not real world figures). 

**How is LPDDR5X RAM on the MediaTek Dimensity 9000 better than LPDDR5?**

[Relevant chart of the Micron LPDDR5X used by MediaTek](https://imgur.com/yKsnPyo)

This RAM is the newest standard in RAM technology for mobile devices. It aims to improve the data transfer on RAM chips used in mobile devices such as the DImensity 9000 (or other counterparts such as Samsung Exynos and Qualcomm Snapdragon). It is claimed that these Micron DRAM modules (produced with 1-alpha technology) consume the lowest power among mobile DRAMs.

[**When sampled**](https://www.digitaltrends.com/features/lpddr5x-ram-vs-lpddr5-dram-dimensity-9000/) Micron’s LPDDR5X solution achieved data transfer speeds of up to 7500Mbps, however this is behind the transfer rates supported by the new standard (8533Mbps). As Micron emphasized on the 8533 figure, my personal prediction is that it will soon bring out products achieving higher transfer speeds (or that it is maybe saving them for other manufacturers than MediaTek). LPDDR5 (highest rate) achieves 6400Mbps. 

*“Based on these results, MediaTek concluded that LPDDR5X modules lead to 17% faster transfer speeds and 15% lower latency compared to the previous generation.”*

*“MediaTek remarked the new RAM technology will allow increasingly higher levels of data processing, which are needed for the complex and heterogeneous processing units that are built into modern-day chipsets. These higher processing capabilities will be vital for the high-data requirements of the 5G era.”*

**The difference between Micron’s and Samsung’s LPDDR5X solutions can only be compared once the Snapdragon 888 benchmarks are released, or newer chips featuring the most recent RAM technology.**

*Availability of Micron’s new DRAM:*
*“Micron’s Taiwan fabs have begun volume production of 1α node DRAM, starting with DDR4 memory for compute customers and Crucial consumer PC DRAM products. Micron has also begun sampling LPDDR4 to mobile customers for qualification. The company will introduce additional new products based on this technology throughout calendar 2021.”*

**P/E Ratio:**

MU’s current P/E ratio (as of Wednesday 24th November pre-market) is 16.3x. The median P/E ratio for the US is 18x. I’m sourcing from the below linked article for this section. 

*[“Recent times have been advantageous for Micron Technology](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-piece-of-the-puzzle-missing-from-micron-technology-inc.s-nasdaq%3Amu-27-share-price-climb) as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to wane, which has kept the P/E from rising.”*

*“Micron Technology's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver moderate growth, and importantly, perform in line with the market.”*

Last year delivered a 117% gain to the company’s bottom line. The EPS has fallen 57% in total from three years ago. Therefore the recent earnings growth may have been undesirable for the company.

*“Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 35% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 11% each year growth forecast for the broader market.”*

Micron’s P/E is now in line with other companies. You can use P/E to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations. It’s superior earnings outlook is not contributing to P/E as much as expected. When strong earnings outlook is seen with faster-than-market growth, potential risks are what may be placing pressure on the P/E ratio. 

The risk of price drop looks to be subdued, but investors likely thing future earnings could see some volatility. 

**NAND Flash revenue growth for Q3 2021:**

[Recent relevant article released today, I will be sourcing from this for this section.](https://evertiq.com/design/51010)

Hyperscaler and enterprise clients are continuing procurement in line with Q2, this is in order to deploy products based on new processor platforms. 

Major smartphone brands are expected to expand their procurement activities during Q3, as they are preparing to release new flagship models. 

*“As such, clients in both server and smartphone industries made significant contributions to the revenue growth of the NAND Flash industry for 3Q21.”* 

However, suppliers note that orders from PC OEM’s are showing signs of decline. 

“‘On the whole, the industry’s quarterly total NAND Flash bit shipment increased by nearly 11% QoQ for 3Q21, and the overall NAND Flash ASP rose by nearly 4% QoQ for the same quarter. Thanks to rising prices and expanding shipments, the quarterly total NAND Flash revenue increased by 15% QoQ to a new record high of USD 18.8 billion in 3Q21.”*

*“Demand from the data center segment remained strong, and clients continued to adopt Micron’s 176L products. However, Micron’s shipment share in the smartphone market lagged behind that of other NAND Flash suppliers. Furthermore, its PC OEM clients were starting to be affected by the uneven supply of semiconductor chips. In light of these factors, Micron’s NAND Flash bit shipment increased by a modest 4% QoQ. On the other hand, the NAND Flash market remained in a severe shortage in 3Q21, thereby driving up Micron’s ASP by about 5% QoQ. Hence, Micron’s NAND Flash revenue for 3Q21 reached USD 1.97 billion, an 8.8% QoQ increase.”*

[*Sales ranking of Branded NAND Flash makers, Q3 2021 (in million USD)*](https://imgur.com/sbJyTmY)

**NAND Flash revenue growth for Q4 2021:**

The impact of the component supply shortage has increased across numerous segments of the NAND flash market, as the capacity issues in the foundry market remains unresolved. 
Currently, NAND Flash components are in higher available supply compared to other kinds of key components. 

*“For OEMs and ODMs, the differences between the NAND Flash inventory level and the inventory levels of other components have been growing over the past several months. Therefore, they have to scale back orders and reduce stock for NAND Flash. As inventory adjustments are happening, NAND Flash contract prices will start to drop and thus bring about an end to the several quarters of strong revenue growth enjoyed by suppliers.”*

I would note that this is actually possibly negative news for MU, but will only affect Q4 and perhaps after that. NAND is only a segment of Micron’s business though. 

**Micron’s CEO, an analysis of his performance**

[“Memory chip demand has been exploding since Sanjay Mehrotra was recruited as Micron CEO in 2017.”](https://investorplace.com/2021/11/mu-stock-is-at-the-middle-of-an-upswing-not-the-end/)

Mehrotra previously founded SanDisk. He became available after Western Digital acquired SanDisk in 2016.

[After Mehrotra joined Micron as CEO, strong performance was seen in 2017 and 2018.](https://investorplace.com/2018/05/micron-technology-inc-booming-despite-low-stock-price/). Micron’s sales rose from $12 billion in 2016 to $20 billion in 2017 (fueled by data centres and smartphones). In 2017/2018, Mehrota astutely aimed production at solid state drives and graphics. One reason for this was to target the cloud boom, and their upgrade cycle to meet demands for AI applications (making memory important, and thereby putting Micron in a good position). He also aimed to balance between supply and demand that year, rather than the bear market that was indicated by current stock price. In 2017/2018, while expanding investment, Micron built up a cash reserve. It has $8 billion in cash (as of May 2018), and short term investments as of the most recent quarter at that time. Long term debt fell to $7.8 billion nd could be paid out of cash on hand. It’s price to earnings ratio was 10 (as of May 2018), which would mean a 25% bump in stock price. 

*In March 2020* [Micron surprised ‘analysts by earning $405 million, 36 cents per share, on revenue of $4.8 billion for the quarter ending in February.’](https://investorplace.com/2020/03/micron-mu-stock-offers-hope-in-turbulent-market/) Certainly strong performance despite being at the start of the pandemic.

*”The results sent MU stock up over 5% on March 26, although shares are down over 3% in mid-morning trading March 27.”*

“Shares rose sharply thanks to a [conservative outlook from CEO Sanjay Mehrotra](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/micron-earnings-conservative-outlook-seen-as-prudent-but-rest-of-year-remains-a-big-question-2020-03-23), who has seen many booms and busts in his 30 years as a memory company executive.”

*“Last week, Micron Chief Executive Sanjay Mehrotra said in a letter that the company took early precautions in January to limit the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in its facilities in China and the rest of Asia and expanded those protections as the virus spread world-wide.”*

*“We have also carefully managed raw materials and our supply chain to maintain our manufacturing capabilities and production,” Mehrotra said. “Our global team has shown tremendous strength and solidarity, operating with excellence despite lockdowns and quarantines that challenged staffing, shipments and work schedules.”*

Because memory chips are commodity products, MU stock is prone to sharp rises and falls. Until recently (as of March 2020) it was said to be riding a “supercycle,” with chip-based memory replacing spinning disks in devices, PCs and the cloud.’

*Analysis as of today 24th of November 2021:*
Memory has been going through a ‘super-cycle’ for years now, this is due to SSD’s/flash memory replacing standard HDD’s in consumer devices and more recently in data centres. SSD’s/flash memory are faster and more reliable. As the price has been coming down for SSD’s/flash memory, the switch to these has accelerated. 

Analysts may warn that this ‘super-cycle’ is peaking, however it is just [cooling down](https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202107140009). And as outlined in my previous DD, in 2023, 2024 and the future. We can actually expect memory demand to exponentially increase. 

[Chart showing price projections of various DRAM product categories for Q3](https://imgur.com/bPkMum5)

The current supercycle is expected to run [until 2023 (“The super cycle in global memory chips, where price strengthening is coupled with demand overwhelming supply, is expected to last until 2023”)](https://m.pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2021&no=489942), and could go well beyond that with new demand from [the Machine Internet](https://cplaneai.com/the-machine-internet-age/). As well as cloud-computing. 

Mehrotra sees it continuing. As outlined in my previous DD, he has set a capital budget of [$150 billion for the next decade.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/micron-plans-over-150-billion-in-capital-r-d-spending-in-decade-ahead-11634724001). Please see my last DD or the link for more info on this budget.

**TL;DR:**

* Fridays performance was strong due to Evercore ISI Analyst upgrades, as well as a Citi upgrade.

* Mondays performance was due to the Evercore ISI and Citi analyst upgrades, as well as other factors including; CNBC article, LPDDR5X DRAM announcement, and other articles released/general hype. It was one of the top discussed stocks on WSB.

* Tuesdays performance was due to Mizuho analyst upgrade. It was also one of the top discussed stocks on WSB.

* Micron’s LPDDR5X solution achieved data transfer speeds of up to 7500Mbps, however this is behind the transfer rates supported by the new standard (8533Mbps). As Micron emphasized on the 8533 figure, my personal prediction is that it will soon bring out products achieving higher transfer speed.

Please see my last DD or the link for more info on this budget. 

**TL;DR of the TL;DR:**
Analyst upgrades, hype and new RAM technology have contributed to the price rise this week. NAND flash shipments are rising Q3. There is a supply shortage across the market. The memory supercycle is expected to continue until 2023 and perhaps beyond. The CEO of Micron is delivering high performance, expects this to continue and has set a capital budget of $150 billion for the next decade."

Most of you apes know Qualcomm as a company that supplies chips for smartphones, but in the latest Earnings call and investors Day, Qualcomm has shown the results of its diversification plans. With roughly **40%** of the QCT **earnings being from non-handset domain.** This has clearly pleased the wall street and the stock jumped more than 40% over the last few weeks!

The main reason why I am supper bullish on Qualcomm is that they mentioned with all their diversification plans coming into fruition their total addressable market has jumped from **100B to 700B!** That is insane for company of this size.

# A brief overview of Qualcomm’s New & Existing Markets

**The Metaverse:** 

https://preview.redd.it/g0klgm7und181.png?width=2195&format=png&auto=webp&s=9079349fa0732c10fcbd45a33ead96f768932138

Qualcomm has been in the metaverse game before it was hip. More than **10M** Meta Oculus have been shipped containing the SnapDragon XR2 chips. They already have a strong presence in this area, and it’s likely to be more popular. They have acquired multiple AR related companies over the last decade and have a well-established Snapdragon Spaces Developer platform. The CEO is expecting demand for these devices to be just as big as phone market which means another market space for Qualcomm to dominate in.

**The PC market:**

Let’s be honest, Qualcomm’s current presence is the PC space is almost negligible. But Last year Qualcomm did a very interesting acquisition of **Nuvia for 1.4B** dollars. Nuvia was a startup focused on developing ARM based high performing CPUs which was **founded by chief architect of Apple SOC**, responsible for CPUs like iphone A14 Bionic chips and also the M1 & M1 pro Macbook chips! Qualcomm already has the best modem expertise in the world, and teaming up theoretically with the best CPU team is definitely gonna take a good bite out of the PC chip market share soon. Qualcomm is planning to launch its first CPU by late 2022. 

**Automotive tech:**

Qualcomm is serious about being the technology provider for most of the auto industry. It recently acquired the ADAS (advanced driver assistance system) unit of Veoneer for **4.5B** dollars. GM and BMW are one of the first companies that has agreed to power their digital cockpit with Qualcomm tech. Revenues from auto sector have already doubled since last year with **13B design wins in the pipeline** over the next few years. 

**5G Dominance:**

https://preview.redd.it/8t3u5khznd181.png?width=1890&format=png&auto=webp&s=70f171e5d260f2b7f00d477f8f11d62f3eb81dc7

Qualcomm has decades of expertise in Communication technology, which is significantly more than any other companies. With the transition from 4G to 5G just starting, Qualcomm is set to continue dominance in the smartphone world. The big concern that investors had with Qualcomm was with Apple planning to make its own modem chips in the next few years. But QCOM is projecting that the revenues from Apple will be less than 5% within a couple of years. **Even though Apple and Samsung are making in-house chips, they cannot escape the royalties that they have to pay to Qualcomm for using their 5G patents.** So virtually every smartphone is using Qualcomm tech directly or indirectly!

**IoT Projection looks Insane and currently on track:**

https://preview.redd.it/1rxoh0l0od181.png?width=2637&format=png&auto=webp&s=80b766d721b0252482385b544cd787a7abfd4ffc

TLDR: Qualcomm is a severely undervalued at the moment, especially if you compare to Nvidia, which has less earnings than Qualcomm and still roughly 4X the market cap of $QCOM. With all the diversification plans showing results every quarter, $QCOM It is ready to launch into stratosphere. I believe Qualcomm has the potential to be one of the best tech stock over the next few years.

My Position: 250 shares and few 185c jan calls for some tendies. 

Not a Financial advice. Do your own research.

So I’ve taken my daily Adderall, caffeine, and nicotine; I’m in a DD mood. I was requested by a few users to write an $MU (Micron Technology) DD. 

**Company profile:**

*“The world is moving to a new economic model, where data is driving value creation in ways we had not imagined just a few years ago. Data is today’s new business currency, and memory and storage are strategic differentiators which will redefine how we extract value from data to expand the global economy and transform our society.*

*As the leader in innovative memory solutions, Micron is helping the world make sense of data by delivering technology that is transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all. Through our global brands — Micron and Crucial — we offer the industry’s broadest portfolio. We are the only company manufacturing today’s major memory and storage technologies: DRAM, NAND, and NOR technology.*

**Introduction:**

[MU 1D chart](https://imgur.com/ZVG0IKv)

**Don't sell MU now, it outperformed most of it's peers**
*”MICRON TECHNOLOGY INC was among the best performers on Friday. It returned +7.8% to close at 83.03. On a day when the overall market breadth was 44%, it closed higher than 68% of the market. In comparison, the benchmark SP500 index closed today at -0.0014%.”*

**This is going to be a DD focused on the value of the products (Micron and Crucial memory, data center presence, and consumer use), as well as the value of the company. MU is definitely a long term play, though there is a lot of short term interest at the moment that may cause a run.**

**It is worth noting that MU is a cyclical stock, dependant upon memory demand, hence why I have focused on future memory demand in my DD.**

Latest news: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/22/micron-stock-has-best-day-in-18-months-traders-see-bigger-breakout.html

Micron climbed a lot on Friday. This was due to an analyst at Evercore ISI adding the memory chip maker to his list of top stock picks. [He anticipates a return to earnings growth next year.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-stock-price-earnings-chip-shortage-51632864045?mod=article_inline).

MU was up 8.4% to $83.52 during Friday afternoon trading. It was the second best performer of the day for the S&P 500 (shortly before 3PM). Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse noted that though shares of memory chip makers such as Micron have lagged behind the [PHLX Semiconductor index since early June](https://www.barrons.com/quote/index/us/xnas/sox?mod=article_inline), he believes tides are shifting.

*“We believe negative sentiment was due to investor concerns over the sustainability of PC, handsets, and cloud demand, which was also compounded by DRAM spot pricing that began to flatten out in May/June 2021,” wrote Muse.*

Muse noted that WSt expectations for Micron’s Feb/May quarter earnings have been cut by 33%/31% respectively, since August. While there could be further downside, weakness is now priced in. He believes either Feb or May quarter will be a bottom for Micron’s earnings. Micron shares tend to outperform one or two quarters before a bottom in earnings, hence he believes the stock could begin a run soon.

*“And once they do—we think the stock action could be fast,” Muse wrote. “We also note most investors expected the memory trade to begin to work in 1Q22 based on our investor survey last month and would not be surprised to start seeing investors look to get positioned in the name ahead of January 1st, 2022.”*
*Other reasons for the climb:*
* Citi analyst Christopher Danely said in a research note that recent channel checks show there has been increased demand for DRAM memory among PC makers, and that a pricing correction in the DRAM market is “drawing to a close”.
* Danely also said the outlook for enterprise server sales in Q1 22 is better than expected. The server market is improving “due to recent increases in spending from cloud companies such as Meta and Google”. Danely maintained his buy rating and a $120/share price target.
* Earlier this week hedge fund Appaloosa Management said it recently sold off almost 3 million shares of MU, to leave the fund with 2.75 million shares.

**Higher future DRAM demand and how this affects Micron:**

Micron is a market leader in DRAM and NAND memory, with a market share of 20%/11% respectively. In 2021, DRAM revenues accounted for 72% of MU’s total revenues, and grew by 38% YoY.  [The company is improving its 1-alpha DRAM](https://www.micron.com/1alpha-dram-technology) to compete with Samsung/SK Hynix.
The DRAM market is expected to grow over the long term, due to rising DRAM use in smartphones, PC’s, consumer electronics, automotive and industrials. 

*Smartphones:* 
[Since 2016 the average DRAM capacity has risen from 2.4GB to 4.75GB (average of iOS and Android).](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/smartphones-dram-trends-2019-2020/) Micron has stated that 5G phones feature 50% more DRAM than 4G phones. It also expects that 5G and AI will drive new applications such as optimised video capture and editing, which will further fuel DRAM requirements. Phones are very much powerful PC’s living in our pockets now, and as software advances we can expect that DRAM requirements will increase. For example, think about how old iPhones struggle to run new versions of iOS, partially due to insufficient DRAM in older models.

[""Micron LPDDR5X DRAM to Feature in MediaTek Dimensity 9000""](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/micron-lpddr5x-dram-to-feature-in-mediatek-dimensity-9000)

*Data Center:*
DRAM is integral in servers, notably in data centre applications, it is rapidly evolving to support growing workloads for AI, big data and machine learning. Micron is working on DDR5 to support data center transitions to DDR5 platforms this year.
Data creation is projected to grow at a rate of around 23% in the next 5 years. This would require larger cloud infrastructure in order to handle this. Data centres are generally backed up by an SSD storage array, Micron remains committed to this through it’s NVMe SSD portfolio, and is introducing PCIe 4.0 data centre SSDs. As demand for cloud storage rises, Micron could see increased demand for these products. 

*PC/Gaming:*
Faster RAM leads to faster processing speeds. Intensive use of PCs such as gaming, video editing and streaming require better and more efficient RAM.
From Statista, the chart below shows increasing PC DRAM memory density, with the share of memory >[4GB increasing to 82% in 2020](https://imgur.com/w9w0xPq) 
(https://www.statista.com/statistics/781438/worldwide-computer-dram-shipment-market-share-by-density/)

*Automotive DRAM:*
Automotive DRAM only accounts for 1.8% of the DRAM market currently. However, advances in automotive tech such as autonomous driving and vehicle connectivity will drive an increase in this. The Tesla Model 3 has 14GB of DRAM, and next-generation models will use GDDR5 and are expected to have a minimum of 20GB. Although, the average vehicle is estimated to have only 4GB of DRAM in 2021. I expect newer/next-gen vehicles will continue to use even more computing power/DRAM, therefore increasing the market share of Automotive DRAM. Note that Micron are specialists in GDDR5 and 6 memory. Auto NAND accounts for 7% of the NAND market, [it is also expected to see rapid growth due to the rise of ADAS](https://www.eetasia.com/another-nand-flash-for-automotive-ota-ai-and-more/) and clusters of vehicle instruments added to infotainment (requiring greater storage capabilities).

*Industrials & Consumer Electronics:*
DRAM is used in systems/equipment in manufacturing processes. Industrial type DRAM is more focused on providing a stable solution for reliability. Automation and IoT (Internet of Things) is likely to increase demand for memory/increased memory. In consumer electronics, DRAM is used in tablets, wearables, games consoles, etc. This is the least significant growth factor but still important to note. 
Another important note is that the PS5 and Xbox use Micron GDDR6 RAM. Samsung and Micron both started producing GDDR6 RAM 3 years ago, while SK Hynix is still ramping up production. The PS5 actually uses Micron RAM (16GB GDDR6 SDRAM), while 512MB of SK Hynix DDR4 RAM is used for background tasks. THe Xbox Series X also uses 16GB of Micron GDDR6 SGRAM. 

**My Nvidia thesis:**

**I worked as a qualified IT Hardware, Networking and Software Engineer for 5 or 6 years, and am now an Engineering student at college. I’m a computer geek, especially for hardware. So I’m going to enjoy writing this part. I hope my knowledge lends to it.**


Although you won’t find much correlation in the [charts](https://imgur.com/o3EaSAV), apart from the recent semi-boom. Nvidia and Micron are very strongly linked. 


*Increasing penetration of GPU’s in data centres*


Recently, data centres have developed into the fields of AI and Machine Learning for functions where a solution is required via rapid iterations. This works well with GPU’s. GPU’s lend themselves perfectly towards [Machine Learning (ML-OLD) functions in data centres](https://www.eetimes.com/ai-chip-menu-expands-for-data-centers/).

Now remember that GPU’s are highly memory intensive. 
This is corroborated from the data specs of Nvidia’s newest chip, the A100 GPU just released, [designed for AI in data centers](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258419/nvidia-ampere-gpu-ai-data-centers-specs-a100-dgx-supercomputer).
[You can also read more here.](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/ampere-architecture/)

“The first GPU to use Ampere will be Nvidia’s new (as of 2020) A100, built for scientific computing, cloud graphics, and data analytics. Nvidia new A100 GPU will also include 19.5 teraflops of performance, 6,912 CUDA cores, *40GB of memory*, and *1.6TB/s of memory bandwidth.”* *There’s also a version using 80GB!*

“*Smarter and Faster Memory*
A100 brings massive amounts of compute to data centers. To keep those compute engines fully utilized, it has a class-leading 2 terabytes per second (TB/sec) of memory bandwidth, more than double the previous generation. In addition, A100 has significantly more on-chip memory, including a 40 megabyte (MB) level 2 cache—7X larger than the previous generation—to maximize compute performance.*”

I cannot find any sources (after half an hour of searching) that specify the exact manufacturer of the A100’s memory. However based on my experience, Nvidia consumer GPU’s use either Micron, Samsung or SK Hynix memory. Micron *does* manufacture the [HBM2E memory used in the A100](https://www.micron.com/products/ultra-bandwidth-solutions/hbm2e#:~:text=HBM2E%20%7C%20Micron%20Technologies%2C%20Inc), hence I suspect Micron is one of their memory vendors for their data centre GPU’s. 

I found that the Nvidia DGXA100 system (the world’s first AI system built on the A100 Tensor Core GPU, using 8 A100 GPU’s with up to 640GB of GPU memory), actually happens to use [Micron NVME drives](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/pdf/dgxa100-service-manual.pdf). See below:

*GDDR6X and GDDR5X memory in Nvidia high-end graphic cards:*
The GTX1080, 1080Ti, and Pascal Nvidia TitanX all used GDDR5X memory.
The RTX 3080 and 3090 GPUs use GDDR6X memory.
Who is the world's only manufacturer of GDDR5X and GDDR6X memory? Micron. 
*“Micron has created the world’s fastest discrete graphics memory solution, GDDR6X. GDDR6X was launched with NVIDIA on the GeForce® RTX™ 3090 and GeForce® RTX™ 3080 GPUs (including Ti) to take graphics beyond gaming into true AI. Watch to learn how Micron was able to achieve incredible speeds up to 1 TB/s system memory bandwidth.“*

[Read more here.](https://www.micron.com/products/ultra-bandwidth-solutions/gddr6x)

[Comparison between GDDR5X, GDDR6 and GDDR6X](https://imgur.com/fl8FY68)

This means Nvidia is dependant on Micron to deliver/manufacture their higher end GPU’s (as Micron are the only manufacturer of GDDR6X memory). Furthermore, Micron GDDR6 memory is commonly found in RTX3050, 3060, 3070 (including Ti) GPU’s. They are not the only manufacturer for this, but are frequently used, for example my RTX 3060 laptop has Micron memory, and my RTX 2070 Super has Micron memory. I use them for crapto mining, and the memory overclocks well. 

**Overall I would conclude as long as Nvidia remains strong/bullish, you can be bullish on Micron as Nvidia are dependent on them for their products, particularly in the high-end.**


**The AMD link:**

Although not as dependent on Micron as Nvidia. AMD [are using Micron GDDR6 memory in their RX6000 series graphics cards:](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-delivers-high-performance-gddr6-memory-amd-radeon-rx-6000)

“Micron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU), today (November 1st) announced that its high-performance 16Gb/16Gbps GDDR6 memory solution is now available with AMD Radeon™ RX 6000 Series graphics cards built on the AMD RDNA™ 2 gaming architecture. Using Micron’s advanced 1z process technology, this latest version of GDDR6 enables up to 512GB/s system performance for demanding applications like gaming and graphics. Today’s announcement continues Micron’s rich history of innovation and collaboration with industry leaders to deliver breakthrough performance that enables the most advanced gaming solutions.

“Radeon RX 6000 Series graphics cards were built to deliver high-performance, no-compromises gaming experiences, and the addition of Micron memory to the product line will help us meet that objective,” said Scott Herkelman, corporate vice president and general manager of the Graphics Business Unit at AMD. “Micron has a strong history of developing advanced memory products, and we worked closely with their engineering team to optimize GDDR6 for RDNA 2 architecture-based graphics cards, giving our board partners more choice and flexibility to produce additional designs for gamers.”

**Is Micron a buy right now?:**

For the past half year, Micron shares have been trending downwards, however this has changed in November. The shares trended downwards due to a difficult pricing environment for its PC memory products, and macro developments have had their part to play in the downtrend (‘mostly the supply chain issues behind a lack of non-memory components which has led to some customers cutting back on memory and storage purchases’).

Micron has recently stated that over the next 10 years, it intends on spending $150 billion (combined) on Global Manufacturing and R&D. Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill believes this plan has brought questions of “potential over-capacity issues and whether a plan like this would be a large drag on free cash flow.”

Micron believes that “secular growth drivers” such as 5G and AI use cases should see increasing demand for DRAM and NAND. **I covered this in the ‘Higher future DRAM demand and how this affects Micron’ section of my DD. Thus I think Micron is justified in this belief and spending plan.** Gill thinks it’s a good move, and worries are overblown.

*‘“The current spending plan,” said the 5-star analyst, “When annualized and put into context, is nothing out of the ordinary and should neither cause significant increases in industry capacity (so there should be no resulting price wars from the competition) nor be a significant drag on free cash flow, which would continue to grow and reach historical highs as a % of sales.”’*

Gill agrees with Micron, in that continued demand for DRAM and NAND based on 5G/AI drivers is important to focus on.

“In fact, Gill thinks the company will have enough free cash flow to provide it with a “high level of capital return flexibility,” which during cyclical sell-off periods, for example, could see the company repurchase shares. Additionally, should the need arise for “competitive reasons,” it will also provide a “safety buffer” for more R&D or CapEx spending.”

Gill reiterated a Buy rating for MU stock with a $130 price target. 14 other analysts join Gil on the bull list, with another 6 holds and 1 sell, the stock has a moderate buy consensus rating (as of Oct 27 2021, I’ll add more recent figures in the following section). 

[“The 47 rating InvestorsObserver gives to Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) stock puts it near the middle of the Semiconductors industry. In addition to scoring higher than 38 percent of stocks in the Semiconductors industry, MU’s 47 overall rating means the stock scores better than 47 percent of all stocks.”](https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/stock-update/does-micron-technology-inc-mu-have-what-it-takes-to-be-in-your-portfolio-friday)

**Has Micron Run Its Cyclical Course?:**

I will be heavily sourcing from [this great and recent Nasdaq article](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/has-micron-run-its-cyclical-course) for this section.

‘On the face of it, year-to-date, Micron’s stock price is almost at the same level. However, its stock has been on a 2021 roller-coaster ride. It opened 2021 at $77.42, and hit $95.3 in the first week of April. Since then, the stock steadily fell until it hit $67-levels in October. It spent time consolidating in October before starting to rise again.’

This fall is due to Micron’s cyclical nature of business. The stock moves based on the demand/supply for memory. ‘When the world needed semiconductors, the stock moved up. Now, as the world is slowly opening up, there was a fall in its stock price. However, Micron stock seems to have bottomed out.’

The company has beaten earnings expectations in the last four quarters (each of), the company has delivered profits and has not disappointed investors. 

‘Micron Technology president and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said that the demand outlook for 2022 was strong, and Micron would continue to deliver innovative solutions. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the company’s guidance is $7.65 billion in revenue, with a gross margin of 46%.’

A June report by Global Market Insights states that semiconductor memory market revenue will cross $180 billion by 2027. It said, “The growing uptake of Dynamic Random-access Memory (DRAM) in gaming consoles, PC hardware, and high-performance computing devices will support the industry growth.”

Micron has stated that memory and storage are a growing portion of this industry, representing approximately 30% of the semi market. The company also stated that government support would be crucial for its expansion plans, as memory manufacturing in the US costs around 35%-45% more compared to lower cost markets. ‘Funding to support new semiconductor manufacturing capacity is a must, said EVP of Global Operations Manish Bhatia. He added, “Sustained government support is essential for Micron to ensure a resilient supply chain and reinforce technology leadership for the long term.”’

‘The top three companies in the sector invest billions of dollars every year to manufacture chips. These chips are increasingly getting more complicated and expensive with every passing generation. It is very unlikely that price wars will break out over market share. The game will be played on quality.’ **Refer to my section about GDDR6X memory, Micron is delivering TOP quality.**

Investors (regards) will have to accept that the company stock price is generally going to be volatile, due to its cyclical nature. However you can take comfort in the fact that the lows/highs for the stock will generally move up. ‘The company has realized this and has purchased 15.6 million shares of its common stock for $1.2 billion during the fiscal year of 2021.’
[Here is a useful article explaining the volatility of MU this past month.](https://investchronicle.com/2021/11/16/here-is-why-micron-technology-inc-mu-stock-volatility-recorded-over-the-last-month-was-2-30/)

‘Tipranks’ Stock Forecast Tool indicates 15 out of 22 analysts have given MU a Buy rating, while six analysts have a Hold rating on the stock and just one has a Sell rating on the stock.

The average Micron price target is $96.09, which indicates 24.2% upside potential.’
‘A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Barclays decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $110.00 to $87.00 and set an ""overweight"" rating for the company in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. JPMorgan Chase & Co. decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $140.00 to $100.00 and set an ""overweight"" rating for the company in a report on Friday, September 24th. UBS Group decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $95.00 to $90.00 and set a ""buy"" rating for the company in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. Morgan Stanley restated a ""hold"" rating and set a $75.00 target price on shares of Micron Technology in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. Finally, The Goldman Sachs Group decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $104.00 to $88.00 and set a ""buy"" rating for the company in a report on Thursday, October 14th. One equities research analyst has rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have assigned a hold rating, twenty-three have assigned a buy rating and two have assigned a strong buy rating to the company's stock. Based on data from MarketBeat.com, the stock has an average rating of ""Buy"" and an average target price of $103.31.’

**Upcoming Quarterly Sales/Next Earnings:**

[Analysts expect that Micron will report $7.66 billion in sales for the current quarter](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-mu-consensus-analyst-rating-2021-11-2-3/), according to Zacks Investment Research. The highest sales estimate of 6 is $7.67 billion, and the lowest is $7.65 billion. Micron posted sales of $5.77 billion during the same quarter last year, indicating YoY growth of 32.8%. Next earnings date is Monday, December 20th. 
On average, analysts expect full-year sales of $31.34 billion (for the current financial year). For the next fiscal year, analysts forecast reported sales of $35.60 billion on average. 
Micron last issued its earnings results on Monday, September 27th. “ The semiconductor manufacturer reported $2.42 earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, topping the Thomson Reuters' consensus estimate of $2.33 by $0.09. The business had revenue of $8.27 billion during the quarter, compared to analyst estimates of $8.21 billion. Micron Technology had a return on equity of 15.98% and a net margin of 21.16%. Micron Technology's revenue for the quarter was up 36.6% on a year-over-year basis. During the same quarter in the prior year, the firm earned $1.00 earnings per share.”

“very nice rally after a downtrend breakout here on MU ! today we are approaching a big resistance zones on the RSI and chart.

We can break resistance and continue a rally to all time high next week, but I think we will most likely see a few more weeks of consolidation first so the RSI can cool off.
“

**[MU Long setup](https://imgur.com/ShnyQn8) - Nov 18:**
“MU after correction, going for final push for W-1 of W-5”

**[MU TRADE IDEA](https://imgur.com/z3mjHUK) - Nov 16:**
“Upside looks limited from here. Expecting us to pullback into a corrective wave 2 into a very buyable dip around $70. Be patient on this one, it's only getting started” My gut says this guy is incorrect tbh, given the recent push. 


**[After 200 days we can see a breakout](https://imgur.com/Vmhx9Al) - Nov 12, very in-depth:**
“Today we will take a look at Micron Technology , a company that engages in the provision of innovative memory and storage solutions. Time to check the Technical elements on the chart:

1) From 2018 until November 2020 the price was inside a massive range until we saw the breakout of it and a 50% bullish movement from that situation towards the top of the bullish impulse

2) From April until today the price has been consolidating on a clear corrective pattern where we can define both top and bottom edges

3) How can we know that the structure is finished? Two reasons here: first we have clear edges (previous item) and second the structure has made contact with a key level, in this case, the ascending trendline.

4) Now we have a breakout of the corrective pattern. Remember that Technical Analysis is a statistical discipline, which means that we are never gonna have certainty about a situation. However, we know that if we engage in quality situations over certain periods, we will be able to observe consistent results.

5) We are not taking setup on this stock, (we already have exposure on other assets). However, it's an interesting situation to wait for a throwback (retest of a broken structure). IF that happens, we have defined an activation level as you can see on the chart (ALWAYS ABOVE THE TRENDLINE)

6) Depending on how aggressive is the setup you are taking, the invalidation level can be: FIRST below the whole structure 65.00 / SECOND below the throwback (this setup provides a massive risk to reward ratio, however, is prone to a quick stop loss)

7) Targets: IF I would be executing a setup here, I would protect my setup once the price reaches the previous top, which shares a major resistance zone that you can see on the weekly chart (2% below that, I want to be risk-free) / Now, the places to close setups on profit can be the first or 2nd Fibonacci extension . The expected duration of a movement like this may be between 200 to 300 days.

8)RISK: This is the formula I use to trade: I never have more than 5 setups at the same time NEVER EVER. And the maximum % of risk I take on any setup is 3% (ONLY with a STRATEGY THAT YOU HAVE a lot of EXPERIENCE WITH). Let's understand this better, most of my setups happen on the daily chart , which means that time resolutions are between 2 weeks to 3 months. Another rule I use is that my setups must happen on uncorrelated assets example: NFLX / BTCUSD / XAUUSD / FCX / AMZN . So my worst-case scenario is losing all at the same time which means a -10% to -15%. That's more than acceptable for me. And the most probable thing is that I would be able to open 4 to 5 new setups 1 to 2 months later. That's why this type of trading style is so secure. Even in apocalyptic scenarios, you would face a manageable loss, and it will take you time to develop new setups (you avoid impulsive trading)”

**’I’m a regard that wants to YOLO options, what do I do?:**

*Disclaimer: I have a good history with options, but I only trade (for the most part) 1 month, or 6 month options, or 1 year or 2 year LEAPS. I would advise to go for LEAPS and shares for this stock - either ITM or slightly OTM. If it becomes ITM, you can always roll to a higher strike if you wish.*

*High-risk:*
Be regarded and YOLO to play earnings on December 20th. I would suggest either buying ITM 80c or slightly OTM 85c for December 23 or December 31st. 90c if you like crayons. 

* [December 2021 options chain](https://imgur.com/QD3ROzy)

*Medium risk:*
Buy 80c, 82.5c, 85c for April, June, July or September. Or if you’re regarded 87.50 and 90c.Play on the thesis that MU has a lot of value, will do well in December earnings (maybe), has great products, and that the downtrend is beginning to turn into an uptrend as I believe. I would suggest buying shares also.

*Low(ish...they’re still options) risk:*
Buy 80c or 82.50c for Jan 2023, June 2023 or Jan 2024. Medium/low risk is 85c. Medium/low risk but still regarded is 90c.  Even better would be to buy warrant options.

* [January 2024 options chain](https://imgur.com/GSTkEPb)

Medium/low risk:
Buy 80c or 82.5c for 2022 and LEAPS for 2023/2024. Maybe warrants, if that is possible for you. Also buy shares. 

*My position:*
I'm a Europoor with a small account. I got up to $8000 from $1500 (largely AMD and NVDA gains) this year but I had to spend it on life shit. So I've started agan from $336, up to $551 now from NVDA and FB calls, as well as some daytrading.

$134.33 of 12.21 86c warrant calls
$69 of 03.22 90c warrant calls
$69 of 06.22 96c warrant calls
As of 14:47
(account value has increased to $620)
edit: Bought $40 more of 06.22 at 15:07, other positions have increased in value.

Yes I'm regarded.


I hope my small position assures you this is not a P&D (I hate them), I simply love writing DDs and am trying improve my skill at them (and share my in-depth research).



**Where should I enter? (options or shares):**

Look out for a mini-dip on Monday or sometime next week. Enter there. Consider using DCA to get a better average cost over multiple dips.

**Conclusion:**

I think this DD speaks for itself. Micron has great drivers/catalysts to drive the price upwards. It is investing heavily in itself. Nvidia is dependent on them. I am very bullish on MU after doing this research. I will try to open a position of LEAPS and shares as soon as I have the funds. 

**TL;DR:**

* MU bounced on Friday, perhaps this is the sign that its downtrend is reversing.

* Higher future DRAM demand will push up Micron. DRAM is used in Smartphones, Data centres, PC/Gaming, Automotive, Industrials and Consumer Electronics. Increased demand in these sectors will drive up Micron’s value. 

* Nvidia uses Micron memory in it’s data centre GPU’s.

* Nvidia’s ONLY supplier of GDDR6X memory used in higher-end gaming GPU’s is Micron. Nvidia is dependent on them for this high-performance memory.

* AMD are using Micron GDDR6(not X) memory in their RX 6000 series GPU’s.

* Micron’s downtrend has changed in November. 

* Micron intends to spend $150 billion combined on Global Manufacturing and R&D.

* $130 price target from Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill.

* Micron moves based on the supply/demand for memory.

* Micron may have bottomed out now, and is due to go up.

* ‘Tipranks’ Stock Forecast Tool indicates 15 out of 22 analysts have given MU a Buy rating, while six analysts have a Hold rating on the stock and just one has a Sell rating on the stock.
The average Micron price target is $96.09, which indicates 24.2% upside potential.

* [Analysts expect that Micron will report $7.66 billion in sales for the current quarter](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-mu-consensus-analyst-rating-2021-11-2-3/), according to Zacks Investment Research. The highest sales estimate of 6 is $7.67 billion, and the lowest is $7.65 billion. Micron posted sales of $5.77 billion during the same quarter last year, indicating YoY growth of 32.8%. Next earnings date is Monday, December 20th. 

* On average, analysts expect full-year sales of $31.34 billion (for the current financial year). For the next fiscal year, analysts forecast reported sales of $35.60 billion on average.

[Hedge funds have bought another 1&#37; of all shares in the past quarter. Insiders have sold about 1.4&#37; of shares. Probably usual churn. Possibly some insider knowledge ](https://preview.redd.it/kq0b46tmfk081.png?width=493&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d5a038d604077750e1a91dcaad9c1318ef3be01)

**Weather:**

The province is going into its rainy season. Historically it rains/snows the most going into the winter months which could slow repairs. Daylight hours are decreasing as we head into winter solstice. The flood water will also take time to drain away, I have no idea how long this takes. If freezing temperatures happen things could be royally messed up if the floodwater freezes in place.

**The trigger of a recession or bubble pop:**

This is all happening right before the Christmas season. **Vancouver is currently low on supplies and buying restrictions are starting to pop up in Edmonton where I live**. This flood has taken out the 2nd largest port on the west coast responsible for $40 billion worth of goods annually (3.3 billion a month). Also, the Vancouver port is the fastest major port in terms of shipping from Asia to the East coast of the US. This port is responsible for shipping your products like AMD or NVIDIA. Nvidia grew by 0.6 billion last quarter what if part of that 0.6 billion in growth is tied up in Vancouver right now or your other favorite company?. If there is a cascade of supply shortages there will likely be another panic like the toilet paper shortage but potentially much worse because everything will be out of stock.

**Stock estimate:**

When covid hit the stock tanked to around $68 but this would probably hit easier than covid. Covid took down revenue for 2 quarters in 2020. This will last 1 quarter probably. A slight difference is that the pandemic did not cause infrastructure damage. The floods have caused major damage that needs damage assessed, repairs to be deployed, repair inspections, and approvals on top of any covid protocols, weather delays, supply shortages, and personnel or equipment logistics. If this DD gets popular a drop may happen fairly soon. If this remains fringe knowledge then the drop will probably happen after Q4 earnings on Jan 25, 2022, so keep that in mind.

I am more bearish on the rail companies over trucking or ship companies, I imagine they can find an alternative route. Even if supplies lines are completely taken over by trucks. This is money not going into CN or CP.

I predict large stock gains and new ATHs before a plunge just like the pandemic. Everyone is partying it up right now.

**CN vs CP**

CN and CP operate separate routes. CN can probably handle this better since they have access to 9 ports including Vancouver. While CP only has access to 4 ports. Even if they got ships to unload at their other ports they are all effectively on the Eastern side adding at least 7 days of delay for CN and 11 days for CP.

**Risks**:

It could all be a false alarm 🤷🤷🤷 but are multi week long delays good for the economy? Everyone wants gains to make up for covid losses or feel covid happened close enough for a recession. Analyst hype could keep this stock propped for a while. Many articles end in “CN is a great buy or hold”. The CEO of CN is doing great damage control stating saying that Prince Rupert is still running to keep investors calm but it is only 2.5% of Vancouver's capacity!

**Bear articles:**

I've also done analysis for other stocks as well. Feel free to check out my profile for them! For those that don’t know, Nvidia is a company based in the United States that designs graphics, processing units, and chip units. They reported earnings for Q3 on 11/17. They did good overall reporting revenue of $7.1 billion, which is a 50.1% Increase from the same quarter last year, and beat estimates by $290 Million. They also reported record Data Center revenue of $2.94 Billion, and record Gaming revenue of $3.22 billion. At the time of this post, NVDA is sitting at just about $316.75, gaining over $24 today alone. Some of you are probably looking for the next stock similar to TSLA in terms of growth and are thinking that this might be it, especially after their recent run up. They are up $93.85 in the last month alone!

During the press release, they talked about a lot of great things NVDA has done or is in the process of doing. For example NVDA discussed plans to build something which they call Earth-2, Earth-2 is an AI supercomputer which will be made specifically to predict climate change. Another cool thing they’re doing which I’m sure some of you have heard of is the Omniverse avatar, Omniverse is a technology platform which generates interactive AI avatars. The avatars that are created through this platform will be 3-D. According to NVDA they will be able to see and speak. The avatar will be able to talk about a very wide range of subjects. In the Automotive sector, They released AI technology which allows safe autonomous driving on streets and a computer architecture and sensor set made specifically for self-driving systems. I could go way more in depth on the other great advancements this company is doing but these were my favorite and I think you guys get the point.

Now let's talk about their evaluation…

1. Nvidia beat expectations, and they had pretty strong revenue growth in Q3, however, percentage wise, they did fall short compared to their semiconductor competitors, such as AMD and TSM. Their EBITDA margins are also looking pretty good. However, compared to other competitors in the space, once again they fall short, other companies in the space captured a larger portion of the market. Overall, Nvidia’s multiples are leading more than any other company.
2. Management believes that there is a lot more growth in store. They are growing at a tremendous rate right now. In the earnings call, The CEO of NVDA said that they are finally transitioning into becoming a software company. Nvidia is the dominant leader in creating GPU hardware and now they are also becoming a leader in AI tools and virtualization technology. NVDA wants “Every transaction that goes over the internet to touch a GPU” While also selling the best software available to utilize their GPU’s.
3. Nvidia's current market cap is very substantial. This stock has had extreme hype as of recently, especially because of the anticipation regarding the Omniverse. It’s definitely possible that this company could see great growth over the coming years. Especially since they basically have a monopoly on GPU hardware and also very extensive experience in visualization and AI, but they will be fighting a lot of competition from companies that want in on the action. Furthermore, Uk regulators have been pushing back on Nvidia’s $40 billion acquisition of the chip designer Arm and if this transaction is hindered then it could put a pretty big crater in Nvidia's plans. Overall, I believe their company is very overvalued right now and people should wait for a dip if they want to buy into this company.

I hope you all learned something from my analysis of this company. Thanks for reading everyone!

# [Stocks rise led by tech shares as Nvidia soars](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/17/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stocks rose after Nvidia, the world’s most valuable chipmaker, reported better-than-expected third-quarter results and gave a positive outlook.
*****
> Dow futures rose 24 points, or 0.07%. S&P 500 futures gained 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.5%.
*****
> Trading has been choppy this week with the major averages mostly wavering around the flat line, but the S&P and Nasdaq are still on track for a positive week and are sitting less than 1% from their records. The Dow is 1.7% from its record.
*****
> Nvidia shares popped more than 8% in premarket trading after beating on the top and bottom lines of its quarterly results and issued a bullish revenue forecast for the current quarter ending in January. The chipmaker reporter a 55% gain in data center sales from the same period a year ago and its biggest market, gaming, reported a 42% sales increase.
*****
> Those gains helped lift other chip stocks in early morning trading. Advanced Micro Devices gained 2% while Skyworks and Micron Technology added more than 1%.
*****
> Retail continued its big earnings week. Shares of Macy’s and Kohl’s kicked the day off jumping 11% and 7%, respectively. Both companies smashed quarterly profit and revenue estimates, much like its peers who reported earlier in the week. Most have reported same-store sales gains from the previous year and investors are optimistic going into the holiday shopping season.
*****
> Elsewhere, Deere saw its shares rise more than 1% after it came to a resolution with workers who had been on strike since Oct. 14.
*****
> Dow component Boeing also saw its shares rise another almost 2% following on upgrade from JPMorgan, which said the aerospace giant has significant upside as it clears up several issues that have dogged the company.
*****
> Going in the other direction, Cisco Systems fell 5% due to weaker revenue guidance and a revenue miss. Kraft Heinz shares also dropped more than 2% after the company announced a secondary offering of common stock.
*****
> On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 211 points, dragged down by a 4.7% loss in Visa shares. The S&P 500 dipped 0.26%. The Nasdaq Composite ticked 0.33% lower, despite most mega-cap technology companies closing in the green.
*****
> The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 was the relative underperformer on Wednesday, dropping 1.2%.
*****
> “Recent economic reports remain strong, but today’s stock market action highlights that it is already discounting another Covid cycle,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.
*****
> “Concerns about Covid also caused the 10-year bond yield to decline for the first time in 6 days and kept downward pressure on commodity prices including another sizable drop in crude oil prices. If inflation keeps rising while another Covid surge again stalls real economic activity, we may find out how the stock market handles a pseudo-stagflationary episode,” he added.
*****
> Investors await more retail earnings on Thursday with Applied Materials and Palo Alto Networks reporting after the bell.
*****
> The Labor Department will report last week’s jobless claims data at 8:30 a.m. on Thursday. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting initial filings for unemployment insurance fell to 260,000 for the week ending November 13, from the previous week’s 267,000 claims.

Macy’s earned an adjusted $1.23 per share for the quarter, well above the 31-cent consensus estimate, and the raised forecast is easing concern about holiday season inventory shortages.

I always lose when I trade semis, but this time felt different. I knew that they would beat earnings and have another quarter of record profits, record growth. However, I also knew that if I bought calls they would've filed for bankruptcy effective immediately and completely fuck up the market.

Because of my unselfish behavior and deciding to not buy these calls, NVDA is now up to 317 at the time of typing this. This earnings call was going to guide the market for the rest of 2021. This may be the greatest fade of all time, and I've never felt better about fading myself. I actually might be the smartest man alive. Thank me later for all of your tendies.

Obviously Nvidia doesn't have the potential to 8000% gain at $290 but it's probably going to triple in the next few years. 
I think the world will revolve around some of the tech this company is doing and there's only 1 - 3 major players in some of those fields and Nvidia is tops in most.

Tables of stocks found below.  My diamond hands are so rough on my fleshy...forearms. I can't type anymore.

# Observations/Assumptions

Before  you jump down my throat, these are simplified observations/assumptions,  not internationally agreed upon mandates from heaven. Okay, now you can  jump down my throat.

* Companies  with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a  sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies  missing one or more of those attributes.
* For most people it is impossible to time the market
* Stock prices have all available information priced into them.
* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.
* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)
* [Index  fund returns, such as the S&P 500, are now predominately determined  by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)
* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).
* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 (yes, simplified)
* During times of volatility, companies that had poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.
* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.
* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:
   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp)  even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have had  losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing in  that same set of stocks in the same proportions.
   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don’t want to support.
   * Due  to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the  index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when Tesla  was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on 11/16/2020,  forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up the price,  which had already been driven up by people buying the stock knowing it  was then going to get added to the index forcing more people to buy the  stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular, that’s because it is.

# Hypothesis

Using  industry benchmarking against the best of the best of the best  companies in each industry in order to purchase only the best companies  in equal measure should provide a well-diversified portfolio that over  the long term should be able to beat the S&P 500.

# Experiment 2020

750  largest US stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry  (Industry details available further down the post). Stocks were given a  score based on their relative percentage compared to the industry index.  For example, each companies’ average ROE of the last 4 years was  compared to this index value with the following type of breakdown:

* ROE < Index ROE = Poor = 1
* ROE > Index ROE = Moderate = 2
* ROE > 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3

For  example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was  10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,  they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they would  receive a moderate rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would receive a  great rating.

This was done for all of the metrics below:

* ROE
* Revenue Growth %
* EBITDA %
* FCF %

The  relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there  was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth  only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be  decreased to 125% for a better distribution.

Any stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.

[ROE Example](https://preview.redd.it/t7l27u9tu6081.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f904309edb170cc8679189ea62f7bbe057646a3d)

ROE Example

That left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.

This  left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the  company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently  in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them  being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire? Has  WSB said it's a buy? Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason  that I want to exclude them?

That left 26 across 7 sectors.

[Industries 2020 Experiment Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/3gurx91wu6081.png?width=366&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e37aa1afdb655721fc83dff4e75867923e48cc1)

**2020 Industry Breakdown**

These  26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and  September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total  purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.

2020 Experiment Results July, August, and September 2020 purchases to 11/16/2021

* **S&P 500** total return reinvested dividends: **49.09%**
* **My 26 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **61.53%**

Can we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.

# Experiment 2021

2,850  tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.  The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:

* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company
* Profit Margin – shows how effective the business is at making money
* Operating Margin – shows how much money the company earns on its revenue
* FCF Margin – shows how efficient a company is with their cash
* EBITDA Margin – shows a companies’ operating profitability
* ROE – shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money
* ROA – shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits
* ROIC – shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns
* Debt/Equity Ratio – shows the financial stability of a company

More  metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to  determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to  median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of  the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:

·  3 stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over  the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry is  then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that benchmark.

Each  stock was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the  metrics and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite  score out of 27, from 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the  metrics. The scores are based on how much better they are then the  average. I measured them against the benchmark using the same  methodology as previously performed: Poor < 100%, Good < 150%,  Great > 150%. Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the  particular metric to find a useful distribution.

I  also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst TICKER THAT SHALL NOT BE NAMED (evidently a stock that cannot be named because I was banned the first time I posted this) with a score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9 categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn’t match the original  input (congratulations on your reading comprehension), this is primarily  due to mergers/acquisitions or the stock being taken private. Another  stock was acquired during the analysis, changing the max number yet  again.

Here is an example showing Aerospace & Defense scoring:

[Aerospace & Defense scoring](https://preview.redd.it/5r8i1qb0v6081.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=947be14d943204b8211c0933e9c1f1a41d4a1986)

Here is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the company’s most recent year):

[Growth Scoring](https://preview.redd.it/a2nq8c1av6081.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1f79a62b587bf6f1530f5beefda1b174b5d7d43)

Here is an example of the visualizations for the data:

[Data Visualization Example](https://preview.redd.it/5d41vcvdv6081.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=26567d730e1d668ccef856a18497fab38345577b)

I  applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at  the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock  that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a  high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.

Next,  I read the description of \~300 stocks and looked through their  financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off  their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly  leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that  Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns  Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them (how could you not?), no  there are not great synergies between the sectors of the business, yes,  they are aware of this. I also eliminated industries I wasn’t interested  in reviewing, such as REITS due to the need to look at different  metrics like FFO, Oil and Gas because it’s oil and gas, etc. These  activities eliminated \~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I’d  need to build a separate model.

I  then looked at each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made  the cut. Are all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are  the profit margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt  situation, did WSB say it's a buy, etc. Who deserves to be on this list?  This eliminated \~75.

We were down  to 84 stocks at this point. I then looked at each company's investor  presentation, annual report, etc. to better understand what the company  does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was not nearly as thorough on  this portion this year compared to last year just due to the substantial  increase in companies, 26 vs 84. My hourly wage at McDonald was going  to be better than my returns from the analysis if I took too long. I  only eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83  companies across 31 industries. Breakdown below:

[Industry Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/0bmcwyuiv6081.png?width=390&format=png&auto=webp&s=0df395664265ef942ff736c889108711216e76ed)

I then purchased all of these in equal proportion in April, May, and July of 2021.

2021 Experiment Results April, May, and July 2021 purchases to 11/16/2021:

* **S&P 500** total return including reinvested dividends: **11.93%**
* **My 2021 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **14.26%**

# Industry Classification

* For Experiment 2020, the Sector was used to determine how companies should be compared.
   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.
   * This  seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each other  that aren’t really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE below.
* For Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.
   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.
   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).
   * I  ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further. Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less than 10  stocks. I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical issues dealing  with averages/medians that were negative. There were also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they could be combined such  as biotech and pharmaceutical.

# Notes

I  partnered up for both the 2020 and 2021 experiments. This was critical  for both expanding my initial idea, brainstorming methods to build the  model, and reviewing the work done for errors. This was a team effort,  and I by no means deserve all the credit or hate.

All returns are showing reinvested dividends in the total return.

\*I  am not a financial advisor or anything else I should put here to ensure  it is clear that I did this for myself and am sharing my results and am  in no way forcing you to push buttons to buy things you don’t  understand or requiring justification for this run on sentence and  henceforth.

\*\*\*\*. Past results are no guarantee of future returns."

# [Stock futures are little changed after Lowe’s and Target post earnings beats](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/16/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures were little changed in morning trading Wednesday as investors weighed earnings reports from big-box retailers Target and Lowe’s.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 14 points. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were little changed.
*****
> Home improvement giant Lowe’s got a boost after reporting earnings that easily beat Wall Street expectations. The stock initially popped in premarket trading as the company not only topped the Street view but also raised its full-year sales forecast. Shares were last higher by less than 1%.
*****
> Target posted beats on the top and bottom lines, however, its CEO noted rising costs related to supply chain issues and compensation could have an impact going forward as the company plans to absorb those costs rather than passing them onto the customer. Shares slid 3.3% premarket.
*****
> Shares of Dow component Boeing rose nearly 2% in premarket trading after the company received an Akasa Air order for its 737 MAX worth $9 billion. The aerospace company’s stock has been a laggard this year, up just 5.5%.
*****
> Also, Tesla moved higher by about 1% as the stock continues its rebound after founder and CEO Elon Musk sold a chunk of his shares.
*****
> On the downside, Visa shares slumped about 2% after Amazon said it will stop accepting payments made via Visa credit cards issued in the U.K. starting next year.
*****
> The moves in futures trading come after fresh economic data and corporate earnings signaled U.S. consumers are ramping up spending despite rising prices.
*****
> The Dow added 54.77 points, or 0.15%. The S&P 500 gained 0.39% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.76%.
*****
> Retail sales rose 1.7% in October, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday, faster than economists expected. The figure measures how much consumers spend on goods across a number of categories.
*****
> Strong quarterly results from Home Depot also boosted investor sentiment Tuesday. The home improvement retailer led gainers on the Dow after earnings topped analyst estimates. Walmart also reported better-than-expected results, though its shares declined.
*****
> “US stocks rallied after an impressive retail sales report, solid industrial production data, and retail earnings showed the consumer is handling the current pricing increases. All signs are pointing to a very strong holiday season for retailers and that should help keep sending stocks higher,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, said in a Tuesday note.
*****
> Investors await more retail earnings Wednesday from TJX, Bath & Body Works and Victoria’s Secret. Other major companies reporting results Wednesday include Cisco Systems and Nvidia.

What's poppin' bull gang, hope you all managed to escape meme week with your portfolios intact! The name of the game this week is Retails Giants and Chinese Tech, and it’s here where we’ll find some of our most lucrative opportunities. Although it may not seem like it, some of the companies in these sectors have extremely large historical moves, meaning we’ve got the potential to make some serious dough. We’re also approaching holiday season, meaning that many retailers will give adjusted guidance on their calls in light of the supply chain issues that have been plaguing the globe, adding to the intensity of these already large moves. Let’s get into it!

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eV9BTySXfVbMnVZFp5IfkaYf_xETjYyplJh_r-SLMjg/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eV9BTySXfVbMnVZFp5IfkaYf_xETjYyplJh_r-SLMjg/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **The premiums on $NNOX are intoxicating.** Options are pricing around a 17% move at the time of writing, but historically $NNOX only moves 9%. Unfortunately for us, the sample size on this company is small, so we need to tread a little more carefully than usual. Regardless, the most $NNOX has ever moved post earnings is 18%, meaning even if we do get a “maximum” move, we won’t lose much money. I will likely opt to sell a 20/28 strangle once I conduct all little more research into the company later this week. I want to see if I can uncover any reasons regarding ***why*** the premiums are so high.

&nbsp;

- **$FL options will be extremely cheap come Friday.** Currently, the options are pricing an 8.3% move relative to the historical move of 9.3% , making them relatively efficient. Given that volatility doesn’t inflate throughout the week, these options should become extremely cheap by Friday since theta will murder the extrinsic value on them. Footlocker is no stranger to large moves, and if we can enter a lotto strangle for cheap Thursday before close, we could be looking at a handsome return come Friday morning. A straddle will currently run you $460, but by Friday this number may be closer to $300. If that’s the case, I’ll roll the dice on this one - I like my odds.

- **Chinese tech give us an awesome collateral play opportunity!** $KW£B is a high liquidity ETF consisting of all of the Chinese tech stocks who report this week. If it behaves anything like American tech does during earnings week, there should be a clear directional move in the entire ETF. If we’re bullish or bearish on Chinese tech as a whole, we should look to go long or short on $KW£B instead of any of the individual tickers in order to mitigate our risks and generate significantly greater profits.

I put together some data for upcoming earnings this week through Wednesday. Basically I was looking to build a snapshot of each company. The POS. column is a result of compiling the options contracts ending the week with the highest open interest. My actual position is to the far left. $SPREAD indicates the range between the current price and the strike price of the contract. NET/GROSS is for the last reported yearly financials. All data was pulled from either Yahoo or Nasdaq. Numbers are accurate-ish. I have no background in finance, so Im expecting to learn from this. Would definitely appreciate feedback from those who know what they're doing. I understand IV crush limits or extinguishes profits on contracts held through earnings, so Im taking positions that I think will have meaningful price movement. Green on the row means I have calls, and red puts.

QFIN: this company has a low and positive P/E and lower estimate for the next year. They beat earnings last quarter by 25.42% and a profit margin of 25.78%. A price point of 26.04 is affordable they're involved in data so Im giving it a go.

MVST: there's a lot better DD on this site than this, but overall it looks like they're going to start growing into positive earnings, and if contracts with USPS come through, it'll be a great play. beat earnings last quarter by 91%. The options with the highest open interest are puts, but I see a great upside here.

DAVA: This company has a high P/E but they beat earnings and have a profit margin of 28.24%. The options with leading OI are already ITM.

STNE: Looks solid across the board. Affordable. crushed EPS last quarter. good profit margin.

SBLK: Affordable. Super low P/E estimate. Maybe moving into big earnings. Still positive profit margin. Might do a late DOE on this.

DLO: affordable: PM is huge. Big upside on the favored strike price.

WPC: a little pricey. Looks like a solid company overall.

TGT: Huge upside for puts. The spread makes me think people know something I don't. 83% of open interest is for puts here. Would really like to hear someones opinion on this.

LOW: Same as TGT. huge spread of the strike price. Less percentage overall for puts. A lot of analysts are saying its over weight. Maybe they'll have dog shit earnings?

ZIM: this seems like the star of the show. The financials are solid. Super low P/E estimate. nice spread on strike price. Insane profit margin. Big time go.

NVDA: everyones buying this anyway.

YY: no position here yet. Just curious how they have a negative operating cost that puts NET above Gross.

Please let me know if Im a total smooth brain retard or what. Thanks!"

* Actually create their own chips
* 9.75 PE, massive earnings, increasing dividend, fair value is at $300B
* New GPUs (trash compared to Nvidia but something) <- Miners finna gobble those up, increasing revenue
* Spending a ton for new fabs and to compete with TSMC, Samsung, Micron, and Nvidia and to try and ""solve that chip shortage,"" including spending $95B towards new fabs in Europe. <- if they can somehow pull that off, their revenue and market share will grow as TSMC and others wouldn't be able to compete. Unlikely, but investors will be happy they are ""trying""
* Still hold a majority CPU market share, the 12th gen CPUs are speedy af
* Data centers are growing at a very fast rate and use Intel chips
* Fell on Q3 earnings, giving it a good price and entry

I also believe the overall chip market is set to grow a ton, as semiconductors will be in everything, from automobiles to a pig's brain. If Intel can't regain market share, they will ride the wave of semiconductors, although it may be slower than other chip stocks and **$SOXL**.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 15th, 2021.

# **Inflation remains the hot topic in week ahead as Walmart and other key retailers report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/12/inflation-remains-the-hot-topic-in-week-ahead-as-walmart-and-other-key-retailers-report.html)**
*****
> Consumers are in the spotlight in the week ahead, with the imminent release of retail sales for October and earnings from major chain stores.
*****
> Retail sales is the big economic report for the week, when the Census Bureau releases October data on Tuesday.
*****
> Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said he’s also looking at the New York Federal Reserve’s Empire state manufacturing survey Monday for updates on prices paid. The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey, a measure of growth in that region, is released Thursday.
*****
> “That’s going to be key, outside of that it’s retail sales,” Boockvar said. “I think the inflation story will continue to dominate the headlines and the news flow in markets and what the Fed does.”
*****
> Investors will also be watching the outcome of the virtual meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday evening.
*****
> “I think it’s good that they would be on a talking basis,” Boockvar said. “I don’t think anything would come out of it unless there’s some shocking change in the tariff situation, but I doubt anything will happen.”
*****
> # Chain store earnings
> The earnings season is winding down, but the big-box stores have yet to report. Walmart and Home Depot release results Tuesday, and Target reports Wednesday.
*****
> “Walmart is a pretty big barometer for the health of the consumer for sure, and it will be interesting to see how they handle margins,” National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said. Rising costs have been pressuring companies across industries, and many have raised prices in response.
*****
> Based on the latest sentiment data Friday, consumers are getting worried about rising prices. The University of Michigan’ consumer sentiment index dropped to a 10-year low of 66.8 in the preliminary November report, from 71.7 in October.
*****
> “It’s so important to look at what consumers do, versus what they say,” Hogan said. He said retail sales are expected to be up 1.1%, compared to a 0.7% gain in September.
*****
> “The trend that we’re looking for in the next week is sequential improvement in economic data,” Hogan said. “That’s the important thing to focus on.”
*****
> Other data in the coming week includes industrial production Tuesday. Housing starts and building permits data will be released Wednesday.
*****
> Inflation also proved to be a problem in the stock market this past week, after both producer prices and consumer prices increased more than expected. The consumer price index jumped 6.2%, a three-decade high.
*****
> Stocks snapped a five-week winning streak, and all major indices were lower in the past week. The S&P 500 was down 0.3% for the week, at 4,682. The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 saw the biggest declines, falling 0.7% and 1% respectively.
*****
> Treasury yields rose, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner to combat inflation.
*****
> The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.57% on Friday afternoon, and the 2-year yield traded at 0.52%. Yields move opposite price.
*****
> The best performing major S&P equities sector was materials, an inflation play that gained more than 2.5%. The worst performer was the consumer discretionary sector, which includes retailers: It declined nearly 3.2%.
*****
> Hogan said even with inflation fears, he expects stocks to continue to rise.
*****
> “I think we continue to grind higher. We did the larger reset that we needed, which was six weeks - in September and two weeks of October,” he said. “The good news is demand hasn’t been destroyed. It’s been delayed.” Hogan said supply chain issues should get sorted out. He noted that some components of CPI, like higher used car prices, show that the inflation should be temporary.
*****
> Trivariate Research founder Adam Parker said he expects the market to continue its march higher. “What would make me call for a correction in the market would be two things — hubris and debt,” he said. Neither of those are currently a problem, since he does not see signs of “management gone awry” and many companies restructured their debt.
*****
> Managements are not engaging in arrogant behavior that would be more common at a market top, like excessive spending, he said.
*****
> Parker said he expects mid-single digit earnings growth. “I think we could be pretty constructive for the next couple of quarters,” he said.

> # Best and Worst S&P 500 Stocks Since September 30th

> The past month has seen the S&P 500 pivot and rally higher after declines throughout the month of September. Since the end of Q3, the S&P has now gained 8.6%, which is slightly off the highs from earlier this month. Earnings season has been in full swing over the past few weeks meaning there have been plenty of stocks with catalysts for big moves since the end of September. Below we show the stocks that have risen and fallen the most since September 30th.

> Topping the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH) having rallied 67.77% in the past month and a half. The bulk of that gain came after earnings as the stock leaped 24.65% the day after reporting and plenty of follow-through in the days after. Arista Networks (ANET) is also up over 50%. Like ENPH, a large portion of ANET's move came from an over 20% gain on earnings in response to a triple play. There are 18 other stocks in the S&P 500 that have risen by more than 25% since the end of September. The largest of those are NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).

> Only 18% of the S&P 500 has traded lower since September 30th, and by far the biggest decliner has been Moderna (MRNA). Although it has fallen a dramatic 41% in a short span, that eats into what have been very strong gains this year. Even after its decline so far in Q4, MRNA has still more than doubled year to date. The only other biggest decliners since September that are still up year to date are Garmin (GRMN), Allstate (ALL), Carnival (CCL), and Dish Network (DISH).

> # Week Before Thanksgiving, DJIA up 19 of 28, but weaker lately

> Next week is not only November’s monthly option expiration week, but it is also the last full week of trading before Thanksgiving. DJIA has a reasonably solid track record over the last 28 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.41%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks have not been as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 18 years with a median loss of 0.09%.

> S&P is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.24% and down 10 of the last 18, –0.16% median loss. NASDAQ is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.28% and down 9 of the last 18, +0.07% median gain. Russell 2000 is up 15 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.54% and down 10 of the last 18, –0.20% median loss. If weakness does manifest next week, it may be a good set up for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.

> # Reasons To Be Thankful

> As we reach the home stretch of 2021, there is a lot to be thankful for. Stocks are having an amazing year, the economy is improving, and COVID-19 trends are going the right direction. Let’s look at some reasons to be thankful.

> What an amazing year and incredible recent run in stocks. The S&P 500 Index just made 8 consecutive all-time highs for the first time since 1997 and it was up 17 out of 19 days for the first time since 1971. Along the way, the S&P 500 was up more than 25% year-to-date in the month of November, making it one of the best years ever.

> The S&P 500 has made 65 new all-time highs this year, tied for the second most in any year ever (tied with 1964), with only 77 in 1995 higher. Although it is still a longshot, there’s a chance we could see 13 more new highs and break the record, something to be thankful for indeed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.10.21.png?ssl=1))**

> “Although the economy did slow in the third quarter, it looks like that was a one-off event due to supply chain issues and the Delta variant,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We fully expect growth to pick up over the coming quarters as the economy continues to rebound thanks to a very healthy and strong U.S. consumer.”

> From the best services number ever, to job growth beating expectations, to inflation and supply chain issues showing signs of peaking, to consumers with trillions of dollars in savings, there are many reasons to expect the economy to remain strong as we head into 2022.

> At the end of the day, though, it is all about earnings. So, while the economy might have slowed in the third quarter, earnings once again came in much better than expected, showing how agile corporate America can be. S&P 500 earnings are tracking to a 39% year-over-year increase in the third quarter, more than 12 percentage points above expectations with still more than 40 index constituents left to report. As our Earnings Season Dashboard shows below, there is a lot to be thankful for as it pertains to earnings.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.10.21-.png?ssl=1))**

> Lastly, the trends in COVID-19 are going the right way, with the number of hospitalizations down more than 50% from the September peak. With booster shots on the way and kids allowed to get vaccinated, there are many tailwinds to a continuation of the reopening we’ve been seeing. This is definitely something to be thankful for.

*****

> # Sentiment Steadily Moving Higher

> The S&P 500 has encountered some selling pressure this week, but that hasn't stopped sentiment from continuing its grind higher. The weekly AAII sentiment survey saw 48.0% of respondents report as bullish this week up from 41.5% last week. That puts bullish sentiment at the highest level since the first week of July when it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it is now.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bull.png))**

> The increase in bullish sentiment borrowed from bears as less than a quarter of respondents reported having negative sentiment for the first time since the last week of July. Similar to bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment is now at the lowest level since the first week of July when it came in at 22.2%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bear.png))**

> Overall, sentiment continues to favor bulls to a wide margin. As a result of the inverse moves in sentiment, the bull-bear spread rose to 24 from 15.5 last week. Again, that is levels not seen since early July.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Spread.png))**

> Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling by 4.5 percentage points to 28%. Unlike bullish and bearish sentiment, that reading is basically in the middle of the past several months' range as the reading has generally hovered around the 30% level.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Neutral.png))**

> # Small Business Economic Outlook Dour

> This morning the NFIB released the results of their October survey of small business sentiment. The report saw small business sentiment fall for the second month in a row. At 98.2, the index is now back to the same level it was at this past March.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-HL.png))**

> With the decline in the headline reading, breadth was terrible with only one index that is an input to the optimism index—Plans to Make Capital Outlays—moving higher month over month. The various indices are now all over the place with regards to their own historical ranges. For example, Higher Prices, Compensation, and Compensation Plans all hit a record high while Expectations for the Economy to Improve and Credit Conditions for Regular Borrowers are just off of record lows.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Table.png))**

> Sales and earnings-related topics weighed on optimism in October. A net negative percentage of responding firms reported weaker actual and earnings changes. Meanwhile, the weakest percentage of respondents reported now as a good time to expand since February. Alongside that weaker reading, Outlook for General Business Conditions continues to collapse and is now at the second-lowest level on record; only slightly above the low from nine years ago. One potential factor playing into that weak sentiment is higher prices as that index hit another record.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Sales.png))**

> While the headline Small Business Optimism index has declined, it has held up considerably well relative to the massive drop in the Outlook for General Business Conditions. As shown below, the spread between the two is now at a record high dating back to 1986.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Spread.png))**

> While there were some signs of cooling in October, overall the employment metrics in the report continue to be historically strong. Hiring Plans were unchanged at 26 which is off the late summer peak but still above any pre-pandemic level. While firms do not plan to take on as many workers as they had planned a few months ago, they are at least paying them better. Both Compensation and Compensation Plans continue to surge to new record highs. That has appeared to have some effect as the number of firms reporting Job Openings as Hard to Fill fell modestly. Additionally, as we noted in today's Morning Lineup, fewer businesses are reporting labor problems as their biggest concern.

#[Dow futures up nearly 100 points after J&J shares pop on split news](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/11/stock-futures-inch-higher-as-wall-street-looks-to-avoid-losing-week-amid-high-inflation.html)

*****
> Stock futures moved slightly higher early Friday morning as Wall Street looked to end the week on a positive note after a historic inflation report.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 90 points. S&P 500 futures added 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.2%.
*****
> Dow component Johnson & Johnson saw its shares pop about 3% in premarket trading following a Wall Street Journal report that the company is splitting in two. Johnson & Johnson is reportedly breaking off its consumer health division into a separate publicly-traded company.
*****
> The move in futures comes after the stock market appears to have withstood the hottest inflation report in 30 years on Wednesday. The major indexes are on track to snap five-week winning streaks but are still within striking distance of their recent records.
*****
> Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for the Schwab Center for Financial Research, said that year-over-year comparisons to an abnormal 2020 and rising wages may have dented the reaction to the inflation report.
*****
> “Big numbers get big headlines, and yes prices are higher, but you’ve got also wage increases that are just about to the same amount as inflation is. So inflation is definitely real, but the impact isn’t quite as severe as people think,” Frederick said.
*****
> The inflation report was the latest complication from economic data that investors have sorted through in recent weeks, with some professional investors looking optimistically toward 2022.
*****
> “We’ve probably reached maximum supply chain disruption and I think the labor market is going to free up a bit as we saw with the jobs report last Friday,” said Brent Schutte, the chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual.
*****
> This week has seen more dramatic action in the bond market, where the inflation report led to a sharp reversal from the recent decline in the 10-year Treasury yield on Wednesday. The bond market was closed on Thursday for Veterans Day.
*****
> On Thursday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5%, while the S&P 500 edged slightly higher. The Dow dropped nearly 160 points, dragged down by Disney’s post-earnings slide.
*****
> Through Thursday, the Dow is down 1.1% for the week, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are down 1% and 1.7%, respectively.
*****
> After a busy week of earnings and economic data releases, Friday is relatively light for investors. The preliminary read for November consumer sentiment and the September report on job openings and labor turnover will be released Friday morning.

It reached a high around the 320s before the inflation fears kicked in, and I think with the strong close from AMD above 146 from below 140 over the last 2 days NVDA is due for another hot RUN with the earnings catalyst coming and the metaverse announcements

Today, I decided to finally sell all of them, take my profit and equally YOLO it along with 4/5 of my savings. I randomly selected these three tech giants: Microsoft, Nvidia and Meta. One, because I know a lot about them and two, because I personally cannot see them significantly drop in value in the long term.

Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qpri9s/a_couple_of_pairs_worth_watching_amatsnps/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

And thus far, what I have seen has fallen in line with that post. You can see AMAT and SNPS running together price-wise, and, based on today’s premarket, tech will take a hit today. I was not, before today, inclined to treat today as a buying opportunity before some heavyweights I like report (NVDA, AMAT). That’s because I expect retail earnings and guidance to be a drag on markets next week.

But I could be wrong on that front if disappointing tape in retail drives people back into growth stocks. Keep an eye out… positions next week will probably include SNPS (not too heavy because it seems to be low volume) and CRWD."

I know last few years they were struggling and they are still stuck on their 10nm process but the 12th gen CPU's finally started competing with ryzen, and I think they are getting back on track.

And their valuation compared to AMD and Nvidia seems like a bargain especially considering Intel has Fabs unlike other 2 (though if they are losing money on them it could be a drawback)

I present to you a very diverse ticker (META). This is an ETF consisting of many high growth stocks such as FB, AMD and the daddy of them all - NVDA along with many others. Please see below for charting. 

I believe this stock will be trading around $18 by the end of the week. Momentum has increased around METAverse related stocks such as AMD and NVDA as well as FB. While the idea of creating a meta verse is not new; it will continue to gain momentum in the coming months and years.

Metaverse/Omniverses will not be created overnight; however, we can continue to see increase activity surrounding these ideas.

Big dates: 

Six weeks since ETF began trading (don't have date sorry) - **Crosses $50 Million in assets**

9/14/2021 - META ETF Crossed **$100 Million in assets.**

11/8/2021 - META ETF Crossed **$250 Million in assets.**

11/9/2021 - Currently sitting at **$281 Million.**

This ETF has potential to hit $300 million by the end of the year if it holds its momentum. Furthermore if the above stocks continue to hold their current levels or if they gain more momentum we can see $320 Million. This is just a general DD. I will provide more in-depth DD soon!

# [Dow futures edge lower after new highs; GE jumps on news it will split into 3 companies](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/08/stock-us-futures-market-open-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures were mixed during early trading Tuesday after the major averages closed at records, boosted by strength in infrastructure stocks.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 21 points. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures traded in mildly positive territory.
*****
> Shares of GE rallied after CNBC’s David Faber reported that the legendary company would be splitting into three companies focusing on aviation, healthcare and energy. The stock soared more than 12% in premarket trading.
*****
> During Monday regular trading all three major averages rose to new highs. The Dow gained about 104 points, or 0.29%, posting its 44th record close of the year. The S&P 500 added 0.09% and closed above 4,700 for the first time. The move pushed the broad equity index to its 64th record close of 2021. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.07% to post its 11th straight positive session, the longest daily winning streak since December 2019. The tech-heavy index registered its 44th record close of 2021.
*****
> Key inflation data will be reported this week, with the producer price index, which measures the costs of final-demand manufactured goods, reading coming on Tuesday, followed by the consumer price index on Wednesday.
*****
> Economists surveyed by Dow Jones are expecting producer prices to have risen 0.6% month over month in October. The consumer price index is also expected to show a 0.6% jump compared to the prior month.
*****
> Tesla shares turned higher in premarket trading, a day after falling nearly 5% when company founder Elon Musk asked Twitter users whether he should sell 10% of his stock. The stock was up 1.2% Tuesday morning.
*****
> Popular trading app Robinhood saw its shares lose more than 3% premarket following disclosures that a third party made off with names and email addresses of a few million users and was able to get personal information on about 300 of those users.
*****
> NVIDIA shares rose nearly 5% premarket after the company said it was joining forces with several self-driving sensor companies on safety systems that automakers will be able to deploy as soon as 2024.
*****
> Infrastructure-related stocks were among Monday’s biggest winners after the House passed the spending package on Friday evening. Materials was the top-performing S&P group, rising 1.23%, while the industrials sector closed at a record.
*****
> “The passing of the traditional infrastructure bill is a strong positive for the economy and for markets, as it should result in positive ROI [return on investment] for the country,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance.
*****
> “Infrastructure is one of those expenditures which is truly an investment — with an expected positive return on money spent — as opposed to a pure expense, with relatively little chance of getting the money back,” he added.
*****
> Strong earnings results have also supported stocks in running to new highs. Through Monday morning 445 S&P 500 components have reported quarterly results, with 81% beating earnings estimates. When it comes to revenue, 76% of companies have exceeded expectations.
*****
> The bulk of the index may have reported, but there are still some widely-watched reports on deck. D. R. Horton will report before Tuesday’s opening well, while Wynn Resorts and Coinbase will provide updates when the market closes.
*****
> “With Q3 earnings season winding down, economic data and the progress in economic re-openings will gain in importance in investors’ focus from here to the end of the year,” noted John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management.
*****
> Also on Monday, Federal Reserve Governor Randal Quarles, who served a dual role as banking system supervisor, announced he would be stepping down around the end of 2021. Multiple Fed officials spoke Monday, with Vice Chairman Richard Clarida expressing concern about inflation, the current pace of which is “much more than a moderate overshoot” of the Fed’s 2% goal.
*****
> In another central bank development, President Joe Biden last week interviewed Fed Governor Lael Brainard for the position of Fed chairman, Bloomberg News reported, a surprise development in that most of Wall Street expects Jerome Powell to be renominated to the position.

/1. INTC is the only real US chip manufacturer that can reasonably compete with Korean Samsung and Taiwanese TSMC (-100 credit score for acknowledging Taiwan). It is getting lots of literal boat load of cash(probs something like $50B equivalent) from the government that is positive for the shareholders, while maintaining the buybacks and dividends.
Yes, TSMC and others are also hedging and gonna start making some chips in USA but realistically the gubment will give most of the cash to INTC.

/2. US gubment is in a cold war with China, this means it's also a technological warfare. This means supercomputers, missile, Starlink chips(private company) etc and Intel is likely going to be one of the prime suppliers of this boom in tech investment.

/3. TSMC and Samsung are pretty much bottlenecked. Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Mediatech, Broadcom, various carmakers, electronics manufacturers etc and not to mention Intel themselves are a big buyer. Specifically, Intel and Apple has bought out all capacity of TSMC 3nm(equivalent to Intel's 5 nm probs, I forgot). This means there is an enormous demand that is not being fulfilled and Intel launching their foundry services and already signing deals with Qualcomm, Amazon is a big deal.

For reference, TSMC's market cap is bigger than 3 Intel (yes, that's a unit I invented). In 2024-2025, you might even see Apple, NVIDIA and the likes fabricating their chips from Intel just to give a big F U to TSMC (who is currently slightly overcharging if the rumours are to be believed).

/4. Intel is launching a GPU. The GPU market is also in a huge bottleneck due to higher demand from gamers and corn miners. Everyone expects that they are likely to sell their GPUs very easily. Think about this for a sec. Intel is just about to become one of the players in this huge GPU market.
Which would also make way for their server GPUs and AIs and the likes.

/5. Think 10-15 years from now. Your fridge, doorbell, light, heating system and every ducking thing will have some chips and Intel is likely to remain a dominant player in this market. I think this will be bigger than the current entire semi market as it is. IOT is just getting started.

/6. Intel is one of the forerunner player in AI techs like autonomous vehicles through their various investments(Mobil eye for one) and will likely remain so. I don't know how big this will be in 10 years, but it's likely that Intel will be one of the bigger players in the market like Google (through Waymo), Tesla and NVIDIA.

/7. Intel also recently launched their big little architecture, where it has already became competitively better than AMD especially in gaming with low power consumption and huge power. Not to mention being very power efficient most of the time for using its efficiency cores most of the time. Not that it matters that much, seeing the gamer Steam reports, very few people actually play on the latest of the latest gen. But, that's also something that's worth noting at least. 

However, the vast majority of pc sales is in just your average boomer laptops and desktops. And they have a good lead there.

*Tips for those wanting to build a high end new pc. Wait for Intel's lineup to be available broadly, high end pc gamers will dump their last gen AMD chips for the Intel one in the second hand market, causing a flooding of cheap AMD CPUs, buy one of them. Source: Did this once.*

/8. One worrying factor is in the server market. Everyone seems to be launching their own server chips and AMD is very competitive and eating away market share. But Intel's management seems to be guiding us towards the right path. If their predictions prove to be right, they are on the right track.

/9. Intel announced that they will launch Angstrom scale CPUs in the future, that's good I guess. They are also working in RISC-V and other CPU architectures.

/10. Pat has an approval rating of 96% in Glassdoor and the employees would recommend others to work in Intel 89% of the time. This is a huge ass jump for both scores from the Bob Swan era. Go to Wayback Machine, you will see. This means a noticeable change has taken place within this huge organisation in such a short time.

/11. Intel stock always seem to have price support at around $50. And it's near that range right now.

/12. Most analysts are bullish on the stock. Comparatively cheap stock in this clown market. Wanna buy a $5.48B gravity powered truck company anyone?

/13. Intel actually has one of the highest talented employee pull who can be expected to deliver. Contrary to popular belief.

**Bear Cases**

/1. This is a boomer stock according to reddit's circejerk. So, it's difficult to convince people that it is actually expected to grow around 11% CAGR just by the current demand circumstances alone by management's conservative estimates for the next few years. This is mega bearish. If the market doesn't care about a stock, no matter what the management do, the stock will not perform.

/2. Intel has repeatedly failed to prove that their foundry division's predictions are reliable. If they went fabless like AMD, it would have probably rocketed already. But a big part of the cheapness of the stock comes from the unreliability of their foundry division. Yes, the management has finally started getting serious about their foundry, but one cannot ignore their past failures.

/3. Government contracts and the likes are not completely free money like some of you believe, delays in delivery and contract fulfillment could make what is essentially a free money glitch to a costly mistake and a billion dollar loss with a brink of an eye. The terms are generally very strict, so Intel has to deliver.

/4. Investments are going to be a lot and semiconductor industry being cyclical means, if Intel fails to deliver, its market share will be eaten away and lose billions in potential profit.

/5. Stock seems to be largely rangebound like Microsoft was for 15 years.

For the last 2 weeks I have traded NVDA every trading day. Converting my small $800 investment into $22,000 within these said 2 weeks.

NVDA Price action always follows the same pattern from what I have noticed. We open high and its either push higher or come crashing back down only to recover later during power hour or the following day.

For the last 3 trading days NVDA has had some amazing price movements. Giving me the ability to turn 800 into 22 thousand. At one point reaching $42k but as a true autist I did not sell.

This stock has given us some amazing returns YOY. For tomorrow we can expect NVDA to break to new ATH (if it is able to break through 314). We can see a very bullish case of 314, 317, 320, 338. I am not saying this will happen tomorrow or the next day. All I am saying is if we break through tomorrow we can make some sweet tendies.

Yesterday I gave a trade idea which I did not take due to going deep into nada. This call out was AMD $145C Nov 12. These were trading at 1 and went up to 10.6 over 2 days. They won MSFT and METAs business. However, I believe that NVDA will run tomorrow since they also have an event regarding their omniverse business.

For tomorrow $320 weeklies will be hot. See chart above for a clear view of this bullish pennant. With that I wish you guys luck and lets make some money.

qpri9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qpri9s/a_couple_of_pairs_worth_watching_amatsnps/,A couple of pairs worth watching [AMAT/SNPS; PANW/CRWD/ZS],10,5,2021-11-09 08:35:13,"One of the things I love watching for is trades within sectors that I know somewhat, where one or two businesses report earnings, followed (over a period of one or more trading days) by other businesses in the same sector. On earnings, stocks in the same sector tend to all fall or rise together (e.g., UBER, LYFT) absent some sort of significant differentiating factor that comes in during the earnings report or in the guidance, unless there are clear signs that market share is definitely being taken away from one player to the benefit of another (e.g., AMD, INTC). 

Take Lyft and Uber. Lyft reports before Uber, generally, so a positive report and guidance for Lyft (which is much smaller, lacking a global footprint and certain businesses Uber has) generally results in Uber shares rising the day after Lyft reports (assuming, of course, that Lyft rises as a result of the positive report and guidance). The same generally occurs when Lyft stock drops on account of a negative report and/or guidance- Uber drops, unless people are counting heavily on different business lines shoring up Uber's balance sheet and earnings for some reason. Occasionally you might get some decoupling because, for example, a pandemic forces large international markets into lockdown while the U.S. remains open, but, for the most part, the pattern holds. (Just don't expect to hold Uber up to and past its earnings date based solely on how LYFT did!)  


By contrast, an earnings report and guidance that lifts AMD does not always lift Intel. AMD and Intel's offerings come about as close to direct substitutes as one can get; in the PC and server markets, we basically have a duopoly.

So let's take those out of the picture, shall we?

Applied Materials reports next week. I am long AMAT (LEAPS long) because I believe there's a secular trend of increasing CapEx for semiconductor manufacturing equipment (built by the likes of AMAT) that is supported by the massive supply chain shortage plus the movement of manufacturing facilities out of countries like China, plus the metaverse, obviously. (The last factor is more psychological than anything at the moment, but it's clearly material to investors who pumped up every semiconductor manufacturer in the universe last week.) What I am not inclined to do is to gamble on AMAT earnings at this point, as the date is too close, and 90 percent of the run-up has already occurred, which leaves me to (more likely than not) be IV crushed. Plus, there are some significant negative catalysts standing between today and the earnings date. But there is a higher margin business in the same sector as AMAT that reports much later.

Synopsys owns a lot of IP in the semiconductor space, and does silicon design and verification work, silicon manufacturing design, and software security assessment/validation work. In short, SNPS does all the things one would need in an environment where AMAT and all of the other semiconductor manufacturers prosper. Good guidance and earnings reports in the coming days from the likes of AMAT and NVDA should prove a boost to SNPS stock in the days following earnings reports for AMAT and NVDA; bad news should have the opposite effect. For the reasons I state above, once I complete my own DD I am likely to run with SNPS longs that I hold through earnings (SNPS reports in December). 

&#x200B;

The same goes for the cybersecurity space, where Palo Alto Networks reports the week of 11/18, followed in a couple of weeks' time by Crowdstrike and ZScaler, which are all pure-play cybersecurity stocks. 

The point is to own/short the later-reporting stock (or options in the underlying) next week so that you benefit from the sympathetic rise/fall that occurs when the earlier-reporting company reports its earnings and guidance next week. Don't bother acquiring them this week because retail starts reporting next week and that's liable to tank everything as the numbers and guidance will be depressing from all but the most well-prepared retailers. 

Additionally, you probably don't want to own a whole lot of anything (longs) past November 9, either. Why? Inflation numbers for October get reported on 11/10 before open, and if they are anything but low AF, stocks likely will see a shock as a result. At a minimum, give it a few days before jumping back in.

P.S. If the AMAT/SNPS interplay appeals to you, NVDA's earnings report and guidance are worth watching for a similar sympathetic change. NVDA reports 11/17, the day before AMAT on 11/18. Any indication that NVDA is ramping up production, getting additional contracts for metashit, or is less dependent on cryptominers than it is on gamers will all benefit NVDA and (to a lesser extent) will pump up AMAT. But again, I think the odds of the market tanking (not a correction, but enough to cost you serious money if you are highly leveraged) after the 11/10/2021 October inflation report and/or depressing reports/guidance from retail are high enough that you should wait until closer to NVDA's earnings date to try this out."

Technical analysis indicates that now is an excellent time to buy into HIMX. As shown in the chart below, HIMX is breaking out of a four-month long decline and buying now allows an entry point that comes with low downside risk. Moreover, this break-out is occurring in November, exactly one year from the break-out that occurred last November.  Comparing the two break-outs suggests that strong gains lie ahead for HIMX.

**$10 Support Held**

HIMX has a support at $10 that has been tested multiple times this year (see chart). This support first started as a resistance (point 1), which then switched to a support that was subsequently tested six times (points 2-7). In general, the more a support is tested and holds, the stronger it gets. For example, at point 6, the support was breached and HIMX closed below $10. However, the very next trading session HIMX recovered and closed above $10. In subsequent trading sessions the $10  support was tested but not breached (point 7). If a support is breached, but subsequent trading sessions fail to confirm this breach, the support is considered to have held.  The chart shows that the $10 support has held pretty much throughout 2021.

**Downward Channel Broken**

HIMX has been in a downward channel since July 1, forming a descending flag  pattern. However, HIMX broke out of this pattern between Oct. 28 - Nov. 1, which is right where the upper channel line intersects the $10 support. A break-out at this location is not coincidental and very bullish for HIMX, especially given the strong post-earnings follow-through on Nov. 5. In fact, this break-out mirrors the start of the break-out that happened back in November 2020. Again, very bullish.

**Conclusion**

After months of decreasing prices, HIMX has formed a reversal that is turning into a strong break-out. This break-out will especially accelerate if the bears capitulate and close out their short positions. (As of October 15, the short interest is 24,652,040 shares or 14.1% of the public float.) I have already posted about the lure of HIMX’s FY-2021 dividend, which will most likely be above $1.92 per share and correspond to a 16+% forward yield. But there is one other thing to consider.  (Click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HIMX/comments/qns9ow/if_you_are_interested_in_himx_now_is_the_time_to/) to read post on dividends.)

The  market is heading into December, a time in which many investors and institutions re-balance their stock portfolios for the next year. Such re-balancing includes investors and institutions reducing their exposure to stocks that performed well but have become overextended.  The resulting profits are rotated into undervalued names. HIMX is deeply undervalued relative to virtually all other semiconductor stocks. For example, AMD and NVDA have forward PE ratios of 41.04 and 63.74,  respectively, while HIMX has a forward PE ratio of about 4.7. As such, HIMX is going to garner a lot of buying interest in December due to its ridiculously low PE, strong projected 2022 revenues, expanding 2022 margins, and mind-boggling 16+% forward yield.

The bottom line here is to get in early before HIMX really starts to move.  If Friday’s (Nov. 5) price action is any indication, investors liked  what management had to say during their earnings call (Nov. 4) and more will buy into HIMX as the word starts to spread. The technical analysis shown in the chart below indicates that now is an excellent entry point in HIMX and comes with low downside risk.

Today I am presenting an analysis on Mueller Industries, a company that even after a recent runup seems undervalued in a seemingly overvalued market.

**Mueller Industries, Inc. Ticker = (MLI)**

\----------------------------------------------

**Basic Stats:**

* $3.2B Market cap
* 0.9 P/S Ratio
* 2.92 P/B Ratio
* 8.17 P/E Ratio
* 0.003% of shares outstanding traded each day
* 33.67% increase in the past month (compared to 7.73% S&P 500)
* 0.002% of net shares bought/exercised by insiders since 8/1/2021

Mueller Industries makes a variety of products using copper, plastic, brass, and aluminum. The company’s largest segment is copper-related products, including pipes and fittings. Copper prices have increased in recent months, so some of Mueller’s recent outperformance may be related to this trend; MLI’s stock price performance in the past has been weaker in less accommodative copper markets.

The finances of the company are sound, and the company is valued at low price to book and price to earnings ratios. The company also has a relatively low amount of debt, which has decreased dramatically in recent quarters. The share price of Mueller Industries has not kept up with profit and equity growth, and this presents an opportunity to purchase the company at a relatively low valuation.

**Institutional Ownership:**

* 90.17% Institutional Ownership
* 6.93% Retail Ownership (non-insider/institutional)
* 15.5% Owned by Blackrock Inc.
* 10.6% Owned by Vanguard

Many companies, especially in the tech sector (looking at you Nvidia), have been overvalued and overhyped by retail investment. MLI’s low retail ownership and high institutional ownership demonstrates that this company is not overhyped, and this is reflected in the P/E ratio. Institutional investors likely see this company as a safe, undervalued stock due to these factors. This bodes well for the company as an investment and coupled with the recent growth and solid financials, show that this company has great potential.

qnwkfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnwkfx/intc_the_sleeping_giant/,INTC the sleeping giant,107,158,2021-11-06 17:10:16,"Hi fellow retards, been a fellow lurker for a few years now but decided to post because I recently shifted my stance on $INTC and figured I should get the full smooth-brain experience by getting roasted by my fellow apes.  

TLDR: Intel is making all the moves to hire good talent to get fabrication and R&D back on track, they have the cash to do it, and DoD has stepped in to make sure they succeed in the wake of the China scares. Moreover, Intel is moving to offer foundry to other companies, which means that it don’t matter whether your team pro AMD or NVIDIA, they will likely be manufacturing for most US companies in the next 3 years.  

I figured Intel was done for ever since they stopped making significant progress on their chip performance and neglected their foundry, and was on the AMD hype-train ever since Ryzen 2 launched. However, a lot has changed on the global stage and on Intel’s strategy which signals a new outlook for Intel in the next year. 

First of all, Intel has seen the writing on the wall. They have gotten sloppy and greedy for too long and have seen their bottom line and image hit the shitter. In response, they have started hiring the talent they need to get their foundry and R&D back on track. They recently hired [Vineet Goel](https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/intel-hires-top-amd-gpu-architect-to-lead-xe-ip-roadmap) from AMD to work on GPU architecture, and have hired a slew of [veterans and new talent](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16807/intel-continues-to-rehire-veterans-at-some-point-theyll-run-out) as part of their revamping and have finally started to [move in the right direction](https://www.pcworld.com/article/549611/intel-core-i5-12600k-review.html/amp). Intel definitely sees how they’ve lost their edge to AMD and NVIDIA and are making sure they hire the right talent to turn the tide. They also have deeper pockets than AMD and NVIDIA to make sure this happens (34.6B vs just 3.6B and 7.7B respectively). 

On the other hand, the political stage has completely shifted, and China and the US are more than just on bad footing, as the FBI officially note that . [china is “a threat to our economic security—and by extension, to our national security”](https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/the-threat-posed-by-the-chinese-government-and-the-chinese-communist-party-to-the-economic-and-national-security-of-the-united-states). As a result, the US government is currently in a race to decouple as quick as possible from china, and no decoupling is more important than that of the chip-manufacturing industry. 

There is only 1, US-based chip manufacturer, and if you’re also smooth brained, you likely know it’s INTEL. Everyone else just designs in the US and manufactures in Asia, which is an issue because the next big player, TSMC is increadibly close to getting rammed by China because china want’s to [take over Taiwan](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2021-11-03/china-clearly-developing-ability-to-invade-taiwan-top-general-says). This leaves the US government as well as the  entire private industry up in the air if and when China invades Taiwan (or even just makes shipping to/from Taiwan harder). 

You know who has deeper pockets than Intel? The DoD and they’ve basically decided that Intel has to be the leader for the sake of the entire private industry and US national security ([see here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-wins-us-project-develop-foundry-ecosystem.html#gs.f1t2zi).

Intel will be a big mover going forward because they want to win, the US government needs them to step up their game, and cash is clearly not and will not be an issue. More importantly, Intel is going to be more than just a cpu vendor, they are likely going to be the main foundry for most american chip designers like AMD, Nvidia, Apple and Qualcomm"

I see a lot of you dumping on INTC. It's a value trap, it's garbage, they missed the boat, they're dependent on TSM, they're a bunch of boomers. Fine. All that's true, but when was all that ever NOT true? And despite them missing the boat all over the place, I'd like to show you all something.

**When in doubt zoom out.**

Let's take a trip down crayon avenue.

[Mmm.... that support line. ](https://preview.redd.it/79ityv404ux71.png?width=2900&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffb4644f3f76c4836376878a3c87dcc38d61f0ad)

The big chart, that's Intel's price history since 2011.

Let's look at the red line that slopes upwards. Beginning November 19th, of 2012 and all the way to October 25th, 2021, INTC's tested its support 11-15 times (depending on what you count as testing and re-testing). Either way, every single time it's tested that support line, it's found its way back to life. EVERY TIME.

Most recently, spring of 2020 when COVID-19 reared its disgusting head.

After that, October of 2020 when COVID-19 was making another appearance with Delta.

And most recently October of 2021 when INTC had a bit of a negative earnings surprise.

All the while, $AMD's been making sweet love to the call holders out there. But you know what, AMD can only hang out with you for so long. Money's gotta go somewhere. How about NVDA? Yep, that's was a money maker galore. But it too's gone parabolic. Where else to put those sweet semi tendies?

Well, seems like a lot of the big money is putting that money into INTC.

Why? Well, take a look at the rebound off the support line.

&#x200B;

[INTC money flow has been trending downwards, except for the past week. Money flow is going back into the stock. Will it get crazy good? I'm not a fortune teller, but these charts are my tarot cards and they're looking pretty good. ](https://preview.redd.it/h70mv75o5ux71.png?width=2860&format=png&auto=webp&s=551642db068ffdcc22d840c1fcefde65120b0ddc)

I'm not going to share any other crayons than this.

You can draw your own Fib retracements from April 12th @ $68 - Oct 28th @ $47 and you'll see something like this: The levels are pristine. If INTC is truly going to rebound off the support line like its done since 2011...then things are going to look pretty good over the next couple months.

[Dammit... I drew the fib. ](https://preview.redd.it/81db3f696ux71.png?width=2870&format=png&auto=webp&s=37d239e93adcb3aca54f0a7d2fe9918d4a026174)

Positions: Boomer style.

&#x200B;

[It doesn't matter how little I have. One day I'll get this portfolio to Buick bliss. ](https://preview.redd.it/zr7j3ogp6ux71.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d58adb3eea547c604cc299f4b635fee32f2a4f6)

&#x200B;

**TL;DR: INTC long and strong like Donkey Kong.**

&#x200B;

P.S. Yes I get that INTC is ultra reliant on TSM. But guess what...those peeps are just as range bound but without any of the technical crayon momentum.

https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ql3vzm/be_careful_of_the_all_the_sudden_intc_suggestions/

Inside that post I specifically detailed exactly how AMD would eventually dominate the CPU race in energy efficiency, processing power, space, security etc.  

I know INTC is out, AMD is gaining a lot of ground, but I'm huge on energy efficiency and why want to get a head start as I think Arm with it's speed and energy efficiency is something we should investigate.  

Unlike my AMD stock post years ago I have no knowledge of Arm or M1 except using it in a macbook but it's performance blows me away while energy consumption is so low is quite the milestone.

Thanks to buying AMD under $2 and alternative currencies I no longer work so I'm looking for informed opinions for those that work in that space.

Besides owning NVDA I haven't kept up with the merger, are there national security concerns, monopoly concerns that might hold up the NVDA Arm deal?"

It’s a simple version, with many other factors to consider. But this is the general concept of how it works. There are a lot of good experts on here that can help better with strategy and technical analysis. Do not take any examples as ways to strategize. It’s just made up examples. 

Background: I’ve been trading options for over a decade and I have no financial or business background. I learned before it was popular online and I am self taught. So I’ll be explaining it the way I was able to understand it. There are better ways, but this is what helped me. I turned $1700 into $500,000 back in 2014. 


Options are basically lay aways for shares. So let’s use a house as an example. 

If you bought a house for $1M and I come and offer you $1.2M (the strike price). The catch is I have a certain amount of time to decide if I want the house. You cannot back out but I’m not obligated to buy it. So what’s in it for you? I offer you a $10,000 deposit that you get to keep no matter what happens. Now what? 


I hold a CONTRACT between us that costed $10,000 and I give myself 6 month expiration date to decide if I want it. So now I am hoping the housing market goes up above $1.2M so let’s go over a few scenarios. 

Benefit? I profit on a $1M house as if I own it even though I only paid $10,000. 

MARKET RISES
1. The housing market goes up and it’s now worth $1.4M within 3 months giving me 3 more months on the contract. So the contract is worth at least $200,000 because if I forced you to sell it (exercise). So I can go around and sell the contract to someone else and say “look I can force them to sell for $200,000 today, so give me $200,000 + $20,000 for the 3 months because it could continue to rise. So they pay $200,000 to receive $200,000 in equity and $20,000 premium because the contract still has more time. Meaning if the housing market goes up to 1.5M The new owner of the contract can now exercise the contract (option) and profit $80,000 or 4X their investment. 

 MARKET DIPS
2. The housing market dips and the house is now worth $800,000. I would owe you $1.2M so I just wait the 6 months and hope it rises or I sell my contract $10,000 at a loss maybe like $3,000 to someone else hoping it jumps back up. Worse case if the time comes to an end i lose $10,000. 

MARKET RISES BUT NOT MUCH. 
1. You do not have to hit the price you bet to earn money. So if the market hits $1.1M within 1 month since there is 5 months left. I can sell the contract to someone else for more now thst it’s more likely to happen. So I can get $20,000 even though it didn’t go over $1.2M. I’m selling the contract to someone else and letting them hope it goes up. 

Now translating to stocks. 

1 option or contract is 100 shares per contract. 

So if you buy 6 contracts for apple to hit $300 you have 600 shares on hold for you. Every dollar above $300 you earn $600. Because you only owe the owner $300 so everything above is yours. 


So your call is you betting it goes up, and if you do a put, you are betting it goes down. Either way you will only ever lose the initial deposit or purchase price of the contract. 

Stock example I bet Nvidia will hit $360 by feb22 so I needed to pay the owner $15 per share as a down payment. So it was $1500 for the 1 option. Now the closer it gets to the price I said it would hit the price of the contract goes up because it’s now more likely to happen. 

So for example if I said your house will hit $2M by 3 months you wouldn’t believe it would happen so you would accept a lower deposit say $1000 now imagine something happens and 1 week later your house jumps to $1.4M. Since it’s more likely to happen I could sell the contract to someone else for $2500 because it’s not as crazy and I’ve made 150% in 2 weeks. 

You don’t hold a contract till the date, you flip the contract to someone else when you make money on the deposit. 

How are they priced? The crazier your bet the cheaper it is. Tesla at $2000 within 2 months is probably impossible so it would be cheap. Tesla at $2000 by 2024 is more likely so it would cost more. 

I turned $1700 into $500,000 from options at 19 back in 2014. But I’ve also lost $100,000 in a day when fedex dipped when gas was low because they buy gas in 6 month intervals. So their earnings were low and the stock dipped. With not that much time left I lost it all. So if it’s your first time, give your self some time in the expiration date . So be careful."

Sup. Made some gains in the past two weeks.  


It all started when I heard about the Gamestop fiasco. I pretty much started investing after the larger squeeze, so as you can imagine, I ended up bagholding and lost money. Now, after discovering options, I became slightly addicted and lost around 30k over the course of the year, transferring little by little from my bank account to RH. Pic related.

Now, I am down to my last 4.4k, what do I do with it? I gamble it on options of course! Little did I know, Hertz made an announcement to purchase Tesla vehicles. I just woke up to go to work and seen Tesla was rising. Here's the purchase and sells for that.

Shit man! I had some fucking money! I made all my losses back plus an extra 10k or so. I finally accomplished something in my life! Why would I want it to end there though? I want more. So much more.  


Nvidia and SPY have been doing great as well so I started to buy calls for those as well.

Golly gee! I'm high on a rush of gambling so I needed to continue. This put me at about 60k or so total. I took profit where I could and thats the way you should always play it.

It's not enough though. We gotta keep going don't we? It's NVIDIA time!

I am just blown away. If it wasn't for WSB, shitposting, losing money, I would never have made this achievement. Can't forgot JPow either. Thanks!  


p.s. My current positions remaining are 100 310c 11/5 (down 64k) and 13 300c 11/5 (put 200 order in but didnt fill) I also am still holding SPY 400 266c 11/5.  
So, in 14 days, I raised my account by 680,000 for a 17,250% gain since Oct 5.

In between all of these options I did place some which either made so little difference or even lost money but overall I felt it didn't matter to put them in. Yes I couldve held some of the earlier ones longer for a way bigger profit, but sometimes you gotta take what you got and work with it."

My mistake was that I didn't buy back those options when it was clear that the Fed was going to be dovish.

Despite this, their mcap is $2.3B as of writing (so a revenue multiplier of 1.2x). This got me thinking, in a market where NVDA mcap trades at \~40x revenue, AMD trades at about \~14x revenue, TSLA trades at about \~25x revenue, and even INTC (which is widely considered lately to be a bit floppy when compared to their rivals) trades at 3x revenue - then this suggests that a few more good years and the market might be willing to let the price climb to a higher multiplier - all CRSR have to do is keep making money. LOGI who are probably their closest rival in the peripherals space trade at about 3x.

It's a similar story when you look at P/E ratios. LOGI/CRSR/INTC are sat around the 10-15 mark, but many other tech and PC orientated stocks are trading on ratios *way* higher than this.

Not only this, but this stock is being held about 33% short - which is significant in comparison to the other stocks mentioned above (who are all less than 10%). That's probably because CRSR is a relative newcomer to the market more than anything, but it could also just be because the hedge fund managers don't understand that it's a really well established brand in the markets it plays in.

With DDR5 on the horizon, sales in components still probably being depressed as the GPU availability and price situation hasn't yet calmed down (so many of their customers are poised to buy a new system, but haven't yet committed to it), and with the ever increasing popularity of gaming and streaming, I can't see that they are going to lose customers/revenue - and if anything as the GPU situation sorts itself out and with DDR5 becoming the latest RAM standard, I can only see sales in m.2 drives and RAM increasing. Further to this they are entering the monitors arena with a strong ""gamer"" brand that can command good prices/margin.

So immediate short term (heading to FY results) this stock could potentially multi-bag. On revenue multipliers alone, I feel this should be at about the $60 mark. Especially if the GPU situation gets much better towards Christmas.

Full disclosure, I have a small holding. I just really like this stock."
ql3vzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ql3vzm/be_careful_of_the_all_the_sudden_intc_suggestions/,Be careful of the all the sudden INTC suggestions on the sub Investing,58,73,2021-11-02 21:11:27,"I hold no position of INTC long or short just a person who used to reverse engineer this stuff, and then worked in a datacenter for many years.  

There has been a noticeable amount of INTC posts but non of these delve into their technical shortfalls compared to their competitors AMD NVDA TSM ARM etc

I wrote this many years ago https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/

and the gap in technology is even bigger in AMD's favor.  Since 2016 I've been super bullish on AMD at $1.80, cloud computing stocks MSFT AMZN, energy stocks like TSLA etc. 

If you've ever been in a datacenter it consumes a ton of energy and why I think the future of computing is AMD NVDA TSM ARM MSFT AMZN  and energy efficiency stocks.  

INTC lacks this and is falling way behind in tech and design, still far behind and I literally called it years ago almost on the dot.   

Other users have noticed this too

https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qkihov/intc_cluster_buy_by_510_directors_and_ceo/hiwxuit/

My post pointing out that since 2016 AMD NVDA TSM have been superior in design efficiency and stock price was promptly deleted on that sub.  I reminded them that since 2016 AMD price has increased close to 6800%, NVDA 3400%, TSM 500%, cloud computing has taken off and MSFT is up 600% AMZN 500%.

Intel is gone up maybe 30% in the biggest stock run and semiconductor/cloud computing run in 5-6 years.  Abysmal compared to every semi stock.

So be weary of INTC suggestions.  Not saying you can't make money it is up 30% in 5-6 years but there are way better investments and the opportunity costs of missing out better tech like AMD NVDA TSM MSFT AMZN etc."

**GFS - The Sisyphean AMD child**

**Who is GFS:**

GlobalFoundries Inc. (GF or GloFo) is a multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company incorporated in the Cayman Islands and headquartered in Malta, New York. Created by the divestiture of the manufacturing arm of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), the company is privately owned by Mubadala Investment Company, the sovereign wealth fund of the United Arab Emirates.

The company manufactures chips designed for markets such as mobility, automotive, computing and wired connectivity, consumer internet of things (IoT) and industrial.

As of 2021, GlobalFoundries is the fourth-largest semiconductor manufacturer; it produces chips for more than 7% of the $86 billion semiconductor manufacturing services industry. It is the only one with operations in Singapore, the European Union, and the United States: one 200 mm and one 300 mm fabrication plant in Singapore; one 300 mm plant in Dresden, Germany; one 200 mm plant in Burlington, Vermont (where it is the largest private employer) and two 300 mm plants in the State of New York: one in East Fishkill and one in Malta.

In 2019, Thomas Caulfield, the chief executive officer (CEO), said GlobalFoundries plans to become a publicly traded company in 2022. In 2021, the company submitted an initial public offering (IPO) filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 

**AMD Spin Off:**

* In 2008, AMD decided to spin off its fabrication division in a move to leverage its competitive advantage in the microprocessing side of the Chip industry. This would give AMD a much needed cash infusion and freedom to solely focus on the side of the business that was actually working, a situation that was necessary for the struggling stock at the time. 
* After the spin off, AMD would own 34% of the manufacturing company with 66% belonging to Advanced Technology Investment Company (ATIC), a subsidiary of the Mubadala Investment Company. 
* AMD would hold the right and plan to taper off the ownership of the company over time.
* AMD would also be transferring 1.2Billion in debt to the newly formed company. 
* By 2012, AMD was fully divested from Global Foundries.

**Global Foundries:**

* On March 4, 2009 Global Foundries(GFS) was officially announced. 
* GFS primary business is its Foundry business. Understanding the Foundry side of the semiconductor industry is important as it will give an important insight to its position in the market. If we think of chip manufacturing like photography, AMD/Intel/NVidia would be the photographers and GFS would be the print shop. These companies design the chips and GFS manufactures them.
* GFS has tried to compete in the designing of chips on many occasions and has failed every time. 
* As of 2015, the firm owned ten fabrication plants. fabrication 1 is in Dresden, Germany. Fabs 2 through 7 are in Singapore. Fabs 8 through 10 are in the northeast United States. These sites are supported by a global network of R&D, design enablement, and customer support in Singapore, China, Taiwan, Japan, India, the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. In February 2017, the company announced a new 300 fabrication \[fabrication 11\] in China for growing semiconductor market in China.
* In 2016, GlobalFoundries licensed the 14 nm 14LPP FinFET process from Samsung Electronics. In 2018, GlobalFoundries developed the 12 nm 12LP node based on Samsung's 14 nm 14LPP process.
* On August 27, 2018, GlobalFoundries announced it had cancelled their 7nm process due to a strategy shift to focus on specialized processes instead of leading edge performance.
* On January 29, 2019, AMD announced an amended wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries. AMD now has full flexibility for wafer purchases from any foundry at 7 nm or beyond. AMD and GlobalFoundries agreed to commitments and pricing at 12 nm for 2019 through 2021.
* On May 20, 2019, Marvell Technology Group announced it would acquire Avera Semi from GlobalFoundries for $650 million and potentially an additional $90 million. Avera Semi was GlobalFoundries' ASIC Solutions division, which had been a part of IBM's semiconductor manufacturing business. On February 1, 2019, GlobalFoundries announced the $236 million sale of its fabrication 3E in Tampines, Singapore, to Vanguard International Semiconductor (VIS) as part of their plan to exit the MEMS business by December 31, 2019. on April 22, 2019, GlobalFoundries announced the $430 million sale of their fabrication 10 in East Fishkill, New York, to ON Semiconductor. 
* In May 2020, GlobalFoundries stated it was fully abandoning its plans of opening fabrication 11 in Chengdu, China due to reported rivalry between the latter and the US.\[30\] This was three years after the manufacturer announced it would invest $10 billion to open the new fab; the fabrication was never brought online.\[31\]

**Bear Case:**

* GFS IPO is an exit strategy for the majority shareholder ATIC, which has proved to be a Sysphean for the fund. (https://semianalysis.com/globalfoundries-gfs-ipo-mubadala-lost-over-22-4b-now-they-are-hoping-public-markets-bail-them-out/)
* GFS has wasted billions on failed ventures(fabrication 11, 7nm) while its competitors have had no issues in their ventures in the same field. 
* AMD is and was their largest customer, but they have been rapidly declining.
* TSM, MU and NXP all are taking a large stake in the fabrication industry.
* The timing of the IPO is to capitalize on inflated market, inflated semi conductor reliance, and looming self-confidence in GFS.   
* Gross profit of the last three years have been a net loss, and has increased negatively by 58% (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001709048/000119312521290644/d192411df1.htm)

**Subjective Bear Case:**

* A bit of context, I worked as an intern at GFS at their HQ. 
* They had 3 MULTI million $ accidents while I was there. One caused by a hardware technician accidentally pressing an emergency stop button during an etching process. When these processes are stopped for ANY reason, the wafers being processed are as good as garbage. Semiconductor manufacturing is incredibly expensive, time consuming, and if a wafer is not PERFECT on a nano scale, the wafer is rendered useless. 
* The building was beautiful, this might sound like a pro but let me explain why it is a con. GFS has never been in a financial situation where they are able to spend the amount of money that they spent on their office. There were at least 60-80 meeting rooms JUST for engineers and in every single room there were 82inch flat screen HD monitors. There were “to go” chrome books on every corner where if you needed an extra laptop for any reason, you could just grab it. Everyone, even the janitors, were given company laptops, phones, backpacks, etc that were updated every year. 
* Because of the international importance of semiconductors and limited pool of talent, diversity among engineers is an understatement. The amount of engineers I would be in contact with on a daily basis that didn’t speak english/spoke really broken english was quite literally counterproductive. There were times I had to have people from my team come with me to someone else’s desk so they could translate for me.
* They had a soccer field in the back of the site where they would PAY the employees to partake in - again, definitely a pro but a con in regards to finances. 
* All of this spending while being in a financially rough spot screams to me money hemorrhaging at the management level. 

**Bull Case:**

* The IPO will give GFS a needed cash infusion to leverage itself as a top contender in the fabrication industry.
* Deepening relationships(straight from SEC prospectus) could mean long term contracts with their clients which would mean more stable revenue for the following years. 
* Inflated market, semiconductor prices, and needs of chips means higher revenue and profits for GFS. Due to an increase in need also means customers will be much more willing to work with GFS if they can compete with TSM, MU etc or their competitors don’t have the bandwidth to meet customer demand. 
* Loss from operations has decreased over the last three years(delta of 34%) and compared to last year is a fraction of what it was. 
* Loss per share is almost 14% of what it was compared to 2018(-4.7 vs -.6) 

**Conclusion and Summary:**

I wish I could’ve had a more quantitative approach to this post but almost all of the data can be seen at the SEC filing so I will let you guys do the calculations you want to know. I also believe that the qualitative information surrounding GFS is far more interesting than the numbers currently. These are incredibly dynamic times for the semiconductor industry, so the numbers used in the SEC filing are not fully representative of the future of the company. I am interested to see what happens AFTER IPO. Overall, I am net bearish on GFS but I do hold a part of me that believes they could leverage this cash infusion in their benefit. The semiconductor industry will/has seen a massive explosion that will keep exploding for some time."

Well, it’s now the largest company in the world.

The AAPL cult is now not so vocal, because it has matured. 

DIS cult, Nintendo cult etc have made their companies huge players in their respective industries. Now they are just dormant.

Let's come back to some present day cults. AMD, Valve(private company) and NVDA are the biggest pc gaming related cults that are out there. Go to r/pcmasterrace or other similar places, the cult vibe is relentless and unending. Their only position being: INTC and Epic(private company) bad. AMD, NVDA, Valve daddies good.

And look at the stock price of AMD and NVDA!! They speak volume of the power of that cult!

Of course, PTON the workout cult is also a good example to showcase this example or NKE.

Cult stocks generally have higher valuation relative to their peers or their valuation may even be nonsensical.

I am kinda a AMD cult person(indoctrinated by the pcmasterrace cult), but let me demonstrate the valuation difference by comparing AMD and INTC.

AMD has almost 73% market cap of INTC. This would indicate that ultimately AMD would have 73% of the discounted free cash flow of INTC. Is that likely? Hell no.😂
INTC is much more diversified and has almost 6 times more revenue than AMD and even the most optimistic projections won't make that prediction.

But does that mean INTC will keep a larger market cap than AMD within 1 or 2 year? No, I think the opposite will happen, AMD will surpass INTC in market cap regardless of fundamentals.

It’s supply and demand. Cult followers not just buy their product, but also the stock (I think).

Also, there are cults surrounding GME, AMC stocks and if those cults are long lasting, well, elevated valuation is highly likely.


Now, let us talk about the current biggest cult of all. TSLA. Need I say anything?
If the cult is to be believed, TSLA will have 3 trillion in robotaxi, solar energy and other revenues within 2025 or something. 
(I am not saying you shouldn’t buy TSLA, my whole post is about showing the power of cult)

As long as there is a cult which has buying power and buys the product+stock, the stock would reward one handsomely.

With all that prologue, I have recently started browsing some online discussion circles, and I think DWAC is a similar big cult in the making. They have a huge portion of the populace by the balls as potential customers and regardless of what their product is, if the cult has staying power (which I believe it does), the product would hardly matter.

TL;DR: Invest in cult. Invest in DWAC and other similar cults.


Edit: I haven't mentioned some cults as I don't wanna get banned(cry ptos, tell me what value they actually produce), other cults could include companies like LULU or Yeti. And my original intention was to see some other tickers that have similar cult vibes, looks like the discussion just became too focused on a single ticker."

What's poppin' bull gang, hope you’re all doing well! Our free money glitch remained unpatched for another update, allowing many of us to pull clean double baggers across the board. God bless $SNAP. With all of big tech set to report this week, it could prove to be more lucrative than the last. We’ve got a large variety of trades we can make this week ranging from educated gambles, to good old fashioned theta plays. We’ve even have a couple of opportunities to sprinkle in some collateral plays if we wish! Let’s get into it!

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Jetblue is inefficiently priced.** Historically Jetblue moves roughly **4%** post earnings (inline with all the other American airlines),  yet this quarter, the options are pricing in a move of roughly **10%**. If we sell straddles or strangles, we can collect this extremely inflated premium with very little risk on our end. I looked into the entire sector as a whole since I planned on trading it last week, and I came across nothing that would’ve fundamentally caused this spike in volatility in airlines, or Jetblue specifically. The odds are awesome on this trade, and I plan or robbing some gamblers next week. For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)

&nbsp;

- **Twitter is inefficiently priced. Avoid it.** Historical move of **6.5%**, priced move of **11%** - on paper, this trade gives us insane edge, but I’m still not touching it, as we saw what happened with $SNAP on Thursday. Although Twitter dropped 5% as the market tried to price $AAPL’s privacy policy in, I don’t feel like taking on additional risk because the fundamentals have shifted right before its’ earnings. Normally I would take this trade 10/10 times simply from a pure numbers standpoint, but I’m not as confident anymore because of the added volatility created by $SNAP. 

&nbsp;

- **Oil stocks tend to experience Post Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD).** PEAD is the phenomenon where a stocks price will drift in the direction of an earnings surprise for several weeks following an earnings announcement. If a stock beats, it will continue to grind up for weeks following the ER report, and vice versa if it misses. This is especially true among oil stocks - check the charts if you don’t believe me. The best way to play oil this quarter would be to capitalize on this effect, and do **monthly** call or put debit spreads based on the results that come out Friday. To those curious, standard weekly options provide no edge at the time of writing, so it’s best not to gamble this time round.

&nbsp;

- **Collateral Plays are your friend!** If you’re bullish on big tech, look to long $QQQ this week to alter your risk exposure and bag some safer gains. If you’re bearish on oil, look to short $XLE instead of any of the individual companies for an added safety net. If you think $AMD is gonna knock it out of the park, look to play $NVDA or $SOXL instead. There’s lot’s of opportunities for collateral plays this week, and I’ve just barely scratched the surface. If you wish to learn more about collateral plays, refer to [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

#Summary and Conclusion

We've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly!  If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you’d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**"

Blackberry is already in 24/25 top EV cars. Analyst that work for Candian banks have tried to knock down the stock price for 8 years claiming it's going bankrupt or whatever. I believe they don't understand what the future is and how Blackberry plays a critical role in enabling it. Connected future and cities require high security and safety and that's what blackberry provides.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, hope you're ready for week two of earnings! This week is jam packed with companies reporting within highly volatile sectors, the most notable being steel and airlines, so keep an eye out for those! Alongside those, we've got a handful of boomer blue-chips pulling through, as well as the Netflix, who got relegated from FAANG in favour of Nvidia. There's a lot of money to be made this week, especially with [*collateral plays*](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays), so make sure you've brushed up on those concepts if you haven't already! Let's get into it.

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Snapchat is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $SNAP has had an average post earnings move of **17%**. At the time of writing, the options chain is pricing in a move of only **10%**. This priced move will ***shrink*** as we progress through the week since theta will decay the contracts, meaning we’ll likely have a priced move closer to **8%** the day before the ER. Snapchat has ***never*** moved less than 6% post earnings since IPO, meaning that If you're gambling on this one, the odds are really in your favour. 6% minimum historical move, 17% average move, 8% priced move - The risk reward profile of this trade almost seems too good to be true. We ran this exact trade last quarter and made a huge bag, so I’m really hoping we get to abuse this free money glitch again come Thursday. 

&nbsp;

- **Netflix is inefficiently priced.** Same deal as $SNAP, just not as good. Netflix usually moves 8%, but options are only pricing in 5%. I don’t like this play as much as $SNAP since a straddle will run you over three grand, and that’s not exactly gambling money. Regardless, those with huge accounts and even bigger balls may opt to run this trade.

&nbsp;

- **Airline stocks aren’t priced properly (yet).** Delta Airlines tanked 5% post ER last week, resulting in the rest of the airlines also tanking 5%. $DAL closed the week down 6%, while the rest of the airlines recovered, ultimately closing out the week flat / slightly negative. This indicates to me that airlines aren’t priced properly at all - Delta had an amazing ER and put out some banger numbers, but tanked despite that due to the concerns in rising fuel prices. Rising fuel prices will end up plaguing ***all airlines***, not just $DAL exclusively, meaning that unless the airlines put up mind-blowing numbers (which are also better than the insane numbers $DAL put up), **a downward move is likely imminent.** I’m genuinely shocked that the other airline stocks recovered throughout the week despite the headwinds they’ll all inevitably face during their ERs this week. Keep in mind, this analysis is made void if airlines slip throughout the week going into earnings as market re-prices them. I could be entirely wrong about this move - we’ve seen time and time again that the market is extremely irrational.

&nbsp;

- **Collateral Plays are your friend!** As displayed by the airlines last week (and hopefully later this week), stocks within the same sector tend to move together. If we’re bullish or bearish on airlines, we can look to long or short $JETS, as almost all of its holding report earnings this week. The IV on $JETS is half that of the reporting tickers, meaning we’ll get huge gains on a relatively small move. Most of the steel sector also reports this week! We can look to long or short the entirety of steel earnings by playing $X or $MT since we’ll see a comparable move in those tickers as well, but won’t get IV crushed. More information on these types of plays can be found [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

#Summary and Conclusion

We've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them this week, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you’d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**"

You may notice the rise in all stocks generally.

Tech stocks such as NVDA and AMD is what i am watching right now.

NVDA up 2.8% and AMD up 2.5% meanwhile, TSM is only up 2.3%

No real news reported to make NVDA and AMD rise. TSM reported better than expected earnings and they lack behind the rest of the sector.

I believe TSM will gain market share in the following weeks due to its trading pattern. I believe we may see this touching $130 - $140 range in the next few weeks.

Here is a comparison between Walgreens today and TSM today. I believe we will see the same thing soon.

People do not realize, TSM is known for manufacturing the high tech Semiconductors for things such as your cell phone and Apple watches.

TSM had reported a 20% increase in the chips due to the shortage in the auto sector.

With a annual dividend payment of $1.87 yearly, solid future. I would not be surprised if this becomes a 1 trillion dollar company.

Building new factories in Arizona, and finding an agreement to build another on in Japan with Sony. This appears to be a solid lifetime stock.

&#x200B;

I hold 300 shares and 340 calls at $115 strike for next friday.

Google + Qualcomm partnership is huge.,1232,254,2021-10-14 08:42:43,"As you know, BB moved up 5% (50 cents) today on news that they have partnered with Google and Qualcomm. You're probably surprised it went up because it always goes down on news.

This news is different. This news is huge.

Everyone was quick to jump to the conclusion that Ford had dropped BB entirely from their cars in favour of Google: [https://www.obj.ca/article/techopia/ford-drops-blackberry-qnx-infotainment-platform-inks-deal-google](https://www.obj.ca/article/techopia/ford-drops-blackberry-qnx-infotainment-platform-inks-deal-google)

Well, the Google and Qualcomm news pretty much puts that assumption to bed. Not only will BB still be in Ford cars, any car that is built using both Android's infotainment and Qualcomm's chips, will need BB tech.

We have Google, Amazon, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Baidu, etc. etc. on our side. We have a patent sale that could be worth 1 billion+ coming no longer than 2 months from now. And we have Blackberry IVY slated to release this month.

Please stop throwing current revenue numbers at me when this thing is going to pump revenue out like crazy in the future. Stop focusing so much on their past. Stop focusing on how paperhands rule this stock. I don't see a company out there that has this many positive things going for it with a 5 billion dollar market cap.

If the stock market is forward thinking, why not BB?

This is a market that is only expected to keep growing! CRSR just started getting in to the camera business. As you and I know, streaming is a growing business and CRSR is a dominant player taking marketshare from competitors. 

\-Corsair Gaming (CRSR) reported 2nd Quarter June 2021 earnings of $0.33 per share on revenue of $472.9 million. This represents about a 22% increase from last year despite the economy reopening!

\-Zacks Consensus Estimates expect earnings of $1.82 per share and revenue of $2.08 billion. These totals would mark changes of +13.75% and +22.19%, respectively, from last year.

\-Digging into valuation, CRSR currently has a Forward P/E ratio of around 15. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 23.03.

\-CRSR recently refinanced their debt, meaning they will pay a lower interest rate increasing their earnings per share.

\-CRSR has also commited to paying down its debt strengthening its balance sheet.

\-The company said it continues to expect 2021 revenue of $1.90 billion to $2.10 billion. The current consensus revenue estimate is $2.02 billion for the year ending December 31, 2021.

Since this stock has been beaten down lately, this is a great entry point in my opinion. Not financial advice I'm just an ape. I have 6500 shares at 27.70 per share.

​​4 ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:

* Transition from wet to dry etching
* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production
* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process
* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams

**Technical Analysis**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9brk0w620oo71.png?width=2668&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e9e48b60a203a512e916039a142c8f77362a176

Looking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.

**Conclusion**

The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out high dividends (\~1.56% annually) but does re-invest that money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.

Today aunt Yellen, wrote a big, bold and beautiful letter again to Pelosi warning her to close here long NVDA and big tech plays and buy some Puts.  She even reminded members of congress of what happened in 2011 as some of them are old members who are forgetful.

As history always rhymes in the stock market, markets will definitely sell off because our leaders are trying to get bipartisan support when they cannot even get there own party members to vote for it.

Well, I guess, none of you. However, 3.7 billion people do not have any access to the Internet; poor dudes no porn, and no YouTube. Well, guess what, one company will make money anyway when these guys get access to the internet, and **I am not talking about PornHub, it is Nvidia!**

Nvidia is developing very quickly its chips for data centers and eats Intel's market share every day. Here is why, if you are not a retarded living in a cave, you should buy Nvidia (NVDA). 

# Crazy quarterly results: 

Last quarter's results were monstrous, **bears go back in your cave!**

* Revenues: $6.51 billion versus $6.33 billion expected (dumb-ass analysts were not even close). 
* Revenue growth:  68% annually after a growth of 84% last quarter (get the rocket ready). 
* Adjusted earnings: $1.04, versus $1.01 expected (analysts cannot grasp how much money it makes).

**Dude, have you ever seen a company with such growth?** In comparison, Facebook with its 39% % growth year-over-year looks like a boomer company.  

&#x200B;

**Here is why Nvidia is a cash cow for the coming years:**

# Why you will make money in 1 year:

· Graphic cards (current biggest segment): **growth of 87%** to $3.91 billion. This is crazy growth, and the current valuation seems not to fully consider such growth, especially considering that it is the biggest segment of Nvidia. Nvidia has a PE of 79, it may look big, but Amazon (AMZN) has a PE of 59 and growth is tiny in comparison. Square (SQ) has a PE of more than 200.

# Why you will make money in 3 years: 

· Compute and network segment (chips for data centers): growth of 46% to $2.6 billion. This is crazy growth for a normal company, but it is not sufficient for Nvidia. However, the future looks sexy.

· Data are the future and companies are building data centers all the time. If Amazon invests so heavily in AWS, it is because the cloud is the future! Well, the more Amazon spends on the cloud, the more money Nvidia makes. **Demand for Nvidia chips is exploding**, especially when considering that they are way better than the one from Intel (boomers go home). The cake and the slice of the cake are growing for Nvidia and I will eat the cake as I am a shareholder!

# Why you will make money in 5 years:

· Professional use: Industry will progressively get more automated and therefore needs more chips. Annually graphics cards for high-end professional workstations **went up 156% annually** to $519 million. This growth is tremendous and proves that demand is enormous. 

· Secondly, its automotive business unit. Sales were up 37% from last year's respective quarter. This is poor growth (LOL) for Nvidia but the future looks awesome. If you think two seconds, you will realize that the future is not about EVs, the true revolution will be autonomous cars! And who will be the true winner? Tesla? No! Nio? No! Nvidia? Yeah boy, you got it! Considering the potential of this sector and how crazy people get “just” with EVs, **Nvidia will not go to the moon but through the whole universe**, once people understand the potential of this division! 

# TLDR:

Bears have been repeating that Nvidia has been too expensive for a while. They have been repeating that it is not rational for the stock to double in 12 months and blablabla. Well, if they were not retarded, they would see that they are still **tons of catalysts** and the more time passes, the more we will use Nvidia products. So bears are gay and bulls are strong! 

Position: because I do not live in a cave, I bought 50 shares, worth approximately 11,350 USD."
pjqb7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pjqb7r/the_world_is_hungry_for_chips_undervalued/,THE WORLD IS HUNGRY FOR CHIPS - Undervalued Semiconductor Play - HIMX,84,87,2021-09-08 00:19:04,"&#x200B;

**CHIIIIIPPPPPPSSSSS - NOM NOM**

Good morning ladies and gents. Lets talk about chips - semiconductors to be exact. If you have tried to purchase a car or refrigerator in the past few months you've noticed that either the price has increased or they are on backorder.

Unfortunately, everything from your car's dashboard to your dragon shaped dildo now requires a computer chip. Because of this all this, the semiconductor/chip stocks have been shooting straight up (**AMD, TSM, NVDA**). Their valuations are high, but this is rightfully so since the semiconductor shortage is theoretically going to last until 2023 according to analysts (1). This is where **HIMX** enters the building.

**HIMX** is a fabless semiconductor provider. They create a multitude of design solutions for visual displays (TV's, Laptops, mobile phones, car navigation, VR devices) as well as a whole host of additional products such as silicon IP's and LCOS micro displays for automotive HUD. The company is based in Taiwan, and has been chugging along during the pandemic, increasing their quarterly revenue growth by an impressive 95.5% yoy. It's quarterly earnings have beaten expectations during the last two quarters, but due to the China FUD and being located in Taiwan it's become risky for investors.

**BEARISH POINTS**

So let me lay out the bear case before I start pumping the bull argument. There is a legitimate fear that China will eventually completely control Taiwan and impose the same tariffs that already exist for mainland China. This would drastically hurt business with the West, from which HIMX draws a large portion of it's customer base. Taiwan's position is that as long as they keep making semiconductors, they are important to the West, and we will protect them. At the moment, that's still the case, and looks like that will continue to be the case for the next few years.

From a technical aspect this company is being shorted heavily. The put/call ratio is 1.34, the short interest on Aug 13th was 10.35%, and the short ratio everyday since Aug 13th has increased dramatically.

So if you think China doesn't plan to start WWIII, please keep reading.

**BULLISH POINTS**

The bullish argument is that you have a company creating a product that is in high demand, and will continue to be in high demand in the near future. **TSM** has raised the prices of their semiconductors by 10% within the past month, it's likely that **HIMX** will follow suit. There are two opportunities for them to make this announcement within this week: Sept 6-7th dbAccess IAA Cars Virtual Conference 2021 and Sept 6-10th 22nd Credit Suisse Asian Technology Conference (2).

When **HIMX** P/E is compared to other semiconductor stocks, it's much lower (Trailing P/E 9.94 vs. 32.55 for **TSM**). Within the past month the price action has pushed **HIMX** back down to the 200SMA, which it has been grinding along for the past week. The price action appears to be consolidating against the 200SMA which suggests a big move in either direction. According to FinTel the short borrow fee rate jumped from 0.7% to 1.86% on Sep 3rd. The number of shares available to borrow has been steadily decreasing within the past two weeks while the price has begun to stagnate. It appears HIMX is going to make a decent sized move soon, and with analysts suggesting a low PT of 19 and high 23.50, it's only a matter of time until this puppy pops (3).

This honestly leads us to wonder when the next ATH will be, when will $AAPL hit 155, 160? $AAPL reached ATH recently near $151\~ range and seems to be consolidating for now.

While looking at open interests on AAPL options today, I noticed a whopping volume of 210k for 9/17 150c volume. Are the hedgies or MM's blasting $AAPL up to new ATH soon?  Yes even though $AAPL's trading average is 70\~80M shares per day, an influx of 150 ITM calls will create 21M more shares that need to be covered. (Not including the other weeklies 150c's) That's 1/3\~1/4 of the daily average. I strongly believe that if there is a major push to $150 on $AAPL, $AAPL can finally retest ATH.

Thoughts on whether this would be a catalyst to finally pushing $AAPL out of 150\~ range?Not to mention JPOW ending tapering in early 2022: ""INFLATION IS TRANSITORY"", + iPhone 13 everything seems to be the right environment for $AAPL to finally pop off after consolidating from all that uncertainty."

With automation, AI, ML becoming more widely adopted across industries in the decade ahead, and NVDA’s strong grounding in all of the above, I am convinced NVDA will be the AAPL growth story of this generation. Please change my mind.

This post also isn't meant for those who can't read newspapers and failed to spot this:

https://www.barrons.com/articles/intel-stock-chips-defense-51629757043?siteid=yhoof2

Short story:

˝Intel said Monday it had landed a U.S. Department of Defense pact for an undisclosed sum to manufacture advanced microchips through its contract-manufacturing unit for the first phase of a broader program.˝

First phase of a broader program...

Finally somebody figured out that having most of microchips being produced on an island that China has a hard on for isn't the best idea.  

As part of governments ˝made in America˝ program Intel will invest in new factories in Arizona and expand existing capacity. 

On Taiwan they screwed over Apple and AMD and booked most of TSMC's 3nm capacity for the next year.

In Q1 2022 they will also release their new gpus. Rumors say that Intel's top of the range gpu is on par with Nvidia's 3070. 

If they manage to pull that one of and flood the market with a decent number of graphic cards - they will be flying to the moon just based on that one.  

Plus generally speaking they are swimming in cash.

Yeah I know this post is a bit gay and requires reading one linked article but I just had to post some fucking alternative to endless stream of posts about fucking BABA - a company that can be fucking delisted with one snap of Xi's fingers.

Everybody is talking about how cheap $160 BABA is and I'm just here facepalming at endless stream of people basically giving away their money to Xi. 

WISH literally just happened... Did apes learn anything? Nope they collected what remained of their bananas and are rushing to hand them over to daddy Xi...

As today Nvidia will present their fundamentals for Q2 2021, we expect a significantly grow in earnings, most likely the expectations will be crushed, as AMD did 3 weeks ago.

Corona\`s main economic impact is the increased need of electronic chips especially high computing power like GPU.

For those who don\`t know, there is an absolute chip shortage in the market right now. Auto chips, to new consoles, and any kind of electronics.

Nvidia as the current market leader in the area of GPU is expanding in all diffrent kinds of business not only gaming but as artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud computing, big data and/or the greater use of data through 5G, which is probably leading to exponential growth in those young markets.

Nvidia spent 3.92 billion U.S. dollars on research and development in their 2021 fiscal year, an increase from the 2.83 billion U.S. dollars that was spent  on R&D in 2020.

Nvidia is not only a good bet in going short, but will probably going upwards in mid and especially in long term.

Let's GO!!  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀

The fatal crash of a NIO ES8 sport-utility vehicle took place last week in China. The SUV is equipped with several driver assistance functions, including features enabled by Intel (ticker: INTC) division Mobileye, that enable some forms of autonomous driving. NIO’s driver assistance functions are called NIO Pilot and employ cameras as the so-called eyes of the car.

NIO has other autonomous-driving technology, referred to as NAD, such as radar, lidar—a laser-based radar—and camera vision, as well as computing power provided partly by Nvidia (NVDA) to process all the data points coming at the car.

The NAD features don’t appear to be available on all NIO vehicles, including the ES8. All autonomous driving systems require the driver to pay attention to the road at all times.

NIO responded to a request for comment with a Weibo post in Chinese. The post indicates the company is cooperating with police regarding the investigation.

The global automotive industry is still wrestling with regulatory and branding issues surrounding autonomous technology. Self-driving features, such as adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assistance, make driving safer as long as systems are used as intended. But drivers might rely too much on the features when systems are dubbed pilot or autopilot. Government safety regulators, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, are still drafting plans to prepare for the introduction of more advanced self-driving features.

p5r925,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p5r925/roblox_rblx_ready_for_take_off/,Roblox ($RBLX) - Ready for take off,33,67,2021-08-17 06:56:35,"First, no one cares about earnings miss in this market when it relates to tech stocks. If so, $NVDA, $AMZN, $GOOG and the like would soar to infinity beyond every earnings report but often go down after record breaking earnings. Why? Because of buying the rumor and selling the news and forward projections.

These companies are established and have to work hard to establish how they are going to continue growing at that pace, but for newer companies earnings miss are not only expected but a shakeout of weak paper hands. Remember $TSLA anyone?

So let's talk about $RBLX, who just post earnings announcement.

Here is the TLDR;

Q2 was less growth than Q1 compared to last year 🤦- well duh!?!?

Last Q2 was Apr 2020 - June 2020 which encompassed a rapid growth period for Roblox during the lockdowns.

Here's the incredibly bullish thing though - **there was growth** 🚀🚀🚀.  The bears against this suggest that it was just a pandemic play and that it faced strong headwinds because of that. Yet, despite the economy vast re-opening and $DIS exploding it's park attendance with blowout earnings, $RBLX still experienced vast growth YoY in the headwind environment. I think this will only continue to curve upwards as pandemic surge data moves out of focus. For the short-term and my tendies, the earnings call tomorrow will make a big impact whether this will print or not. The Delta variant is growing lockdown concerns again too. Either way, more lockdowns or not, $RBLX is a strong play with lots of insider buying too. There has to be something that Nancy and Cathie know. $85+ let's go 🚀🚀🚀!

What’s poppin’ bull gang, Flux here with your weekly Historical Post Earnings Moves spreadsheet! Last weeks theme was selling options, and boy did we sell! **$APPS short strangles returned close to 100%, with $BIDU following closely behind netting around 80%. Meme stocks also had muted volatility. I sold an $AMC 34 strangle for $630, and although I closed early, I was given the opportunity to close it out at the end of the week for mere pennies on the dollar. Last but not least, a long strangle on $UPST would’ve netted you a whopping 460% return!** Unfortunately for us, earnings season is slowly coming to a close, meaning the quality of our plays will be diminishing greatly! Those looking to trade this week should proceed with caution, as there isn’t much of an edge to be gained this time round. If you wish to track my trades and try them out for yourself, feel free to check out the community links on my profile! Let’s get into it.

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **This week is an awful week to play earnings.** Most companies are low quality, and don’t have historically big moves. Options are also priced properly in most cases, meaning there isn’t much edge to be gained on the buy side or the sell side. It’s literally all just gambling, and as a result I’m probably gonna sit this week out entirely. Pay little attention to the sample plays below, as I’ve only included them for inspiration, and in case anyone sees something I may have missed.

&nbsp;

- **Selling $DNUT puts may prove to be profitable.** Although justified, Krispy Kreme has been on a downtrend since its IPO. $DNUT is literally hemorrhaging money and fundamentally the company is a terrible investment. A couple of years ago they actually went private after defrauding investors, doing shady audit practices, and literally using company money to buy back stores owned by family members of the executive board for FIVE TIMES what they were worth. More info on that [here.](https://www.cfo.com/risk-compliance/2009/03/three-krispy-kreme-ex-execs-settle-sec-charges/) Nowadays, the stock is priced as what it is - a fraudulent, cash burning business. Earnings is priced to fail, and as a result, any semblance of positive news will likely send us going upwards. If you have the balls, selling puts may prove to be profitable. The 15P is going for $0.80 giving you a breakeven of around 5.5%. You can even pickup pennies in front of the steamroller and sell the 12.5P for $0.05, giving you a breakeven of 17%. Everyone is expecting $DNUT to fail, so if we get even a smidge of positive news, we’re going up.

&nbsp;

- **$CSCO options are inefficiently priced.** This is literally the only pricing inefficiency at the time of writing. Options are pricing a 2% move, while historically Cisco moves around 5%. Given that prices remain the same or get cheaper by earnings, a strangle should net you some nice profits. If you’re poor or want a binary directional play, I’d look to buy puts. $CSCO is at ATHs so we’re probably gonna do the classic “dump after earnings regardless of the outcome“ thing that everyone seems to get tricked by. Regardless, at the time of writing, $CSCO strangles give us nice edge.

&nbsp;

All that being said, there aren’t many trades to run this time round! If I notice anything extra during this week, I’ll look to keep you guys posted on my socials. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.

#Summary and Conclusion

All in all, pretty awful week for trading. Most tickers are complete garbage, and there’s little edge to be gained among those that aren’t. No shame in sitting this one out! That being said, if you see any appealing plays I’ve missed, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment! If you want access to more trading tools, or have any specific questions or observations you’d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links within the spreadsheet or on my profile. **Happy Trading! :)**"

Its last earning surprise and its great growth guidance led the price to go 30% up. Additional bullish news about MacPro is also boosting this price up with 4x higher volume.

However, we all gotta know that we always need to ""sell the news"", and ""sell the greed"" in order to make profits(especially options) because realistically, institutions and big hands have better models, connections, business relationships, and platforms which bring the fastest and newest information to them so they can take their profits out faster than one another. Most stocks are already priced in when its bullish news comes out, and I think AMD would not be an exception.

Reasons:

1. The price is already too high, Quarterly RSI:82, 40 P/E, (Remember, Nvidia is still strong enough to keep their #1 position for a while).
2. 76% owned by institutions (most of us can't buy or sell faster than them. Too risky to fight with them. That is why ""sell the news"", and ""sell the greed"" became quotes for retail investors aka ants).
3. The current market sentiment is not bullish enough. We all know that the whole market went up too much since the COVID due to low interest rate and stimulus checks. Institutions and big hands all perceive that there will be a huge correction before the end of this year, but they can't start a big sell off now because thankfully the Fed and retail investors are helping them to take little more profits before they eventually start selling off. Therefore, I think AMD's current price rise was high enough to be the peak before it drops.

As you can see by this forecasts, S&P 500 index keeps decreasing from August 2021 to January 2022, and then bouncing back from February 2022. It is just a forecast, but if the Fed says they will actually start considering about tapering in next year or something, there will be a high chance that the market goes down like this forecast values.

4. AMD needs a healthy correction before it goes up again. Every stock needs a correction in order to prevent its froth.

I hope that Bulls do not hate me by this DD because I love AMD too!

I used to kept my long position until yesterday and sold at $119 and bought some puts with a small amount.

I just want to do both ways to maximize my profits though. Indeed, I am going to buy Calls again later when it dips.

This is not a financial advice, just a DD. Thank you guys :D

Bless all you investors aka ants!!!!!!!! Let's do this!!!!!!!"

As you can see above, MC/TO ratio on NVDIA is almost 3x higher than on AMD despite AMD having higher recent growth. It is obvious that this is not the only ratio that matters and other factors come into play when pricing a stock, but AMD is an incredible growth stock and I strongly believe it will keep crushing on Turnover and closing the MC/TO gap to NVDA. Even a small increase from 9.9 to 12 would mean an additional 20% in stock price assuming current Turnover, which will be history very soon given the rapid growth.

Finally, it is important to note that NVDA is up 45% in the past 6 months vs 28% for AMD and this is mostly due to the XLNX acquisition, which brought concerns to investors. Recent numbers from XLNX have given some comfort to the market.

TL/DR: AMD still cheap. I see $150 in the horizon."

For context, AMD announced Xilinx acquisition in october last year: [https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2020-10-27-amd-to-acquire-xilinx-creating-the-industry-s-high-performance-computing](https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2020-10-27-amd-to-acquire-xilinx-creating-the-industry-s-high-performance-computing)

The acquisition is an all-stock deal, which means for every Xilinx stock you will get exactly 1.7234 of AMD stock after the merger is completed. The merger is planned to be completed by the end of the year, and it has been reiterated during 2 of the previous earning calls.

&#x200B;

# What is there to gain?

AMD stock is trading today at $112. Xilinx today is trading at $146. This means a ratio of 1.30 instead of 1.7234. Buying Xilinx you are buying AMD stocks for $85 after merger happens. This is 30% upside of free monies.

&#x200B;

# What is there to lose?

If AMD/XILINX deal doesn't go through, XLNX will most likely jump straight back to pre-merger announcement territory, it will probably end up around $110-$115.

&#x200B;

# What could stop the merger from happening?

There are several regulators that have to approve merger. Most of the important ones already did:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD\_Stock/comments/n9xnu2/regulatory\_approval\_status](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/n9xnu2/regulatory_approval_status)

However it hasn't been approved by China yet: [https://www.enterpriseai.news/2021/07/01/with-approvals-in-from-the-ec-and-the-uk-amds-35b-acquisition-of-xilinx-now-up-to-china/](https://www.enterpriseai.news/2021/07/01/with-approvals-in-from-the-ec-and-the-uk-amds-35b-acquisition-of-xilinx-now-up-to-china/)

The moment China approves the deal, Xilinx stock will jump very close to 1.7234 multiple of AMD (and possibly drag AMD down a bit, however merger approval is *good news* for AMD as well).

&#x200B;

# What are the chances China does not approve of the deal?

Of course it's a gamble with high US-China tensions, but let's take a look at some facts. In 2019 Chinese antitrust committee reviewed 465 deals. It approved all of them (!!).

[https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=1421064d-d8f4-4591-963c-d0d65999ff57](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=1421064d-d8f4-4591-963c-d0d65999ff57)

In 2020 they reviewed 458 deals. Out of all of them, they rejected a single one (DouYu merger with Huya, both Chinese companies).

[https://www.gibsondunn.com/antitrust-in-china-2020-year-in-review/](https://www.gibsondunn.com/antitrust-in-china-2020-year-in-review/)

This means only one rejection out of 923 deals!

Nvidia purchased Mellanox in 2020 and it was conditionally approved through China. This is equivalent of AMD/XLNX deal. AMD owns ATI, which was started by Chinese Canadians. Both Xilinx and AMD are US based. They already have heavy business connections with China. I'm not bold enough to estimate the odds, but the facts suggest they're quite high!

&#x200B;

# If this is such a good deal, why is nobody else buying XLNX?

They were, but had to cover their shorts! The most common way to play XLNX/AMD merger is to go short AMD and long XLNX, and that's what most investors did. However, with recent magnificient AMD run up after Q2 earnings call they were forced to cover their short positions as they became too expensive to hold till the merger. And I have proof that prices were closely correlated until very recently, let's take a look at this XLNX/AMD ratio graph: [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/upndown/viz/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio\_16114624177710/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/upndown/viz/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio_16114624177710/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio)

Up until very recently the deal was oscilating within 1.5-1.6 area and after recent AMD run up it's been lagging strongly behind. Unless there's some hidden factor major investors know about but not common folks, this is literally the best time in history to buy XLNX to convert into AMD after the merger.

TuSimple ($TSP) currently has the best autonomous truck tech and is the closest to profitable commercialization. 

[TuSimple Stock: The Driverless Truck Stock That Counts NVIDIA and Cathie Wood as Investors](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/979f72e4-7022-3f0e-a9a5-e20306d3e48e/tusimple-stock-the.html)

# Why not Robotaxis?

Robotaxis are sexier and get all the media attention. But commercialization of robotaxis currently poses several technical, operational, and business challenges. 

## Why not Robotaxis: Technical

Robotaxis are most profitable in downtown environments. But those environments also pose the greatest challenges for an autonomous vehicle due to the large number of hard-to-predict agents. No company has been able to solve those yet. 

Pick up and drop offs are also technically very challenging because, frankly, most Uber/Lyft pick up and drop offs in downtown environments are in illegal locations. Human drivers can get away with that. But a computer system cannot be programmed to perform illegal actions without the company being held responsible.

## Why not Robotaxis: Operational

With Uber or Lyft, the drivers do much more than just drive. They purchase, store, clean, fuel/charge, and maintain their vehicles. With robotaxis, all of this operational load falls to the robotaxi company. Where are they going to store thousands of vehicles in downtown environments? How are they going to charge them and perform all of the other operational tasks? Even if this problem could be solved, it means that robotaxis will scale much more slowly than Uber or Lyft did.

## Why not Robotaxis: Business

The cost of robotaxis is currently extremely high due to the compute and sensor requirements. Even if they perform perfectly, it will take a long time before they are more profitable than vehicles with human drivers.

Further, recent regulation in the US has shown that the public support is behind the drivers, not the silicon valley companies. Driving for Uber and Lyft has been a lifeline to people who lost their jobs during the pandemic. So robotaxis are going to be viewed with hostility and likely backlash from the public and thus from governments. 

# Why Trucking?

## Why Trucking: Technical

Highway driving, though higher speed, is much more structured than downtown environments. In most ways it is much easier, as evidenced by current level 2 driver assistance systems that easily handle most highway driving. It does, however, require much longer range perception. We will return to that below.

## Why Trucking: Operational

Trucks already have all of the operational infrastructure. They are stored at depots. They have dedicated staff for their cleaning, maintenance, fueling, etc. Making trucks autonomous can simply leverage all of this infrastructure.

## Why Trucking: Business

There is currently a shortage of truck drivers. Freight shippers want to ship faster (and not need to wait for drivers to sleep). Truck driving is not a fun or healthy job. It keeps people away from their families. And trucking is a $4T industry globally ($1T in the US). 

Given the long lifespan of trucks and their ability to run for millions of miles, the cost of the autonomous compute and sensor system can be amortized much better than for robotaxis.

In short, the stars are all aligned for autonomous trucks today.

# Why TuSimple? 

The players who started with robotaxis have built their entire tech stack around detailed but short range perception. Trying to convert that tech stack to trucking poses more challenges than one might expect. But since TuSimple has focused on trucking from the beginning (2015), they have built their stack to have 1000 meter perception - more than 4x other companies.

TuSimple also has been building up partnerships with the rest of the international freight ecosystem since the beginning. They have key partnerships with OEMs, Tier 1s, shipping companies, and part manufacturers in the US, Europe, and Asia. None of the other autonomous companies have that.

TuSimple is also building their Autonomous Freight Network across the US in multiple phases. Initially, only corridors with favorable weather will be autonomous. But as the technology improves to be able to handle heavy rain and snow, additional corridors can be easily flipped from manual to autonomous mode. 

## But, but, aren’t they Chinese?

They definitely have ties to China. Their first investors were Chinese. So what? 

This actually gives them an advantage vs pure US players: they have easy access to the entire trucking market in China.

# Conclusion

Given all of the above, TuSimple is undervalued with its current valuation of about $15B. Some other self-driving companies are around $30B or more, despite facing all of the challenges mentioned.

* NIO August 10th
   * Best EV company stock to own because of their nationality and the governmental support they have.
* WMT August 17th
   * Free education for their employees? How can you not love a company like that?
   * Also, since they made that decision, they must have done extremely well, right?
* NVDA August 18th
   * Still under their ATH post split, so it's just a matter of time before they start running again.
* TGT August 18th
   * Gained too much since last ER, so pass.
* TSLA August 19th
   * Biggest potential, My PT is 4k by end of 2024, and I believe it should get to $900 around the AI day.

* CRM August 24th
   * They have been gaining momentum, right?

For too long there’s been a load of DD about $CRSR on here, a lot of it is just parroting the same old points over and over again, giving only bullish sentiment and rocket emojis without any insight into the actual gaming industry.

Hopefully my DD will give you a better understanding of where $CRSR fits into the gaming market. This DD is meant to be balanced, all DD should have bearish points and bullish points imo, so this is not the DD to fuel your conformation bias, sorry, but maybe you'll get slightly aroused at certain points 🚀🚀

As for my experience - I’ve been gaming for the last 20+ years playing many different types of games. I actually have a degree in Computer & Video Games but don’t work in the sector these days. But I’m still a keen gamer and build gaming rigs, and game on PS5 as well.

I’d also like to point out from the start that I really like Corsair. I own shares and do build PCs using their components. They are not my go-to choice for every component, and i'll explain why later in this DD.

As always, this isn’t financial advice, it’s the ramblings of someone who’s spent too long scouring the internet for a 3200mhz stick of memory. I’ve also done a TL;DR at the end with nice bullet points for those knuckle-dragging retards who can’t read more than a few paragraphs at a time.

&#x200B;

# Corsair has been smashing earnings

We’ve seen this so many times before in other DDs so I won’t focus on it too much but it’s good for perspective. The rate at which Corsair has been increasing its revenue is pretty impressive.

In their Q1 2021 earnings, they reported **net revenue of $529.4 million**, which is a year-over-year **increase of 71.6%**

Their gamer and creator peripherals segment **net revenue was $175.9 million**. A huge **increase here of 131.9%**

Corsair’s gaming and components segment also grew, with a **51.9% increase to $353.5 million**.

Clearly the demand for Corsair products is there, with increasing demand, increasing revenues and profit. Most expect Corsair to beat earnings again in their Q2 report next week.

Their market share is also impressive, with (by Corsair's own claims and from research from NPD Group) a total component market share of 41.9% and about 20% for peripherals. I can’t seem to find very recent market share figures since IPO, since you need to pay for market analysis and I’m a peasant who can’t afford it, but from what I can find Corsair is:

**1st** in Keyboards

**3rd** in Mice

**4th** in Gaming headsets

**2nd** in Streaming gear

**1st** in High performance memory

**1st** in Cases

**1st** in PSUs (power supplies)

**1st** in Cooling solutions

&#x200B;

# How does Corsair fit into the gaming market?

As you probably know, the gaming market is a fucking behemoth. It’s bigger than the music and movie markets combined, and is only getting bigger.

The pandemic has further fuelled this market, with new gamers joining as they were sat around at home and needed something to do that wasn’t jacking off. So they built epic RGB gaming rigs. I think these new customers will stick around in the industry for years to come. Building a PC is a bit like smoking crack, your current rig doesn’t quite achieve the maximum FPS possible, so you’re always on the look out for the next component that will give you a slight boost, you’re always chasing that high.

The PC building market and console market vary widely in terms of generational changes. With consoles, you get a change of console generation, most people buy the new one all at the same time or within the same year or two. With PC building, gamers will be constantly upgrading bits and pieces of their rig to keep it up to date, there's no seismic generational shift like there is with consoles. It’s rare for gamers to throw an entire gaming rig away and build from fresh.

Corsair is a mid-tier component maker. Their products fit into the ‘not the cheapest, but not the most expensive’ category. This is the same in terms of quality, performance and reliability - they offer good quality products that have decent reliability and the performance is usually pretty good. In some cases, as I’ll mention later, their products are basically identical to other manufacturers. This mid-level position in the market is probably one of the reasons they make it to the number 1 spot in terms of sales for several component categories. Gamers want good bang-for-buck and decent reliability when it comes to components. They spend hours and hours researching this, and usually know exactly what they are buying, if it's a good deal, and if it's going to perform the way they want it to.

Also it's important to point out that the term *best components* is a relative and sometime subjective term. Taking price out of the equasion, the *best* component is the one that works in your rig to deliver maximum performance and not cause a bottleneck. Sometimes it's a cheaper one, sometimes it's a more expensive one.

&#x200B;

# Who is the Corsair customer?

The Corsair customer is a mid-tier (and sometimes high-tier) PC rig builder. Younger teenagers/kids often use Corsair as their marketing and branding appeals to them. They love RGB fans, and Corsair basically puts RGB in absolutely everything, these days even on RAM sticks and built into the GPU cables. Console gamers are also included in this customer base, mostly for headsets and streaming gear.

The extreme ultra-nerd PC builder who spends hours and hours pouring over spec sheets and benchmarks might not use Corsair unless there was a reason related specifically to their build like compatibility with other components, or perhaps a part was on offer at their chosen retailer. Have a look at some build guides online and a lot of the time their no-holds-barred builds often won’t include Corsair components, or only one or two. There are so many variables that go into building a PC, it’s not just a case of buy whatever components you like the look of. It all has to work together.

&#x200B;

# The misconceptions of Corsair

**The first misconception of Corsair is that their components and products are the absolute best in the industry** \- the ultimate in luxury component, the ‘Apple’ of gaming if you will.

Corsair is mostly a mid-tier component maker. Their components are good value for money, work well and are reliable but there are companies out there that make higher quality components, some that make lower quality ones and some that make pretty much identical ones.

The components market is extremely crowded, there are a lot of companies competing for the same margins on the same products: NZXT, CoolerMaster, Noctua, G.Skill, Fractal are just a few of the dozens of companies in this space. I'll go over the competitors later in this DD.

Once you start to peel back the surface of the gaming market, you’ll realise that actually a lot of these companies are pretty much the same in terms of the products they sell. In some cases the spec is almost identical and in reality some of the time it doesn’t really matter what brand of component you put in your rig (as long as its not a cheap knock-off), the performance will be roughly the same, or in many cases identical. For example, the Corsair Hydro Hxxxi series are basically the exact same products as the NZXT Kraken X series, just with a different fan arrangement, branding, exterior LED arrangement and exterior shroud.

**This leads me neatly onto my second misconception that Corsair has a massive moat.** Unfortunately it doesn’t have a huge moat against the other companies in the component space in terms of actual products that compete or compare with each other. The acquisition of Elgato was a nice move, though, and in the streaming market does give them an edge over some other competitors with an expanded product lineup. But in terms of their moat over other component manufacturers, in some cases, they don't have one at all.

**The third misconception of Corsair is that gamers have extreme brand loyalty towards specific component manufacturers.** Gamers usually want one thing when building a rig: the absolute maximum performance for their budget. Looks and RGB often come secondary to this.

While some gamers do have some brand loyalty (particularly some of the younger kids who are less experienced at building rigs) and Corsair strengths in branding and advertising help this, I don’t think there’s *extreme* brand loyalty amongst gamers who build their own rigs and have spent years doing so. I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone who exclusively built their rig with Corsair components because they specifically wanted to out of brand loyalty, except [Linus from Linus Tech Tips on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEIKFxHzzac&t=194s), which was a paid-for sponsor by Corsair.

The price is an important factor here, and in many cases gamers will just buy a stick of RAM, for example, from one manufacturer over another simply because the price is different, or the specific stick is on offer at the time they build their rig. They also might be limited to what kind of AIO cooler they can get due to the other components they are using such as the size restrictions in their case. There's a lot of variables that go into making a sale right then and there, and a lot of the time Corsair doesn't stand-out as the absolute leader in some components that warrant gamers spending the extra money if their parts are more expensive at that given moment in time.

I would say there is more brand loyalty around core components of a rig - like CPU or GPU.

&#x200B;

# Some Corsair components aren’t actually made by Corsair

Corsair doesn’t actually manufacturer all its components. Many of their products are actually OEM products, rebranded and built by another manufacturer.

Corsair AIO CPU coolers are all made by either Asetek or CoolIT.

Corsair PSUs are made by Seasonic, GreatWall, Flextronics, CWT or Chicony.

Corsair RAM have chips made by Samsung, Micron or SK Hynix.

So what does this mean? Generally it means that there is often minimal or no difference between some products that are sold under many brands within the PC component market. Gamers will often say “Look at the underlying product, rather than the brand” when comparing two almost identical products. You could compare a Seasonic PSU to a Corsair PSU, and end up finding that they are actually almost identical, and underneath it’s actually just a Seasonic PSU with a Corsair logo slapped on it.

Now this isn’t always the case, OEM rebrands are not always an identical item, the end brand may  modify the products they take from OEM before selling it to the customer. They can also request specific changes to an OEM part from the manufacturer. In some cases this can change the performance of the component, for example using different fans on an AIO cooler can cause performance increases/decreases depending on how said fans displace air through the radiator fins.

This is seen a lot with GPUs - for example Nvidia release a ‘Founders Edition’ of all their cards which is basically the standard card. Then all the GPU manufacturers such as MSI, Gigabyte, ASUS, Zotac etc will built their on shrouds and fan arrays onto the cards, with their own branding and brand-specific features. The base card and chip are always the same, but there can be slight performance differences between the cards in terms of active cooling and power consumption.

But rebranding OEM parts doesn’t mean the quality of the part is reduced, and this doesn’t seem to be the case with Corsair.

What OEM parts can do though, in the case of Corsair, is reduce its moat. For some products Corsair has little to no edge over the competition, and often if you go onto some of the PC building subreddits and compare an OEM Corsair PSU (made by Seasonic) and an actual Seasonic PSUs, most of the replies will suggest buying the Seasonic one since Seasonic are the original manufacturer. There are arguably slightly better offerings from Seasonic vs Corsair in terms of PSUs in some instances, even though the underlying product is similar, with better warrenties if something goes wrong in the future. Being the original manufacturer seems to also hold some value amongst gamers.

To further this, in some cases, you can cut out Corsair alltogether and go direct to the manufacturer to get almost the exact same product - this is the case with AIO Coolers, you can build-your-own direct from Asetek. Gamers don't usually do this, many of them probably never heard of Asetek, they are an OEM so don't really target end-consumers, their customer is companies like Corsair.

&#x200B;

# Corsair’s branding and marketing

By this point in the DD you're probably asking why Corsair has some products that have absolutely no moat, but are still best-sellers. And here is one way that Corsair shines over its competition: branding, marketing, collaboration and visability.

They sponsor eSports tournaments, give away free kit to increase exposure and work with streamers to increase brand awareness. Also just look at their website, it's head-and-shoulders above many of their competitors in terms of functionality, look and feel.

Their targeted marketing seems to be paying off. With collaborations and sponsorship with YouTubers, targeting younger audiences with their stylish, colourful branding and RGB unicorn puke, I think Corsair can continue to lead the market in terms of sales by continuing their marketing.

Corsair is not new to the gaming space, it was founded way back in 1994, so this long term pedigree in the market place definitly helps with their visability.

&#x200B;

# Corsair’s competitors

Corsair has a lot of competitors. Dozens of companies compete in the PC gaming space. Corsair is somewhat unique in the way that you can basically build an entire PC almost exclusively from Corsair components, so it doesn’t have a direct like-for-like competitor in that sense, but there are many, many competitors who compete with them for specific components.

**Logitech - Peripherals and streaming gear**  
Corsair and Logitech compete over peripherals and streaming kit. Logitech is often compared to Corsair on this sub, probably because it’s one of the only other companies relating to gaming that trades on the stock market, but they are actually pretty different companies, with different target markets and different products. While Logitech does target gamers for some products, it also has a substantial ‘productivity’ target - peripherals for people working from home or in the office, in creative fields and so on. Personally I don't find the two companies *that* comparable, but they do compete in some product lines so have added them here.

**Razer - Peripherals, cases, pre-built desktops**  
In terms of peripherals, Razer, Corsair and Logitech often compete for the top three spots on any ‘Best gaming keyboards/mice this year’ blog post. They make similarly good quality peripherals, but often where Razer falls down is their QA and longevity. They are often slightly more expensive than Corsair, many say Razer is ‘style over substance’. They also compete for the headsets portion of the console market.

Peripherals in general are very subjective, everyone has differing opinions on which one they prefer in terms of quality, usability and comfort so other than looking at sales figures, it's pretty hard to figure out which supplier produces the *best* peripherals.

In terms of their hardware, though, Razer are allegedly somewhat unreliable in that aspect, with users complaining of poor QA issues. Razer compete with Corsair for PC cases, which they offer two choices - a full sized ATX and a Mini-ATX. Recently Razer also entered the pre-built market, with the Tomahawk Gaming Desktop, a small-form-factor pre-built rig.

Razer in general are pretty expensive, targeting the high-end gamer who has money to burn. You could argue that Razer is the Apple of the gaming world, with stylish ultra-expensive laptops. Judging by user reports online though, their QA and performance doesn't quite live up to the price tag.

**Turtle Beach - Headsets**  
Corsair and Turtle Beach compete directly with gaming headsets. This is not PC specific, console gamers will also buy headsets from either of these suppliers.

Many say Turtle Beach is massively undervalued, it does trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker HEAR. Personally I find their headsets disappointing, I own one and it was expensive, not comfortable to wear, the audio quality isn’t great and has a cheap plasticy feel. That’s just my opinion though, they are a popular choice amongst many gamers.

**NZXT - Components and pre-built gaming rigs**  
I feel like NZXT is one of the closer ‘all-round’ competitors of Corsair. While they don’t sell all the products that Corsair offers, they do sell cases, AIO coolers & fans, PSUs, RGB lighting and recently motherboards (which Corsair don’t offer at all).

Their products are good quality, their cases are nicely designed, popular and easy to build in. NZXT also have started selling pre-built rigs, like Corsair, to add further revenue streams.

In my opinion NZXT could be one of the main rivals to look out for in terms of a major competitor in coming years, because they could increase their product lines to compete more directly with everything Corsair does.

In some cases, as I’ve described previously, NZXT and Corsair products are almost exactly the same. The AIOs sold by both companies are actually manufactured OEM by Asetek, with changes to the fans, exterior shroud and so on, but the underlying product is pretty similar/the same in some cases.

**Seasonic - PSUs**  
As i've mentioned elsewhere in this DD, Seasonic actually produce some of Corsair's PSUs, they are an OEM supplier. Seasonic make some of the best PSUs in the industry, in terms of quality, reliability and customer support (i.e. warrenties etc). This quality does filter down to Corsair's OEM PSU units, but many gamers will reccomend going to the original manufacturer when buying a PSU.

It's worth noting that when gamers buy a Corsair PSU, some of the money they pay for it goes directly to Seasonic (depending on model, Corsair gets its OEM PSUs from multiple suppliers depending on the model). I don't know the exact margin figures for these PSUs, so can't make a judgement on if this positive or negative (i.e. does Corsair make a tiny margin on their PSUs becuase they give the OEM manufacturer most of the money of the sale, or do they actually make better margins than manufacturing them in-house becuase it's costly to do so).

**A few other competitors in the component space**  
**Fractal Design** \- They make cases and a few AIO CPU coolers which are OEM made by Alphacool.

**CoolerMaster** \- Makes keyboard, mice, cases, AIO coolers (they are a main manufacturer), air fans, monitors.

**Noctua** \- They compete directly with Corsair in terms of air cooling. Corsair recently started offering the A500, a fan CPU cooler for those who didn’t want to use AIO cooling, but it doesn’t perform as well as many cheaper or equally priced Noctua or Deepcool competing products. In some instances a decent Noctua air cooler will outperform a Corsair AIO cooler for less money.

**G.Skill** \- Compete with Corsair on RAM. G.Skill are often used in high-end rigs, with built-in RGB, decent clock speeds and some of their sticks are ultra-low-latency for maximum performance. This RAM is quite popular at the moment, I regularly see it in build videos on YouTube.

**Crucial** \- Compete with Corsair on RAM. Crucial can be a slightly more budget choice, some of their sticks are bare, without RGB or fancy heatsinks, but their performance and reliability is good.

**Kingston, Patriot, HyperX** \- Compete with Corsair on RAM at mixed prices and performance levels.

# Revenue increases during the pandemic - a one-off?

One of the main reasons for Corsairs current sideways trading, in my opinion, is the uncertainty that has come from the pandemic.

Some analysts and investors have taken this huge revenue rise in the last year or so as a ‘one-off’ caused by the pandemic. To a certain extent, I’d argue that this is correct. The pandemic did cause a huge influx of customers into the sector in general.

The real test for Corsair here will be if they can continue to grow their revenue after the pandemic is completely over. It does look positive, with their revenue continuing to climb in their recent January 2021 earnings report. I feel that in the short-term we may see a slight slow in revenue growth, but over the long term it will continue to increase. The customers that built their first PC during the pandemic won’t go anywhere.

For that reason, Corsair is a long term hold. It’s possible we will see some sharp rises as the result of earnings announcements, for example if they absolutely obliterate the estimates to the point where no-one expected it.

&#x200B;

# How can Corsair grow?

Growth (of products, not revenue growth), is something that can hold back the share price. Many of the products Corsair sells might not see any further innovation. For example, a CPU air or AIO cooler is pretty much as good as it gets these days, it's unlikely we will see that many technological improvements in this area, so gamers have less of an incentive to upgrade. Cases is another one - you can literally keep PC cases for a decade without ever needing to change it.

For other components, however, there are more tech improvements. RAM is one of them - DDR5 memory will be coming out this year. This could offer further incentives to gamers to upgrade other components while they upgrade to DDR5 RAM. However, the changeover for RAM usually takes years, as we saw in the past with DDR4 RAM when it came out, so gamers might not all rush out to buy new sticks as soon as it comes out. Often the clock speeds on launch are often slower than later on in the generational cycle, and the prices are expensive so it's likely those top-tier gamers with high-end rigs who will upgrade their RAM at release but many mid-level gamers will wait a bit before upgrading.

Continuing doing what they are doing in terms of increasing revenue through existing product sales might not cut it in this instance. As i’ve mentioned elsewhere in this post, their moat for many products isn’t big, and in some cases non-existent, and I feel like many institutions and analysts have looked at this during their research, and it's made them uneasy. Future mergers and acquisitions could be the key. They’ve already acquired Elgato, which gave them a foothold in the streaming market, and acquired Origin to be able to sell pre-built rigs.

They also released the Corsair One a few years ago, a pre-build compact workstation/gaming PC. It has had a pretty decent reception from some of the online reviews. Although most PC custom builders turn up their noses at pre-builts, and yes you can build a superior performing rig yourself, they have a place in the market in my opinion.

There are plenty of gamers out there who want a decent gaming PC that's simple, compact, good looking and high performing, but don't want the hassle of learning about all the components and figuring out how to put it together. They also want the warranty that comes with a pre-built, and the ease and peace-of-mind that comes with sending it back to Corsair if it breaks. Corsair seem to have a pretty decent returns policy regarding this too - they will pay for the courier service both ways, you can drop it into a physical repair center and will even send you fresh packaging if you threw yours away when you bought the rig initially.

&#x200B;

# The elephant in the room

Yep, the elephant in the room is EagleTree. EagleTree Capital is the major shareholder of Corsair, and has helped them grow for the last 4 years or so. At one point they held over 60% of the shares of the company, and in recent months have been selling off sizable chunks of their position.

Obviously this probably isn't good for short term rises in share price, we could see them sell off larger chunks of their position in the coming months. The flip-side of this is that it could just be scheduled profit taking, and may not effect the share price whatsoever.

&#x200B;

# You can do your research on $CRSR here on Reddit

We are somewhat blessed to literally have a shit ton of customer insight right here on reddit, something we don't often get. There are several PC building and gaming subs that have millions of members who regularly discuss, at length, the pros and cons of every component and brand imaginable. Here are some of the biggest subreddits: r/gaming r/pcmasterrace r/buildapc r/battlestations r/Corsair r/Games r/pcgaming

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

**Bullish points**

* Excellent revenue and profit growth. The fundamentals are super strong.
* Earnings are expected to grow a further 21% in the coming year.
* Proactive expansion into new sectors such as streaming (which will likely grow in the future) and pre-built PCs
* Wide range of good quality, reasonably priced products, many of which are best sellers within the market.
* Strong marketing and branding that increases exposure and visability of their products globally.
* Did extremely well during the pandemic, increasing its customer base.
* In terms of financial fundamentals, very undervalued at the moment.
* The video games industry in general is only going to increase in size and revenue, and streaming will likely increase with it.
* In terms of share price, there’s decent support at this level.
* New generations of products entering the market could be beneficial to Corsair - for example DDR5 memory is just around the corner. This can have knock-on positivity for Corsair in that if gamers want to upgrade to DDR5 RAM, they might need/want to upgrade other components too.

&#x200B;

**Bearish points**

* Some suggest their recent revenue spurts are a ‘one-off’ due to the pandemic. We could see a reduction or slow in revenues in the coming months/years. The uncertainty surrounding the return to ‘normality’ after the pandemic could make investors hesitent to invest.
* Many of their products are almost identical to others from competitors in the same market, the moat in some cases isn’t significant or even existent.
* EagleTree dumping shares could have an effect on share price.
* The margins on many products in the sector are quite small.
* For some products, there’s a level of innovation that might not be improved upon. A fan is a fan, and that’s it. There’s no growth in some specific lines of products to obtain sales from users ‘upgrading’ when there’s nothing to upgrade to.
* The PC components market is exceptionally crowded.
* Corsair has a fair amount of debt, although it is well covered by operating cashflow.

&#x200B;

# Conclusion

As I said at the start of this DD, I really like Corsair. They are a well run company, with incredible revenue growth, solid fundamentals, decent products and a good foothold in the market.

Personally I don't buy the whole 'the pandemic is a one-off' take. We've already seen a continuation in revenue growth into 2021, even after lockdown restrictions are reduced or lifted, so I feel they will continue to make bank. While we might see a slight slow, overall Corsair will just keep growing in terms of revenue and profit. It will grow with the continuously growing gaming industry.

I feel like this is a long term play with somewhat short term uncertainty. But I feel it’s a buy. I only have a small position as am about to go through a divorce, but will be adding to my position as soon as is possible.

I don't suggest calls with short expiries, i've already been burned on this becuase i'm a dumbfuck. If you're gonna do options then leaps are probably ideal, or buy shares and sell covered calls against them. Shares is probably the play in general, but natrually that's jut my opinion, this isn't financial advice.

I’ve tried to be as accurate as possible with this DD, if anything is incorrect, feel free to comment below and I’ll amend it.

Reviewing the top five economies and their case trends -------------------------

Source : Worldometers.info

USA:  new cases curving upward, especially in FL

China:  they lie about their numbers

Japan:  new cases increasing at a roughly linear rate

Germany: new cases growing again, though off of a low base

France:  new cases surging and strong in the numbers, curving up

UK:  new cases surged though showing signs of starting to drop

Keeping your elder family members safe from your infecting them is still a cultural truth.

One political party in a given country wants to make another fail.  One party will weaponize the virus and threaten the other to take action.  This is what leads to restrictions.  Before it was the Democrats shutting down businesses to make the economy worse for Republicans.  Now it is the same, but Repub states will shut down and Dem states will want to keep businesses open.  In another country similar games will play out.

So all the potential economic shut downs are still there.

What is different is that all the technology that was bought to have the kids educate from home, such as tablets and web cams and online meeting subscriptions don't need to be bought a second time so soon.  So the 2nd set of restrictions on the population comes without a sector that gets an economic boost.  The exception is grocery stores and online shopping.

The extra unemployment benefits end on Sept 6th in numerous states, but investors know that and would sell effected stocks sooner.  The moratorium on evictions ends this fall, and so tenants will stop the games and scramble to pay their landlords, taking away their spending money.  If they don't they will get an eviction on their credit record.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

Now to valuations

[https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe)

shows that the Schiller PE ratio of stocks is 38.3.  The .com bubble was the highest it ever got, higher than this level for 2.5 years, and getting to the mid 40's.  Other then that, at no time in history was this valuation ratio this high.

Note also that in 1982 at the peak of interest rates 13 to 14%, the average stock had a PE of 7 to 9.

A book by O'Shoughnessy ""What Works on Wall Street"" studied 40 years of stock market data.  Its results shows that a price to sales ratio is 'the king of value factors', since sales can't be manipulated like earnings can.

[https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales)

shows that this valuation is higher now than at any time charted.  The book suggests that a price to sales of 1.5 is considered a good deal.  We are over twice that level on average.

The market breadth has eroded under the mega techs.  Not the Russel 2000 declined recently.

Here are the price to sales of the mega techs, using data at Reuters.  This can be hard to find in navigation, but a direct link will help, for example

[https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.N](https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.N)

use .N and .O at the end of the symbol for NYSE and NASDAQ.

price to sales:

MSFT = 13.3 ; FB = 10.4 ; AAPL = 7.5 ; AMZN = 4.3 ; GOOG = 8.76 ; NVDA = 25.2 ; AMD = 9.5

These clearly can fall and still be overvalued.

Some have sighted the growth in the money supply, such as M2, as part of what has pushed the market higher.  However, it is important to note that M2 was recategorized in 2020.  So even though you can go to the Mises Institute's site and see articles of big increases in the M2 money supply, much of that is due to the recategorization and strangely the articles omit this but for a footnote.

Inflation ----------------------------------------------

A large part of what we pretend to understand about inflation is the CPI and PCE.

We think that we know that the last CPI reading was 5.4%.  That is above the target of 2% of course when action by the recipe is needed.  This coupled with Powell not wanting to raise rates and desiring to de-prioritize inflation is ""bad enough"" from a stock perspective.  Jim Cramer described Powell as ""having a heart"" in wanting to prioritize helping people back to work.  Recall that interest rates have to be jacked up in response to inflation eventually.  Acting to late makes it worse.  From business school texts, higher interest rates put downward pressure on the value of future earnings.  Thus the forward looking value of stocks drops.

  But I challenge all of you to take the CPI by its percentage components and REBUILD it yourself with online research.  I did.  While the published number was +1.6% year over year at the time, I found no component less than 2%, and most were a good deal higher.  It is easy to find information showing education expenses rising at a +5% annual rate for many years.  Medical costs I found web sites saying +4% annually consistantly over many years.  At the time, only oil was lower than 2% price growth.  Today, with oil back up above $70 a barrel, that is not to be taken lightly.

  Recently the Fed has emphasized the PCE, the Personal Consumption Expendatures index.  Do you find as I do it strange that they publish the 'this month vs last month' number, making it look like small 0.1 to 0.3% rise, and not the more useful year over year number, which would show a larger % increase?

  The National Debt takes no small part in the desire to have inflation be low and keep interest rates low.  But that combination is impossible over time.

  I have been at individual stock investing since 1996 and I have sold most of my stock holdings.  I lived through the .com crash which I took on the chin (with small dollars since I was young and I learned from it such that I was 66% in cash for the crash of 2008.  If you have not been in the habit of thinking about economic impacts, valuations, and questioning what real inflation is, it is certainly time to start.

  The great bull market of the 1980's in the USA was spurred by the acceleration of women entering the work force and the personal computer.  The great bull market of the 1990's was spurred by implementation of the internet, immigration, and foreign economies developing.

  What is the story now?  5G networking is just a faster version of the same thing, but only over shorter distances.  Artificial intelligence is intended to replace humans.  Electric vehicles only reduce pollution after 100k miles according to an article in the WSJ.  I think to move on to much higher valuations we need a big economic story that just isn't there right now."

EDIT:  To be clear I am not saying you should hold calls past earnings.  In fact you may want to sell each right before.  I still think with each earnings NVDA is going to rise."
