Now here’s the narrative…

DDR5 is the next evolution of dynamic RAM, and all the investment analysts are super smart and have built reliable models of how system builders slowly transition from one memory standard to the next.  In fact you can find many articles from the past 6 months about how the cyclical DRAM market has entered a slower phase and the combination of inventory and production ramp-up time means we can expect slower growth from chip makers that are heavily DRAM makers. Like Micron.  That’s the sole reason why Micron (PE 14) has not followed Nvidia (PE 114), AMD (PE 47), Broadcom (PE 42), Applied Materials (PE 27), Qualcomm (PE 23) into much higher valuations.

But now there’s a nasty new version of an exploit called RowHammer that hackers can use to disrupt or steal from DDR4 systems, which is most of the worlds current PC and Unix systems.

DDR5 is naturally more resistant to RowHammer.  Intel and AMD motherboards are already scheduled to ship in 2022 with DDR5 support, so the engineering work is done.  The Rowhammer exploit increases the urgency to upgrade systems and will thus shift the demand curve ahead of what the analysts have in their models.

Now DDR5 makers like Micron, instead of being seen as in a more slow-growth phase of their industry compared to other chip makers, will quickly be recognized to be in high-growth phase, maybe emergency high-growth if a couple Rowhammer exploitations get publicized.

Edit:  I know I misspelled RowHammer in the title.  Turns out you can't edit the title.  Total autist here, you're prolly best off ignoring everything I say."

/1. INTC is the only real US chip manufacturer that can reasonably compete with Korean Samsung and Taiwanese TSMC (-100 credit score for acknowledging Taiwan). It is getting lots of literal boat load of cash(probs something like $50B equivalent) from the government that is positive for the shareholders, while maintaining the buybacks and dividends.
Yes, TSMC and others are also hedging and gonna start making some chips in USA but realistically the gubment will give most of the cash to INTC.

/2. US gubment is in a cold war with China, this means it's also a technological warfare. This means supercomputers, missile, Starlink chips(private company) etc and Intel is likely going to be one of the prime suppliers of this boom in tech investment.

/3. TSMC and Samsung are pretty much bottlenecked. Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Mediatech, Broadcom, various carmakers, electronics manufacturers etc and not to mention Intel themselves are a big buyer. Specifically, Intel and Apple has bought out all capacity of TSMC 3nm(equivalent to Intel's 5 nm probs, I forgot). This means there is an enormous demand that is not being fulfilled and Intel launching their foundry services and already signing deals with Qualcomm, Amazon is a big deal.

For reference, TSMC's market cap is bigger than 3 Intel (yes, that's a unit I invented). In 2024-2025, you might even see Apple, NVIDIA and the likes fabricating their chips from Intel just to give a big F U to TSMC (who is currently slightly overcharging if the rumours are to be believed).

/4. Intel is launching a GPU. The GPU market is also in a huge bottleneck due to higher demand from gamers and corn miners. Everyone expects that they are likely to sell their GPUs very easily. Think about this for a sec. Intel is just about to become one of the players in this huge GPU market.
Which would also make way for their server GPUs and AIs and the likes.

/5. Think 10-15 years from now. Your fridge, doorbell, light, heating system and every ducking thing will have some chips and Intel is likely to remain a dominant player in this market. I think this will be bigger than the current entire semi market as it is. IOT is just getting started.

/6. Intel is one of the forerunner player in AI techs like autonomous vehicles through their various investments(Mobil eye for one) and will likely remain so. I don't know how big this will be in 10 years, but it's likely that Intel will be one of the bigger players in the market like Google (through Waymo), Tesla and NVIDIA.

/7. Intel also recently launched their big little architecture, where it has already became competitively better than AMD especially in gaming with low power consumption and huge power. Not to mention being very power efficient most of the time for using its efficiency cores most of the time. Not that it matters that much, seeing the gamer Steam reports, very few people actually play on the latest of the latest gen. But, that's also something that's worth noting at least. 

However, the vast majority of pc sales is in just your average boomer laptops and desktops. And they have a good lead there.

*Tips for those wanting to build a high end new pc. Wait for Intel's lineup to be available broadly, high end pc gamers will dump their last gen AMD chips for the Intel one in the second hand market, causing a flooding of cheap AMD CPUs, buy one of them. Source: Did this once.*

/8. One worrying factor is in the server market. Everyone seems to be launching their own server chips and AMD is very competitive and eating away market share. But Intel's management seems to be guiding us towards the right path. If their predictions prove to be right, they are on the right track.

/9. Intel announced that they will launch Angstrom scale CPUs in the future, that's good I guess. They are also working in RISC-V and other CPU architectures.

/10. Pat has an approval rating of 96% in Glassdoor and the employees would recommend others to work in Intel 89% of the time. This is a huge ass jump for both scores from the Bob Swan era. Go to Wayback Machine, you will see. This means a noticeable change has taken place within this huge organisation in such a short time.

/11. Intel stock always seem to have price support at around $50. And it's near that range right now.

/12. Most analysts are bullish on the stock. Comparatively cheap stock in this clown market. Wanna buy a $5.48B gravity powered truck company anyone?

/13. Intel actually has one of the highest talented employee pull who can be expected to deliver. Contrary to popular belief.

**Bear Cases**

/1. This is a boomer stock according to reddit's circejerk. So, it's difficult to convince people that it is actually expected to grow around 11% CAGR just by the current demand circumstances alone by management's conservative estimates for the next few years. This is mega bearish. If the market doesn't care about a stock, no matter what the management do, the stock will not perform.

/2. Intel has repeatedly failed to prove that their foundry division's predictions are reliable. If they went fabless like AMD, it would have probably rocketed already. But a big part of the cheapness of the stock comes from the unreliability of their foundry division. Yes, the management has finally started getting serious about their foundry, but one cannot ignore their past failures.

/3. Government contracts and the likes are not completely free money like some of you believe, delays in delivery and contract fulfillment could make what is essentially a free money glitch to a costly mistake and a billion dollar loss with a brink of an eye. The terms are generally very strict, so Intel has to deliver.

/4. Investments are going to be a lot and semiconductor industry being cyclical means, if Intel fails to deliver, its market share will be eaten away and lose billions in potential profit.

/5. Stock seems to be largely rangebound like Microsoft was for 15 years.

Although I like eating Mac n cheese, mj and masturbating on any Friday night, today I call for your attention for three different Ms, literally. $MMM is a manufacturing company blah blah boring shit, they have their hands on basically everything including sticky notes, paint, medical respirators and a lot more stuff… especially construction stuff.

THE ANALYSIS

Biden’s’ infrastructure plan passed congress, many companies will benefit. The thing is, 3M is so broadly present in the sectors that will be invested on by the government that it is nearly impossible for it not to benefit. It’s like that awkward friend that you knows everyone around you so he goes to all the parties and stuff but you don’t really know know them and just awkwardly say hi, but he seems to be really close to everyone you know just not you for some reason… ya feel? 

Anyways, offering EV battery solutions, mostly insulating materials; and we know how hot that sector is right now.

But not only EVs will benefit, 3M is all around the manufacturing industry with abrasives, paints, bonding and more. Even touching the Broadcom sector.

What I mean is, when Biden passed this bill, 3M execs bought a Beverly Hills house for each one of their dog’s toys. And these are rich dogs. Think about it.

THE TA

Now for the part that you are waiting for, your daily horoscope reading for a random stock with badly drawn lines and numbers you don’t understand… but don’t worry cause I don’t either.

See, the stock has been trading in this triangle, which is on the brink of breakout, in fact when voting started for the bill on Friday morning we can see how much momentum it gained; until they said they were delaying voting.

https://charts.equityclock.com/3m-company-nysemmm-seasonal-chart

Also here’s graphs of stock performance during the months of September through December, beating SPY by about 2% and there are not weak months for SPY usually.

CONCLUSION

MMM is primed for a breakout Monday after the bill passing. The best part is the price of the contracts, with 190 next week contracts being merely around $30. With the movement of this stock Friday morning, I am sure the stock will rally with this incredible catalyst. 

POSITION
21 190C 11/19

EDIT: TL;DR: Buy Mmm, go boom Monday cause bill and Brandon"

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 30th, 2021.

# **A key jobs report in the week ahead could drive the next big market move - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/27/a-key-jobs-report-in-the-week-ahead-could-drive-the-next-big-market-move.html)**
*****
> With Jackson Hole in the rear-view mirror, August’s employment report could be the next driver for markets.
*****
> Stocks gained in the past week, surging again to new highs Friday after a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The chairman acknowledged that Fed officials expect to taper back their $120 billion a month bond-buying program this year, a first step toward reversing easy policy.
*****
> Powell was speaking at the Kansas City Fed’s annual Jackson Hole, Wyo. symposium, held virtually this year. He said the Fed has seen sufficient progress on inflation, but the labor market has not yet improved enough to start the taper. Importantly, he also emphasized that the wind down of the bond program does not mean the Fed will automatically move on to raise interest rate hikes.
*****
> “Powell has made it clear the Fed is not prepared to raise interest rates anytime soon. The market seems relieved by that. … With some of the economic data already slowing, I think interest rate hikes are far, far away, and investors are happy about that,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for the US SPDR business at State Street Global Advisors.
*****
> Arone said the Fed has so far avoided a “taper tantrum,” similar to the 2013 market sell-off when the Fed announced it was rolling back quantitative easing. Powell’s speech was widely anticipated to clarify the Fed’s position on its $120 billion monthly bond purchases, after a number of Fed officials called for the start of a wind down.
*****
> # Jobs are the focal point
*****
> Now, market focus shifts even more fiercely to jobs data, with the release Friday of the August employment report.
*****
> “For sure, the market is going to react,” said Jim Caron, head of macro strategies for global fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “I think it’s important. I think the issue that they’re going to have is unemployment benefits don’t really run out until the beginning of September. It’s really not until you get the October jobs number that you get a more free look at September.”
*****
> The dollar index sank after Powell’s Friday morning speech, as stocks rallied to new highs and Treasury yields fell. Other data in the coming week includes consumer confidence Tuesday and Wednesday’s release of Institute for Supply Management manufacturing data and ADP’s private sector payroll data, a kind of preview for Friday’s government jobs report.
*****
> “I wouldn’t be surprised to see follow-through Monday and Tuesday, but ahead of ADP on Wednesday, I’d look for position adjusting which means weaker stocks and weaker bonds and stronger dollar ahead of the jobs data,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.
*****
> He said Powell was dovish, as expected, while still emphasizing that tapering was coming. But the key for markets was that he stressed the end of the program does not mean “tightening” or rate hikes. The 10-year Treasury yield had risen above 1.35% this week, but fell to 1.3% after Powell spoke Friday.
*****
> # U.S. 10-year Treasury yield
*****
> “The market will get cautious again ahead of the jobs data. Then it’s a new world into September. You have to wait until after the jobs data to see if these moves have sustaining power. This is ‘a buy the rumor, sell the fact’ move,” Chandler said.
*****
> Some market pros had expected an announcement on tapering from the Fed at its September meeting, but that view has now mostly changed to a November or December announcement. “Because of the uncertainty of delta, I think it will take more than the next jobs report,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “The disruption to jobs in particular is if schools have to close again.”
*****
> Economists polled by Dow Jones expect 750,000 jobs were created in August and the unemployment rate fell to 5.2%. In July, the economy created 943,000 jobs and unemployment slid to 5.4%. Education was a big contributor in July, with 261,000 jobs added in public schools and private education.
*****
> “It doesn’t have to be a spectacular number to satisfy their needs,” said Swonk of the August report. “You need a solid jobs number, something north of a half million... I think we’re going to be close to that. They’re going to want to see September employment as well.”
*****
> # Market risks
*****
> State Street’s Arone said the Fed’s discussion of the tapering will be top of mind in the markets, just as the next earnings season rolls around.
*****
> “It will be interesting at a time when the Fed starts taking its foot off the pedal,” he said. “Right now, the bull case continues to be reasonably strong, but markets don’t go straight up. If I was going to key on a specific risk, I’d keep an eye on third quarter earnings reports, and more importantly what corporate executives are saying about next year.”
*****
> Arone said strong earnings has been the biggest driver of market gains, helping investors ignore worries about the spread of the Covid delta variant, the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and dysfunction in Washington.
*****
> The market’s summer rally continued in the past week, with the Dow ending at 35,455, up just about 1% for the week. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both ended the week at record highs.
*****
> The S&P 500 was up 1.5% at 4,509, and the Nasdaq rose 2.8% to 15,129.
*****
> “The market has been able to ignore all this noise and rally,” he said, adding it would be ironic if it were earnings that caused a sell-off and not a Fed policy change or something else.
*****
> He said the market could get choppy in September and into October, a seasonally weak time of year for stocks.
*****
> “We caught a glimpse of this this quarter, with big tech — where the numbers were beating, but they suggested that future quarters would see slower growth,” Arone said. “Investors didn’t like that, and I think it gave us a glimpse of what happens if it spreads beyond the technology sector to other sectors.”
*****
> There are a few earnings in the coming week, including Zoom Video Monday, Campbell Soup Wednesday, and Hewlett Packard and Broadcom Thursday.
*****
> # Watching Ida
*****
> The oil and gas industry is closely watching Hurricane Ida, which was heading straight for Louisiana. Oil, gasoline and natural gas all rallied Friday, as energy companies shut down Gulf of Mexico production ahead of the storm. Louisiana is also home to a number of refineries.
*****
> West Texas Intermediate futures settled up nearly 2% Friday, at $68.74 per barrel. The benchmark U.S. crude was up more than 10% for the week, its best weekly gain since June 5, 2020.

> # Small Cap Labor Day Rally Getting Underway

> In the below chart, daily data since July 1, 1979 through August 20, 2021 for the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies are divided by the Russell 1000 index of largest companies, and then compressed into a single year to show an idealized yearly pattern. When the graph is descending, large-cap companies are outperforming small-cap companies; when the graph is rising, smaller companies are moving up faster than their larger brethren. The most prominent period of outperformance generally begins in mid-December and lasts until late-February or early March with a surge in January. This period of outperformance by small-caps is known as the “January Effect” in the annual Stock Trader’s Almanac.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ee23ad03da0bcf4a9f8869976521a446/51d39e9e109dc4da-47/s500x750/7dc9cb9b15e57125a71f2475fad23ab6ccd1423e.jpg))**

> In recent years, another sizable move is quite evident just before Labor Day. One possible explanation for this move is individual investors begin to return to work after summertime vacations and are searching for “bargain” stocks. In a typical year, small-caps would have been lagging and could represent an opportunity relative to other large-cap possibilities. As of today’s close, Russell 2000 is up 13.4% compared to the Russell 1000 being up 19.0% year-to-date. Lagging small-caps and resilient U.S. consumers could be the ideal setup for a repeat of this pattern this year. However, the small-cap advantage does historically wane around mid-September.

> # Small-Caps Bounce

> ln today's Morning Lineup, we noted the inverse correlation between performance this week and market caps. As shown in the major US Indices screen of our Trend Analyzer tool, the two best performers over the past five days have been Micro-Caps (IWC) followed by small caps like the Russell 2000 (IWM) and the Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR). Mid-cap ETFs are the next best performers with high 2% gains then most large cap indices have only risen around 1.5% this week with the exception of the Dow (DIA) which has not even gained 1%. As for where these indices are trading relative to each one's trading range, it is partially a mean reversion story. Small caps were deeply oversold one week ago and are now sitting just below their 50-DMAs. While not to as extreme of a degree, mid-caps were similarly trading a full standard deviation below their 50-DMAs last week. Today, they are on the opposite side of their 50-DMAs and on the verge of overbought readings.

> As previously mentioned, small caps like the Micro-Cap ETF (IWC) and Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) were oversold last week. From a charting perspective, each of these indices' rallies this week are not only bounces from extreme oversold levels, but they also follow brief dips below their 200-DMAs. But whereas the past five days have seen solid gains, yesterday saw IWC and IWM reject their 50-DMAs and the high end of their ranges that have been in place since late July. In other words, even though small caps have led the market this week, they are not out of the woods yet.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082721-IWM.png))**

> Looking at the relative strength lines of small caps like IWC and IWM versus the large cap S&P 500 (SPY) over the past year, the past week's outperformance again is a blip on the radar and has only put a small dent in the longer term trend of underperformance.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082721-Small-v-Large2.png))**

> Where that is not necessarily the case is small market caps versus the smallest market caps. As shown below, the relative strength line of the Micro-Cap ETF (IWC) versus the Russell 2000 (IWM) broke out of the past few months' downtrend over the past few days.

> # 6 Charts on Stocks Making New All-Time Highs

> The S&P 500 Index made yet another new all-time high yesterday, the 50th on the year. “The all-time record for any one year is 77 S&P 500 new all-time highs back in 1995,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Incredibly, 2021 is currently on pace for 78 new highs. There’s a long way to go, but this has been an amazing year and this is yet another way to show it.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-1.png?ssl=1))**

> As impressive as 50 new highs is, investors need to remember that new highs happen in clusters that can last decades. We’ve been sharing this chart for years, saying exactly that: previous periods of new highs lasted much longer than most expected. Mark Twain said history doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes. If history rhymes once again, we could still have several more years of new highs.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Another interesting stat about S&P 500 all-time highs is every month so far in 2021 has seen a new high, 8 for 8. Only once have all 12 months made a new all-time high and that was in 2014. This is somewhat surprising, given the S&P 500 gained only 11.4% in 2014, but it was a very slow and persistent move. Most investors (including this author) would guess it was 1995, but that spectacular year saw new highs in ‘only’ 10 months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-3.png?ssl=1))**

> Although August tends to be historically weak for stocks, that hasn’t been the case this year. In fact, the S&P 500 has made an incredible 9 new highs already this month, the most since 1929. No, we don’t think this is another 1929, but this is just another way to show how astounding this bull run has been.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-4.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 50 new S&P 500 all-time highs before the end of August is quite a feat. In fact, only twice has the 50 level been cracked through the end of August, in 1964 and 1995.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-5.png?ssl=1))**

> So what happens next? The rest of the year in 1964 the S&P 500 added 3.6%, while it added 9.6% in 1995. Below we looked at all the years with at least 30 new all-time highs through August and sure enough, better than average returns the rest of the year are common. The final 4 months gained 4.7%, versus the average final 4 months gain for all years of 3.6%. Now this is skewed due to 1987s crash, as that was the only time stocks were lower the final 4 months after more than 30 new highs by the end of August. Smoothing things out, the median return jumps up to a very impressive 5.4%, versus a median return of 3.6% for all years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-6.png?ssl=1))**

> 2021 is off to a roaring start and we continue to expect higher prices before all is said and done. The studies we did today do little to change our view. We’d use any potential weakness as an opportunity to add before potential higher prices.

> # Nasdaq Crosses Another 1,000 Point Threshold

> It won't be official until the close, but with the Nasdaq crossing 15,000 for the first time today, it's on pace to cross its third 1,000 point threshold this year and the sixth since the pandemic began in early 2020. The table below lists each 1,000 point threshold that the Nasdaq has crossed over time along with the first day that it crossed that threshold, the number of days since the prior cross, what percentage that 1,000 point consists of relative to the prior threshold, and then how many upside and downside crosses the Nasdaq has had around that level on a closing basis.

> Of all the 1,000 point thresholds the Nasdaq has crossed over time, the only one that it never traded back below after crossing it was 6,000 back in April 2017. Besides 1,000, that was also the 1,000 point threshold that took the longest to cross above. After first crossing 5,000 back in March 2000, it took 6,256 days for the Nasdaq to top 6,000. Since then, though, the Nasdaq has been making quick work of 1,000 point thresholds. With the exception of the 486-day gap between 8K and 9K, every other 1,000-point threshold since 6,000 has taken less than a year to cross. Even in the midst of a global pandemic, it took the Nasdaq less than six months to get from 9,000 to 10,000.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082421-Nasdaq-Crosses.png))**

> The long-term chart of the Nasdaq below includes red dots to show each time the Nasdaq first crossed a 1,000 point threshold along with the number of days for each one.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082421-Nasdaq-1000-Point-thresholds.png))**

> Looking at the chart above may give you a feeling of lightheadedness given the seemingly parabolic nature of the last few years. An important thing to keep in mind, though, is that as a percentage of the index's price level, every 1,000 point threshold represents a smaller move in percentage terms. While the move from 9K to 10K represented a move of over 11%, the move from 14K to 15K represents only a little more than 7%. Looking at this chart on a log scale where each label on the y-axis represents a doubling of the index shows how modest the recent 1,000 point thresholds have been relative to earlier ones. Think about it this way, in the less than two years between when the Nasdaq first crossed 2K to when it crossed 5K for the first time (four different 1,000 point thresholds), it rallied 150%. Over the last four years, though, the Nasdaq has crossed 10 different 1,000-point thresholds, but the gain has also only been 150%.

> # Bulls Head In Separate Directions

>As the major indices have set more record highs in the past week, bullish sentiment has rebounded. The American Association of Individual Investors' (AAII) weekly reading on bullish sentiment rose 6.4 percentage points to 39.4% this week. That is the highest reading of optimism since the week of July 8th when bullish sentiment was a hair above 40%. While recovered, that reading is still muted versus the past year's range and is only 1.5 percentage points above their historical average. In other words, bullish sentiment has rebounded but is far from elevated.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082621-AAII-Bull.png))**

> While the AAII survey showed an increase in bullish sentiment, another survey of newsletter writers from Investors Intelligence saw the opposite result. This survey's reading on bullish sentiment dropped to just 50% this week which is the lowest level since May of last year. Although this reading has now fallen out of the past year's range, it is still slightly elevated versus the historical average of 45%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082621-II-Bull.png))**

> Given the uptick in bullish sentiment, the AAII survey saw only a third of respondents report as bearish versus 35.1% last week. Like bullish sentiment, this reading remains outside of the range it has occupied for most of the past year although that current reading is also not far away from the historical average of 30.5%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082621-AAII-Bear.png))**

> As we noted in last Thursday's Chart of the Day, the bull-bear spread dipped into negative territory last week for the first time since late January and it was at the lowest level since October 2020. With the inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment this week, the spread has moved back into positive territory to its highest level since the last week of July.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082621-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

> Not all of the gains to bullish sentiment came from the bearish camp. Neutral sentiment saw an even larger decline of 4.2 percentage points. That brings the reading down to 27.5% which is the lowest reading since April 15th when it stood at just 21.6%.

Don't get faked out by the bear traps liek this week - it was always gonna happen on OpEX week combined with a huge move in big caps tech over the past month.

I believe Qualcomm has been brutally oversold. I expect a large rebound in the following months. 

Following their [most recent earnings report Q1 2021](https://investor.qualcomm.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001728949-21-000022/0001728949-21-000022.pdf) on the 4th of February their stock dropped 10% in 2 days. However, their earning report was strong and they maintain confidence that they will have a strong Q2 earnings too with an EPS of $1.65 (analysts were expecting an EPS of $1.57). The Q1 ER had an EPS of $2.17 per diluted share which is more than double their Q1 2020 $0.99 EPS. Although their ER beating high estimates of $8 billion in sales by an extra $200 million, [their licensing division brought in $1.35 billion of an estimated $1.43 billion.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/qualcomm-stock-earnings-chips-apple-51612390489) Their equipment and services division brought in $6.440 billion. They had an operating income of 2.5 billion.


Qcom has a healthy balance sheet with $7 billion in cash and very little short term debt. They do have $15 billion of long term doubt, which would be entirely covered by their cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. They can chip away at this debt slowly in this low interest period whilst focusing on R&D.


All sounds good, so why did the stock tumble so bad? I’ve looked at different sources and have read that business analysts are worried about the limited manufacturing capacity across the semiconductor industry. However, I believe this is bullish. With demand higher than supply, it allows for the flexibility in price and larger profits whilst reinvesting back into manufacturing. Furthermore, I do not believe the dip is for this reason as other US chip producers such as Broadcom, Nvidia and the likes also are experiencing the same chip shortage and their stocks have not dipped in the same way. AMD has dipped in a similar way after beating earnings in true fashion and is showing signs of recovery which makes me bullish of a rebound. 

 It is possible the sell off may be due to [citi downgrading their PT to $165 from $194.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/qualcomm-stock-gets-a-downgrade-at-citi-after-earnings-2021-02-04) This is still higher than the current price by a bit but is slightly more bearish. Qualcomm has 77% of shares held by institutions, so you’d expect less volatility considering recently they have been loading up on shares, however, this data is prior to earnings. Updated figures on institutional holding reports are filed within 45 days after calendar quarter end - the 21st of March. [The most credible reason for the dip may be due to analysts having higher forecasts for the licensing division, however, I do believe the reaction has been very disproportionate especially when following EPS for the next quarter remains strong.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/04/why-qualcomm-stock-is-falling-today/)

&#x200B;

today i want to introduce you to Nokia #NOK. 🚀

The year is 1865 in Finland – NOK was founded. Our beloved God Elon didnt even exist as a sperm back then; nor did your boomer grandpa. NOK took vegetables and made paper out of it. Then they decided to make phones and computers. 

In 2014 NOK sold their phone business to Microsoft for billions. Microsoft sold it to HMD global. NOK still receives royalties for their name. So NOK is not a phone company anymore (do not confuse the 2 when researching). 

Today, NOK is far more advanced than making paper from paprika or selling undestructable phones. By taking over a joint-venture from Siemens in 2013, Alcatel-Lucent in 2015 and continuous work, aquisitions and research, they now pose as a major player in hardware and software for critical communication technology. More about this later.

In August last year (2020), NOK hired one of their key phone infrastructure employees back. He was there from 1990 – 2000. And now he is back as CE fucking O. 🚀

In between 2000-2020 he did some random shenanigan CEO stuff. His name is Pekka (#CoC) Lundmark. NOK have 2 other new executives, very capable.

5G - The economic future outlook is looking very juicy compared to NOK’s share price: 

NOK has a market share of 22%. Sure, Ericsson has 26, Huawei has 28.5%. But Huawei is kicked out of Europe, North America, and now many more.The list of countries banning Huawei is growing fast. Who is happy to take over, even in asia? (look at Singapore, partly Thailand f.e.) NOK, Samsung, Ericsson. NOK will have a pie of it. 🚀

EV with autonomous driving will need 5G to be connected perfectly. Also autonomous traffic such as drones will rely on this heavily. Guess who produces infrastructure for this, and offers safe communication infrastructure solutions already tested? NOK. 🚀

The finnish, norwegian and swedish governments already bought into NOK. 5G with secure critical infrastructure is a big deal.

What else? NOK is involved in cyber-security slightly similar to #BB BlackBerry. 

Nokia Smart Grid for securing power stations; Network security in general; IOT security and Railway infrastructure security.

5G will be developed faster than you think. According to Ericssons 2020 mobility report, 40% of all mobile internet subs will be 5G – 3.5 billion users in 2026. You might think thats 6 years still, but remember that its 40% of all mobile subs, and where are 3.5bn of subs? Except EU and NA – think China, India, South america, africa, south east asia. Massive numbers.

With one deal, NOK managed to secure 2.2bn$ in 2018.

Research & Development: 

NOK is the flagship for 6G research in the EU.

NOK is working with NASA to put 4G and 5G on the fucking MOON. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I didnt look to far in research and development; NOK has claimed some 3000 patents for 5G, but Huawei is the leader right now. What seems interesting though is that NOK is ahead in confirmed patents. 

https://preview.redd.it/0m0suzawnwd61.png?width=815&format=png&auto=webp&s=635e3eeb409ada0404f6caae272b77066224c523

&#x200B;

The discussion about the patent leaders are diffuse. TwoBirds said that Ericsson was leading, with Huawei questioned as to if their numbers were legit. Qualcomm is also a major player. 

**My point though is that NOK’s stock is still flat,** while Qualcomm and the others significantly gained. (Except Huawei, political risk)

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

NOK is worth a buy IMO. Traffic of tomorrow will rely heavily on secure 5G infrastructure. NOK’s basic revenue is solid, cash flow positive. They will pay dividends, and are a big competitor in a growing sector. They will need their time though, they wont skyrocket next month. 

This is not a YOLO play. As u/ST_McD pointed out, NOK is not the next GME. I see good upside on this stock though, around 100% until next year. 

For 2 other good DD's on this, check u/ST_McD and u/zepherance. Special thanks to u/zepherance, I used some info from ur DD. 

&#x200B;

Position: long 4000 @ 3.85 Eur. Looking to get calls soon - 8c Jan 22. 

This is not financial advise, I'm not a bot and this is not distortion of GME - im holding. 

&#x200B;

TL;CR: NOK go boom. NOK build Internet for Moon with NASA. NOK stonks.🚀"
