Whether this was a knee-jerk reaction that came from human beings or purely the work of algos, the significant dip represents an opportunity for those who see ADBE as a larger and significantly more diversified business than DOCU, operating in spaces that have weathered the pandemic and even prospered quite a bit.

For reference, Adobe‚Äôs Document Cloud segment, which it‚Äôs e-signature offering falls into, makes up about 13% of Adobe‚Äôs business. It‚Äôs fair to expect Document Cloud to take a bit of a hit (though the e-signature product probably isn‚Äôt a huge contributor to revenue), but it is difficult to suggest that it‚Äôs other business segments, dealing with the content creation, content management, and digital advertising spaces, shrank or remained stagnant rather than growing. 

This feels a lot like a gift.

I've done a few of these posts previously, you can find them [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?q=Market+Perspective+author%3A_foldLeft&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all).

I don't do outright trading advice; this is intended to help form a picture, possibilities, ideas, to keep in mind when making trades.

I take a look at the overall market through some charts first, then use those to highlight some possible conclusions and considerations.

Let's dig in.

# Charts

[Sector Compare YTD](https://www.tradingview.com/x/x4YHO2WX/)  
There's a lot going on here, but really we're just looking at the year-to-date % moves across our top indices and sector ETFs, to get an idea of what's been leading and what's been lagging.

[SPY 1y](https://www.tradingview.com/x/aYpjCCVU/)

[QQQ 1y](https://www.tradingview.com/x/epMPugQp/)

[IWM 1y](https://www.tradingview.com/x/n9R1TbHe/)

So just looking at these:

* After exploding higher from the mid-October lows, SPY has been flirting with the 470 (SPX 4700) level for almost two weeks.
* Likewise, the QQQ was flirting with the 400 level (NDX 16400) for the same time period, but broke higher Thursday/Friday as bond yields fell. Generally when we've seen the Qs break above a level like this, we see more runway and more ATHs.
* IWM (small caps) broke out of the range they've been in for the majority of the year, but have given up these gains and closed down inside that range on Friday. Right now this is looking like a failed breakout, and we'll have to see what the price action gives us next week.Perhaps this could have been opex-related (we'll discuss more below), and anecdotally small caps have outperformed more often than not in November / EOY, but the last two weeks have been worrying.

Let's take a look at some other charts to help build more context:

[SPY vs S5fI](https://www.tradingview.com/x/LYAnsTqd/)  
SF5I is an index that tracks/measure the percentage of S&P500 stocks above their 50-day moving average. This gives us some insight into *breadth* \- the amount of stocks that are actually performing well within the index. The higher the better, as that's indicative of more stocks participating in the rally.

[NDX vs NDFI](https://www.tradingview.com/x/t8ctpiNB/)  
This is a likewise chart showing  the Nasdaq 100 vs the Nasdaq 100 stocks above their 50-day moving average.

[IWM vs R2FI](https://www.tradingview.com/x/GljXtOIv/)  
Likewise chart for the Russell.

[RSP](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Rtn6XBQ2/)  
This is the equal-weight S&P500 (SPY is cap-weighted), which gives us similar insight: if this is going down and SPY is going up, that's indicative of small breadth, just a few high-weighted stocks leading SPY higher instead of a broader-based rally.

[US10Y](https://www.tradingview.com/x/2AfL6hFe/)  
The 10y has been pretty volatile as of late, eliciting some nervousness as it swung up to 1.7 but then giving pretty much all of that back. I'm not worried about this until we see it break above that 1.70 - 1.75 zone, which I think would cause a sell off in growth stocks. Until then though, no reason to worry IMO.

[DXY](https://www.tradingview.com/x/euklkjzN/)  
A lot of people have been looking at the strength in the dollar (index). I want to take a moment to remind everyone that the DXY is a measure of the dollar vs a basket of 7 other currencies, but the largest one being the EUR. IMO the recent move higher in the DXY is not so much dollar strength relative to other currencies, but instead the EUR dropping hard, and we can see that in this chart: [EUR/USD vs DXY](https://www.tradingview.com/x/gFVWMfXe/) \- this entire move has been from the euro falling against the dollar, and that's really more about the state of Europe and European monetary policy than dollar strength.

# Looking forward & Takeaways

[Gamma Exposure](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix?), a measure of the total gamma exposure in the market, hit highs going into opex last week but we saw a majority of that roll off on Friday's expiration. High gamma usually portends price *pinning* and possibly volatile price action out of opex. It will be interesting to see next week if we get a volatile move higher or lower, as one of the other is likely coming out of a opex like this.

&#x200B;

* As just mentioned, gamma rolling off generally portends some volatility in one direction or another and thinking about seasonality here our assumption would be a move higher.
* We need to watch small caps (IWM / Russell). Is this a failed breakout, or will we bounce back and push higher? I already have a position here and will cut losses if we continue to break down; alternatively I'll look to add if we start to see positive price action again.
* Likewise, though I didn't include their charts, oil / energy and financials are in the same situation. This makes sense as they exploded higher will small caps from the end of last year into early this year, but they're now looking at a possible failed breakout like IWM / /RTY. All of these are sitting right at what could be a support level, so will be watching if these are able to bounce back and resume an uptrend - where I'll be a buyer - or if they'll confirm a breakdown.
* I think you still have to have some long exposure to growth / tech. It's looking likely we continue higher here, and the narrative has been growth / tech as the market leaders doesn't look likely to change right now.
* Seasonality is in play here, and barring any unknown unknowns, I think we are higher by EOY / January, and I'm likely to buy any weakness into the start of December. We should be constantly reviewing market conditions though, and re-adjusting our own positions to accommodate. Flows before pros, always.

I've constantly thought back to [this note](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-sp500-forecast-yearend-big-first-half-returns-2021-7) from earlier this summer:

>When its advance is greater than 12.5% in the first six months of a year, the S&P 500 usually records a median return of 9.7%, which is nearly twice the median return of 5% for any given year, according to LPL Financial.

# Bonus Chart

[ADBE](https://www.tradingview.com/x/EWU984t8/)  
I spotted this Friday and started a very small position into close. ADBE broke out above it's most recent high / resistance on no news (that I saw), high volume, and good technicals. Looking for this thing to run 700+ in the next few weeks, but I'm out quickly if we drop below that 680 line."

Tables of stocks found below.  My diamond hands are so rough on my fleshy...forearms. I can't type anymore.

# Observations/Assumptions

Before  you jump down my throat, these are simplified observations/assumptions,  not internationally agreed upon mandates from heaven. Okay, now you can  jump down my throat.

* Companies  with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a  sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies  missing one or more of those attributes.
* For most people it is impossible to time the market
* Stock prices have all available information priced into them.
* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.
* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)
* [Index  fund returns, such as the S&P 500, are now predominately determined  by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)
* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).
* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 (yes, simplified)
* During times of volatility, companies that had poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.
* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.
* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:
   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp)  even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have had  losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing in  that same set of stocks in the same proportions.
   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don‚Äôt want to support.
   * Due  to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the  index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when Tesla  was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on 11/16/2020,  forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up the price,  which had already been driven up by people buying the stock knowing it  was then going to get added to the index forcing more people to buy the  stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular, that‚Äôs because it is.

# Hypothesis

Using  industry benchmarking against the best of the best of the best  companies in each industry in order to purchase only the best companies  in equal measure should provide a well-diversified portfolio that over  the long term should be able to beat the S&P 500.

# Experiment 2020

750  largest US stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry  (Industry details available further down the post). Stocks were given a  score based on their relative percentage compared to the industry index.  For example, each companies‚Äô average ROE of the last 4 years was  compared to this index value with the following type of breakdown:

* ROE < Index ROE = Poor = 1
* ROE > Index ROE = Moderate = 2
* ROE > 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3

For  example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was  10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,  they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they would  receive a moderate rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would receive a  great rating.

This was done for all of the metrics below:

* ROE
* Revenue Growth %
* EBITDA %
* FCF %

The  relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there  was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth  only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be  decreased to 125% for a better distribution.

Any stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.

[ROE Example](https://preview.redd.it/t7l27u9tu6081.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f904309edb170cc8679189ea62f7bbe057646a3d)

ROE Example

That left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.

This  left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the  company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently  in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them  being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire? Has  WSB said it's a buy? Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason  that I want to exclude them?

That left 26 across 7 sectors.

[Industries 2020 Experiment Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/3gurx91wu6081.png?width=366&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e37aa1afdb655721fc83dff4e75867923e48cc1)

**2020 Industry Breakdown**

These  26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and  September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total  purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.

2020 Experiment Results July, August, and September 2020 purchases to 11/16/2021

* **S&P 500** total return reinvested dividends: **49.09%**
* **My 26 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **61.53%**

Can we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.

# Experiment 2021

2,850  tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.  The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:

* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company
* Profit Margin ‚Äì shows how effective the business is at making money
* Operating Margin ‚Äì shows how much money the company earns on its revenue
* FCF Margin ‚Äì shows how efficient a company is with their cash
* EBITDA Margin ‚Äì shows a companies‚Äô operating profitability
* ROE ‚Äì shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money
* ROA ‚Äì shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits
* ROIC ‚Äì shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns
* Debt/Equity Ratio ‚Äì shows the financial stability of a company

More  metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to  determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to  median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of  the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:

¬∑  3 stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over  the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry is  then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that benchmark.

Each  stock was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the  metrics and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite  score out of 27, from 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the  metrics. The scores are based on how much better they are then the  average. I measured them against the benchmark using the same  methodology as previously performed: Poor < 100%, Good < 150%,  Great > 150%. Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the  particular metric to find a useful distribution.

I  also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst TICKER THAT SHALL NOT BE NAMED (evidently a stock that cannot be named because I was banned the first time I posted this) with a score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9 categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn‚Äôt match the original  input (congratulations on your reading comprehension), this is primarily  due to mergers/acquisitions or the stock being taken private. Another  stock was acquired during the analysis, changing the max number yet  again.

Here is an example showing Aerospace & Defense scoring:

[Aerospace & Defense scoring](https://preview.redd.it/5r8i1qb0v6081.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=947be14d943204b8211c0933e9c1f1a41d4a1986)

Here is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the company‚Äôs most recent year):

[Growth Scoring](https://preview.redd.it/a2nq8c1av6081.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1f79a62b587bf6f1530f5beefda1b174b5d7d43)

Here is an example of the visualizations for the data:

[Data Visualization Example](https://preview.redd.it/5d41vcvdv6081.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=26567d730e1d668ccef856a18497fab38345577b)

I  applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at  the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock  that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a  high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.

Next,  I read the description of \~300 stocks and looked through their  financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off  their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly  leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that  Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns  Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them (how could you not?), no  there are not great synergies between the sectors of the business, yes,  they are aware of this. I also eliminated industries I wasn‚Äôt interested  in reviewing, such as REITS due to the need to look at different  metrics like FFO, Oil and Gas because it‚Äôs oil and gas, etc. These  activities eliminated \~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I‚Äôd  need to build a separate model.

I  then looked at each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made  the cut. Are all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are  the profit margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt  situation, did WSB say it's a buy, etc. Who deserves to be on this list?  This eliminated \~75.

We were down  to 84 stocks at this point. I then looked at each company's investor  presentation, annual report, etc. to better understand what the company  does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was not nearly as thorough on  this portion this year compared to last year just due to the substantial  increase in companies, 26 vs 84. My hourly wage at McDonald was going  to be better than my returns from the analysis if I took too long. I  only eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83  companies across 31 industries. Breakdown below:

[Industry Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/0bmcwyuiv6081.png?width=390&format=png&auto=webp&s=0df395664265ef942ff736c889108711216e76ed)

I then purchased all of these in equal proportion in April, May, and July of 2021.

2021 Experiment Results April, May, and July 2021 purchases to 11/16/2021:

* **S&P 500** total return including reinvested dividends: **11.93%**
* **My 2021 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **14.26%**

# Industry Classification

* For Experiment 2020, the Sector was used to determine how companies should be compared.
   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.
   * This  seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each other  that aren‚Äôt really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE below.
* For Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.
   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.
   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).
   * I  ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further. Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less than 10  stocks. I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical issues dealing  with averages/medians that were negative. There were also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they could be combined such  as biotech and pharmaceutical.

# Notes

I  partnered up for both the 2020 and 2021 experiments. This was critical  for both expanding my initial idea, brainstorming methods to build the  model, and reviewing the work done for errors. This was a team effort,  and I by no means deserve all the credit or hate.

All returns are showing reinvested dividends in the total return.

\*I  am not a financial advisor or anything else I should put here to ensure  it is clear that I did this for myself and am sharing my results and am  in no way forcing you to push buttons to buy things you don‚Äôt  understand or requiring justification for this run on sentence and  henceforth.

\*\*\*\*. Past results are no guarantee of future returns."

Some additional notes to add context to this DD:

- Autodesk has changed it's billing structure due to no long relying on licenced agreements for income. It is not more streamlined like Adobe after deeply rearchitecting for the cloud using Amazon and AWS. 

- Autodesk Forge is an API product that may see extensive use in markets like the metaverse, despite Autodesk Maya already being relevant in gaming or movies.

- Autodesk Flex is a counter for piracy of expensive licenced or subscribed products. As I like to put it, piracy means there's a high demand for the product and a problem in its supply. It's a supply chain problem for software. 

- Autodesk Build is a spend management software which may be relevant as trillions of dollars continue to be injected into infrastructure markets.  

- Fusion360 is a great introductory tool and funnel into the Autodesk ecosystem that ranges from water infrastructure to cinematic development.



IMO Autodesk will he a 200B market cap company by 2024."

qar6j5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qar6j5/hedging_against_a_market_crash_2008_all_over_again/,"Hedging against a Market Crash, 2008' all over again",501,362,2021-10-19 01:14:17,"Hey everyone,

I did put a lot of research into the current situation for quite some time and finally build a portfolio I am 100% behind long-term. However, the more I learned, the more sure I am that we will experience a market crash rather soon, than late.

I am not here to debate whether or not you think this is true, but the situation for this thought game is that we might see a crash similar in numbers, **not principle** like 2008' all over again. In general, during times of high inflation, most businesses will not come out well. The earnings will go up, but they need to put more money into their own business to even stay in the same place. A hedge for this are companies that can easily scale their business without needing money flow. I am looking at you Facebook, who can place 10% more ads, Adobe who can increase their product price without fear of losing customers, Apple, Microsoft...

The theory behind this discussion would assume that GameStop is a good hedge, I even heard that from the high ups in a very big, German bank, which is incredibly weird since they were against it months ago and did not even want to talk about it in the first place. This assumes that the crash is happening because of said theory I explained below in short. It does not mean that a high percentage of the entire portfolio should persist of them, but a chunk just in case might be a very good idea. The market is more complex than many think.

Another hedge and long term hold can not be mentioned in this sub, but you might guess what it is. Sadly, we cant debate this here. Has to do with weird blocks and tokens, latter of which might change the whole gaming industry and I am thankfully in the position where I can take constant profits from it in percentages that sound absolutely insane.

So, in case of this **theoretical** scenario, I would like to get everyone's opinion on this. I want to be clear, I value every single opinion and would love the most input possible. In case of no crash, my investments should grow steadily, but in case of a crash due to named circumstance, they would skyrocket. Again, this is purely theoretical, I do not want to discuss whether or not it is happening, but what you would do in case it will happen in the near future.

&#x200B;

**TLDR: How would you hedge against a potential market crash ala 2008' (similar in numbers, not principle) due to Evergrande + GameStop and the overall market situation?**

*I will add the theory behind GameStop again, even though most of you might know this already.*

*The theory: Most part of the stock is traded in Dark Pools and some shorting Hedge Funds are telling us that they closed their position, which is mathematically impossible. Do the research yourself. What I think is happening, is that all the shorts are actually synthetic and not real shares. There is tons and tons of proof of it, too much to even deny at this point. They exercise and sell deep ITM calls in order to get the FTDs. So basically, they are passing them from one to another, to another.*  
***The endless cycle:***  
*Person 1: Exercise deep ITM calls > Person 2: Sells deep ITM calls > Person 3: Sells shares > Person 4: met his FTD > Person 5: Exercise deep ITM calls  > Person 6: Sells deep ITM calls > ‚Ä¶*

***Explanation for Golden Retriever:***  
*Think of it like this, a good analogy; You get a credit card with 10.000$ on it, max it out and have to repay the debt next month. However, you have endless credit cards, so you can get another credit card and ""pay"" the 10.000$ with that. The debt is still there, its just getting passed. You can do that forever. Now you need more money, so you do this all over again and keep digging the grave deeper and deeper. In this theory, multiple times the float and continuing. In order to stop that, you have to lock the float entirely, which is why everyone is currently directly registering their shares.* ***IF*** *this is true, I do not have to explain the potential outcome. There is simply too much proof.*

*Computershare confirmed this.*  
*Quote from their Twitter: ""Shares held directly on the books of US companies through a transfer agent are not held at DTCC. As such, shares are not available to be loaned for any means within the security markets. Computershare is a registered transfer agent, therefore does not lend shares in any capacity.""*

*Cheers, have a nice week everyone!*"

Salesforce was always sort of a wall street hype stock, when they hit a $100B market cap around 06/2018, they had $11B in annual Rev and $3.6B per quarter for an ~8 price-to-sales.  In fact, in all their years public they never really broke through a 11 p/s ratio and to their credit, like ADBE, AMZN and other successful companies they actually grew into their valuations.

SNOW is almost at $100B with $270 mil per quarter.  Price to sales is around 100.  See the problem?

Others:

BILL - $28B market - 110 p/s

DDOG - $44B market - 55 p/s

ZS - $37B - 60 p/s

OKTA - $39B - 33 p/s

CRWD, COUP, SHOP, MDB, DOCU, DOCS, NET, MNDY, TEAM, U, etc

There are plenty more.. Zoom peaked in Oct of 2020 at a \~70 p/s and has been on a downslide since then. 

I think we‚Äôre a quarter of two away from a major crash in software. The pump can‚Äôt go on forever.

For anyone such as myself who likes Palantir, Snowflake and other data/AI companies, C3.ai is in a great position to be bought right now.

The company is [led by Thomas Siebel](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quickerbettertech/2020/11/19/on-crm-tom-siebel-is-back-and-hes-working-with-microsoft/?sh=5859683d341f), and while he is kind of older and approaching retirement age, you cannot overlook him. He is the man who invented CRM‚Äôs, which are the software such as Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics that drive most major corporations.

What he is doing with this company is creating usable AI for companies, which he likes to repeatedly call ‚Äúturnkey solutions‚Äù. Essentially this means AI programs that simpleton operators in big companies can use without any serious coding or programming.

Basically, C3.ai is doing what Palantir does, but their focus is making plug and play programs, instead of relying heavily on forward deployed engineers.

Of course, what really matters here is are these empty promises and big dreams, or does the software actually work?

Well the contracts and partnerships they have developed would certainly suggest that their software friggen works.

They aren‚Äôt doing this work alone, they are partnered with many serious players:

# 

# CRM‚Äôs:

To make AI tools that are usable with CRM‚Äôs such as Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics, they have officially partnered with **Microsoft and Adobe**. Microsoft went a step further and purchased some shares during the IPO last summer.

Note, through their partnership with Microsoft, they are not competing with Salesforce, they are working with Salesforce.

And this software is not in development, it just became available.

*Partnership source:* [*https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/26/c3-ai-microsoft-and-adobe-combine-forces-to-re-invent-crm-with-ai/*](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/26/c3-ai-microsoft-and-adobe-combine-forces-to-re-invent-crm-with-ai/)*Launch source:* [*https://c3.ai/c3-ai-announces-general-availability-of-c3-ai-crm/*](https://c3.ai/c3-ai-announces-general-availability-of-c3-ai-crm/)

# 

# Energy:

To make AI tools that are usable in oil and gas, they partnered with **Baker Hughes**, and that software has been adopted by other oil and gas companies such as **Shell** and MEG. And obviously it works, because after their initial trial, Shell went ahead and renewed their commitment with them for 5 years.

*5 year renewal source:* [*https://ir.c3.ai/news/news-details/2021/C3-AI-and-Shell-Extend-Strategic-Collaboration-to-Reshape-Global-Energy-and-Resource-Industries-with-Enterprise-AI/default.aspx*](https://ir.c3.ai/news/news-details/2021/C3-AI-and-Shell-Extend-Strategic-Collaboration-to-Reshape-Global-Energy-and-Resource-Industries-with-Enterprise-AI/default.aspx)

# 

# National Defense:

To make national defense tools, they are working with both the **US Air Force**, and the **Missile Defense Agency**, to create AI tools used for diagnostics on aircraft, and ballistics for a missile defense system.

Note, the Missile Defense Agency has the ambitious goal of creating an advanced system that would protect USA from airborne missile attacks. Basically, they are trying to create an iron dome comparable to what Israel is using to defend itself from Palestinian terrorists.

&#x200B;

# Autonomous Packaging:

Now today, they just announced that they have expanded into technology that will obviously be useful in ALL retail. They just signed a deal to help develop autonomous packaging with one of the largest aluminum packaging companies in the world, **Ball Corporation, who does $12B** in annual revenue at 60 international locations.

*Ball Corporation source:* [*https://c3.ai/c3-ai-to-enable-ambitious-sustainability-and-energy-efficiency-goals-with-aluminium-beverage-packaging-category-leader/*](https://c3.ai/c3-ai-to-enable-ambitious-sustainability-and-energy-efficiency-goals-with-aluminium-beverage-packaging-category-leader/)

&#x200B;

# Cloud Computing:

C3.ai‚Äôs products are now being carried by both **Google Cloud and Snowflake**. Both of those companies are offering C3.ai‚Äôs products to their customers to work with their platforms, and both of those companies have an incentive to help sell the product. Google Cloud‚Äôs CEO has done a TV interview with C3, stating that they intend to use Google Clouds 2000 person sales team to get people using C3 on google servers.

*Google source:* [*https://c3.ai/google-cloud-and-c3-ai-create-industry-first-alliance-to-accelerate-enterprise-ai/*](https://c3.ai/google-cloud-and-c3-ai-create-industry-first-alliance-to-accelerate-enterprise-ai/)

*Snowflake source:* [*https://c3.ai/c3-ai-and-snowflake-partner-to-deliver-next-generation-enterprise-ai-applications-at-scale/*](https://c3.ai/c3-ai-and-snowflake-partner-to-deliver-next-generation-enterprise-ai-applications-at-scale/)

&#x200B;

So the question is this if these companies and organizations see value in C3‚Äôs software, why the hell is it valued so much lower than Palantir and Snowflake:

* Microsoft
* Google
* Adobe
* Shell
* Baker Hughes
* US Air Force
* Missile Defense Agency

&#x200B;

**Some key fundamental facts:**

* The stock is down 75% from it‚Äôs meme mania highs, and looks like it has technically bottomed out.
* They have $1B of cash on hand, with like a $37M burn rate. They have LOTS of runway.
* They are actually ‚Äústructurally profitable‚Äù meaning they have a large margin on their cost of goods sold, but their loss is directly attributable to the money being spent on marketing and sales, which the CEO rightly defends as a smart investment.
* YOY revenue is up 29% in the last quarter.
* They operate in the large customer space like Palantir, and their enterprise AI customers grew 85% to 98 in the last quarter. With the recent announcements, they are likely over 100 now.

ok4l9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ok4l9c/i_analyzed_the_performance_of_companies_in_the/,I analyzed the performance of companies in the ‚Äúbest places to work list‚Äù over the past 10 years and benchmarked it against S&P 500. Here are the results.,701,122,2021-07-14 21:42:01,"**Preamble:** Every year Fortune publishes the top 100 companies to work for in the world. The results are based on an anonymous survey conducted on over half a million employees.

I wanted to check whether companies where people are the happiest to work produced better returns for their shareholders when compared to the market. My hypothesis is based on two assumptions

a. An employee would create his/her best possible output when they truly love the place they work

b. Companies with excellent culture would create a feedback loop to attract top talent by word of mouth and referrals.

I feel that both of these factors would contribute to the company innovating over their competitors and creating outsized investor returns.

**Data:** There are a lot of players that create the best companies to work for list. I chose Fortune as they are the most established company and have been doing this over the past 20 years. Their survey sample size is also very high (more than 5,00,000 anonymous responders), which would give us a fair representation and minimize the chances of false positives.

For this analysis, I took companies present in the best places to work for list in the last 10 years (2012-2021). But, not all the companies on the list are public and listed. So, the current analysis will only focus on the companies whose shares are listed.

All the data used in the analysis is shared in a Google sheet at the end.

**Analysis Methodology:** Every year Fortune publishes its result on the 2nd week of February. I have considered two different ways to invest in the best companies to work

a. You invest in the company as soon as the list comes out and hold for 1 year and then sell and repeat this every year

b. You invest in the company and hold (This is based on the assumption that company culture does not change year over year and once the company makes it into a list, it‚Äôs a good long-term investment)

Returns from the above strategies are then compared to the S&P 500 returns \[1\] over the same period.

**Results**

https://preview.redd.it/fxgwbdq9m6b71.png?width=1032&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a26a48dd0922c14776c97a6fab8ba706315aadd

The companies in the best places to work consistently beat S&P500 in stock returns. There is a noticeable difference in return as you move up the list with the best place to work (Rank-1) beating the market comfortably by 9.5% every year! \[2\]. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/uxfqsqebm6b71.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=93e4c7d47160e3accf8fbc845417413ef3e367a4)

The difference in returns becomes more noticeable if you buy and hold the company for the long term. Here we can see a steady increase in returns as you move up the ranking ladder with the top company returning a whopping 131.5% more than the index over the last 10 years. This also validates our assumption that companies having great cultures create superior investor returns over the long term.

Now that it‚Äôs out of the way, we can dive deeper into the data and find out which stocks made the best returns and how your returns would have faired over the years.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/4s97sp3dm6b71.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f5aa6f005cc1f72f5acb30c5f15180567ac27a0)

The best long-term return among the top companies to work for was generated by Adobe! The stock has returned 1762% over the last 10 years. As expected, tech companies have generated the most amount of returns with Microsoft, Google, and Adobe all present multiple times.

For our final analysis, we can check if the returns were consistent throughout the years or was it just a few years that are contributing to the overall positive results.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/tcry8ieem6b71.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=48368f25abadca99ca2f9e7ba0184b10b3b45d13)

I think this graph shows one of the most important takeaways from this analysis. As we can see best companies to work for have beaten SPY by a considerable margin in 8 out of the 10 years (80%) of our analysis timeframe. Even in the years that our strategy did not beat the market, the difference between the returns was negligible.

**Conclusion**

No matter how you slice it, the above analysis shows that companies that are exceptional places to work create exceptional returns to their shareholders.

I think this ties in nicely with our initial hypothesis that companies having great culture will have happy employees that create the best possible results and also would attract top talent. Both of these in turn would lead to market-beating shareholder returns.

Now you know what to do when the next year's results come out!

**Footnotes**

\[1\] I have considered the benchmark as S&P500 as the Best Companies to Work for list contains companies across industries and I think that S&P500 is a fairer representation of the overall list.

\[2\] 6 out of the last 10 years, the top company to work for was Google.

# TL;DR

`Heutagogy - self-determined learning, is a student-centered instructional strategy that emphasizes the development of autonomy, capacity, and capability`

`Pedagogy - the method and practice of teaching, especially as an academic subject or theoretical concept.`

Roblox is fundamentally an education company that encourages students to learn modern-day equivalents of typing on a computer. These skills involve things like learning how to code, develop art, or strong communication skills. =

# Purpose

To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here. WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts can crush Wall Street analysts at places like Morningstar or M-Fool. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation or cooperation.

* Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**
* How do we compare social media incentives? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**
* What really is customer service? **(GameStop DD Complete)**
* Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(Kansas City Southern Rail DD Complete)**
* What are elements behind US lagging industrial sector? **(Autodesk DD Complete)**
* Do we understand the consequences of STEAM education (Science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics)? **(YOU ARE HERE)**
* Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? **(Cloud Compute DD in Progress)**
* How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sharing my writing. I‚Äôm not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.

# Video Games & Heutagogic Learning

It appears clear these days that video games are the most dominant form of media. This is because the video game industry can better access and more aggressively capture our high-barrier entry need for adventure and journey. Other industries compete with this element but ultimately place their customers in the spectator's seat. For example:

1. The short stories on social media like Snapchat, Instagram, Youtube, or Twitter.
2. The hero tales created by Disney or Netflix.

&#x200B;

[Gaming as the leader in entertainment or media](https://preview.redd.it/xms6g6ksvpt61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=e84e0655c99280e464931f3da513e33404fbdee6)

One must remember that the attention-economy fundamentally depends on on key metric: **engagement**. It is no secret why organizations like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, or even Tesla have further intersected with gaming in aggressive maneuvers in recent years as a result of this economic condition. Gaming is a big winner of the attention-economy and often sits at the frontier of new economies.  When looking at age, gaming or other medias can be the shortest path to reaching new or lifelong customers. It is a lucrative and difficult position to acquire or maintain.

&#x200B;

Think of it historically; during the first iterations of the web, many customers were fearful of putting credit-card information online while online gaming companies have ventured into selling branded debit cards that sold to children and youth that otherwise did not have access to banking. Roblox takes this nature a step further by effectively defining and supporting Robux-to-fiat economy as the lifeblood of the company.

&#x200B;

[First generation fintech and banking services](https://preview.redd.it/72qme0crxpt61.png?width=353&format=png&auto=webp&s=cadb26b801c61afe73a8a96cb16a0024c66e316b)

I‚Äôve discussed internet media, user incentives, and their distinctions in a previous DD involving Pinterest. To highlight one of main ideas:

>""An internet forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. In my view, it ranks like the following list, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:

1. Google is fueled by customer‚Äôs need for answered information.
2. Online video games are fueled by a customer‚Äôs need for adventure.
3. Reddit is fueled by a customer‚Äôs need for community.
4. Pinterest is fueled by a customer‚Äôs need for ideas.
5. Facebook is fueled by a customer‚Äôs need to connect.""

In this DD, I would argue that gaming is one of the most comprehensive applications of internet forums that can encapsulate all of the needs above and dig deeper into the ideas that drive it.

&#x200B;

[The investment incentive: low barrier to entry & decentralized game development](https://preview.redd.it/hmibns2pzpt61.png?width=1303&format=png&auto=webp&s=a08c1a1680665d6f9272f3cff8ab19bb68f3f3ed)

I typically do not like to assert authority on a subject when I write DD, but I feel that in this case it is necessary due to an enormous complexities behind education technology, what's wrong with it, and what needs to be corrected.  In short, my view is that video games are one of the most powerful ways to engage students in a meaningful and long-lasting education, ranging from social to reading skills.

&#x200B;

[Heutagogic learning](https://preview.redd.it/rq9dxj9yzpt61.png?width=591&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4fbe53adde74b85313ca4dca53077e14de64983)

Online games fulfill a similar shortcoming that traditional medias fail in regards to adventure or journey.  In the same fashion, education and the art of teaching generally stutters when the student remains a spectator for too long.  What gaming achieves as an education service are all the critical requirements of a healthy STEM education:

&#x200B;

1. The ability to inspire curiosity and confidence.
2. The ability to deeply engage.
3. The ability to produce imagination or creativity.

Some of us may scoff about this, but there is a lot of truth to this sentiment that I believe many would agree with. For many early online child gamers, skills like typing quickly, bartering, multiplying, reading comprehension, or the desire to pursue arts originates from our time spent engaged by video games.

This is the goal and nature of heutagogic learning. This nature extends to adulthood, as many of us experienced this phenomenon while learning about advanced financial instruments for the sake of ""learning the game""  of stock market investing. We spend time scowering through forums and generating a community no different than that of popular online games.  Many of us have even acquired generational knowledge as a result of this media condition. We have met the proper requirements and incentives for a STEM education at scale.

[Andragogic\/Heutagogic learning at scale](https://preview.redd.it/gplo1bx41qt61.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=715bae2a0ff447bd5d21569bcac401c636c69dae)

I could talk length about this subject alone, but simply put, the world is not quite ready to accept such an idea. Games are still seen as entertainment, but it typically evolves each generation. In my generation, three societal transformations occurred:

1. It stopped being weird to purchase in-game cosmetics.
2. The idea of watching others play video games was normalized.
3. E-Sports became popular and inspired a new economy.

&#x200B;

[Second generation online gaming](https://preview.redd.it/4bt555i62qt61.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c281084802f3ff72cb8143b40761bde4fa9e5ed)

Some of these resistances are interesting when you look at it from a simpler lens. Why was it weird to watch others play video games online, when it was seemingly normal to watch someone play Dance Dance Revolution in an arcade or an older sibling progress through a game? Why was it strange to purchase cosmetic goods where we spend a large percentage of our time in digital worlds? Why was it bizarre to see dedicated players compete at global levels when gaming and online access became a worldwide normalcy? Usually there is no good reason for the psychological resistance to change.

Yet here we are, playing and learning effectively one of the most popular mobile games in the US.

&#x200B;

# STEAM Pedagogy - Arts in STEM

&#x200B;

[STEAM pedagogy for architecture, engineering, or construction](https://preview.redd.it/b57peu7j2qt61.png?width=2782&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e6ce51e01691091ff6dbeee88ff1dad985a2ff7)

With that idea covered, I want to transition to examine one of the leading pedagogies in US education, which is the inclusion of arts in STEM, known as a STEAM pedagogy.  It may not be immediately clear why the inclusion is such a drastic change to STEM, but one should consider several factors:

1. STEM education standards are poor with low engagement (a societal problem)
2. Good science and engineering requires confident students (resisting imposter syndrome)
3. STEM requires creativity and imagination (critical thinking requisites)

&#x200B;

[Game development, code, or design](https://preview.redd.it/556dqhnp3qt61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6b4a2ac6c89a435890fcd01210026208aae9337)

What an arts education does is fundamentally produce new language and learning skills that are actively applied in a STEM education. Typically speaking, arts is also far more engaging to youth while traditional STEM learning models can carry less obvious inherent incentives.

However, slowly but surely, we are beginning to see students who seek to learn digital art, coding, investing and other STEAM-derived interests that can transition into other branches of STEM as a result of incentivizing the desire to learn these skills.

A young Roblox game developer is only a short path away from finding a passion in architecture or cloud computing. This strategy is not new and has had success for organizations like Adobe, Microsoft, Autodesk, and other technical skills. These are largely andragogic forms of learning, or adult-centered educations.

&#x200B;

One of the most significant accomplishments of the inclusion of Arts in a STEM-centered education is the inversion of a question that afflicted many classrooms for generations:

>‚ÄúWhy do I need to learn this?‚Äù

It turns out, the answer is not

>‚Äúso you can become a scientist!‚Äù

but to provide an environment that encourages and incentivizes a proper learner's mentality

>‚ÄúI need to learn this, so that I can create that.‚Äù

&#x200B;

Engineers and scientists are simply disciplined creators no different than an artist or performer. However, there are significant and clear barriers to entry to STEM-based and Arts-based learning. It is far more pragmatic for a child to inspire creative behaviors with a canvas, skateboard, or instrument while the barrier to entry for engineering practices may be far less accessible.

Some of this is partially a consequence of time, where there has been less knowledge transfer on writing software vs. writing prose and some of these barriers have compounding consequences at the socioeconomic level.  For example, there is a large disparity in big tech hirings, and such consequences can carry over to other multi-trillion dollar industries driven by infrastructure and Green New Deal policies.

&#x200B;

[Socioeconomic consequences in education support](https://preview.redd.it/t2mh2ikz3qt61.png?width=987&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ed2aadf47bb21e36d44864efe58303c20119d74)

Another huge barrier to entry to STEM is simply the fact that many students do not believe in themselves or have not been encouraged to imagine that they are capable of achieving success in subjects like mathematics and science, so there is an enormous amount of undue self-filtering in the field. Learning how to dance is a far more engaging practice to a child, while learning how to code in some developer environment without the proper incentive may seem pointless. Organizations like Roblox can and are changing the equation for some students.

You may be at a loss at this point, but it's worth taking the time to simply ponder on this and what it means economically for Roblox. The language used here is directly aligned with the language used in the Roblox S-1 registration document:

1. Inspiration mentioned 9 times.
2. Create and inspiration mentioned 75 times.
3. Engagement mentioned 160 times.

This language is particular due to the game identifying with its original iteration, Interactive Physics, an education game that launched in 1989.

>""The story of Roblox began in 1989 when our founders, David Baszucki and Erik Cassel, programmed a 2D simulated physics lab called Interactive Physics, which would later go on to influence our approach to building the groundwork for Roblox. Students across the world used Interactive Physics to see how two cars would crash, or how they could build destructible houses. In starting Roblox in 2004, we wanted to replicate the inspiration of imagination and creativity we saw in Interactive Physics on a much grander scale by ushering in a new category of human interaction that did not exist at the time.""

&#x200B;

[1989](https://preview.redd.it/s0pl9rby5qt61.png?width=583&format=png&auto=webp&s=2aba26a92988fee33e889e1bc394a3a226216978)

&#x200B;

# The Roblox Vision

>""We focus our business on our developers, creators, and users, and acting in their interests in the long-term may conflict with the short-term expectations of analysts and investors.""

&#x200B;

[EBP - Engagement Based Payouts started in 2020](https://preview.redd.it/z63prfzr6qt61.png?width=467&format=png&auto=webp&s=faad3efe3a156c1f26e4adadefb20346466bb37e)

Understanding the nature of modern-day cloud computing and its future direction will allow investors to understand the paths that Roblox will take. The fundamental theory of this economy is that a customer's data is an increasingly tangible asset. The way that I like to examine the economic output of this industry is by two core economic elements.

1. The value of work generated by machine-to-machine transactions (network output).
2. The value of data and services generated by human experiences (customer input).

[Serverless computing - network service architecture for real-time and powerful apps.](https://preview.redd.it/wl88yq547qt61.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&s=618f6be99e0b7cc157065b4505cb82d7f89d5e36)

There are many organizations that capture the essence of this industry. Organizations like Square and Zoom will provide services that we're all familiar with, but we often forget the under-hood-details that exist and govern the infrastructure of these companies. What cloud computing organizations have realized is that as our engagement with platforms increases, the value of our data and needs becomes increasingly tangible. Our needs for financial technology or property rentals have resulted in regulatory or social challenges, which we typically refer to as ""disruption"". The disruption is rooted in the fact that our data is an authentically tangible good.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This idea that our data and time spent on digital platforms is the central hypothesis behind creation of the robux system that Roblox lives on. There are many things that Roblox needs to accomplish in the near to short term to achieve long-term profitability and the leadership seems to have a clear vision on how to achieve that:

1. The company will continue to redistribute its wealth back toward its developers.
2. The company will aggressively invest in education sectors to incentivize students to learn valuable skills.
3. The company will support wildly successful games as a way to create a long-term identity for Roblox (like popular Nintendo games)
4. The company will continue to invest in its cloud platform and eventually develop its own hardware platform to reduce its expenses.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jr21jf1b8qt61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8175cc302d2be55fe0e446f0b78dc71d6f1d4956

The reason that I'm certain of this is because the organization needs to accomplish the following incentives and financial feats:

1. Reached a large enough audience in order to maintain long-term relevancy.
2. Produced and support games that create enough incentive to join the platform.
3. Created enough incentives for developers to produce quality experiences.

&#x200B;

>""Roblox has a vibrant economy built on a currency called Robux, which can be purchased through the Roblox Client and website. Users can also acquire Robux through a monthly subscription to Roblox  
>  
>Premium. Developers and creators earn Robux by selling access to virtual content. Developers can also earn Robux by driving engagement of Premium subscribers through an engagement-based payout system. When Premium subscribers spend time in a developer‚Äôs experience, that developer earns a prorated share of the user‚Äôs monthly subscription fee. Engagement-based payouts incentivize developers to invest in the engagement of their experiences. Roblox allows developers and creators to convert earned Robux into the real-world currency of their choice through our Developer Exchange Program.""

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h95ts6pt8qt61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0406e17772f8f302bfdc4beb4eee288509e07440

In my view, Roblox's 2020 premium payout system will be one the biggest shifts in media as it has many potential outcomes that we aren't fully implemented yet. This is the nature of certain powerful architectures like computing more data at the edge or leaning on services like Fastly, Amazon Fargate, or other serverless/back-end platforms. Roblox is no such stranger to this and I would say that they certaintly have a vested interest in pushing these kinds of interactions.

Some uses cases of engagement-based payouts are repeatable to other platforms, where organizations like Reddit could easily implement similar financial logic if they discover that Reddit Subscribers spend the majority of their time to a small concentration of subreddits. This already exists to an extent, where users represent engagement through coin-sharing and reddit emoji placements.

Another example, if a high-quality education game were to be released on Roblox, where the developer agrees to redistribute their earned Robux to schools in need, then Roblox has achieved an economy where a student who is spending time learning has resulted in the improvement or construction of other learning facilities. This is also reflective of the idea that data is increasingly tangible.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bb9j3yj7aqt61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=8308e21dd05757fa74928a26560f665d0d61bf12

The possibilities with an engagement-based payout system are enormous for Roblox and produces added value to the ideas behind things like virtual concerts, streams, or other experiences that aren't fully realized in the gaming sector. For example, what is the economic consequence of children having a safe environment to attend concerts of their favorite artists? At the same time, the Robux payout system is a non-trivial distance away from creating applications of other alternative currencies like exchanging Robux with other digital assets like VBucks, tickets, or block-you-know-what-based applications.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1g33ivkwaqt61.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6ff4e2b37801f0ee02fa70d46b8fa636bc5455b

Another core element to Roblox's financial future is to ultimately secure its means of distribution. As it currently stands, the biggest expense to the Roblox platform is the fee processing it must agree to when it comes to doing business with organizations like Apple, Microsoft, Google, and other payment processors like Visa and Paypal. One way to reduce these costs and increase profitability is to develop products akin to the Nintendo Switch or Oculus platform. This idea is not too far away given the nature of Roblox's business, which has an enormous amount of various types of games that would be well-suited by Roblox partnerships. Overtime, the value of Apple or Google's distribution power weakens as the company cements itself into public consciousness.

&#x200B;

The company has alluded to this idea with an April fool's joke in 2019, with a console known as the imagination-powered Robox:

>"" At Roblox, we‚Äôre continuously exploring new and innovative ways to bring our platform to millions of people across the world. Just as we‚Äôve expanded onto phones, tablets, the Xbox One, and virtual reality, we believe that there‚Äôs an even greater potential just waiting to be unlocked. A new way to experience all your favorite Roblox games. A new way to connect with your friends. A new way to make your dreams a reality in stunning, 8K ultra-high definition graphics and at greater than 120 frames per second.  
>  
>Welcome to a new era of interactive entertainment. This is **Robox**.""

# Conclusion

There was a lot of ground to cover here so let's briefly review. Gaming is arguably the best form of media in the attention-economy where Roblox identifies itself at the intersection of education and digital media development.

A significant portion of the education sector is focused on STEAM pedagogy which aligned with and supported by Roblox goals long-term. Roblox is able to leverage cloud computing to disrupt traditional models in gaming, education, financial technology, and imagination markets.

# TL;DR

Meaningful, sustainable, long-term employment.

The current administration and Federal Reserve are continuing to progress in setting the stage for long-term investments in the American economy. In combination with the USMCA trade deal of 2020, the US will see 250B in investments per year for 8 years in infrastructure spending. We take a look at how Autodesk is a core benefactor of the economic models that govern these investments. I expect Autodesk to triple in size by 2024.

[Autodesk Revenues](https://preview.redd.it/aj4qbyf05zq61.png?width=1276&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfff18884011a16bded7ba20d46e3772fad4a6fe)

# Purpose

To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here. WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts tend to run head-to-head with Wall Street analysts. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation.

\- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**

\- How do we compare social media incentives? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**

\- What really is customer service? **(GameStop DD Complete)**

\- Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(Kansas City Southern Rail DD Complete)**

**-** What are elements behind US lagging industrial sector? **(You are here)**

\- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? *(Cloud Compute DD in Progress)*

\- Do we understand the consequences of STEAM education (Science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics)? *(Roblox DD in Progress)*

\- How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sharing my writing. I‚Äôm not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.

# The Employment Problem

>The **Fourth Industrial Revolution** (or **Industry 4.0**) is the ongoing automation of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices, using modern smart technology. Large-scale machine-to-machine communication (M2M) and the internet of things (IoT) are integrated for increased automation, improved communication and self-monitoring, and production of smart machines that can analyze and diagnose issues without the need for human intervention.

&#x200B;

[A Skill Gap Problem](https://preview.redd.it/sbi6dmoy6zq61.png?width=711&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cad0f9dc367ce723290f7ae65f97f702812041d)

Ultimately, the US is doing a pretty good job at maintaining  its engineering and architecture sectors, but there has been a glaring issue with a skill-gap that effects certain regions more than others. This is largely due to the strained relationship between increase automation vs. difficulty of learning the new tools associated with automation. People get left behind, especially when employment is lost in one factory and a worker is left to join another manufacturer with different standards, machines, or tools. In a nutshell, the barrier to entry for sustainable employment in the industrial sector has gone up in almost every facet.

Tools like Autodesk sit at the heart of these kinds of problems, where being able to understand and utilize a tool like Autodesk will dramatically increase your ability to get hired. In the information age, skills associated with Autodesk are ultimately as valuable as learning how to code in software or knowing the value of legislation and finance in other white-collar sectors. Autodesk lags behind these competitive sectors because the nature of industry it exists in with high capital expenditures.

The problem is a bottleneck problem, and solving the bottleneck will produce a far leaner and more efficient pipeline for industrial productivity, employment, and societal satisfaction.

[Autodesk's recognition of its role, alongside organizations like Adobe.](https://preview.redd.it/kvm8z2md8zq61.png?width=1588&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6d865498e39ddeff11d800b4e8e904d6137539c)

# The Education Solution

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ly24pppuezq61.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ab25ce2945104acb0f3c4d3816cb713db1af238

The reality here is that the education sector is also a slow-mover where shortcuts carry heavy competitive consequences. Another big element in this process is that high-level skills are ultimately dependent on adoption and communication demands. We need adaptable engineers to be familiar with a fundamental skill set that speak similar ""languages"". Autodesk has generally positioned itself to be one of those tools in a similar way that organizations like Adobe has positioned itself.

What I believe will happen is that the incentive of certifications and accelerated programs will increase dramatically as a way to boost lucrative employment and adoption of skills. These training programs will effectively become tickets initiate a good career.

# AutoDesk's Role

AutoDesk targets the EAC sector (engineering, architecture, and construction), so it helps to think about AutoDesk as software that can handle large scale developments focusing on the nature of smaller designs like intricate screws or cars. There is a lot of work that must be completed, with a strong societal demand. This can range from multi-year developments of hospital building in rural areas, or the construction of off-shore windmill farms. This inevitably creates a powerful compounding effect with employment and Autodesk's subscription model and increasing mobile capacities.

\- As employment increases, subscriptions begin to increase.

\- As subscription increases, projects of scale are adopted.

\- As projects of scale increase, employment increases.

\- As employment increases, the length of subscription increases.

The following is a list of Autodesk's relationship with various opportunities in the near and longterm.

\- **LEED architecture certification in civil sectors with Autodesk's architecture platform, Revit.**

>**Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design** (**LEED**) is a green building certification program used worldwide. Developed by the non-profit U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) it includes a set of rating systems for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of green buildings, homes, and neighborhoods which aims to help building owners and operators be environmentally responsible and use resources efficiently.

QNX is generally regarded among engineers as the most advanced, stable and secure operating system in the world. As such it is trusted by the likes of NASA for mission critical operations, large nuclear power stations, factories, high-speed train control systems, and an endless array of embedded systems that require 0% downtime. QNX has earned its reputation and many in the computer industry believe that if QNX had chosen to compete with Microsoft and Apple and pursue a consumer sales route rather than an enterprise route, the world of computing would be generations ahead of where it is now. 

So what makes it so great? QNX is built on a micro-kernel, which means that the core component of the OS (the kernel) only contains the bare minimum amount of code that can provide the mechanisms required to run an operating system. The remaining functions in a typical kernel (Monolithic OS) such as the filesystem, device drivers, application IPC, etc. are instead run outside of the kernel in the user space. Essentially what this means is that the kernel is the only software executing at the most privileged hardware level and is therefore infinitely more secure and stable. Bad drivers, software or executions can‚Äôt bring it down.

Micro-kernels also allow for RTOS, which simply means an operating system with guaranteed consistency for how long it takes to accept and complete a task. For a real-life scenario, think about the ABS brakes on a car ‚Äì they require mission critical specifications to occur in real-time or someone can die, so the system running them has to be able to guarantee the delivery, receipt and execution of messages in X amount of time or it does not qualify at RT.

The benefits of this architecture are too numerous to get into here, but one of the main benefit to RIM is its ability to execute multiple platform runtimes at the same time with high efficiency ‚Äì this is why you can write an application in C/C++, Adobe AIR, Webworks HTML5, and Java and have them all run natively on BlackBerry 10. The benefit to developers and consumers here cannot be understated. Basically ANYONE with any amount of programming experience can make an app, from high-level web based UI‚Äôs to low-level 3D games.

QNX takes their design one step further by also offering POSIX support, which is a family of IEEE standards that helps maintain OS and software compatibility. Being a full POSIX system, and not partly POSIX, ensures it‚Äôs a lot easier to develop software for the QNX platform."
