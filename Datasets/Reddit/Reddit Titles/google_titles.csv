1. U.S. stocks late dive! Dow down 0.25% to halt six-game winning streak

The three major U.S. stock indices opened lower, the S&P and Nasdaq turned lower in the last few minutes of Thursday's trading session, and the Dow Jones also ended its six-game winning streak. By the close of trading, the Dow Jones fell 0.25%, the S&P 500 fell 0.30%, and the Nasdaq fell 0.16%.

The performance of large U.S. technology stocks was not satisfactory. Sorted by market cap, Apple fell 0.66%, Microsoft fell 0.77%, Google A fell 0.34%, Amazon fell 0.33%, Tesla fell 1.46%, Nvidia fell 1.38%, and only Meta rose 0.41%.

Usually, U.S. stocks will rise in the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year, a phenomenon known as the ""Christmas market. The lower-than-average trading volume, combined with the fact that many investors are closed for the holidays, can lead to increased trading volatility. Some companies are also adjusting their portfolios at the end of the year.

2. The popular Chinese stocks closed Thursday's big rise highway up more than 21%

Popular Chinese stocks closed up sharply on Thursday, with Gao Tou, Ai Qi Yi and Beili Beili leading the way; the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index closed up 9.40%, the biggest one-day gain since 2008.

Highway rose more than 21%, Akiyip and AutoChina rose more than 13%, Beili Beili, Vipshop and Shell rose more than 12%, Alibaba and Funhead rose more than 9%, and NetEase rose nearly 9%.

4. Thursday U.S. oil closed 0.6% higher, approaching $ 77 per barrel

U.S. crude oil futures prices closed higher on Thursday. Oil prices were supported by easing market concerns that the mutated strain of Omicron is hampering economic recovery and signs that crude oil inventories are falling.

On Thursday, West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures for February delivery rose 43 cents, or 0.6 percent, to close at $76.99 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Brent crude oil futures for February delivery on the Intercontinental Exchange in London rose 9 cents, or 0.1 percent, to close at $79.32 a barrel. Brent crude oil futures have risen for four consecutive trading days so far.

5. Thursday gold futures closed 0.5% higher

Gold futures prices closed higher on Thursday despite a stabilizing dollar and higher U.S. stocks.

Investors believe the Omicron mutant strain is less of a threat to economic growth, pushing the dollar to stabilize on Thursday and U.S. stocks to climb, pushing the Dow and S&P 500 to new intraday highs.

6. Year-end U.S. unemployment benefits data released Gold rises U.S. bonds fell

U.S. first-time jobless claims fell unexpectedly last week, indicating that despite the outbreak of a new round of epidemics, but labor demand is still strong.

Data from the U.S. Department of Labor on Thursday showed that in the week ended Dec. 25, the number of first-time jobless claims totaled 198,000, down 8,000 from the revised level in the previous cycle. The median estimate of economists surveyed was 206,000.

**International Macro**

1. The founder of Bridgewater Dalio: the Fed may raise interest rates 4-5 times next year, which will be a sensitive issue

Rui Dalio, founder of the world's largest hedge fund Bridgewater, said in an exclusive interview that the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates 4-5 times next year until it negatively affects the stock market.

Regarding the current inflationary pressure, Dalio pointed out that the U.S. now has two types of inflation: a cyclical inflation that occurs when demand for goods and services exceeds production capacity, and a monetary inflation caused by the over-issuance of money and credit.

For the second type of inflation, he warned that if cash and bond holders were to sell these assets in a big way, the central bank would have to raise interest rates at a faster pace or keep them low by printing money and buying financial assets, and this would exacerbate inflation. This adds difficulty to the Fed's policy making.

2. The United States CDC: regardless of vaccination or not, people should avoid cruise travel

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday advised people not to travel on cruise ships, regardless of their vaccination status, as the Omicron variant swept the world with a recent sharp increase in new positive crown cases.

The CDC raised its travel advisory for cruise ships to the highest level. The agency is currently investigating or observing dozens of cruise ships with New Crown outbreaks.

The CDC warns that the New Crown virus is easily spread from person to person in close proximity on board ships and that the chances of contracting the virus on a cruise ship are very high, even with New Crown vaccinations and booster shots.

3. U.S. Cancellations Exceed 1,000 Again as Chaotic Holiday Travel Season Continues

The number of flight cancellations by U.S. airlines is still growing, with another 1,170 flights cancelled Thursday as a surge in coronavirus cases leads to severe understaffing. And the forecasted snowstorm could further disrupt travel during the New Year's holiday.

According to [FlightAware.com](https://FlightAware.com), JetBlue canceled 175 flights, or 17 percent of its scheduled flights, as of 2:27 p.m. New York time Thursday. Allegiant canceled 93 flights, or 18 percent of its scheduled flights. United Airlines canceled 197, or 9 percent of its schedule. By noon, the number of flights canceled for the day had surpassed the 1,084 canceled for the entire day on Wednesday.

This comes on the heels of thousands of U.S. flight cancellations over the Christmas weekend and into the early part of the week due to winter storms coupled with staffing shortages.

4. U.S. first-time jobless claims unexpectedly fell last week, highlighting that labor demand is still strong

The number of first-time jobless claims fell unexpectedly last week, indicating that labor demand is still strong despite the new outbreak of the epidemic.

The number of first-time jobless claims totaled 198,000 in the week ended Dec. 25, down 8,000 from a revised level in the previous cycle, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 206,000.

The number of continuing claims for unemployment benefits fell to 1.72 million in the week ended Dec. 18, the lowest since March last year.

5. The United States civil servants treatment ""peak""? U.S. media revealed that Fauci's annual pension can be $ 350,000

The report said that the U.S. government has served 55 years of Fauci for two consecutive years to become ""the highest-paid civil servants in the United States"": 2019 income of $417,000, 2020 rose to $434,000. His salary is higher than that of the president of the United States, admirals and some 4.3 million U.S. government employees.

According to Federal Personnel Administration standards, Fauci's pension is calculated as the average of his 3-year maximum earnings, multiplied by 80 percent. If he receives the same salary in 2021 and 2022 as he did in 2020, his pension could reach $347,000.

In addition, his ""long service"" can bring additional government annuity benefits, the amount is at least $ 8,344 per year.

6. Israel officially approved the opening of the fourth dose of the new crown vaccination limited to people with low immunity

In the evening of Dec. 30, local time, Nachman Ash, director general of Israel's Ministry of Health, officially approved the opening of the fourth dose of the new crown vaccination to the country's immunocompromised population, but still has not approved the opening to people over 60 years old and medical workers.

7. The European Central Bank management committee Nott: the end of bond purchases may be raised in early 2023

ECB Governing Council member Nott said the ECB is close to achieving its medium-term inflation target of 2%, and the likelihood of inflation staying above 2% in 2022 is high, although it will not be far above 2%. If prices continue to rise unexpectedly, the central bank could unwind stimulus measures sooner than it plans to now. Policy rates could rise after bond purchases end in early 2023.

8. ECB Governing Council member Vesco: 3% average inflation expected in 2022

ECB Governing Council member Vesco said inflation is expected to average 3% in 2022 and then gradually fall back to a level slightly below 2%; inflation in 2023-24 is expected to be below 2%, facing downside and upside risks.

**Company News**

1. Tesla recalls about 475,000 vehicles in the U.S., close to its total global deliveries last year

Tesla is recalling about 475,000 vehicles in the U.S., almost as many as its total global deliveries last year, due to a technical defect that could increase the risk of accidents.

Tesla plans to recall all Model 3 models built between 2017 and 2020, totaling as many as 356,309 units. The company told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that the wiring harness of the rearview camera can be damaged by opening and closing the trunk, hindering the image display.

Tesla is also recalling as many as 119,009 Model S vehicles assembled since 2014 because of a problem with the front longitudinal beam that could cause the hood to open unexpectedly, according to a separate NHTSA statement posted on its official website Thursday. The company said it will fix both problems for free.

2. The only big winner in the lack of core crisis: Tesla

The global automotive industry is affected by the ""lack of core"", but Tesla's production this year is expected to be about 80% more than last year. Because of its strong self-research chip capability and vertical integration ability, Tesla is not afraid of the ""chip shortage"" and has become the biggest winner in the industry.

3. 2021 global M&A transactions for the first time exceeded the $5 trillion mark Goldman Sachs for the fifth consecutive year to take the lead

Goldman Sachs Group is sitting at the top of the table as global M&A deals set a record in 2021.

For the fifth consecutive year, Goldman Sachs topped the list of M&A advisors based on the total dollar value of deals handled, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Goldman Sachs' top spot comes as global mergers and acquisitions and related transactions surpassed $5 trillion for the first time. The bank advised on more than $1 trillion worth of transactions, with a market share of more than 24 percent, according to the data.

4. The U.S. airline industry faces the test of the epidemic JetBlue Airways announced that it will cancel about 1,280 flights

JetBlue Airways said it is reducing its flight schedule by about 1,280 flights through Jan. 13 due to a significant increase in cases of Omicron strain infection among its crews.

A JetBlue spokesman said the number of new coronavirus cases in the northeast, where most of the company's crews are located, is expected to continue to spike over the next one to two weeks, meaning the likelihood of continued flight cancellations until the number of new cases drops.

5. Samsung denies acquisition does not matter Canaccord Genuity expects limited downside for Baiken

Canaccord Genuity analyst Sumant Kulkarni maintained a ""buy"" rating on Biogen ([BIIB.US](https://BIIB.US)) with a price target of $390.

Earlier, South Korean media reported that Samsung Group was in talks to buy Biogen, saying it was valued at about $42 billion. Subsequently, Samsung Bio, a subsidiary of Samsung, said these were untrue information.

In fairness, this does look like a categorical denial,"" Kulkarni said in a report. However, we lack the relevant language background to figure out the nuances of what was specifically identified as untrue in the Korean-language document.""

6. Employees complained that Amazon is too cold: no compensation after work injury, and not allowed to take leave

Some Amazon employees reportedly complained recently that it was difficult for them to get compensation and leave after being injured on the job.

In June this year, an analysis said that the rate of serious injuries on the job of Amazon warehouse employees is almost twice that of other companies in the industry. The data showed that in 2020, Amazon warehouse employees had an average of 5.9 ""serious"" injuries per 200,000 hours worked.

This compares to an average of 3.3 ""serious"" injuries per 200,000 hours across the warehouse industry. As one of Amazon's largest competitors in the retail industry, Walmart has 2.5 ""serious"" injuries per 200,000 hours, less than half of Amazon's serious injury rate.

This has presented buying opportunities for those who want to add to their boomer portfolios for the long-term. I've decided to analyze companies that are down 50%+ from their 52-week highs.

*Historical Revenue, EBITDA, and EBITDA Margins. 2021E - 2025E based on my own assumptions*

Sales growth from 2018 - 2019 was 17.03%, and increased by 55.16% in 2020 due to increased demand, consumer sentiment, and better margins. Over the historical period, gross margins increased from 20.55% to 27.34% and EBITDA margins increased from 6.22% to 11.84%. Net Income and Earnings per share had a significant increase primarily due to strong top-line revenue growth, gross margin expansion in both segments, expanding EBITDA with low capital expenditures, an asset light business model, and investing to consolidate market leadership.

**Q3 2021 Results**

* Corsair gained market share in almost every category through Q3 2021
* Q3 Revenue was impacted by availability of reasonably priced GPUs which curtailed the demand for new PC builds and its components
* Higher logistics costs including ocean and air freight had an impact on Q3 margins resulting in Gross Profit Margin of 25.9%
* Gaming Components and Systems segment was impacted by GPU shortages which caused retail prices to surge to 150%+ of MSRP causing many customers to hold off building a performance gaming PC
* Gamer and Creator Peripherals segment was impacted by IC shortages which caused Corsair’s premium high value products to be in limited supply. Additionally, Gross Profit Margins were impacted by increased logistics costs as well as some reduced sales in premium products
* Company refinanced LT Debt, increased revolver size, and reduced the interest rate to LIBOR + 125.0 bps

**Preliminary Risks**

* Corsair’s competitive position and success in the market depend upon the ability to build and maintain the strength of its brand among gaming enthusiasts
* Long term success and company growth depend heavily on continuous development and improvement of existing and new products
* The Company depends on the introduction and success of third-party high performance computer hardware including GPUs, CPUs, and sophisticated new video games to drive sales of its products
* Industry is highly competitive and Corsair faces intense competition for market share
* Sales depends on the growth of gaming, streaming, and eSports industries

**DCF Valuation**

https://preview.redd.it/hjdj09e3zp881.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=0460d39adfc6d85e4a4ccfbcd32417c7836cc9c1

*Base Case DCF Valuation: $28.72 / share*

*Winter's Opinion Case DCF Valuation: $42.58 / share*

Winter's Assumptions: Revenue Growth of 13.0% / 20.0% / 17.5% / 17.5% / 15.0% in projected years, EBITDA Margin 11.0% to 12.5% in projected years, Cost of Equity 10%, Terminal Value EBITDA Exit Multiple 10x (used EBITDA given CapEx estimates), $20.0MM growth capex per year, effective tax rate of 17.4%

* Commentary: Conservative growth estimates based on management expectations and industry growth. Supply chain disruptions should begin to decrease throughout 2022 and its likely GPUs and other systems will have pent-up demand over the next few quarters. The company should see a bullwhip effect in sales growth and a decrease in operating costs moving forward. Increase in stay-at-home lifestyle due to Covid-19 should help sustain sales for years to come.

**Public Comps Analysis**

Competitors: Logitech, Turtle Beach, Dell Technologies, HP Inc.

Based on Multiples (EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, Price/Earnings), CRSR share price ranges from $17.40 to $32.30 with an average estimated share price of $23.31

**Outlook and Final Thoughts**

Based on my intrinsic valuation, I believe Corsair is valued at $32.95 (average est. share price of DCF/Comps). Corsair closed at $21.17 on 12.10.2021, representing a 55% discount to my valuation. I think that Corsair is undervalued and selling at a discount. Growth stocks will continue to face problems based on inflation risk until supply chain issues are resolved. The share price may remain volatile in the coming weeks or months. I think this is a good stock to own if you're a strong believer in the gaming industry for the long term and believe that Corsair can continue to capture market share through marketing efforts and quality products.

**Disclaimer: 📈📈📈 Short term bullish play (around 3-4 weeks for y’all WSB degens)**

**This is my first big write up so please be friendly and constructive with your comments :)**

As many of you all are aware, with what seems like the 100th strain of COVID— Omicron— spreading across the world, COVID-testing kits are once again in hot demand. I’m doing this write up to explain my bullish stance on COVID test kit suppliers going forward.

**Why Test Kits :**

* It is clear that we will have to co-exist with COVID, so shutting down our economy is not an option. Thus, mass-vaccination and testing have become the optimal strategies.
* Given vaccination rates have plateaued, nation-wide testing is the best thing we can do to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic.

**Context:**

The Omicron variant, which now is the dominant (and most contagious) strain in the United States, has driven daily US COVID cases past the Delta variant’s peak. However, the United States severely lags behind European countries for COVID testing. In these countries, such test kits are ubiquitous, while there is a test kit shortage at US retailers. For instance, those in the US have to spend at least $14 for a two-pack at U.S retailers, compared with $5 or less in some countries, such as Germany (WSJ). The U.K government distributes free tests to its citizens on a weekly basis. While the countries’ differing healthcare systems contribute to this, it is undeniable that there exists a severe COVID testing shortage in the United States. In fact, President Biden admitted last week that “I wish I had thought about ordering a half a billion \[tests\] two months ago, before Covid hit here.”

As such, there should be no doubt that the United States government will become more proactive in its acquisition of test kits, emulating the U.K and other European countries, which are giving out so many free kits so people can test themselves every week.

The Biden Administration recently announced the purchase of 500 million home kits. The contracts to purchase the tests have not been finalized, but even if we were to conservatively assume an average purchase price of $15, that is $7.5 billion going into the COVID test kit supplier market. To put that into perspective, the largest federal contracts that have been granted to COVID-test manufacturers are around $500-600 million with Celltrion and Abbott.

**🚀Bottomline🚀: Omicron is SPREADING FAST, and the lack of supply for test kits creates an asymmetric demand/supply relationship, with the government compounding the price inelasticity of demand. The few companies that are able to supply up-to-par test kits have strong pricing power.**

&#x200B;

[COVID cases in the past 2 years](https://preview.redd.it/9ludt4jjyo881.png?width=1112&format=png&auto=webp&s=b35b068d85a84b3732276038d562cdaa4e621ff6)

**Overview of COVID Test Manufacturing Market:**

The market is pricing for a mild growth in the next two years yet underestimated the recent momentum. The testing trend is top-down and is only beginning to develop. First, the DoD or HHS will start granting generous contracts to vamp up manufacturing capacity; as Omicron continues to spread, businesses and organizations will purchase large quantities of tests for their employees to minimize disruption from the pandemic; massive and regular testing will become the norm: households and businesses will order tests in bulk orders on a regular basis.

**💎 Why Should I Invest In Cue Health ($HLTH) 💎 ?**

Out of the various COVID testing manufacturers, Cue Health ($HLTH) is one of the best out there with over $480 million in federal contracts as well as To-B contracts with Google, Mayo Clinic, the NBA, Canada Air etc. Rather than making antigen rapid tests, Cue developed the NAAT (Nucleic Acid Amplification) testing method. As of this moment, Cue is the only NAAT test manufacturer that has developed its own integrated platform solution and can manufacture in-house. Mayo Clinic conducted thorough research and concluded that Cue’s home testing kits results have a 98% match (vs. \~85% sensitivity for Antigen tests) with PCR Lab results.

TLDR: Cue’s testing method is revolutionary by producing testing results virtually identical to those conducted in a professional lab in under 20 minutes ❗️❗️

As a result of its superior testing capacity, Cue Health demands a high premium for its kits, which so far its clients (the federal government, premier healthcare providers, prestigious national sports leagues etc.) are willing to pay for. Aside from its top-notch caliber of clientele, Cue’s 60% GM and 10%+ NI business, along with their recent IPO, will inject them with enough cash to expand on their product offerings outside of Covid testing. This will in turn generate more cash to capitalize even more on their superior technology, creating an upward flywheel effect.

Moreover, it is very likely that Cue Health will be one of the beneficiaries (gain new federal contracts) under the recent initiatives from the Biden Administration. Its $481 mill contracts last year in October include both capex on new manufacturing facilities and $6 mill testing kits. The company sees its capex expand rapidly in that quarter from $4.8 million to $30.5 million in Q1FY21 and 27.1 million in Q2. Since Capex decreased to $19.3 million next quarter, we can reasonably estimate that total capex will be south of 100 mill, since the company will finish ramping up its manufacturing capacity within a year. This implies that each testing kit for Cue costs around $60 (way higher than the average Antigen kit). Given that their 12-month TTM revenue of $438.9 million and the majority of their revenue is, for now, federal contracts, it can be estimated that they’ve at least delivered 4 million testing kits as of today. It is very likely that they will gain a decent piece of the 500-million testing kits federal contract.

**🌑 The Bear Case🌑:**

South Africa’s decline in COVID cases may suggest that its Omicron peak has passed. It will be worth observing whether this decline occurs in the United States. If cases steadily decrease, this might prompt investors to believe that testing demand will start dying down once again, causing selling pressure.

**🌟 Mitigating Factors🌟:**

The Biden Administration, along with many influential people in the healthcare community have expressed their regrets over not escalating testing programs, reiterating that they will not repeat their mistake of distributing enough COVID to help combat potential surges. Furthermore, a vast majority of Cue’s clients will still require Cue’s products and services. The federal government and businesses will still need to test their employees on a regular basis; travelers will still need negative results to be cleared for cross-border traveling. Therefore, while the eventual dying-down of Omicron might affect market sentiment, its fundamentals remain robust as there will always be a huge need for rapid COVID testing.

**🔥Conclusion🔥:**

Going forwards, we will be seeing a fundamental shift in attitudes and business behaviors regarding COVID-testing in the United States. As Scott Becker, the CEO of the Association of Public Health Laboratories acknowledges that “we can’t be caught flat-footed again \[in regards to the severe shortage of testing\].” Any short-term concerns on whether testing demand would die down have now completely dissipated. This tailwind will certainly last well into 2022 and potentially further down the road as it is almost consensus now that we will co-exist with COVID.  As long as that is the case, Cue Health ($HLTH) will stand to be one of our largest winners 🚀 🚀 🚀 .

As of press time, Apple shares are trading at $179.67, and given the possibility of a ""Santa Claus run"" in the near future, Apple is close to reaching the next trillion dollar threshold. However, with history, this may not be a good thing for the broader market.

By itself this data is indeterminate, but the deaths have not budged AT ALL, and ICU hospitalizations are going DOWN. COVID has done cucked itself into a regular seasonal flu. Everyone I know in NY that is vaccinated is getting omicron. No politician wants to touch mandates with a 10 foot pole and people are fed up with following guidelines, I think covid is just going to slowly fade out of the news.

EDIT: Some below were curious about how other places further along into the spike look and how places with a lower vax rate look, kindly check out South Africa (third world country with poor health infrastructure) and Alabama (third world country with poor health infrastructure and incest)  numbers. They all support the idea that omicron is castrated covid.

For those of you who are a whole other level of degenerate and trade options in your retirement accounts, you also can leave and ignore this post.

**For the remaining 3% of you, who realized net gains in a taxable account, you really need to pay attention so that you aren't in a world of hurt.**

Every year around March or April, someone becomes absolutely mystified that, yes, they owe taxes on all of their gains (WOW!). This scenario especially common here due to something called 'beginners luck', in which you make sick gains but have absolutely idea what you are doing.

And, that means that if you made money late in this year, and then didn't set money aside for tax or realize losers at the end of the year, and then in typical WSB fashion ran your portfolio to zero afterwards, **you could really be unable to pay your taxes and have IRS collections on you!** I've made a helpful clown meme to illustrate how this might transpire:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m9l45w0ybd781.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=956b61252c23f7261eef2e24dd71d514ce9d0893

So what's happening here?

When you sell stock at a gain, you will owe tax on it, generally the following year (sometimes sooner). If you are running your portfolio down after, and you don't realize your losers the same calendar year, you still owe full tax on those gains, and you in turn, won't be able to realize those losses. Realizing those losses in the following year leaves you in a scenario where you have a loss shield, but owe tax, and might even have more tax due than you have funds.

So, my PSA is three simple ideas.

1. REALIZE YOUR LOSERS. No, <large cap meme stock) is not going to 4x in the next month, you'll be OK. You can always buy in 32 days later.
2. About that. It's called wash sale. I've put it in the FAQ.
3. If you dont have losses, but you realized substantial gains you may still want to set aside money for your taxes, or just pay them now so you aren't tempted.

**FAQ:**

Q: Wash sale? WTF is that?

A: When you sell a security at a loss, then buy the same security back in 31 days or less, it's a ""Wash sale"", and the loss is disallowed. You don't ""lose"" the loss, it goes back into your acquisition cost (cost basis) of the security.  But, it doesn't shield you on taxes!  So, if you sell to take losses, you gotta wait 31 days.

&#x200B;

Q: Look at me, I'm clever! Can I just buy call options after I sell a loser and avoid a wash sale?

A: Grey area. Don't try that one at home, may want to ask CPA. IRS has been kind of ambiguous on this one. I personally try not to. I have heard some brokers flag this and some do not. I have no idea which do or do not.

&#x200B;

Q:Fine, how much do I set aside?

A: Go calculate your tax rate, but your net gains (gains minus losses and then also minus any losses you had in surplus on last years taxes) times 40% is going to cover you in MOST situations. go 50% if you are in a very high tax state and make a lot of money. But go calculate if you aren't sure.

&#x200B;

Q: I'm not in the US and I'm not a US citizen, how does this work?

A: No idea. Ask google.

&#x200B;

Q: Why should I care? Why not just pay the tax?

A: Because if you can defer the tax by realizing losses, you have more money to invest (or gamble). It's kind of like a 0% margin loan from the government. Also, if the taxes are more than your funds you have a bigger problem. The IRS does not really love to hear ""i'm a little bit poor right now and can't pay"" as an answer."

Cerence Inc.

CRNC- $78.10

Market cap- $3.01 B 

Cerence Inc., (CRNC $72.52) is the market leading provider of embedded voice-powered assistance and artificial intelligence (AI) software for automotive manufacturers worldwide. CRNC enables drivers to use their voice to control internal features in the car such as using the cars navigation system, infotainment systems, and connect to the outside internet via cloud providers such as Google, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft bringing the ability to use third party external services such as sending a text, making a phone call, making a reservation through Open Table or getting a weather update. This is all through voice activated artificial intelligence capability provided by CRNC.  Car OEMs around the world can use CRNC's platform for both voice activated control of internal systems in the automobile and connecting to outside third party service providers via the cloud. Enabling a true connected car to be realized.  CRNC has around 53% market share of the cars with voice activated internal control systems and around 13-15% market share of cars with connected capabilities.

We feel the street's reaction to CRNC's results and outlook were overly negative and this is a case of a good company with a lower than expected outlook getting taken out to the woodshed and beaten.  The stock dropped over 20% the day the company reported September quarter results and has continued to drop in the week since the report and is down around 33% since reporting Q4FY2021 results on November 22nd.  However, we believe this is an opportunity to Buy the stock at a much lower price point with a move back to the $125 level over the next few quarters as automotive production increases as the supply chain of semiconductors or integrated circuits (ICs) improves.  We believe automotive production is bottoming as we speak and will start to get better in 1-2 quarters. And as this happens we believe CRNC's stock will start to move higher over the next few months and we would be adding to positions at current valuations for a move back up above $125. 

CRNC gets paid several different ways from automotive OEMs with the biggest being licensing revenue for the embedded voice activated software shipped with each new car produced which controls the cars internal systems such as stereo, navigation and control systems of the car.  The company typically gets a one-time up front licensing fee for each car shipped with CRNC's embedded software installed that totals on average $4.00-$5.00 per car (more for premium models and less for entry level cars).  This revenue is recognized in a lump sum when the car ships with CRNC's embedded software installed.  CRNC has around 53-58% market share of cars that ship with some form of embedded control systems (73% of cars have voice activated software and CRNC has 80% share of the 73%). with competition coming from I-Fly Technology in China and a US company called Soundhound.

The company also offers voice activated connectivity solutions allowing CRNC to offer drivers to access outside services via the cloud such as checking the weather, making dinner reservations, searching for a gas station or making a phone call all activated by voice hands free.  CRNC generates revenue when cars are produced using the company's voice activated connectivity solutions versus if the user or driver of the car actually uses the connectivity solutions.  This revenue stream equates to around $1.00-$1.50 per car per year for the length of the contract.  Revenue is received up front for the life of the contract and is amortized over the period of the contract in equal amounts each year generating a large deferred revenue balance and great quarterly predictability as over 80% of revenue each quarter comes from recurring revenue streams.  The competition in this segment is mainly internally produced solutions from the automotive OEMs so we feel more OEMs will outsource this capability in the future to people focused on this market with a broader product line such as CRNC.

In addition, CRNC has around a $2 billion backlog of design wins with key automotive OEMs worldwide for cars that have yet to come into production creating an even more predictable future revenue stream if the cars move into production with the company's embedded voice activated software or its connectivity software solutions.  We would expect this total backlog to take another huge jump higher over the next couple of quarters as one of CRNC's European automotive customers is expected to use CRNC's embedded solutions in a wider swath of its cars and brands generating another order that could be worth more than $100 million. CRNC had two orders in FY2020 that added up to over $230 million worth of orders and backlog from the same European automotive customer and total orders in FY2020 added up to over $835 million again suggesting the company's huge backlog of orders should provide strong revenue visibility and predictable results once automotive production normalizes.

CRNC collects up front licensing revenue when a car is produced using its connectivity solutions versus the user actually using the services.  This is one of the key issues on the September quarter conference call that caused investors to be nervous and the stock to drop over 20% as when this revenue source dropped sequentially many investors took this as a sign CRNC was seeing less usage per car of its connected services which is not the case.  CRNC gets paid if the car is produced using CRNC's connectivity solutions, and not how much each driver actually uses the services, so this revenue source dropped sequentially because of lower auto production levels caused by chip shortages and some one-time spikes in this revenue line item in the June quarter making the sequential comparisons difficult.

Another reason the stock got smacked down after the conference call is investors are now more skeptical with the company's FY2024 revenue target of $600 million given the slow growth environment CRNC is currently facing driven by anemic level of current automotive production.  If growth is projected to be in the 9-16% range for FY2022 to $400-$425 million (which was below the street's initial estimate of $440) this suggests growth must accelerate to 30%+ in FY2023 and FY2024 to hit the longer-term target of $600 million in FY2024.

We believe growth will accelerate for CRNC as overall automotive production improves as IC chip shortages slowly subside during 2022 and into 2023.  Increased levels of total production, increasing market share with key auto OEMs for its core voice activated embedded control software, further penetration into connected services with multiple new and current customers, new connected service offerings and new product introductions for new markets such as ATVs, trucks, and elevators should drive the growth required to hit the $600 million revenue target by FY2024.  Having around a $2 billion backlog and a large deferred revenue balance and 81% of total revenue coming from recurring revenue sources helps with the predictability and visibility into future revenue and EPS growth giving us confidence revenue growth will accelerate. We are convinced auto production is or has bottomed recently and will grind slowly higher over the next few quarters.  As investors see the increase in overall auto production CRNC's stock will start to move higher and when overall production gets back to normalized levels the stock should move back above $125.

Their post is BS. Here's a breakdown:

&#x200B;

>""HUBS"" benefited from a ""one time covid boost""

***Really?*** They didn't listen to the last earnings call.

* **HUBS's retention rate is at an all time high and still increasing**
* This is due to improvements in their product, not some one-time covid boost.
* HUBS put all their resources into improving existing features rather than building new ones for **an entire calendar year** a couple years ago, setting themselves up for better retention
   * This aligned perfectly for them with the pandemic; loads of new customers all with their new very high retention rate
* The other implication here that brick-and-mortar businesses that went online last year will now remove their digital presence is ridiculous

&#x200B;

>HubSpot’s growth decelerated for years prior to Covid

This is uninformed at best and misleading at worst.

* As stated previously, HUBS intentionally didn't release any new features in the year leading up to the pandemic to work on fixing bugs and improving customer happiness with existing features 
* Even so, this was a minor deceleration, **and they're talking about growth rate not growth**

&#x200B;

> Online reviews are blah, products are flawed, pricing is expensive 

Some quick googling shows this is **complete BS**. 

* Great customer reviews. 
* Pricing innovation with free CRM tiers.
* If you google ""I switched from salesforce to""... ""hubspot"" is the only auto-complete in the category (excel and outlook dont apply)

&#x200B;

> Competition is intense and growing rapidly. 

They then mention Salesforce. This is the **exact opposite** of what's happening. 

* HUBS is taking Salesforce customers not the other way around. 
* Salesforce does not capture the small business market like HUBS does. 

&#x200B;

>No wonder leadership is leaving & dumping shares. Founder/CEO Brian Halligan handed reins to new CEO Yamini Rangan 

**Yet again, complete BS**. 

* Brian Halligan is still on as executive chair
* Probably wanted a break from CEO after his vehicle accident
* Leadership Isn't ""dumping shares"" they are executing normal timed sells which ANY company does.

&#x200B;

**As you can see, this is a pretty laughable attempt at PR to profit from their bad position.** With the HUBS earnings call around the corner, and their string of great results, there is absolutely no reason why we wont get a big win quarter (and 2021 year) yet again.

At least the replies in twitter seem to be digging into them for their BS. HUBS has a very low % of retail investors currently. Get on that before it shoots over 1000 retards."

Investing In The Roku Lifestyle?
The streaming lifestyle, it appears, is here to stay. If we weren't already glued to our couches before, the pandemic made damn sure that we slowly became integrated into our couch cushions while the dulcet tones of Carole Baskin blared out over the soundbar. Today, there are more options than ever to stream. You have the heavy hitters like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu Live, HBO Max, YouTube TV and Disney+. Then you have the second class citizens of the streaming world like Peacock and Apple TV+ (though ""Ted Lasso"" seems to have vaulted this one to the top of most peoples' minds). You have tier three which includes the dross of the internet on Paramount+ and *shudder* Discovery+ . 

Speaking of shuddering, you also have networks like Shudder for horror movies or Britbox for your favorite subtitled shows where they're allegedly speaking the same language. Next up, dig through 50 feet of shit and then you end up at the bottom of the barrel of streaming services. These are the ones I'm pretty sure not even the employees watch, and I'm looking at you Fubo TV, IMDBTV and Tubi. RIP to Quibi which would have been the shining gold turd in the punch bowl of this class, but luckily that one was dragged behind the woodshed in time to save the dignity of a few founders and even fewer investors. Hell, streaming has been around so long now that it even has a pretty established graveyard. Prayers up to BOOM and TCM Filmstruck, both services I had a personal hand in designing and launching in my 9-5 life several years ago.

But this begs the question: with so many streaming services available to the public nowadays, what's the best way to access them? You could drop $500 on an Xbox and have a horrible user interface to deal with. You could grab a device manufactured by one of the big guys like Amazon with their Fire Stick, but then you risk getting dragged into a custody battle like the only child in a divorce court. So where do you go? Well, plucky underdog Roku might have your answer. 

What Is The Business?
As is standard practice for companies in the streaming game, Roku has a few different segments that drive their main sources of revenue:
Hardware sales

Platform revenue

Original content

Hardware Sales
Roku is a rare breed of streaming service in which they actually produce their own set-top boxes, referred to as OTT (over the top, as in over the television) products. This was the start of life at Roku, and their game originally was to provide low-cost ways to stream other services in your home. Since then, Roku devices have gotten a little more expensive, but have included new features like the ability to stream in 4K and faster chip-sets. They recently got back to their roots, however, when they announced an exclusive deal with Walmart to sell an entry-level $15 streaming stick, seemingly a shot across the bow of Amazon and Google alike. In Q3 of 2021, this segment generated approximately $97.4 million for the business and was their second largest revenue generator. As a fun side note, this business segment also includes the licensing agreements for the buttons on their remotes. They've even figured out how to monetize the remote!

Platform Revenue
This is actually the largest segment of Roku's revenue at present. This segment entails the software partnerships they have with television manufacturers, as well as the advertising therein. RokuOS, named ""Roku TV"" in their consumer facing materials, boasts an impressive 15 television manufacturer partners worldwide, and their OS also powers the set-top boxes I described a minute ago. According to The Motley Fool, the combination of the TV partners and proprietary set-top boxes has seen Roku leap to #1 in the United States for television operating system usage, capturing a 38% market share.

The volume of RokuOS users also begets extreme advertising revenue for the company, as they farm out the space within their app to external ad vendors and partners. This advertising and partnership revenue clocked in at a company-record $582.5 million in their Q3 earnings report, an 82% increase year-over-year.

Original Content
Curiously for a streaming service, this is the newest part of their business. I mentioned the dramatic implosion of Quibi in my intro, and Roku were the direct beneficiaries when they purchased all of Quibi's library (minus ""Reno 911"") for $100 million in 2021. I'll talk more about this in a minute.

The Bull Case
Worldwide Expansion
Roku, despite their impressive market share in the U.S, aren't resting on their laurels. They also boast a 31% market share in Canada and declared themselves the kings of streaming in Mexico. Now, it's time for Europe. The company is expanding with physical offices in northern Europe, establishing the newest building in The Netherlands to match their existing offices in the U.K, Ukraine and Denmark. Roku seems to be building on their position of strength and setting up the foundation to be able to more effectively distribute original content. What's that you say? Original content?

Original Content Production
Quibi nonsense, come on down! That's right, I told you it would be back. Using the Quibi back-catalog as a springboard, Roku is reportedly planning to produce more than 50 original content shows in the next two years to populate their exclusive Roku channel of their OS. This channel is free to users that have either a Roku OTT product or RokuOS in their televisions. But why is it free? The advertising!

We already talked about the amount of money Roku raked in with their advertising last quarter, but the filling out of the Roku Channel only serves to see that number balloon, and they're off to a good start. Their first original movie, ""Zoey's Extraordinary Christmas,"" was nominated for a Critic's Choice Award and set all kinds of internal records for the company in terms of viewership on the channel. The future is looking bright for this segment of the business, assuming they continue to knock the cover off the ball with their content.

Traditional TV Continues to Lose
We've all heard about, and maybe even participated in, cord cutting of some type. The major carriers are bleeding users, with an estimated 52% of American consumers expected to have severed their relationship with the major TV carriers by the end of 2022. That's a massive number, which provides ample market opportunity for the streaming middle-class to move in. Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+ have already asserted their dominance in a majority of homes, regardless of if you have traditional television or not. It's the second tier of streaming providers that have a new opportunity to move in, and Roku is uniquely well positioned to be able to provide that access point to millions around the world, especially in the U.S market. As the rising tide of cord cutting continues to lift all streaming boats, consider Roku the Army Corps of Engineers that open and close the damn at will.

Recent Key Partnership Agreements
Actually, let's discuss some of those streaming partners. In the world of streaming, the participants don't always play nice. In order to allow access to streaming content from each provider, the companies have to enter a contract with each other than can often result in protracted nonsense bullshit. For instance, did you have a Fire Stick or FireTV when ""The Office"" made its high-profile move from Netflix to Peacock? Then you were SOL because Amazon and NBCUniversal didn't have a streaming contract, so Peacock was unavailable to you. Did you want to watch ""Wonder Woman 2"" last December for some reason and you were one of the 55 million Americans streaming their options through Roku? Sorry! AT&amp;T (parent company of the HBO Max service) didn't have an agreement with Roku so you couldn't watch it, which honestly was for your benefit in this instance. WW2 was just awful.

I set all this up to say that Roku has now closed many of those gaps in their partnership agreements, the highest-profile of which is locking up a coveted multi-year deal with Google to continue access to YouTubeTV. This is beneficial from not only a revenue perspective (Roku stock popped 18% on the news), but also a PR perspective as it ends the long-standing feud between the two companies that threatened to boil over in October. PR might seem like a weird thing to highlight here, but a bad run of PR can dramatically affect your direct bottom-line results. Just ask Disney.

They've also secured some non-streaming partnerships which could make their advertising game a bit more interesting, including one with Shopify that allows merchants to build, run and measure connected TV ad campaigns. It's a fascinating partnership that directly takes on a company like The Trade Desk or Magnite, and could see advertising CPM's on Roku's platform explode in the coming years. To get a sense of just how many merchants are on the Shopify platform, you can read my deep dive into that company here.

The Valuation is Compelling (Finally)
For once with one of these things I can finally put valuation in the ""win"" column. Roku, at time of writing, is currently trading at $221. That's a staggering 50% off its all-time highs back in 2020 when the company rode the ""stay at home"" wave all the way up to $490. While the company has come back down to earth like their seat belt broke on Tower of Terror, the new trading levels for this company make it a compelling, albeit very strange, value play.

I'll touch on the infinite money-pit that is original content in a second, but their revenue is accelerating quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, even when they stack their 2021 numbers up against the almost unfair comps of 2020. Their most recent earnings quarter saw revenue jump over 50% and net income skyrocket 432% over the same time in 2020. They're getting more effective and more efficient, but have still seen their shares beaten down over the last 12 months. Well, Wall Street has noticed. 22 Wall Street analysts have weighed in and the company is classified as a ""Moderate Buy"" by analysts with an average price target of $401, implying an 80% upside.

The Bear Case
They're Late To The Original Content Game
So $100 million for Quibi's back catalog is a lot, right? In absolute terms, absolutely. In terms relative to their competitors? Not so much. Let's look at the king of the pride, Netflix.

Netflix has seen their budget for original content balloon since they began taking it seriously in 2013. The now-problematic Kevin Spacey led the service's first flagship series, ""House of Cards,"" adapted from the British series, which was met with critical and audience acclaim. Netflix had proven that original content could be developed, and they inadvertently sparked an arms race that is spiraling out of control. How out of control you ask? Very!

2014 saw Netflix enter the market with an original content war-chest of about $3 billion. Since then, that number has skyrocketed to $17 billion in 2021, as reported by the company during their most recent earnings report. And that number isn't just spend on random content that won't perform. Their algorithm is so finely tuned that they know what works and they absolutely blast it. Netflix is adept at opening the checkbook to a variety of projects, each one performing better than the last. 2020 saw the unexpected hit ""Tiger King,"" as well as award-darling ""The Queen's Gambit."" The Crown"" cleaned up at this year's Emmy's, and the return of ""Stranger Things"" is one of the most hotly anticipated releases of the last few years thanks to COVID-related delays. The company also pumps out critical flops that consumers can't get enough of, like ""Red Notice,"" the company's most watched film. They've also found success with international projects like ""Lupin"" and 2021's out-of-left-field explosive hit ""Squid Game."" The company can't stop, and won't stop, which puts Roku in a weird position.

We've already discussed that Roku's bread and butter is advertising and OTT, but does the foray into original content leave them in a precarious position? Even Netflix, with their seemingly unlimited balance sheet, has seen original content production creep up to nearly 50% of their annual spend. Roku's positioning in the landscape will be relatively minor at best, but the influx of new shows and content could see them setting money on fire unless the Roku TV channel is a smash hit and they can charge through the nose for advertising. It'll come down to batting average: Netflix can afford to bat like a minor league player because of the sheer volume of content they produce, with the success of the lesser number of hits outweighing the higher number of misses. Roku, in this belabored metaphor, will basically have to be Babe fucking Ruth in order to compete. 

So what's the next production for Roku's original content channel? Apparently it's ""This Old House,"" which I could bottle and use as a sleep aid. The only people that show is going to appeal to are those in their 90's and people on hospital beds with ""locked in"" syndrome.

The Bottom Line
Roku, it turns out, is an incredibly strange company. What started effectively as a hardware manufacturer has effectively pivoted into an ad-tech company with a side of streaming. They not only provide the access point to your favorite content, but they sell ads to you on top of that and are now looking to become your favorite source of content, despite some currently questionable content decisions. The company is taking their partnerships and operating system to the next level simultaneously, all while seeing revenue and income accelerate quarter-over-quarter. The company to me is a screaming ""long"" and thanks to those of you that requested this one so I could dig into it a bit more!

2020 and 2021 have been extraordinary years. They also have been extraordinary for the stock market. After an initial dip in the stock market when COVID broke out everything and anything rallied. Initial dip only lasted 2 months and then sector by sector flew into all time highs and rallied now for a year and a half. There were massive gains to be made in tech, pharmaceuticals, speculative plays, even the old boring financials and even the housing market… I won’t even mention the short squeezes! I myself had some fun with those.
No matter how high the prices looked for the stocks- they just kept getting higher. Critical opinions from analysts and news reporters started disappearing. It just doesn’t look very good if you keep saying that things are overpriced when those prices keep going up, does it? I remember Elon Musk saying that  Tesla prices were too high at $750 pre split- then it reached $1200 post split and now Tesla is trading at 300 PE ratio! And somehow nobody says that it’s that high anymore… Folks, don’t get me wrong, I love Tesla- it’s a great company; and would Elon Musk purpose to me tomorrow I’d say “yes!” without a blink of an eye, but 300 x price per earnings? I suppose Tesla will have to electrify Mars too.
 
I should not single one stock out. Most stocks have gotten into euphoria zone mid pandemic, mid and small caps including. But what no one seems to have noticed is that while blue chips continued to rally- most mid caps (after reaching highs a year ago) have already consolidated. Yes! That’s exactly what I’m saying -market has already corrected leaving only the shiny blue chips at sky high prices. I really don’t want to be this person spewing gloom and doom everywhere, but I do not see a good year coming for Amazon, Tesla, Google, Ford, Zoom, Nvidia, Home Depot, etc. They are exceptional companies, that are currently priced even more exceptionally (if you know what I mean). We won’t be buying computers to start working from home anymore; we have bought extraordinary amount of cars to avoid public transport so there will be little demand for automobiles in the next 5 years, we have already settled with our new subscriptions, housing market is finally slowing and we are not redesigning our home anymore to accommodate a work from home office. There has been an incredible growth in the past few years but now earnings reports will start coming in showing stagnation or downtrend in demand and euphoria will pop very quickly. Our big growth companies will not be growing that fast anymore and can you really justify 50, 100, 300 PE for something that is not extremely high growth? For something that is possibly very strongly affected by inflation?
 
 
So following this thought process what do I think will happen in the stock market? I’ll pretend I’m an oracle here for a second…
Hedge funds need to justify their fees and make some money, most of them do not or are not allowed to go short so they will be looking for opportunities. Possibly stocks that are heavily underpriced with sound fundamentals and that are not that affected by fluctuations in demand. I vouch for the whole pharmaceutical sector to have an amazing year! Data collection agencies, infrastructure, utilities, gold miners should do well. Quite frankly all those beat down forgotten stocks that we were ignoring for the past year should come to life. I believe that after nearly two year stock market euphoria we will come back to fundamentals and conviction plays. Easy money won’t be a thing of the day anymore and things won’t rally “just because”….. here I am with gloom and doom again, but I do think that we need to prepare for more of a whack-a-mole setup in the market for the next few years and stay away from anything that doesn’t appear to be a good deal. I also believe that S&P and Nasdaq will pull back and will make negative gains next year or maybe even a few after, but that doesn’t mean that there won’t be gains made in niches or catalyst plays.
 
 Check out a 20 year Nasdaq yearly chart to see for yourself how desperately it needs to consolidate and it does do consolidate! 

As for myself, I’ll be scouting out the stocks that have strong fundamentals, high growth possibilities (without hitting my wallet with high PE) and positive catalysts in the near future. Happy hunting everyone!"

Now many things happened in 2020 also in tech, energy, etc but biotech was hot on pandemic and to elimnate the need to research some other field, I only focused on biotechs.

1. So I browsed and I shuffled eliminating first the ones that are already flying high on Covid fears. Easy money are already made there. No time for that.
2. Then I eliminated the stocks that had debt, like 0 ZERO debt. The rate hike is in the cards and will make  refinancing or repaying that debt harder. No time for that.
3. Further I eliminated (againt my feelings) all the de-spacs. That trend has its own highs and downs and is  you know... keep it simple. Small caps, easy to manipulate stocks - dumped as well.

**And then I started to dig deep in the pipelines of the few left on the table. Some pretty good names there, a lot to read but  $ABCL Abcellera stood right there.**

To be honest I owned some already (bc of Peter Thiel) but my selection was ownership blind. Just going for the target.

Very short backgroudn story - Abcellera become worldwide famous in 2020 as they were the first company on the planet to get EUA for their antibody treatment. After the IPO ABCL surged as high as 70s and now stands at $13.5. They made some nice hundres of millions until now from that antibody but got crushed when vaccines rolled out, got facny again on variant D as their antibody works great on that and it seems they have a new antibody that can kill Omicron too. (see the update in the top of the page). 

**But**, **You know why $ABCL is great?**

**ABCL pipeline has 150 programs and 131 are royalty based. All those 131 programs have nothing to do with Covid. Nothing.**

**What that means is that from any of this 131 programs they stand to win some 5% (source- management)  of the sales.**

**How much is that?**

I googled it - laisy bastard sometimes and I actualy found a guy (but reddit won't let me place a link here) that actually did that math for me:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2lskkywl6y581.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=62ee4fb675f7c1cbc89f0986419d0d45f77be9e3

They have some 700M cash in hand right now and stand to earn some more this quarter as they deliver more antbody and they didn't shown any tendency o dillute stock holders (I'll dig deep in to that later).

Now, 25% success rate seemed too high for my taste (you know lowest risk, right?)

ABCL has a 25+% success rate but the industry average is 15%. I wanted to make the math for an industry average.

This time is much easier: 15 out of 25 is something like 60%. 60% out of 41$ is 24$.

**Even if ABCL would be an average biotech - with this number of programs, the real value of $ABCL would be 24$. Right now if not 1$ would be earned from their covid antibody. Also NO growth rate has been factored in. Like they would not sign another customer in the next decade.**

But, wait (if you're not bored already) and let's seee just how average is ABCL. Who knows, maybe they are under average or not.

**In short about ABCL**

ABCL owns a global database of different antibodies, from humans and lot of species. On top of that full stakc they use AI to identify the best candidate that can kills a bacteria, virus or cancer and that candidate gets cloned, mutiplied and delivered to the pacient.

Spunds like a great idea but are they really good at doing that? Let's see.

**Who's vetting for ABCL**

I am not that smart to judge on scientifical merrits, but I know who's hat smart - big pharma. Seeing who's working with them and actually pays them, can give a clue on how serious are they.

Here is the short list (the ones that I recognized) of partners of ABCL that are also paying for their platform/research right now. Also this guys are responsible for that 131 programs with royalties:

EliLily\*, Sanofi, GSK\*, Novartis, Bill&Melinda Gates, Gilead, Pfizer, Kodiak, Merck, Regeneron\* and very recently Moderna. It is hard to name a big pharma that is not there.

\*Also you might notice among the biotechs using their platform are all the Covid antibody competition.

Each one of those are ordering more programs and many others are joining them quarter by quarter.

Here is the growth rate focusing on programs ony:

***Q2*** ***Total programs under contract of 138, up 82% from Q2 2020***

***Q3 2021- Total programs under contract of 155 adding 17 new programs.***

[***https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/abcellera-biologics-inc-abcl-q3-2021-earnings-call/***](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/abcellera-biologics-inc-abcl-q3-2021-earnings-call/)

Who else is backing them? O**h, the Canadian Goverment gave them already some 176M.** Some 50M were for the Covid treatment development but 125M was given to build a nice cool factory.

They are building right now a GMP protein biologic manufacturing area and the building will feature laboratory, offices and warehouse space.

[https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/projects/abcellera-biologics-vancouver-facility/](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/projects/abcellera-biologics-vancouver-facility/)

And my favorite early investor (innitial backer)  and member of the board of Abcellera - **Peter Thiel (PLTR, LAZR, ASANA).**

But, hey, if you don;t know who's Peter Thiel ... this is not the place to learn but you should really find time and google it.

**Conclusion**

I already got tired of writing and you got bored with my story.

**Here is the deal :**

* **ABCL IPO price was 20$ (with only some 80 programs and factory paid by Canadian goverment),**
* **ABCL target price (6 analysts median) is 46$**
* **ABCL in my conservative, NO COVID valuation, sets the price at 24$.**
* **Right now you can buy it with 13.5.**

Now, if Covid will stay arround they will make a lot more money like really a lot.

They also have under clinical test a new antibody LY-CoV1404 or Bebtelovimab. As of September 2021 NIH was saying that it can kill ALL Covid variants. IT seems that atacks that protein that don't mutate.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8109210/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8109210/)

Who knows? Untill FDA says otherwise, we need to see this.

Right now the risks on the table are like this:

Scenario 1: If ABCL puts on the table a proven Omicron killer, the stock will rally and we will never see it at 13.5 again.

Scenario 2: If ABCL gets more contracts with the same or other big guys, or if they publish some positive data from any of those 131 programs, it will rally as their business model will get more and more visibility. Chance are that maybe you can get it again at this price or not.

Scenario 3: If ABCL stops selling Covid antobodies and stop signing new contracts, it will keep develop new drugs and slowlly rise to 24$

Scenario 4: IF ABCL suddenly stops delivering results, gets contracts cancelled and they prove to be a ponzi scheme - we all loose our money and will be proved stupid along Peter Thiel, all the Canadian Gov. (not sure there:) Bill Gates, Pfizer, Sanofi, Gilead, GSK and you get the idea :D.

**Please read this with Russel Brand voice:**

That is what I think but more imortantly is what YOU think. Let me know in the comments.

**Btw, I'm in 1.5K commons averaged and bought the biggest stake at this price.**

rhws8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rhws8o/oatly_calls_on_lactose_intolerance_otly/,OATLY - CALLS ON LACTOSE INTOLERANCE ($OTLY),74,104,2021-12-17 02:26:10,"Lactose intolerance is on the rise. This gastrointestinal rejection of our beloved dairy products tells us more than just the truth, it tells us how to invest. This occurred to me just yesterday when I was checking Robinhood on the toilet. Little did I realise, my excessive flatulence was trying to tell me something. Not just how to address my lactose malabsorption, but also how to manage my investment fund.

## Got Milk?

The United States federal government has been artificially sustaining the dairy industry for decades. The USDA recommends every child and adult consume 3 cups of dairy every day despite the fact that 25% of the US is lactose intolerant. The global prevalence of lactose malabsorption is averaged at 68%. How could milk be such an important aspect of our diet if it’s indigestible by more than half the globe? The answer lies in understanding the true consequence of World War 1; an excessive increase in cattle farmers. This overproduction of milk resulted in an unsustainable industry which was promptly addressed via massive subsidization. Big dairy is real and so is the deep soy state.

## Oatly ($OTLY)

Oatly was founded by the Swedish scientist Rickard Öste, the inventor of oat milk. Its products include oat milk, ice cream, cold brew coffee, and other cooking products. (All non-GMO and vegan). This ties well into the trendy vegan globalist agenda, a psyop designed to control the populace and drive the profits of vitamin supplement companies.

How do I judge a company? The same way I judge political candidates, by their website. And to be honest, [Oatly’s website](https://www.oatly.com/en-us) has a nice horizontal scroll with a design that subverts techno feudalistic minimalist websites- in exchange for something a little more visually engaging. The art is a bit corporate but aesthetically sensible. The reason I’m mentioning this is that a well-designed website is a positive signal that the management team is able to find and identify capable talent when scaling for growth.

## Trendy DIY Baristas

It goes without saying that Becky wants to make her own drinks. Even my wife’s boyfriend, Kenneth, makes Oatmilk Mocha Vanilla Frappes every morning. Just look at the pinterest boards, the Google search trends, it all connects. This follows the trend shift from retail to aesthetic consumerism. Oatly is the clearest Becky play.

## Starbucks Partnership

✰$ gets all its Oatmilk from Oatly. I wouldn’t know if it’s any good because Kenneth only lets me drink Starbucks water.

**Bubble Tea**

The bubble tea market is exploding globally. Rapid growth over the next several years. Bubble tea is super popular with GenZ. Lots of the local college girls are always hitting the bubble tea shops. Bullish on bubble tea. Also, the addressable market in China for milk tea is huge since 90% of China is lactose intolerant.

## Becky Play

From now on, I’m going to classify Oatly as a Becky stock. It has all the key components of one. EZ Becky play.

## Neural Networks for Grain Quality Analysis

Rickard Öste utilized artificial neural networks in the late 90s to [analyze grain quality](https://patents.justia.com/patent/5956413). If they were doing this in the late 90s, I can only imagine what they’re doing behind the scenes now. The industrial secrets that Oatly must possess are probably ascended. They’re probably using sentient fucking AI to reverse engineer the genome of oats. Quantum computers to run advanced algorithmic research. Bullish.

## Oat Metaverse

Oat Metaverse

## Hipster Aware Marketing

Oatly has a Bandcamp page with remix stems available for producers. This is marketing 2.0-  There is an acapella track performed by the CEO here. what ceo even does that? Lol so relatable to my genz sensibilities. Oatly seeing massive retail expansion across the states. Massive addressable market.  24/7 oatly ceo slowed + reverb lofi beats to study to

## quirked up oatmilk shawty gf

this is the vibe shift. I wrote this DD on my MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2009). bullish on quirky post-millennial core stocks. my ADHD never lies folks.

# in conclusion

not investment advice but buy the stock while its cheap- at a support level rn. also to the bagholders that got burned from the IPO- green days  are coming soon. just DCA.

## Positions:

100 shares @ 7.90 + 10 January calls / other calls expiring between February - April.

With news over Google staying on the platform, the stock spiked, but nothing stuck.

Roku has seen prices of $400+, but what is stopping it from staying there?

According to Wolfram Alpha, Roku doesn't get the majority of its profits from actually selling Roku devices, but from ADs on the platform. 

""Roku generates 14.3% of revenues from Player segment (Devices sold) while the rest comes from Platform Segment (Ads: 65% of profit)""

People are going to be getting these devices for Christmas, because of how low they are dropping their prices (You can get a 4k ROKU Device for $25 right now).

I'm expecting this stock to jump once the new year hits due to the influx of people opening Roku devices on Christmas.

Hope this was clear enough for you retards

Today I want to introduce you to another shitco on which luckily you can buy shitputs.

Brief intro about myself: I'm a retard like you all, but when I don't waste hours [making video memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r8eboq/brief_recap_of_todays_market_action/), I sometimes write [killer DD on shitcos](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q7i6ot/hudson_bay_capital_hedge_fund_pulling_off_a_scam/), with extra focus on hedge fund managed scams. If you were smart enough to figure out the company (couldn't post the name of the company due to the 1.5B$ market cap rule - solution in the comments), you could have shorted or bought put at virtually any strike/expiration and made some honest money.

For the next one, fortunately, the ticker has been pumped enough to cross the WSB threshold! As I write this, the company is trading at a market cap north of 2B$. In case you missed the title, today's shitco is:

# $LWLG

The company has been around since 1991, public since 2006, and named Lightwave Logic since 2008. For what they claim, the company focuses on the ""development of photonic devices"" or whatever else. But let's dig a little bit deeper into their business.

Throughout this DD, I'll include info I found myself, as well as some from the SA report of:

\- Gold Panda (GP): Lightwave Logic Looks Overvalued Based On Fundamentals

\- White Diamond Research (WDR): Lightwave Logic Is A Tiny, Glorified Science Lab, Recent 500%+ Runup Is Without Substance

I can't link them due to Reddit rules, but I recommend you have a look especially at WDR, excellent work on what a trash company this is.

**So, you may ask, what does this company sell?**

Their revenue is consistently zero. This has been the case for at least 10 years (thanks WDR). If anyone has the patience, you're welcome to look for more zeroes in the past. 11 years ago, someone posted a junk article on SA, claiming:

>For the last 7 years or so a small company named Lightwave Logic (LWLG) has been developing a new electro optical polymer material (EO polymer) that promises increased life for Moore’s Law.

So, they started developing this stuff 18 years ago, and still have to sell anything. This is getting comical, to the point that of their 70+ patents and applications, some are [so old they'll soon expire](https://patents.google.com/?assignee=lightwave+logic&oq=lightwave+logic&sort=old).

[Cumulative sales of LWLG's core product](https://preview.redd.it/uplh6n88wc581.png?width=1830&format=png&auto=webp&s=32f56b2520869d69792dcb0fc1d4bf2acd5bb1cb)

Their main product are shares. They [sell millions of them every year](https://ycharts.com/companies/LWLG/shares_outstanding) to their customers/bagholders, who are in turn rewarded with a [constant flow of PRs](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LWLG?p=LWLG) talking about the next investor conferences, their latest ""breakthrough"" or some award at random events they are attending.

**Ok, but how did they do a +2,000% YTD?**

There must be something behind such a rally, right? Not really, except stock promotion. This appears to be happening with the blessing of $LWLG itself, as it all started with them [casually showing logos of companies](https://youtu.be/rcY5vhsWHKo?t=381) to which they ""planned to sell components"" mid-this year. These included the likes of $CSCO, Huawei, $NOK, and why not let's also throw in the logos of $AMZN, $GOOG and $VZ.

[A few companies that have no interest in LWLG's products](https://preview.redd.it/vanascdbwc581.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=03c8797288e4b261c19fff59d8c123d24e3f1b07)

You can probably tell from $LWLG revenue how much interest there is from these companies to buy their products.

Fun stuff, looking at the YouTube account that posted this (likely an employee), I found [this gem in a March 2017 presentation](https://youtu.be/U60ijsAC70s?t=662).

>The market is ready for our solution: it's scalable...and we have great timing  
>  
>Our technology platform is exactly what customers are looking for...

This was happening 4 and a half years ago. Great timing.

The stock has undergone a promotion campaign by [https://insiderfinancial.com/](https://insiderfinancial.com/) (through its website, twitter and youtube), which is famous for promoting OTC stock scams. A penny stock boiler room basically.

**What's the thing with the hedge fund?**

There's this hedge fund called [Lincoln Park Capital](https://www.lpcfunds.com/). According to them, they are a:

>Chicago-based *Investment* Group and Asset Management Firm focused on opportunistic investing in public and private companies

Not so surprisingly, one of the first suggestions when typing it on google is ""Lincoln Park Capital pump and dump"". Their main business is signing agreements to purchase shares from shitcos, and then dumping them on retail bagholders. [Utopia Capital Research](https://utopiacap.com/lincoln-park-capital/?amp) took some time to go through a series of their pump and dumps, pointing out that such stocks have horrific yearly returns of -42%.

(side note: considering going short the whole LPC scam portfolio)

Fortunately, we don't need to worry about $LWLG finances:

[The intern preparing these slides forgot they shouldn't mention it](https://preview.redd.it/p1kkqrffwc581.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2bafd6485f127362c620cc785be839ce2bc4b61)

Their [previous pump and dump agreement](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2019/01/22/1703512/0/en/Lightwave-Logic-Inc-Secures-25MM-Common-Stock-Purchase-Agreement-with-Longstanding-Investor-Lincoln-Park-Capital-Fund-LLC.html) was for 25M$. [The latest one](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lightwave-logic-announces-33-0-million-financing-agreement-with-lincoln-park-capital-fund-301395039.html) came in on Oct. 7th. Following a few weeks of nothing, the stock price has suddenly started flying on no news. This is somewhat unusual, as LPC has the right to purchase shares at $9.16 (we are north of $18 now). Such agreements are typically very bearish, since they put the market buyer in a position of disadvantage. Wash sales? Stock promotion? I don't know.

But who knows, maybe LPC is genuinely investing in $LWLG, holding shares for the long run? That would fit well with their mission, as stated in their website:

>long-term, win-win relationships where Lincoln Park incentives are aligned with the best interests of common shareholders

Well, as you may have guessed, no chance on earth. A look at the [ownership structure as of Sep. 29th](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LWLG/holders?p=LWLG) reveals as much as 1.45% of the shares are held by institutions. LPC doesn't appear to be in the top 10, meaning they own less than 37k shares. I can see your shocked face expression.

It's also interesting to note that insiders appear to own 0.74% of the shares outstanding. Talk about having skin in the game.

Can it get worse? Of course! $LWLG recently got into bed with H.C. Wainwright. This is another shit company that pumps junk stocks and then hits them with a share offering. Also, they're a larger player than LPC, and when they dump shares, they dump like there's no fucking tomorrow. I've previously fallen for some recommended by their analysts (Azurx biopharma and Eyegate pharmaceuticals, both renamed into other shit this year), which promptly turned out to be trash and were hit with an offering. In this case as well, a google search can help confirming HCW's great reputation for scams.

[$LWLG recently went to one of their scam conferences](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lightwave-logic-present-h-c-014800849.html). Wouldn't be surprised if an offering is coming in the next few months.

**Sounds like a solid investment so far, anything else?**

The management is either retarded or lying to shareholders. They state in their [most recent corporate update](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lightwave-logic-provides-third-quarter-133100829.html):

>As of November 15, 2021, the Company's cash and cash equivalents are approximately $15 million, enabling it to finance operations through March 2023.

For the last two quarters, cash burn was north of 4M$. At the current rate, their reserves should run to zero some time between June and September 2022.

**Why should I buy puts now?**

There's an event hosted by Oppenheimer tomorrow, at which [$LWLG will give a presentation starting at 10:45](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lightwave-logic-present-december-investor-133100984.html). Some dumbfucks on Twitter/stocktwits ([here just an example](https://twitter.com/atlsutiger/status/1468931900630880257)) believe they will announce a foundry partnership. It would sound somewhat improbable to me, considering they have participated in hundreds of these conferences, and consistently announced zero such things.

If the run-up is caused by retail investors interest, this may come crashing once the presentation turns out to be the usual nothing burger. If it's just wash sales, LPC could rugpull.

If you feel adventurous enough to bet on the presentation, based on all the shit you've read so far, there's puts for Dec. 17th (this Friday), which should well satisfy your gambling desires. If you typically hang out on r/investing, but somehow ended up today here on WSB, there's some for June 17th, 2022. By then, they would likely have started dumping shares.

Also interesting, the orders are typically executed around 2pm, both days.

We are talking about a total of \~350k$ in put options expiring in a week, which is not something one would throw in the wind for the fuck of it. This could be an indicator of an upcoming short report. Last time I've seen the exact same thing happening, it was with another shitco called Moxian (now below WSB threshold). Premium spent in puts was also in the 100ks order. Tried to check the usual suspects (Hindenburg, Muddy Waters and Scorpion Capital but haven't seen much hints.

And yeah, I wish that was me, but I doubt IBKR would be happy giving me 10x leverage on 1 week options.

**Can I somehow get fucked?**

Of course! And you likely will! Timing the market is notoriously impossible. All these elaborate hypotheses could be invalidated if $LWLG announces a revenue-generating partnership, LPC decides starting tomorrow they'll hold all the shares they're buying, or whatever else.

Not financial advice and all the usual crap. Hasta la vista and see you in valhalla.

I think FedEx’s earnings are going to tank because of their inability to control costs related to the labor shortages compared to their competition and that you can make tendies on puts or shorts, but this probably won’t be the next DOCU play

**Preface:**

All over the world logistics companies are facing labor shortages and increased shipping loads, on top of the ports being backed up especially a bad thing for courier companies for this quarter since Christmas shopping is in full swing and shopping for tendies online is at an all-time high thanks to covid.

**FedEx’s shipping rate hikes but why I think they mean nothing:**

Last earnings, FedEx announced an increase in rates but it would only take effect on Jan. 3, 2022, these will apply to all US domestic, US export and US import services. FedEx Ground, which delivers to businesses, and FedEx home delivery will increase by an average of 5.9%. FedEx Freight customers could see an increase of up to 7.9%.

Earlier this month starting Nov.1, FedEx also announced that a fuel surcharge will be added to certain FedEx shipments, including FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight shipments. Effective Nov. 15, 2021, Item 525 Over Length and Item 530 Extreme Length surcharges will also increase.

This rise in rates are always expected due to the build-up of the end of year shipping rush, but I think these rate hikes have come too late as it will only partially offset their fuel costs.

**Labour shortages and increased hiring cost problems:**

Taking data from this news report from Convey a few weeks back:

[https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/convey-project44-fedex-ups-postal-service-delivery-on-time/610456/](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/convey-project44-fedex-ups-postal-service-delivery-on-time/610456/)

We can see that FedEx has all along been pretty fucked in terms of their labor problems as this has making them consistently fail in their on-time deliveries. I will explain more on why I think this is relevant below.

Besides the chaos, we still have headlines of FedEx employees dumping packages probably thanks to the insane pile up of packages at this time of the year.

**Flip-side argument from Shipmatrix but why its bullshit**

Boomer shipmatrix.com disagrees with Convey’s reporting matrix and is instead reporting much better on-time deliveries because they use the total time in transit rather than accounting for when each individual courier receives, processes and then delivers each package.

I wont be going into the specifics here but I personally think ShipMatrix is more retarded than the average WSB autist here.

I don’t know anyone who can even agree with these bullshit numbers that they are pulling out of their ass.

A quick sub-reddit research seems that there’s more chaos over in /r/Fedexers/ vs that of UPS /r/UPSers

**Why do any of these numbers matter?**

Not being able to deliver on time had already led to them losing contracts with time sensitive meal-kit businesses, as noted during its last earnings it lost customers such as Clean Eatz Kitchen Inc. due to delays that cost the company thousands of dollars’ worth of shipments of ready-to-eat frozen meals that ended up spoiled in transit.

Next up on some meal-kit business that will lose or have already lost their contract with Fedex:

1. Home Chef - Users grumbling on facebook & reddit
2. Sun Basket – users are reporting that they have already switched away from Fedex to Courier Express (not a listed company so who cares)

A quick look into any of the meal kit subreddits or a quick google has angry customers complaining about long delays of even up to a week in receiving their meal kits. Can you imagine what happens if you let fresh foodstuff sit in a warehouse with no temperature controls for 3 days, what happens after 5? What happens if that week’s kit has seafood?

Take a look here and you can see nothing but disdain for FedEx in relation to meal kit deliveries.

How many of you personally ordered tendies but they came in late because of FedEx?

**Non food related delivery problems also extend into delays of delivery of sensitive documents**

Over at the UK side, FedEx is also fucking up on passport deliveries.

**Possibly higher Labor costs vs their peers:**

I remember reading FedEx is also paying more for labor acquisitions than their peers at DHL/UPS/USPS etc but I haven't gone and dug up more about it beyond this news report.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-04/labor-shortage-ups-union-drivers-give-delivery-service-edge-over-fedex-fdx](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-04/labor-shortage-ups-union-drivers-give-delivery-service-edge-over-fedex-fdx)

**Summary**

FedEx is reporting that they expect higher shipment volume but the increase in revenues wont be high enough to cover their rising costs since they can't even handle the current volume with the current labor shortage. They have also been lagging behind their peers in managing costs possibly leading into an earning's miss and tanking the share price further.

I will likely be picking up puts come market open after I get more allowance from cashing in my good boy points with Mommy.

\*edit\*

Fedex's share price when put against its peers UPS, DHL and Maersk also seems correlated to its poor ability to deliver.

**The Play**

Puts or shorts for potential earnings miss.

\*edit\*

IV pretty low currently so we won't be fucked on option plays

**Risk**

– Share price has already tumbled from its ATH levels of $314 earlier this year. (Currently $246)

– FedEx has other businesses under their arm and this discussion only covers the failings of FedEx Ground

– This may have already been priced into the analyst expected earnings estimates.

Hoping to hear more thoughts about FedEx and if all these are big enough to make FedEx miss its quarterly reports. Especially anyone working under FedEx who can tell me if I’m being retarded"

Today we look at Chewy, an ecommerce retailer of pet food, toys, and budding insurance/veterinary service provider. 3 months ago I wrote a DD about their last earnings. Today we deal with their Q3 earnings report, covering August – October 2021. Last quarter, they guided for USD 2.20-2.22 bn in revenue (23-25% yearly growth, 2.3% quarterly growth) and USD 8.9-9.0 in annual revenue (implying Q4 guidance of USD 2.44bn at the midpoints).

After they reiterated annual guidance on the last call despite disappointing customer numbers, I think there is a good chance that they will fall short this time and have to slightly cut Q4 and annual guidance.

Chewy is a high-flying Covid stock that is down almost exactly 50% from its all time high. Some level of deceleration is clearly priced in, which is a risk for this play. However I believe their earnings report might disappoint for a couple of reasons.

**App downloads and customer numbers**

The biggest and most obvious problem Chewy is facing is their newly added customers. Last quarters additions of 300k fell well short of expectation. Chewy is currently facing a cliff, as they added more customers than ever all throughout 2020. Their comp for this quarter is 1.2 million, slightly less than the 1.6 million they compared to last quarter, but still a very impressive number. As many customers churn around the 1-year mark, they might have problems adding enough gross customers to offset their churn.

&#x200B;

One indication for this is the decline in their app rankings, both on iOS and Android. Apps are commonly (not always) downloaded by NEW customers, so they are a decent proxy for new customer additions. For both platforms, rankings are much lower than they have been since early 2019. There is a particularly pronounced drop on Android, starting around August 1 this year and extending until the current day (even though there was a small recovery). Android is a comparatively important platform for Chewy: while iOS is more popular overall in the USA, Chewy has an approximately equal number of downloads between the two platforms.

Note: Android chart shows overall ranking, iOS chart shows ranking in the Shopping category

**Google Trends**

Google search trends for Chewy also aren’t looking too positive. I’m comparing them here to Peloton, and showing how much each week’s search index dropped compared to the same week last year. Chewy was relatively strong during the summer (a time when Peloton was naturally weak), but has softened a lot going into fall and winter, and is about 20% below last year’s search volume.

[Google Trends](https://preview.redd.it/5s4w9bz77j481.png?width=653&format=png&auto=webp&s=89f3dfd7a3520d3abbc2bdc337c3c97456c4e89b)

**Pet adoption trend ending**

Adopting pets was a huge trend when the covid pandemic started last year. Some covid trends are sustainable, others are not. Unsurprisingly, Chewy falls into the latter category: if you already adopted a dog or cat last year, as adorable as they are, you’re probably not rushing out to get the next one immediately. Demand was pulled forward, but not extended. Google search trends for “dog adoption” and “cat adoption” (and other related terms, not shown here) are weak and in fact lower than they have ever been in the past 5 years (to be precise, searches for these terms are at their lowest since 2010).

Website visits to the biggest USA-wide pet adoption sites are also down significantly in the past months. While some seasonal difference is to be expected going into the winter (in a regular year, adoptions peak in July/August and drop by about 10% by November/December), the decline in search traffic this year is more pronounced than that.

**Website visits**

The one counterpoint to the above is website visits to Chewy, which are looking solid if not spectacular. As expected there is a solid uptick in November as people prepare to buy their pets Christmas gifts. While Chewy is ahead in the ecommerce game of their main competitors Petco and Petsmart, their share of website visits has actually remained extremely stable since February this year. I think this is actually a somewhat negative sign for Chewy, as they are valued much higher than competitors since they were supposed to take business away from traditional retailers. To me this chart implies that competitors are catching on and Chewy isn’t taking as much business as they used to.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** In the last week of November, all three websites saw significant upticks in their website views, which is a bit hard to see precisely in the chart above. As a full disclosure, visits to Chewy jumped 36% compared to the previous week. Visits to Petco increased 30%, Petsmart increased by 31%.

**Positions**

Puts at strike 60, expiring this week. I also own additional puts expiring next week.

**Summary**

Chewy stock has been punished quite a lot already but I think there’s a bit more room to drop. Management was pretty upbeat on the last call, which could lead to disappointment among analysts if numbers suddenly look worse this quarter (as I expect they will).

On the other hand, there are 1-2 bright spots in Chewy’s numbers – website views look solid, they have done very well at converting people to Autoship, and their ARPU is rising steadily and extremely impressive. All this may contribute to a positive earnings report. The stock has also bounced off the USD 60 mark quite a lot (even going back to last year), so there’s a risk it doesn’t drop too much if numbers are somewhat satisfying. IV is also relatively high around 7-8%. As always, enter at your own risk."

I personally love it. It's got a lot of potential and the recent drop in price opens up an excellent opportunity for new investors.

# Dropbox at a glance

So, why should we care about Dropbox? Simple. It's a well-performing business that keeps beating analyst expectations. In fact, Dropbox does not have a single earnings or revenue expectations miss since they floated on the stock market! Yes, Dropbox's growth may be slowing down a tiny, tiny bit, but it is still double digits. This growth is likely led by the overwhelming switch since last year to working from home. A lot of people are also starting their own small businesses and they need solutions like Dropbox to help them organise their files, documents and so on. So, the question is, what does Dropbox actually do? Their flagship product, Dropbox, is a cloud storage solution similar to Google Drive, One Drive, iCloud and so on. Essentially, you can store files on Dropbox and synchronise and share them across PC, mobile, tablets and so on. However, Dropbox is actively striving to become a workspace platform or a smart workplace. Over the last three years they have also acquired HelloSign and DocSend that provide even more capabilities to its users. HelloSign provides the ability to send, receive and manage legally binding electronic signatures, whereas DocSend allows you to securely share documents with other people or businesses, track their usage, provide NDAs, meaning Non-Disclosure Agreements, eSignatures, watermarking and so on. Overall, these three services provide the backbone of the Dropbox product offering. However, Dropbox continues to look for new ways to improve and expand and have recently introduced three new features: Capture, Replay and Shop. I am really interested in the Shop feature, I think that has a lot of potential, but it's still too early to tell. If it goes well though, it could become a very successful marketplace for digital content.

# Earnings, revenue and key metrics

This all sounds really good, but let's look at the numbers. Always look at the numbers before you invest ***especially*** these days when there are so many companies that talk a lot, but have nothing to show for it. Like a lot of modern tech companies, the Dropbox business model revolves around subscriptions and that means it is relatively predictable. As long as users are satisfied with the product, they will continue using and paying for it. In Q3 of 2021, Dropbox had over 700 million registered users with 16.49 million paying users up from 15.25 million last year and those include both individuals and business subscriptions. Dropbox's business model focuses on converting existing users into paying users and we can see it's obviously working from this increase of 8.1% in the number of paying users per year. What Dropbox also does is upsell to existing users and nudge them to upgrade to premium plans, purchase additional licences and so on. As they say though, the proof is in the pudding. Over the last year, Dropbox has managed to increase the average revenue per user to $133.79 compared to $128.03 last year, which is a steady increase of 4.5%. When combined with the increase in paying users, that results in an increasingly profitable business and, as a result, Dropbox shows consistent growth every single quarter. Dropbox had 9 consecutive quarters of rising earnings, but broke their streak in the latest one. Q3 of 2021 showed a tiiiny dip from $0.40 to $0.37 dollars EPS, but that is still up 42% since last year. On the flipside, their revenue has grown every single consecutive quarter since they floated on the market with an average revenue growth of 12.5% to 19% year-on-year. Dropbox's revenue for Q3 was $550.2 million compared to $487 million last year so an increase of 12.9%. We can also see a decent increase in Dropbox's free cash flow of 18.4% to $221.5 million in Q3 of 2021.

# Expectations

Going forward, analysts expect that Dropbox will see a 9.8% increase in revenue next year and a 6% increase in earnings. This doesn't sound like much, but it follows after one of Dropbox's best years so far. Plus, analysts keep pushing their expectations up, which, again, means that Dropbox is performing better than expected. That's important because that's what drives the share price up! There have been 7 Q4 earnings revisions in the last 90 days and all 7 of them have been upward revisions. There has also been 9 revenue revision for Dropbox's full-year 2021 revenue in the last 90 days, 8 of which have been upward revisions. Overall, this bodes well for Dropbox's performance.

# Leaner operations

Also, I've noticed something which a lot of investors and analysts are overlooking right now, but it is extremely, extremely important in my opinion. The operating expenses of Dropbox have barely moved since December 2019 while their revenue has grown by 26% and their free cash flow has increased by 80%. Lean operations are what good tech businesses are all about so this is a really, really big plus for Dropbox in my books. Dropbox has high gross margins, currently 81% compared to the 80% last year and improving operating margins with 29.3% right now versus 23.0% last year.

# Founder is still in business

Another bullish argument for Dropbox is the fact that the founder Andrew Houston still owns almost 30% of Dropbox. That's a massive stake and shows his commitment to the company even though he did sell 9% of his total shares on 17th Nov. That's his only sale in the last 2 years though. Founders having a big stake in the company usually means that the company is still in the growth stage and the share price still has room to grow.

# Financial position

Then, let's take a look at Dropbox's cash position. They are flush with cash, absolutely loaded! They currently have $1.93 billion in cash and cash equivalents which is more than their debt of $1.37 billion which means that Dropbox is in a really good financial position considering that they are also profitable. Plus, Dropbox is not actually paying any interest on its long-term debt! The reason why is because they raised money using convertible notes without any interest. Instead, those notes give the loaner the opportunity to convert the notes to shares of Dropbox at the price of $35.35 and $38.25 per share. So, what is Dropbox doing with its cash? Well, first of all, they have been buying back shares. In fact, Dropbox has managed to reduce shares outstanding by 8.6% since the start of 2020. Just during the last quarter, they've bought back $181 million worth of shares! Second, they're using that cash to acquire new companies to fuel additional growth. Acquisitions can be a double-edged sword sometimes, but Dropbox has made it work so far. As I mentioned before, Dropbox bought HelloSign in February 2019 and DocSend in March 2021. The two acquisitions boosted Dropbox's capabilities and now allow them to offer a complete, full suite of self-serve products to its users.

Alright, I hope that by now we all have a pretty good understanding of what is the current situation with Dropbox. Two main questions now remain. One, is Dropbox trading at a good price. Two, what do we need to watch with Dropbox?

# Valuation

Let's look at the valuation first. Currently, Dropbox trades for a PE of 17.6 calculated using the adjusted EPS compared to the sector median of 25.3. Dropbox's forward PE is 16.5 which again lower than the sector median of 24.96. Finally, its PEG ratio is 0.53 and anything under 1 means that the stock is undervalued. The price-to-sales ratio of Dropbox is 4.66 compared to the sector's 4.08 and their forward price-to-sales are 4.36 compared to 4.14 so that's slightly higher than the median, but not by much. Dropbox also said that they expect $1 billion dollars in free cash flow by 2024, which gives us a forward price-to-free cash flow ratio of just 9 which is really, really good. Overall, Dropbox looks undervalued by several indicators right now. In terms of valuation, SimplyWallstreed gives Dropbox a fair value of $53.5 dollars based on its free cash flow. My personal EPS valuation of Dropbox gives me a more conservative figure of $40.2 dollars. Finbox's 10-year Gordon Growth model gives Dropbox an average valuation of $35.4 dollars which is near the analyst consensus of $34.5. Obviously, these are not precise targets, but the main point is that Dropbox currently appears really undervalued gives its current price of $24.7 dollars. The price of Dropbox surprisingly dipped 20% over the last 5 weeks which was strange. There was no actual obvious reason for it as Dropbox reported strong results and actually raised guidance going forward. To me, that's just a great opportunity to get a great stock at a discount!

# What to watch with Dropbox

Before we finish this off, I want to mention a few things that we need to keep an eye on with Dropbox. First of all, we need to monitor the number of paying users and the average revenue per user as we need to see steady increases there for Dropbox to justify the investment. If those numbers start to stagnate, it may be time to get out of Dropbox. Another figure to watch is the stock-based compensation. In 2020, the total stock-based compensation was $505.9 million which was more than the adjusted earnings of $409.1 million for the entire year! Dropbox is obviously no longer a startup, but it is still in a growth stage so that type of stock-based compensation is normal, but it's still good to keep an eye on it as it dilutes stock ownership. A lot of people have missed the fact that Dropbox has stock-compensation clauses for its CEO, Andrew Houston, connected to its stock price. More precisely, those stock prices are $30, $35, $40, basically on every $5 dollar increment so the more Dropbox's price goes up, the more stock-based compensation Andrew Houston will get. Finally, it looks like institutions are bullish on DBX, but a bit less so than before. The current put-to-call ratio is only 0.8 and that's up from 0.42 during the previous quarter. Essentially, a put-to-call ratio below 1 means that funds think Dropbox will go up. If that ratio goes significantly above 1, then that's one sign of bearish sentiment on the side of funds. Also, it looks like the institutional ownership of Dropbox has gone done from 84% in the last quarter to 76.6% right now. Personally, I think that's because Dropbox hit an all-time high in the latest quarter and funds took the opportunity to take some profits so I'm not that worried about the reducing ownership.

So, that's all I have to say about Dropbox for now. What do you think? Are you bullish like me?"

BlackBerry has so many upcoming catalysts that will make your **TENDIES PRINT** 🐔 💦 - QNX, Amazon Ivy, Billion Dollar Patent Sale/Partnership, Cyber Security, Internet of Things (IoT) ect... but there are other also things happening to drive each and every one of Blackberry's products forward - products that we don't even think about. So here is a bit of a product list with a sprinkling of speculation!

1. **QNX and QNX Hypervisor** \- QNX is in 195m cars, but the Hypervisor is more recent. All the new deals are not just buying QNX RTOS, but they are running the Hypervisor and multiple VM's on high performance chips. This means that the dollar per car will increase by at least 4 - 5 times current values of just QNX.
2. **BlackBerry IVY** \- When it launches there will be a whole new revenue stream for Blackberry, but it's going to be subscription based meaning month after month revenue! Great for changing stock analyst's opinions.
3. **BlackBerry Jarvis** \- Analyses software in embedded systems for vulnerabilities and regulatory compliance - Think about designing software for an EV and trying to get Government compliance for autonomous vehicle driving. Any tool to speed the process is going to do well it the race to build EV's
4. **BlackBerry Alert and ATHOC** are both crisis management and communication software that are becoming mission critical these days in a world of cyber attacks and global warming. Nothing but steady growth for these products.
5. **BlackBerry Radar** is global logistics and asset tracking solution. Covid blew that industry up! People want to know where their shit is!
6. **BlackBerry Cyber Security** \- AI (*Artificial intelligence*) integrated into their end points, into their authentication, and their new hardware, as well as having monitoring services and support.... Because Cyber incidents might not go away for a little while!

As a reminder, the market value of **BlackBerry is CRIMINALLY UNDERVALUED** **at \~$5 Billion** compared to their competitors such as $CRWD at $45 Billion, $PANW at $49 Billion and $ZS at $38 Billion as of December 2021.

**Overall Thoughts:**

BlackBerry is laying the foundation for a very successful next few years and I think the share price will reach $50+ over the next 2-3 of years from EV's alone, especially as the security risks become evermore publicized. The investing market as a whole simply is not yet aware and educated enough of the benefits BlackBerry will bring and can see no further than past performance and what revenue they are currently generating or will generate in the next couple of quarters, in addition to being biased by BlackBerry's uninspiring performance over the last months. This is fine, understandable even, but it is going to leave a lot of people kicking themselves when they didn't get BlackBerry for below $15 per share. Blackberry has got a lot of stuff going on, but every industry they are in is poised to explode in growth over the next 5 years!

**BlackBerry's weekly chart is approaching the breakout point and ready to explode and squeeze higher. Any good news should be bullish for the stock price!** 🚀🌕💎

**Rumors from earlier this year from credible new organizations speculated that Facebook and/or a group of entities is the buyer for BlackBerry's patent portfolio.**

**There was also interesting theories that a Facebook + BlackBerry partnership could be made where ""BlackBerry Secure"" could help bring WhatsApp to the Enterprise. Salesforce bought out Slack a while back for similar goals and integration. This could potentially help Facebook compete with Slack and Microsoft Teams as an Enterprise communications platform.**

Here's what they didn't figure out; the public doesn't really care about the Omicron variant. The US has a decent vax rate and taken together with antibodies, nearly 92% of the country has some form of immunity. Omicron searches on google trends are down big from a few weeks ago. People don't care. Not to get political, but it's likely the media isn't pushing Omicron as much because Biden's ratings are not hot and any further pressure on him won't help. Similarly, with a predicted red wave in 2022, the Dems don't want to put any more restrictions on business. So why is PLAY down? I think it overcorrected.

For all you “iT’s PriCed In!” turds, it’s not. The details and magnitude of patent sales this size are rare and unknown. There are no wallstreet/hedgefund models to price it in. Can it surprise to the downside? Of course. But that’s why we’re all playing this fun game aren’t we. 

Another catalyst- January 5th to the 8th 2022 is the CES Tech Conference in which BB is participating (along with MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, FB and more) to showcase their IVY tech and upcoming projects. This is a serious catalyst to start 2022.

It’s uncle BB’s time to shine. Highest conviction play right now. Double gun salute tardos. Mega Beast.

I've been shilling the fuck out of this stock based on the following thesis:

* Playboy is misunderstood. It's not a shitty boomer company anymore.
* Their revenues are increasing all nearly all fronts.. licensing, dtc apparel, and acquisitions (honey birdette, lovers, yandy)
* The inflection point: They're going to tie everything together with Centerfold, a creator-driven platform. Too much to discuss on this front, but basically it'll be a version of OnlyFans that offers more streams of revenue and a more trustworthy and reputable ""home"" for the nice tits gig economy.
* I don't think the market fully appreciates just how good of a shot PLBY has at pulling this off, and how much money it can pull in.
* The big risks: execution. Centerfold website could suck, could be delayed, the creators that come on board could be underwhelming, etc.

Today, another large part of that risk has been removed:

https://preview.redd.it/notyif2zs5381.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=7163def2b1c4c2adfb8efae116eca478a017fd16

There's a Forbes article (google: ""Cardi B Playboy"") that came out, too. My favorite quote:

> “Creators today deserve to express themselves freely and unfiltered,” she said. “They deserve to feel safe in their creativity and sexuality. And they deserve to own their future. This is what Centerfold is all about. For all those creators out there doing bold, revolutionary, truly culture-shifting things, come join me.” 

Basically, this announcement is a huge win. It ups the brand image of PLBY and makes it more likely that creators join Centerfold. It also shows management is really going all in on Centerfold, and that they're serious about creating a platform that serves creators.

My previous DDs go in depth about how Centerfold vs Onlyfans is \*not\* like Mixer vs Twitch:  Mixer/Twitch rely on the network effect -- more viewers means more creators, means more viewers, etc.   CF/OF only requires creators -- more creators, more subs... plain and simple. The creators bring their own audience through hustling... and who better to represent creators than Cardi B?

**I still do not believe for a second that the market fully appreciates how good of a shot PLBY has at capturing a lot of this market from OnlyFans.** In fact, I'm doubtful they're even aware there is a publicly traded company that offers exposure to the cammer market, which is fucking massive and growing, and a no-brainer investment, deserving of tech valuations.

I think that when Centerfold officially launches (**their launch party is this Saturday**, **so I assume an official PR announcement will be made no later than that**), the stock is going to go fucking nuts as smart money moves in.

# Risks

Since I started following the stock, a lot of the risk is starting to evaporate:

* ~~Launch gets delayed.~~ On Oct 20, Launch got moved from H2 2022 to Q4 2021.  On Nov 31, launch party was announced for Saturday Dec 4. So, seems very likely it's ready to ship.
* ~~Launch is underwhelming.~~ Cardi B is on board. I expect in the official newswire print, there will be **a lot** of bullish language surrounding that. Also I expect a lot of talk about the revenue potential of the market, how the product ties in the rest of the company (flywheel effect, synergies, etc), how the product has an edge over OnlyFans (created with creators in mind, possibly better revshare, offers multiple revenue streams, etc).
* Website could suck. Still a possibility. But, honestly, I don't think it needs to be anything amazing. It's basically a blogging website where subscribers have to pay to see the blog. At any rate, there are technical risks here. Site could go down, could have bugs, etc.
* Is it an appealing place for creators to join? It's possible OnlyFans is too ""sticky"", or that Centerfold just doesn't provide enough juice. I personally don't think this is the case, but it's a common criticism.  I think it'll become the preferred platform for creators for many reasons: possibly better revshare, more culturally relevant/reputable, created with founders in mind (sex-positive, anti-censorship, and be-your-own-business are all central tenants), multiple rev streams (commissions, apparel lines, etc), and best of all: **they didn't tell all their creators they'd ban sexual content, like OnlyFans did.** (Yes, OnlyFans reversed this decision, but still... imagine your livelihood being threatened overnight... would you still want to do business with them if you had a better alternative?)
* Market could simply not care.  Always a possibility.. but I don't think all the things I'm raving about here are known to the market, and I think the official launch print will make it more clear.

# Other News

* A new ETF launched to capture exposure to non-fungus-tokens, and PLBY fungi are the top holdings of it.
* PLBY announced more liquor and apparel collabs, proving once again they are still culturally relevant despite what a lot of you retards keep saying in response to my DDs.
* You're gay if you don't buy the stock

# How much of a Catalyst?

This is the question I ask myself every time I look at my massive pile of highly volatile Dec and Jan calls. When Centerfold launches... will the market care? How much of this is priced in? How big will the launch actually be?

My thoughts on that:

* I think a tiny fraction of would-be investors are aware of the plan of Centerfold, and how it'll fit in to PLBY's other stuff... of which they are also unaware.  So the launch will illuminate that quite a bit. On top of that, I think it's highly investable.
* Of those that are/were aware of the above, I think only a fraction are aware that Centerfold is coming ""this quarter"".
* Of those, I think only a fraction of them are aware the launch party is Saturday, so I think the news print comes out Saturday at the latest.
* I think it's clear Centerfold is Playboy's big bet. So when they launch, I expect them to throw everything they've got at it. CEO and Cardi B making the rounds on CNBC and wherever else.. strip clubs I guess. Big marketing. Targeted ads to creators. Whatever... they'll want everyone to know the ""new OnlyFans"" is here, and as a consequence the market will buy in to the hype as well. **I think it could basically be like a smaller version of what an IPO for OnlyFans would be.**
* Is it priced in? Partially, yeah. it's been climbing since the Oct 20 announcement that Centerfold will be launched in Q4. They also had a great earnings, and on the call Centerfold was hyped. But I don't think the possible market-wide interest in this stock is priced in... and I don't think the hundreds of millions in potential revenue is priced in (OnlyFans pulled in \~$3b I think?).

# What else?

Plenty of bulls on this stock, lots of bullish news. Read the latest Forbes article, and google ""hedgeye PLBY"".

# Positions / etc

**Still a fuck ton of Dec and Jan calls**, since launch is imminent. Been buying the dips... probably recklessly exposed to this stock, but fuck it... it's my end of year YOLO and I'll happily bet on a massive upcoming catalyst like Centerfold launching. I think this Cardi B announcement and price effect is nowhere near as big as the Centerfold announcement will be."

Part of Wish’s plan to turn things around is cutting back on ad spending to focus on its existing users.

1. Increase user confidence in the platform.
2. Provide a more “differentiated and engaging” user experience.

It first took steps to improve confidence through its **Wish Standards program**. The new program rewards sellers for higher-quality experiences. In turn, it highlights the top-performing merchants on its platform.

Secondly, Wish is trying to improve the shopping experience with **Wish Clips**. The new feature brings users closer to the product with live video shopping abilities. In light of this, the company plans on building one of the biggest libraries of shoppable videos.

And lastly, the company is partnering with Klarna to offer **‘Buy Now, Pay Later’** for its customers. The partnership is expected to drive additional sales and traffic.

As can be seen, the company is doing what it can to improve its image from a “cheap marketplace” to a “value marketplace.”

This makes it very likely that Centerfold will actually launch before then. I believe the launch will be a news-worthy event and will draw a lot of eyes to the stock. 🐰🚀

For my original DD on why Centerfold matters, see the previous DD: [🍆💦 = 🐰🚀 -- $PLBY hitting an inflection point, and will challenge OnlyFans and Instagram in early December.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9w1b/)

# What's the opportunity?

**Up until now, Centerfold has just been a little known concept and something in the pipeline -- not even remotely on the radar of most investors. On launch, it will become a reality, an official news event, and investors will decide just how much real potential it holds for PLBY stock. In my opinion, the ability to invest in an OnlyFans competitor capable of pulling in 9+ digits of recurring revenue on short order is appealing.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qiiyactapq281.png?width=941&format=png&auto=webp&s=62c64313900241d70a640abf0b16a2b0052f2e2a

On Friday at 9:00pm, this message was sent to holders of Rabbitars, PLBY's <forbidden-token-phrase> project that pulled in millions in Q3. These <forbidden-token-phrase> are meant to be ""membership keys"" that entitle owners to certain perks -- these perks will be fleshed out more fully in the future. One of those perks, apparently, is the ability to RSVP to this launch party. I personally find it interesting and bullish that PLBY is tying <forbidden-token-phrase> to IRL stuff, but that's besides the point: The news of the launch was made public here.

The link itself points to this:

https://preview.redd.it/lqhilx9bpq281.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e809e155df2b7a0f45ca5780da1d86757d32a18

While the news-of-the-news is known to people that follow PLBY pretty closely, the actual news that ""Playboy launches Centerfold, an OnlyFans competitor"" hasn't hit yet. When it does, it will likely hit some pretty high-profile news feeds. Hopefully when that happens -- which all signs point to being by EOW -- investors of all sorts will all take a closer look at just what the fuck Playboy Centerfold is, and if it's investment worthy.

# What is Centerfold?

https://preview.redd.it/2pgvdjsbpq281.png?width=1023&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b1a237f9caa5bf6e184fb4d89f3a4ee12f43346

Centerfold will be a creator-driven social platform that allows creators to monetize themselves in a variety of ways:

* Subscription-based content, like OnlyFans.
* An anti-censorship platform to post content, like Instagram but without your account getting randomly deleted for showing a nipple.
* A platform that drives revenue through PLBY's other assets

As covered in [my previous DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9w1b/), I think it has a ton of potential that I do not feel is priced in to the stock:

* It has the ability to, on short order, pull in revenues that outsize all of PLBY's current revenues. Yet, management has thus far used $0 as guidance in their forecasts for '22.
* In August OnlyFans fucked up by saying they wouldn't allow sexual explicit content. They later reverted that decision, but the reputational damage was done. The timing is perfect for creators to take flight from OF to a more trustworthy platform that would never threaten their business, and whose entire purpose is to allow creators to monetize themselves in multiple ways.
* Much more info in [my previous dd](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9w1b/).

# Why will it be newsworthy?

I expect there to be an official PR release, which means it hits the ticker's news feeds. In that PR release, I think there will be a few things highlighted:

* Names of creators and ambassadors.  Up until now, we only know they consist of group with over 300M followers, and 100s of millions of $GMV. If some high profile names drop, like Cardi B, it could become some pretty high profile news!
* Specifics on the intended use cases, how closely it competes with OnlyFans/Instagram (eg, the content policy), etc.
* Lots of bullish remarks on revenue potential, cultural significance, etc.

# Other things of note

## Image of the stock

You might think that the news-of-the-news is already priced in... I don't. I still think the *vast majority* of investors have no clue Playboy was planning on launching an OnlyFans competitor, and that this launch will attract a lot of new blood into the stock. This news drop can be a turning point for the stock, changing it's reputation from a dying publisher to a tech-focused company with very high cultural relevance and brand value.

## Other bulls, reading material

* Me. This is by far my largest position right now.
* /u/UberKikz aka, GMEDD guy, banana guy
* Brian McGough, from Hedgeye. His highest conviction play, even before Centerfold
* Jim Osman: Just yesterday released a lengthy piece on PLBY in Forbes. Google ""Forbes Playboy""
* whossayn on theideafund, google it

## Options Chain

https://preview.redd.it/c1gukfkcpq281.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=b18de87bdbd8ce1c21beb2063def8c13b5072e27

The options chain is starting to get pretty jacked up. Gamma values are at 0.36% float per 1% price move -- and a whopping 3.00%+ of daily volume. There is also significant Vanna potential here:  If MMs start to hedge more aggressively due to higher volatility, they'll have to buy a significant amount of shares, at least until we hit the $50 range.

Given the low daily volume of the stock, I think options activity and hedging can have a pretty high impact on the stock's price. In other words, if the catalyst does indeed push the underlying share price up, I think the outstanding options will provide some further boost to share price.

Obligatory warning: Just as dealer hedging can make the stock go up more easily, it can make it fall down more easily as well.

# Risks

While I think the launch will be incredibly bullish, it's possible it can be a dud. Any or all of these might occur:

* The site itself is a disappointment. Shitty design, slow load time, crappy feature set, etc.
* The content policy is insufficient to compete with OF. If they don't allow female masturbation, for example. (However, I still think competing with Insta is a pretty large market -- a lot of pretty vanilla creators have their Insta accounts regularly deleted due to tiny bits of nudity.)
* The initial set of creators sucks. It's possible it's a bunch of woke-related weirdos and ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" type bullshit. PLBY is woke like that, so it's possible. But it's also Playboy... I think they can scope out good tits from bad tits. I think it'll be an interesting mix. Expect some weirdos, though, and realize that some of this is a positive thing as it attracts the very sex-positive and liberal crowd of actual money-making creators.
* Investors see this is a no-go, due to exposure to a potentially ""sketchy"" industry. However, I personally think PLBY is woke enough to walk this line perfectly.
* The news isn't really big news at all. It gets launched, and nobody really cares.

It is the summer of 2015, orange man is on the rise. I'm twenty years old, working in a hot stuffy Western Digital (HGST) lab. I spend my days putting hard drives and SSDs into servers, running tests on them, collecting data, updating the firmware & replacing the drives. This is the work for dummies like me who couldn't get internships at tech companies.

And now that we've established that I'm retarded (a slow learner), let's continue. I'm coming home every night and reading about investing. I read ""PROFITS GOOD"", ""DIVIDENDS GOOD"", ""TECH BAD,"" ""TECH NO MAKE PROFIT OR PAY DIVIDEND,"" ""TECH IS BUBBLE.""

Okay, simple enough, so I go around telling everyone , ""tech is bubble, amazon has NEVER made profit"". ""People should invest in companies that make profit and pay dividends so dividends can be reinvested.""

So with this stupid thinking, guess what I do??? I put 8K into Ford because it pays dividends and makes profit, unlike Tesla, which is ""total scam"".

REEEeeeeeEEEEEEeeeEEEEEE, FUCK FUCK FUCK.

Three years of my life past and this dog shit car company goes down 30%. But HEY, at least I got dividends the whole way down. Meanwhile FANGS killed it (Amazon up 250%...)

# What I failed to understand

We currently live in an era where access to capital (money) is dirt fucking cheap (i.e. low interest rates). If we look at a chart for the interest rates on corporate debt, we see that we've been in a secular decline since the 1980s. Hence, year after year, access to capital is getting cheaper and cheaper.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8sm2zhuwmn281.png?width=2356&format=png&auto=webp&s=22290983179194c6325db318f955dd39b5aafddf

So in an era of cheap capital, the big dick move is to reinvest all revenue back into the company and expand aggressively as possible. Company over spends one year? Who gives a fuck, we're growing revenues at 10, 20, 30% year over year. The interest rates on the debt is nothing compared to the revenue growth.

This is why growth stocks have absolutely crushed it since 2008. Old boomers will cry all day about the importance of ""profits"" but what they fail to realize is the times have changed. They grew up in an era where capital was becoming more and more scarce as interest rates marched higher and higher. When capital is scarce, profits and the accumulation of capital is everything.

""BUT WHAT ABOUT COMPANIES THAT MAKE FAT PROFITS, AND HAVE HIGH REVENUE GROWTH??""

Those make my pp extra hard (i.e. apple, google, microsoft). The important aspect to me however is they continue to have high revenue growth. I'd take revenue growth over profits any fucking day of the week.

In my opinion some of the greatest value investors of this decade will be investors that find companies where the market is greatly misunderstanding the companies future revenue growth. A recent example of this is Asana, where it was growing revenue at 80% per year, however the market cap was only 4 billion at IPO.

However, I'm still retarded so I don't listen to my own advice. Only bought $4,000 worth and no calls 🤦‍♂️

&#x200B;

I think Matterport is going to be huge in the coming months… and here's why:

&#x200B;

To reach as many people as possible, every e-commerce company wants to distribute their fulfillment network as much as possible. The downside of this distribution is that the engineering and construction teams must travel to get accurate site measurements (as-designed - NEVER - matches the as-built... or the building just doesn't have blueprints/CAD available). This type of situation makes Matterport an indispensable tool; reducing engineer travel and speeding up the whole design process. Matterport has a network of contractors with their 3D scanning equipment across the country, and can easily get an accurate 3D and 2D model of the site built. As more e-commerce startups happen, and formerly closed business spaces begin to re-open, Matterport will be the go-to for accurate space information.

&#x200B;

Facebook already has a contract with Matterport for AI research. As Meta continues to grow and tries to get ""digitized"" workplaces, I'm sure Matterport will be the company scanning every corporate facility for ingestion.  Apple, Google, Microsoft, and many others are also trying to compete with Meta in the digital workspace realm, and they will also need 3D scans of workplaces, so this will be ripe for opportunity. The possibilities here are limitless.

&#x200B;

I've been keeping an eye on the housing market, and I would estimate that around 30% of houses I'm seeing have an accompanying Matterport. As foreclosures start to happen and the technology continues to gain popularity, this will only drive more adoption."

**Intro:**

**This is a long term play, shares or LEAPS are the way to go.**

I’ve been buying logitech speakers and other products for a long time, they’ve always been great as a budget option for this category. I also have a Logitech gaming mouse (G700s), which came out as the best mid-end option in my research at the time. I’m a sim racer and have had a Logitech sim wheel, was a great budget option at the time. I’ve now upgraded to a high-end brand though. I also used a Logitech flight stick for literally forever, never failed me, I think it got lost somewhere when I stopped playing flight sims. I have a Logitech C920 webcam, bought on the recommendation of my cam-girl friends. I just use it for MSTeams/Google Classroom though...lol. I also had a Logitech microphone back when I was a teen gamer, which lasted fucking forever and was good quality for the price. My point is, if you’re a gamer, sim racer, flight sim enthusiast, enjoyer of music, office worker, remote worker, pandemic student, or general PC user...you’ve probably owned or still own many Logitech products. How have these products held up for you, were they good quality? Did they last long? I’ve generally found them to be high quality for the price, and seemed to last forever. 

**LOGI (Logitech International SA) popped up on my morning gap up market scanner this morning.**

""Profit booking on the minds of LOGI investors as it marginally outperforms""
""LOGITECH INTERNATIONAL SA delivered good returns today. It grew by +0.58% to close at 80.06. During the last week it lost -1.39% and saw a maximum drawdown of -1.96% before bouncing back.""

Todays pop was likely caused by a Citi Analyst raising their price target, thank you to /u/yoyo248 for pointing this out:

* ""@algobotnews
Logitech risk/reward offers 'very attractive opportunity,' says Citi""

https://twitter.com/algobotnews/status/1461291610923311109

*“Logitech International SA is a holding company, which engages in the design, manufacture, and marketing of peripherals for PCs, tablets, and other digital platforms. Its products include mice, keyboards, presentation remotes, headsets, and speakers. The firm offers solutions for healthy computing, wireless charging, streaming, virtual reality, rom home, schools, healthcare, and software and apps. Its brands include Logitech, Jaybird, Ultimate Ears, Logitech G, ASTRO Gaming, and Blue Microphones. The company was founded by Daniel Borel, Pierluigi Zappacosta, and Giacamo Marini on October 2, 1981 and is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland” (marketbeat.com)*

**The below DD uses multiple sources. Sorry I’m not using Harvard referencing, but my Physics papers have made me sick to death of that so I’m only doing a bibliography and linking a few articles I sourced from (not all because Reddit doesn't allow you to link a few of the sites). Please PM me if you want this since Reddit blocks a few of the links:**

**Logitech is referenced as a good post-pandemic play, for a variety of reasons:**
* The company is benefiting from COVID trends, but also secular trends (“A secular trend or market is one that is likely to continue moving in the same general direction for the foreseeable future. ... The secular movement of a long-term trend can be neutral (flat), positive, or negative in its direction.”).

* It is sustaining YOY growth, paying a very safe dividend (in my research it is strongly recommended as a dividend stock). The company is investing in the ‘future’ (i’ll get onto this later).
Operations are within target, there’s strong cash flow and free cash flow.

* Logitech had a great quarter (despite rising costs, material shortfalls and margin pressure). On a two year basis, revenue is up more than 82%. No doubt due to the gaming boom during the pandemic. 
It is said that logitech is underperforming in cams, tablet accessories, video and headsets (which all saw high-double-digit growth last year). Which I’m surprised to see, as I’m friends with some cam girls, and the device of choice in that industry is and always has been the Logitech C920 webcam. Maybe a surge of Pandemic cam girls will offset this (in all seriousness lol, great brand loyalty to Logitech there).

* They are delivering strength in keyboards, pointers and gaming equipment. Which doesn’t surprise me. I’ve been doing flight sims and sim racing for a long time. On the low to mid end, Logitech has been my choice and the recommended choice for flight sticks and sim wheels. Logitech is killing it in the low/mid end sim racing market. 

**Earnings:**

* Operating income, both GAAP and adjusted, fell 40% but largely due to a 60% increase in marketing and 30% increase in R&D. Which are acceptable reasons, as they should result in higher sales long-term. 

* The company reaffirmed its guidance for revenue and earnings at the previously stated range. “ This is calling for full-year growth in the range of flat to +/- 5% which we view as a wide range given this year’s YTD strength. The comps are going to get tougher before they get easy again but the two strongest quarters of the fiscal year are still ahead. In our view, Logitech should produce at least flat to slightly higher YOY revenue if not growth in the mid-single-digit range.” (https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/logitech-is-still-a-logical-choice-for-dividend-growth-portfolios/?focus=NASDAQ:LOGI)

* “In Q2, adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share fell short of the consensus estimate of $1.10 per share. The company reported earnings of $1.56 per share in the prior-year period.”

* “However, revenues of $1.31 billion were up 4% from the previous year’s quarter and surpassed the Street’s estimates of $1.27 billion.”
 * “Notably, Logitech reaffirmed its guidance for Fiscal 2022. The company expects flat sales growth in constant currency with a probable variation of nearly 5%. Further, it expects to report adjusted operating income in the range of $800 million to $850 million.”
(https://www.tipranks.com/news/logitech-posts-mixed-fiscal-q2-results/)

* Logitech CEO Bracken Darrell commented, “In Q2 we delivered record sales which beat last year’s exceptional sales levels, growing 4% in the quarter and 82% compared to two years ago. We also grew market share in the majority of our key product categories.”
Looking forward, he added “We are confirming our full year outlook, despite unprecedented supply chain industry challenges. I am excited about the long-term growth potential of Logitech.”

**Next earnings date:**

* “Important Dates for Investors in LOGI:
Logitech International SA is set to release earnings on 1/23/2022

* We do not have a set dividend date for Logitech International SA at this time”
(https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/stock-update/should-you-accumulate-logitech-international-sa-logi-stock-friday-morning-2)

**Q2 Sales:**

* “Q2 sales were $1.31 billion, up 4 percent in US dollars and 2 percent in constant currency, compared to Q2 of the prior year.”

* “Q2 GAAP operating income declined 44 percent to $179 million, compared to $322 million in the same quarter a year ago. Q2 GAAP earnings per share (EPS) declined 48 percent to $0.81, compared to $1.56 in the same quarter a year ago.”
* “Q2 non-GAAP operating income declined 40 percent to $211 million, compared to $354 million in the same quarter a year ago. Q2 non-GAAP EPS declined 44 percent to $1.05, compared to $1.87 in the same quarter a year ago.”

* “In Q2 we delivered record sales which beat last year’s exceptional sales levels, growing 4% in the quarter and 82% compared to two years ago. We also grew market share in the majority of our key product categories,” said Bracken Darrell, Logitech president and chief executive officer. “We are confirming our full year outlook, despite unprecedented supply chain industry challenges. I am excited about the long-term growth potential of Logitech.”
(https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211025005827/en/Logitech-Delivers-Record-Q2-Sales)

* Its 3 year net income to common stockholders growth rate is now at 115.87%.

* The 2 year cash and equivalents growth rate now stands at 11.47%.

* Its 2 year net cashflow from operations growth rate is now at 22.74%.

* LOGI's revenue has moved up $3,550,043,000 over the prior 52 months.

See below:

(https://stocknews.com/stock/LOGI/)

**Dividend:**
* Logitech pays a growing 1.12% yield, which is considered very safe.

* As mentioned before they posted a negative cash flow for the quarter due to ad-spend and R&D, not weakness. “The balance sheet is an absolute fortress” (marketbeat.com).

* The company net-cash with very low leverage and ample coverage. Hence no fear of dividend cut or suspension. It also gives reason to think there will be another dividend increase next year. Logitech pays out annually, and only recently made the last distribution.

**The Dip:**
* Logitech has declined this year following supply shortages and a Q2 result miss (which there are ‘logical’ reasons for.)

* Logitech is down 15% this year. It sells for 15 times earnings, it’s normal multiple in the past decade has been 23. It hasn’t been a bad year for Logitech. Revenue in the past year was up 51% and earnings were up more than 32%.

* The stock peaked in June at about $138 and has fallen to the $80-range.
Critics say the company has spent excessively on marketing. Profit margins have shrunk.
However, based on Logitech’s long term record, I think it is a good play.

**The Growing PC Gaming Accessories Market:**

* “Advance Market Analytics published a new research publication on “PC Gaming Accessories Market Insights, to 2026″ with 232 pages and enriched with self-explained Tables and charts in presentable format. In the Study you will find new evolving Trends, Drivers, Restraints, Opportunities generated by targeting market associated stakeholders. The growth of the PC Gaming Accessories Market was mainly driven by the increasing R&D spending across the world.”

* “Controllers, gamepads, keyboards, cameras, virtual reality headsets, and other gaming peripherals are included in the category of gaming accessories. The global demand for gaming accessories has increased in recent years due to the rising usage of PCs. Furthermore, innovations such as virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) have aided the worldwide gaming accessory market’s expansion.”

* I’ve requested a report sample from the market research companies that publish it. I’ll update the DD later with it:

* “Dear (commodoregoat, I’ve removed my name lol),
A specialist from our team will get in touch with you shortly to help you find the right insights based on your research goals.
As a premier market research firm, we guarantee more than 90% accuracy on the data we provide.”

* “Dear (commodoregoat)

Global Wireless Keyboard Market , summary linked to this report: https://imgur.com/Wj3zYW2

* I’m going to update this with some of my own research later, as well as my findings from this report if they send me it. I requested a section relevant to Logitech. Using my student cred to hopefully get them to send me it even though I’m not a professional. 

**Is Logitech a bargain right now?:**

I found an interesting article (after discarding many during my research) analysing if Logitech is currently a cheap stock, I’ve quoted the important parts below:

* “Logitech, which makes input and interface devices for personal computers and electronics such as keyboards, computer mice, bluetooth speakers and universal remotes, saw its share price more than double over 2020, with the good times continuing over the first half of this year. But the stock has fallen on hard times of late, dropping 37 per cent since early June.”

* “Appealing to the company’s significant runway ahead, however, David Driscoll (Portfolio Manager) named LOGI one of his Top Picks for the next 12 months while speaking on a BNN Bloomberg segment on Friday.”

* “We’ve spoken about companies that have fallen more than 20 per cent from their highs despite the fact that the revenue growth and profit growth is there. The reason [Logitech] has fallen as much as it has from its high price of 124 Swiss francs to where it is at 82 is simply because of the COVID variant lockdowns,” Driscoll said.

* “You’re not getting people out there in the gaming industry having competitions and people showing up at movie theatres to watch it,” said Driscoll, President and CEO of Liberty International Investment Management. 

* “This company makes computer mice and the trackballs, game controllers, keyboards, video cameras and multimedia speakers. So, the long term outlook for the company is very strong because, again, video gaming is going to be a thing of the future,” he said.

* “The stock trades at 13x earnings so it’s very cheap right now. Dividends have been rising by ten per cent a year and free cash flow yields are around ten per cent relative to where bond yields are. And then when we look at the return on capital of 46 per cent versus the cost of capital at eight per cent it certainly gives Logitech a great opportunity to raise the dividends and innovate and to spend on research and development for the future,” he said.
“So, I just think where we are at it’s very cheap stock,” Driscoll said.

* “We’ve started strong in Fiscal Year 2022, with Q1 sales up 58 per cent in constant currency and profits doubling versus last year,” said Bracken Darrell, Logitech president and CEO, in a July 26 press release. “Our key categories grew high double digits. This performance demonstrates the strength of our capabilities, excellent operational execution, and ability to capitalize on long-term trends, like gaming, streaming and creating, hybrid work and video everywhere.”

* With Logitech’s fiscal fourth quarter results in April, the company announced both an increase to its share buyback program bringing it to up to $1 billion and a dividend increase of ten per cent, saying the two moves show the company’s “continued commitment to consistently return cash to shareholders.”

**What makes Logitech a good buy?:**

I dislike the Motley Fool and Seeking Alpha, but I haven’t found any other good research for this section. Take (some of)this section with a grain of salt as I’m using them as my sources. If you feel like it skip past the Motley Fool/Seeking Alpha section to see my own analysis and what I’ve wrote from other sources. But so far the Fool/SA articles seem to be a rare gem on them and I’m getting useful information. I’ve mixed a decent amount of my own opinion/writing in (it isn’t just paraphrased).

* “Logitech is still seeing high demand for webcams, keyboards, and gaming products.
It's gaining market share in secular growth categories like gaming.
The stock is trading at cheap levels, despite a long runway of growth ahead.”

*Takeaways from earnings report:*

* Logitech’s sales were up 58% year over year, while its operating profit more than doubled.
“ In a statement, CEO Bracken Darrell said, ""This performance demonstrates the strength of our capabilities, excellent operational execution, and ability to capitalize on long-term trends, like gaming, streaming and creating, hybrid work and video everywhere.""

See below:
https://imgur.com/UbNXJZA

(IMAGE SOURCE: LOGITECH INTERNATIONAL'S FISCAL Q1 2022 EARNINGS PRESENTATION.)

* The global market for webcams was estimated at $6.1 billion in 2019 (according to Grand View Research.)“According to an analysis published in May 2020, it’s expect to grow at a compound annual rate of 8% through 2027”

* “In a similar report on gaming peripherals, the market was estimated at $3.9 billion in 2019, and forecast to grow at a compound annual rate of 10.4% through 2025.”

* ‘Investors now seem overly concerned about a near-term deceleration in growth as the company begins to lap periods when demand spiked for its products during the pandemic. But investors should base their view of Logitech as an investment on the long-term opportunities in front of it. As Darrell said on the earnings call, ""We have an exciting long-term growth potential ahead from this bigger [sales] base.""’

*Gaining market share:*

* While riding trends in remote work and gaming, Logitech is also gaining market share.
It is the leader in most categories it operates in (important ones to note are webcams for cam girls and web conferencing, keyboards, mouses, sim racing, flight sims, other gaming peripherals)

* Market share gains are difficult to come by during pandemic due to supply shortages.
“But with supply catching up to demand, Logitech reported share gains across most categories last quarter.“
Logitech has gained market share in gaming, where sales increased by 76% ‘on a currency-neutral basis.

* “Darrell said that Logitech's marketing around gaming is ""probably the best we've had."" ...having seen this statement I’m going to write a section on their marketing, to see what’s up.

* “Logitech’s PC peripherals business grew 49% year over year, products that have been on the market for 2 years are still driving sales, including the MX Master 3 mouse and MX keys keyboard.”

*Demand is high for hybrid solutions:*

* The growth of Logitech’s webcam business (lmao camgirls and zoom) supports Logitech management's belief that the pandemic has forever changed the workplace. 
* “Darrell suggested that some people may find it awkward to do audio-only calls in the future. The company's 73% sales growth in webcams implies that the need for hybrid solutions in the office will continue to support demand of Logitech’s products “
* “The installed base of PCs is estimated at 1.4 billion, which gives Logitech a massive market in which to grow sales for many years. ""[W]e think the opportunity there is very significant, and we're going to keep investing,"" Darrell said. “

*Secular opportunities to drive long-term growth:*

* “Logitech listed four secular growth trends at its investor day held in March this year: the growth of remote work, the transition from audio toward video calls, video gaming as a spectator sport, and the spike in streaming and content creation.”

* “Logitech expects these trends to create new opportunities” such as:
Workspaces will have to be upgraded, as workers move to remote, or a hybrid model that includes remote and the office.

* “As a result, employees/organizations can be expected to invest more money into peripherals such as keyboards, mice, tablets, and speakers, among other items.” all of which Logitech is a market leader in.
 
* This just reminded me I’ve been buying logitech speakers for a long time, they’ve always been great as a budget option for this category. I also have a Logitech gaming mouse (G700s), which came out as the best mid-end option in my research at the time. I’m a sim racer and have had a Logitech sim wheel, was a great budget option at the time. I’ve now upgraded to a high-end brand though. I also used a Logitech flight stick for literally forever, never failed me, I think it got lost somewhere when I stopped playing flight sims. I have a Logitech C920 webcam, bought on the recommendation of my cam-girl friends. I just use it for MSTeams/Google Classroom though...lol. I also had a Logitech microphone as a teen gamer, which lasted fucking forever and was good quality for the price. My point is, if you’re a gamer, sim racer, flight sim enthusiast, enjoyer of music, office worker, remote worker, pandemic student, or general PC user...you’ve probably owned or still own many Logitech products. How have these products held up for you, were they good quality? Did they last long? I’ve generally found them to be high quality for the price, and seemed to last forever. I like this paragraph so I’m going to copy it as the intro. Sorry for making you re-read it, but it’s relevant to this section.

* This investment by organisations into peripherals would spark a ‘refresh cycle’ and likely increase demand of Logitech’s products (eg pointing devices, keyboards, and tablet accessories.
Logitech, from my personal impression, is a leader in the webcam sector. Cam girls all use the C920, and now students, teachers, office workers etc are all buying the C920 and others for video calls. 
The shift to video calls due to the pandemic means that demand for video collaboration equipment and webcams is likely to increase.

* “Third-party research estimates the webcam market will grow at an annual pace of 16.6% through 2026 and hit $24.6 billion in value. The videoconferencing market is also expected to clock double-digit growth over the long run.”

* This is a good sign for logitech, as video collab equipment and webcams produced more than 28% of its revenue last year.

* The video gaming market is also driving sales for Logitech/the need for new equipment, due to the growing adoption of esports (I’m paraphrasing here, but I think Motley Fool forgot normal gamers here, a lot of us have been upgrading our PC’s, mouses, keyboards, microphones.).

* “According to third-party estimates, the global esports market could clock 15% annual growth through 2026. This would encourage gamers to invest more money into the latest equipment, unlocking another solid opportunity for Logitech.”

* Due to catalysts including esports, online education and other forms of content creation (eg Twitch, Youtube, Camgirls), the video streaming market is anticipated to grow at 21% a year through to 2028 ‘according to Grand View Research.’

* “So it is safe to say that Logitech is sitting on a bunch of impressive growth drivers that could help the company deliver eye-popping results in the long run.”
* “As such, investors looking to add a growth stock to their portfolio shouldn't delay further. Logitech's recent pullback has made the stock cheap, with its price-to-sales ratio of 3.96 falling below last year's average multiple of 4.5. The earnings multiple of 22 is also below the 2020 average of 24.6. A strong earnings report could kick-start Logitech stock's rally, which is why now looks like a good time to go long.” <- this is as of Jul 17 so outdated info, please check elsewhere in this DD for more recent info.

*Logitech is an attractive opportunity now:*

* ""Logitech is very undervalued at current levels.""

* ""The company has a superb track record of beating earnings estimates.""

* ""We think current price levels are attractive for long-term investors. However, we'd like to see a trend reversal before jumping in.""

*Growth Catalysts:*

* Video games. “The average time spent playing video games is projected to increase from 1.1 hours per person per day to 1.5 hours during the next 5 years.” (https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/7dbf4906-4a13-47f9-9a4c-f7898ff6d1b4)

* Reddit brings this to an average of 3-24 hours. You fucking degenerates. 

* “This can be attributed to 2 factors. The first one is that video games are becoming increasingly social. The second one is thanks to the rise of eSports which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.1% from 2019 to 2024.” (https://influencermarketinghub.com/esports-stats/)

* “The second catalyst is the content market which is expected to see growth of 13% CAGR from 2021 to 2026. This includes industries such as movies, music, education, and others.” (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/digital-content-market-size-usd-397-390-million-by-2026-at-cagr-13--valuates-reports-301187341.htm)
CAGR = Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)

*Valuation:*

* ""The intrinsic value has dropped a little to $124 per share. However, at the current price, there is finally a good margin of safety for Logitech.”

*Potential Short-Term Catalysts and Risks:*

* Logitech share price has been falling for several months, this is likely due to the expectation that the boost from the pandemic will disappear and growth will decline temporarily.
Current price may be too pessimistic, “especially when considering that it is already undervalued even with the expected decline in growth.”

* Logitech tends to beat earnings estimates often.
Keep in mind that recent larger beats could be due to pandemic boost. The company may face bigger headwinds than anticipated going forward. 

* However if the trend of beating earnings continues, it could give the stock a push upwards.
(I’ve covered this later in the DD) Logitech is unlikely to be immune from supply chain issues that have impacted a large number of companies around the world. 

* This is an important risk to consider, especially as Logitech is largely pushing hardware products. If Logitech were to announce its inventory has been impacted, it is very possible that the stock would tumble even if they beat on expectations. Note: I think this might very well be the explanation for the current price at the $80 range, read my segment on supply chain issues later in the DD.

*Final thoughts on this section:*


* “Logitech is significantly more attractive today than it was back in July. Long-term investors could potentially consider entering at these prices. However, we rate it a hold because its stock price is still on a short-term downtrend and would like to see the trend reverse before entering.” (Oct 12, 2021)
 
**How Logitech is benefiting from the work from home revolution:**

* “Logitech’s share of the global computer peripheral equipment market grew from 0.6% in calendar 2019 to 1.0% in calendar 2020.

* The permanent shifts in where people work and how they spend their free time may have created a new, larger base for Logitech’s sales.

Logitech’s largest segments are projected to grow at much faster rates than the rest of the computer peripherals market.”

* The firm is well positioned to continue to profit from growth in gaming and work from home:
“the shift to work from home (WFH) will support elevated profits going forward
its strong position in the gaming peripherals industry, which is expected to grow 10% compounded annually through 2025

* The firm’s history of profitable growth.

* The current valuation already implies profits fall 32%” (Oct 11, 2021)

**I will be posting part two later today, I wrote this 7 days ago also, but I will be updating with more recent information**

**Note re VisualMod:** I made this alt-account solely for posting DD's. I have a main, but that's for shitposting. I'm a mod on some other subs and I don't want to bring apes there either. I have been lurking WSB since 2017 and posting since last year."

**Micron opened at 78.93, had a high of 83.86, a low of 78.93, closed at 83.03 (7.80% change), and 47.22M volume.**

[Covered in the first DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzkdma/mu_micron_technology_deepdive_adderallfueled_dd/) *Micron climbed a lot on Friday. This was due to an analyst at Evercore ISI adding the memory chip maker to his list of top stock picks. [He anticipates a return to earnings growth next year.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-stock-price-earnings-chip-shortage-51632864045?mod=article_inline).*

(
*‘“In his note, Muse wrote that while shares of chip makers like Micron have lagged behind the PHLX Semiconductor index, or SOX, since early June, the tide may be shifting.*

*“We believe negative sentiment was due to investor concerns over the sustainability of PC, handsets, and cloud demand, which was also compounded by DRAM spot pricing that began to flatten out in May/June 2021,” Muse wrote.’*

[Useful Nasdaq article explaining Friday’s hype ""Why Is Everyone Talking About Micron Stock?”](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-is-everyone-talking-about-micron-stock)

This is also due to the Citi upgrade (see Monday section).

**Why did MU pop on Monday:**

**Micron opened at 83.66, had a high of 87.67, a low of 83.66, closed at 83.86 (1.00% change) and 34.35M volume.**

MU popped again on Monday, with shares rising as much as 5.6%. Monday’s rise was due to a variety of reasons, outlined below.

**An important thing to note is that despite the market slide on Monday, Micron generally held its own and remained green.** The rest of my calls were obliterated, meanwhile the calls I bought pre-market and 5 minutes after open remained in profit. I did not sell these on the peak, I am still holding them. 


*Evercore ISI analyst upgrade from Friday:* 
Again due to the Evercore ISI price upgrade on Friday, MU saw strong momentum on Monday.

*Citi analyst upgrade from Friday:*
*“Citi analyst Christopher Danely said the pricing correction in the DRAM market was ""drawing to a close"" as the PC and server markets stabilized and expanded. As such, he expects Micron to benefit from ""more positive catalysts"" in the coming months and maintains a ""buy"" rating with a price target of $120 -- more than 40% above its current price.”*

*CNBC article released pre-market:*
[An article was released on Monday from CNBC, 7:00AM EST.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/22/micron-stock-has-best-day-in-18-months-traders-see-bigger-breakout.html)  This highlighted the two analyst upgrades, their targets, and the upside. Due to CNBC’s wide reach, this highlighted the stock to other investors and drove momentum. 

One bearish thing to note (not in the article), from CNBC ‘Trading Nation: “On CNBC’s ""Trading Nation,"" Michael Binger of Gradient Investments said semiconductor stocks that have gained sharply in the recent period are likely to pull back.”
However my opinion as of Wednesday is that this has happened to much of the semi-sector Monday/Tuesday, but MU has remained largely unaffected thus far.

*Micron’s LPDDR5X DRAM is going to be used in the MediaTek Dimensity 9000:*

**This is important news, I’m going to cover this later in my DD.** This was also announced pre-market. 
*[“Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) revealed that its low-power double data rate 5X (LPDDR5X) DRAM for MediaTek Inc.’s new Dimensity 9000 5G flagship chipset for smartphones has been validated.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/micron-lpddr5x-dram-to-feature-in-mediatek-dimensity-9000)*
 
*”Built on its 1α (1-alpha) node, the new chipset will help smartphones unlock applications powered by artificial intelligence and 5G innovation. Micron claims LPDDR5X to be the fastest and most advanced mobile memory available. It says that it has shipped the first batch of samples.”*
 
*“Meanwhile, Micron disclosed that it was joining hands with leading smartphone manufacturers and chipset vendors to enable ecosystem innovation with LPDDR5X.*
[*Micron outperformed the general market on Monday*](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/micron-technology-inc-stock-rises-monday-outperforms-market-01637619013)

[*Nasdaq recommended Micron as one of top 4 stock trades for Monday*](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-top-stock-trades-for-monday%3A-lcid-hood-mu-fl-2021-11-19)

[**Furthermore MU was the 3nd (2nd according to other scrapers) most discussed stock on Wallstreetbets Monday**](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/21/11/24215526/gamestop-top-discussed-stock-on-wallstreetbets-heading-into-new-week-micron-tesla-and-th)

**Why did MU pop again on Tuesday:**

**Micron opened at 85.04, had a high of 87.71, a low of 84.33, closed at 85.41 (1.85% change), and had a volume of 31.64M**

Micron again showed strong performance yesterday. Again, much of the semi sector was sliding/underperforming, yet Micron remained strong. 

The primary reason for this was that [Mizuho](https://www.mizuhogroup.com/) upgraded Micron back to a buy (one month after it was downgraded). 

[Link to Marketwatch article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/micron-upgraded-back-to-a-buy-at-mizuho-just-one-month-after-it-was-downgraded-11637672539?mod=mw_latestnews)

Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh again became bullish on Micron. He upgraded it to buy, after downgrading it to neutral on October 20th. He changed his price target to $95 from $75.

*“When Rakesh downgraded Micron last month, he cited expectations of a soft demand outlook for the first half of 2022 for PCs and notebooks, server and handset markets.*

*“However, our recent checks indicate the ‘ACTUAL’ demand is improving across all three markets,” Rakesh wrote in a research note, with first-quarter PC/NB builds “only” flat to down 5% from the previous quarter, compared with expectations of a 10% to 15% decline and handsets flat versus expectations of down 10%. He also believes server demand could improve.”*


[From Barrons:](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-mu-western-digital-wdc-stocks-analyst-buy-51637675537)
“New data indicated actual demand was improving across PCs, servers and handsets that “could support an improved pricing,” prompting [Rakesh to raise the stock to Buy](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-mu-western-digital-wdc-stocks-analyst-buy-51637675537) and boost his price targets. The new target for Micron is $95, up from $75”

*“Rakesh estimates that first-quarter PC and netbook builds will only decrease between 0% and 5% quarter over quarter, up from previous estimates that they would fall between 10% and 15%. PC demand alone could be up as much as 5% year over year, a shift Rakesh said was surprising given Wall Street consensus that demand would be down between 2% and 3%.”*

*”Requests for memory chips in China also could improve compared to previous estimates, as well as orders from server hosts like Amazon ( AMZN ) and Google (GOOGL). An additional boost could come from upcoming investments in the metaverse and virtual reality.”*

*”Micron may be a new darling among analysts. Last week, Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse added Micron to his list of top stock picks, anticipating a return to earnings growth next year.”*

[**Micron was once again one of the top discussed stocks on Wallstreetbets on Tuesday, being in the fourth position.**](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/21/11/24243247/gamestop-remains-top-wallstreetbets-interest-zoom-video-micron-technology-and-these-are-)

**Wednesday outlook:**

MU is currently declining pre-market. Opening at 85.59, with a high (so far) of $86, and a (current) low of 84.62, where it is at right now as I write this segment (13:22PM GMT/08:22 EST/07:23 CST). There is no negative news, so I expect this is due to the current slide of the semi-segment and general market slightly affecting MU (whereas the past two days it has almost-always remained green despite the current market). However it is only down 0.90%, we will see what happens at open. I will update this segment then. I will also include any news that comes out today.

Update: MU is still remaining strong. As of 10:25AM EST, it has so far peaked at 86.72, after opening at 84.65, the current low being 84.65 also. Volume so far is 6.81(M). Current price (10:27AM EST) is 86.15 representing a  0.85% change. 

*Wednesdays news/articles:*
12:36AM EST: [“Micron Rallies Against The Grain” (Investing.com)](https://www.investing.com/analysis/micron-rallies-against-the-grain-200609364)

Approx 8:40AM EST [:”Micron Technology Stock Is at the Middle of an Upswing, Not the End”](https://investorplace.com/2021/11/mu-stock-is-at-the-middle-of-an-upswing-not-the-end/)

An analysis of the MediaTek Dimensity 9000 news [(Micron LPDDR5X DRAM to Feature in MediaTek Dimensity 9000)](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/micron-lpddr5x-dram-to-feature-in-mediatek-dimensity-9000):

“[Micron is the first semiconductor company to sample and validate this fastest, most advanced mobile memory](https://www.mediatek.com/blog/mediatek-and-micron-validate-lpddr5x-for-dimensity-9000) in the industry and has shipped the first batch of samples of LPDDR5X built on its [first-to-market 1α (1-alpha) node.](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-delivers-industrys-first-1a-dram-technology)”

*‘“This 1α node achievement confirms Micron’s excellence in DRAM and is a direct result of Micron’s relentless commitment to cutting-edge design and technology,” said Scott DeBoer, executive vice president of technology and products at Micron. “With a 40% improvement in memory density over our previous 1z DRAM node, this advancement will create a solid foundation for future product and memory innovation.”’*

*‘“Our new 1α DRAM technology will enable the industry’s lowest-power mobile DRAM as well as bring the benefits of our DRAM portfolio to data center, client, consumer, industrial and automotive customers,” said Sumit Sadana, executive vice president and chief business officer at Micron. “With our industry leadership in both DRAM and NAND technology, Micron is in an excellent position to leverage the growth in memory and storage, which are expected to be the fastest growing segments in the semiconductor industry over the next decade.”’*

It is noteworthy that Samsung was the first to announce LPDDR5X DRAM, however Micron was the first to validate it’s LDPDDR5X module DRAM in partnership with MediaTek. **Micron has already shipped the first batch of this DRAM module.**  This is not surprising as Micron has been making GDDR5X and GDDR6X VRAM for Nvidia GPU’s for many years. 

Micron has also revealed that samples of this new memory module for smartphones supports data rates of up to 8.533 Gbps, making it 30% faster than LPDDR5 modules (it is worth noting these are the highest achievable figures for the standard, and not real world figures). 

**How is LPDDR5X RAM on the MediaTek Dimensity 9000 better than LPDDR5?**

[Relevant chart of the Micron LPDDR5X used by MediaTek](https://imgur.com/yKsnPyo)

This RAM is the newest standard in RAM technology for mobile devices. It aims to improve the data transfer on RAM chips used in mobile devices such as the DImensity 9000 (or other counterparts such as Samsung Exynos and Qualcomm Snapdragon). It is claimed that these Micron DRAM modules (produced with 1-alpha technology) consume the lowest power among mobile DRAMs.

[**When sampled**](https://www.digitaltrends.com/features/lpddr5x-ram-vs-lpddr5-dram-dimensity-9000/) Micron’s LPDDR5X solution achieved data transfer speeds of up to 7500Mbps, however this is behind the transfer rates supported by the new standard (8533Mbps). As Micron emphasized on the 8533 figure, my personal prediction is that it will soon bring out products achieving higher transfer speeds (or that it is maybe saving them for other manufacturers than MediaTek). LPDDR5 (highest rate) achieves 6400Mbps. 

*“Based on these results, MediaTek concluded that LPDDR5X modules lead to 17% faster transfer speeds and 15% lower latency compared to the previous generation.”*

*“MediaTek remarked the new RAM technology will allow increasingly higher levels of data processing, which are needed for the complex and heterogeneous processing units that are built into modern-day chipsets. These higher processing capabilities will be vital for the high-data requirements of the 5G era.”*

**The difference between Micron’s and Samsung’s LPDDR5X solutions can only be compared once the Snapdragon 888 benchmarks are released, or newer chips featuring the most recent RAM technology.**

*Availability of Micron’s new DRAM:*
*“Micron’s Taiwan fabs have begun volume production of 1α node DRAM, starting with DDR4 memory for compute customers and Crucial consumer PC DRAM products. Micron has also begun sampling LPDDR4 to mobile customers for qualification. The company will introduce additional new products based on this technology throughout calendar 2021.”*

**P/E Ratio:**

MU’s current P/E ratio (as of Wednesday 24th November pre-market) is 16.3x. The median P/E ratio for the US is 18x. I’m sourcing from the below linked article for this section. 

*[“Recent times have been advantageous for Micron Technology](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-piece-of-the-puzzle-missing-from-micron-technology-inc.s-nasdaq%3Amu-27-share-price-climb) as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to wane, which has kept the P/E from rising.”*

*“Micron Technology's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver moderate growth, and importantly, perform in line with the market.”*

Last year delivered a 117% gain to the company’s bottom line. The EPS has fallen 57% in total from three years ago. Therefore the recent earnings growth may have been undesirable for the company.

*“Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 35% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 11% each year growth forecast for the broader market.”*

Micron’s P/E is now in line with other companies. You can use P/E to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations. It’s superior earnings outlook is not contributing to P/E as much as expected. When strong earnings outlook is seen with faster-than-market growth, potential risks are what may be placing pressure on the P/E ratio. 

The risk of price drop looks to be subdued, but investors likely thing future earnings could see some volatility. 

**NAND Flash revenue growth for Q3 2021:**

[Recent relevant article released today, I will be sourcing from this for this section.](https://evertiq.com/design/51010)

Hyperscaler and enterprise clients are continuing procurement in line with Q2, this is in order to deploy products based on new processor platforms. 

Major smartphone brands are expected to expand their procurement activities during Q3, as they are preparing to release new flagship models. 

*“As such, clients in both server and smartphone industries made significant contributions to the revenue growth of the NAND Flash industry for 3Q21.”* 

However, suppliers note that orders from PC OEM’s are showing signs of decline. 

“‘On the whole, the industry’s quarterly total NAND Flash bit shipment increased by nearly 11% QoQ for 3Q21, and the overall NAND Flash ASP rose by nearly 4% QoQ for the same quarter. Thanks to rising prices and expanding shipments, the quarterly total NAND Flash revenue increased by 15% QoQ to a new record high of USD 18.8 billion in 3Q21.”*

*“Demand from the data center segment remained strong, and clients continued to adopt Micron’s 176L products. However, Micron’s shipment share in the smartphone market lagged behind that of other NAND Flash suppliers. Furthermore, its PC OEM clients were starting to be affected by the uneven supply of semiconductor chips. In light of these factors, Micron’s NAND Flash bit shipment increased by a modest 4% QoQ. On the other hand, the NAND Flash market remained in a severe shortage in 3Q21, thereby driving up Micron’s ASP by about 5% QoQ. Hence, Micron’s NAND Flash revenue for 3Q21 reached USD 1.97 billion, an 8.8% QoQ increase.”*

[*Sales ranking of Branded NAND Flash makers, Q3 2021 (in million USD)*](https://imgur.com/sbJyTmY)

**NAND Flash revenue growth for Q4 2021:**

The impact of the component supply shortage has increased across numerous segments of the NAND flash market, as the capacity issues in the foundry market remains unresolved. 
Currently, NAND Flash components are in higher available supply compared to other kinds of key components. 

*“For OEMs and ODMs, the differences between the NAND Flash inventory level and the inventory levels of other components have been growing over the past several months. Therefore, they have to scale back orders and reduce stock for NAND Flash. As inventory adjustments are happening, NAND Flash contract prices will start to drop and thus bring about an end to the several quarters of strong revenue growth enjoyed by suppliers.”*

I would note that this is actually possibly negative news for MU, but will only affect Q4 and perhaps after that. NAND is only a segment of Micron’s business though. 

**Micron’s CEO, an analysis of his performance**

[“Memory chip demand has been exploding since Sanjay Mehrotra was recruited as Micron CEO in 2017.”](https://investorplace.com/2021/11/mu-stock-is-at-the-middle-of-an-upswing-not-the-end/)

Mehrotra previously founded SanDisk. He became available after Western Digital acquired SanDisk in 2016.

[After Mehrotra joined Micron as CEO, strong performance was seen in 2017 and 2018.](https://investorplace.com/2018/05/micron-technology-inc-booming-despite-low-stock-price/). Micron’s sales rose from $12 billion in 2016 to $20 billion in 2017 (fueled by data centres and smartphones). In 2017/2018, Mehrota astutely aimed production at solid state drives and graphics. One reason for this was to target the cloud boom, and their upgrade cycle to meet demands for AI applications (making memory important, and thereby putting Micron in a good position). He also aimed to balance between supply and demand that year, rather than the bear market that was indicated by current stock price. In 2017/2018, while expanding investment, Micron built up a cash reserve. It has $8 billion in cash (as of May 2018), and short term investments as of the most recent quarter at that time. Long term debt fell to $7.8 billion nd could be paid out of cash on hand. It’s price to earnings ratio was 10 (as of May 2018), which would mean a 25% bump in stock price. 

*In March 2020* [Micron surprised ‘analysts by earning $405 million, 36 cents per share, on revenue of $4.8 billion for the quarter ending in February.’](https://investorplace.com/2020/03/micron-mu-stock-offers-hope-in-turbulent-market/) Certainly strong performance despite being at the start of the pandemic.

*”The results sent MU stock up over 5% on March 26, although shares are down over 3% in mid-morning trading March 27.”*

“Shares rose sharply thanks to a [conservative outlook from CEO Sanjay Mehrotra](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/micron-earnings-conservative-outlook-seen-as-prudent-but-rest-of-year-remains-a-big-question-2020-03-23), who has seen many booms and busts in his 30 years as a memory company executive.”

*“Last week, Micron Chief Executive Sanjay Mehrotra said in a letter that the company took early precautions in January to limit the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in its facilities in China and the rest of Asia and expanded those protections as the virus spread world-wide.”*

*“We have also carefully managed raw materials and our supply chain to maintain our manufacturing capabilities and production,” Mehrotra said. “Our global team has shown tremendous strength and solidarity, operating with excellence despite lockdowns and quarantines that challenged staffing, shipments and work schedules.”*

Because memory chips are commodity products, MU stock is prone to sharp rises and falls. Until recently (as of March 2020) it was said to be riding a “supercycle,” with chip-based memory replacing spinning disks in devices, PCs and the cloud.’

*Analysis as of today 24th of November 2021:*
Memory has been going through a ‘super-cycle’ for years now, this is due to SSD’s/flash memory replacing standard HDD’s in consumer devices and more recently in data centres. SSD’s/flash memory are faster and more reliable. As the price has been coming down for SSD’s/flash memory, the switch to these has accelerated. 

Analysts may warn that this ‘super-cycle’ is peaking, however it is just [cooling down](https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202107140009). And as outlined in my previous DD, in 2023, 2024 and the future. We can actually expect memory demand to exponentially increase. 

[Chart showing price projections of various DRAM product categories for Q3](https://imgur.com/bPkMum5)

The current supercycle is expected to run [until 2023 (“The super cycle in global memory chips, where price strengthening is coupled with demand overwhelming supply, is expected to last until 2023”)](https://m.pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2021&no=489942), and could go well beyond that with new demand from [the Machine Internet](https://cplaneai.com/the-machine-internet-age/). As well as cloud-computing. 

Mehrotra sees it continuing. As outlined in my previous DD, he has set a capital budget of [$150 billion for the next decade.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/micron-plans-over-150-billion-in-capital-r-d-spending-in-decade-ahead-11634724001). Please see my last DD or the link for more info on this budget.

**TL;DR:**

* Fridays performance was strong due to Evercore ISI Analyst upgrades, as well as a Citi upgrade.

* Mondays performance was due to the Evercore ISI and Citi analyst upgrades, as well as other factors including; CNBC article, LPDDR5X DRAM announcement, and other articles released/general hype. It was one of the top discussed stocks on WSB.

* Tuesdays performance was due to Mizuho analyst upgrade. It was also one of the top discussed stocks on WSB.

* Micron’s LPDDR5X solution achieved data transfer speeds of up to 7500Mbps, however this is behind the transfer rates supported by the new standard (8533Mbps). As Micron emphasized on the 8533 figure, my personal prediction is that it will soon bring out products achieving higher transfer speed.

Please see my last DD or the link for more info on this budget. 

**TL;DR of the TL;DR:**
Analyst upgrades, hype and new RAM technology have contributed to the price rise this week. NAND flash shipments are rising Q3. There is a supply shortage across the market. The memory supercycle is expected to continue until 2023 and perhaps beyond. The CEO of Micron is delivering high performance, expects this to continue and has set a capital budget of $150 billion for the next decade."

r1472s,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r1472s/blackberry_is_more_than_a_meme_and_heres_why/,Blackberry is more than a meme and here’s why,503,129,2021-11-24 20:33:07,"As most of you retards know by now, Blackberry is no longer the phone company that it first was. They are predominantly focusing on cybersecurity and have a huge proportion of the EV manufacturers using their systems (23 of the top 25 electric vehicle automakers to be precise). The system I’m referring to is called QNX and it’s pretty impressive. I won’t bore you and write up about it so if you want to find out more, go onto BlackBerrys website/google it for yourself.

Now, I’m on WSB for a reason, I’m partially retarded so I’ll keep this as short and sweet for the sake of everyone including myself. 

The global electric vehicle market was valued at $162.34 billion in 2019, and is projected to reach $802.81 billion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 22.6%. Blackberry already have an advantage in the EV space and they continue to build on this every year. The opportunity for growth is significant in my opinion. 

SE Labs has rated BlackBerry as the best new endpoint security offering of 2021. (This was only announced yesterday).

Here’s a bit about SE Labs for those of you that don’t know…

“SE Labs prides itself on providing the most realistic and honest cybersecurity testing. The organization hires innovative researchers to replicate the most accurate ‘real world’ testing scenarios possible. As workplaces open and hybrid work brings with it a range of new attack vectors, it’s even more critical that security software be tested against these evolving threats.”

And here’s what the CEO of SE Labs, Simon Edwards, had to say about Blackberry…

“2021 has been the first year we have tested this product with BlackBerry publicly. When judging for our annual awards it is hard to ignore when a new, significant vendor enters our tests and performs so well from the start”. 

“Blackberry has demonstrated excellent performance in our ‘real-world’ testing, and the product is well regarded by both our expert panel of judges and users of the product.”

Take this as you please, I’m no financial advisor but for those of you constantly writing off Blackberry and saying it’s a hype stock, I think you need to re evaluate and realise why people are genuinely excited about this stock. 

Both short term and long term potential in this stock IMO.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading you beautiful bitch.

While this makes a lot of sense (calculated risk mitigation & informed forecast), it's quite difficult (at least for me) to pin-down what exactly they spend that time on.

1000hours or 6 months etc. is a lot of time, which can potentially reveal a lot of more or less useful stuff about a company... so the question is what's the ""optimal"" breakdown of that time?

I mean... I understand it'd be useful to come to the point in which you can predict the CEO's bowel movements to the second within a margin of error of 0.001%... but I don't see how spending however much time that information took to work out being beneficial. ... so there should be a "" ok... 300 hours working out this particular ""lead"" is enough.

I have waited this kind of chance for a while, and decided to go long on turkey. So today I went to my local mall and bought 100 (one hundred) full turkeys. They are all about 5-6 kilogram best in quality, homegrown, and fucking beautiful turkeys . These bad boys are loaded in my brand new, best in class freezers which i picked up on my way home. Cant wait to tell wife! 

I think this is brilliant bet, even if i say it my self. Turkey keep crashing (down -11% today or somthg idk) and i am going to make a fortune. Turkey-to-usd keeps going down and then when the time is right i will sell my turkeys for bigger price. Easy money i would say. 
Going to hold these mf birds with my diamond hands🙌! 

But, there is a one thing that i didn’t think about. Turkey expiration day. How long does turkey last on freezer before it goes bad?  Google says that ”Turkeys can be kept in the freezer indefinitely. However, cook turkeys within 1 year for the best quality.” Does this affect my investiment?

I am not a finance advisor. 
YOLO positions: 100 turkeys in freezer (long)


Btw who tf is Lira?"

Quantum computing in the near future will usher in huge advances in technology and perhaps transform how we go about our daily lives for the better. The unfortunate part of our quantum future is that when quantum computing arrives, current encryption methods keeping all of our information safe, will fail. This is not a question of if, it is of when. The Global Risk Institute released a report titled ""Quantum Threat Timeline"" in 2019 which polled 22 leading data scientists on the forecasted timetable for a quantum computer to break current encryption standards. The consensus at the time was around 15 years, or 2034. Since that report was released, the quantum computing market has experienced a massive surge of investment with incredibly fast progress reported from companies around the globe, several, such as Google (GOOGL) (GOOG), IBM (IBM), Rigetti Computing and Honeywell (HON) already have broken past 100 qubits, with a rapid doubling of capability shown.

 

For reference, a recent article from Cornell University shows that PKI encryption (the current industry standard) may require as little as 2,000 logical qubits to break, making the timeline for current encryptions' obsolescence disturbingly close, likely in the 2025-2030 time frame, with governments such as the USA, UK, China and Russia likely well ahead of that date. A troubling trend noted recently by nation-state actors is to ""harvest now, decrypt later"" which is the term for stealing encrypted data from hardened sources today and then store the data to decrypt when the technology is available.

 

It has even been theorized that the entire chain that digital assets depend on may be at risk of total hijack or collapse once quantum computers reach maturity. This trend makes it critically important for nations to migrate away from PKI encryption as soon as possible to symmetric encryption keys. The biggest problem currently with symmetric key encryption is that you need to have a way to get the key to the other party with whom you are sharing the data. Arqit believes that it has a solution for this critical problem that is completely computationally secure, which means it cannot be broken by any current or future machine, along with a delivery system that cannot be intercepted via the quantum cloud. The key to this entire technology's eventual adoption is that the algorithm used is already the global standard (AES), meaning that it is operable with current systems, giving users no logical reason to not adopt the technology.

 

The technology Arqit invented is covered by over 1,400 patent claims making this company and its technology potentially protected from copycats looking to set up similar business models for some time to come. The commercial strategy also appears to be very well thought out, with the software downloaded by customers and used automatically. Billing events are created by usage via commercial customers with key creation events being metered. The brilliance of this strategy is the incredibly low capex Arqit has to expend once the core infrastructure is in place, as the software needed is basically zero touch.

 

With current systems operating on a compatible format, ultimately every connected device is a potential customer of Arqit without the need of the company building any further infrastructure as the 2 planned and paid for satellites used are able to generate two quadrillion unique keys per year. To get an idea of the explosive potential of this company, please keep in mind that the below pipeline and business development was accomplished all in 2021, with only 2 dedicated salespeople, one being the CEO himself.To land executed, recurring and framework contracts with the likes of the British Government, British Telecom (OTCPK:BTGOF), Sumitomo Corporation (OTCPK:SSUMF) ESA and Dentons in addition to an ""unnamed"" major payment network, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Iridium (IRDM), Verizon (VZ) and BP (BP) accomplished pre hard rollout is unbelievably impressive and gives credibility to the massive potential ahead for the company.

 

During recent analyst conferences before the de-SPAC event, the CEO has reported massively increased interest in the product well before any ramp up in sales and marketing efforts by the company. Generally I do not like to discuss financial projections generated from the SPAC process as many companies simply throw hopes and dreams into a blender to come up with these. However, given the solid and proven pipeline of customers Arqit has signed already and the fact that the service is already live give me enough confidence to share the company's 2025 projections.With Arqit, I really have to control my enthusiasm a bit, not only does the company appear to have a scalable solution to a massive problem affecting nearly every sector around the globe, but the company also has a way of doing it that is low capex and very high margin.

 

In addition, the company having expended basically zero sales effort to date, has secured $130 million in guaranteed revenues from A list customers with a high probability of closing a $1.1 billion backlog pipeline already. The CEO indicated in the recent investor day that in his 30 years of sales experience, he has never had any product like Arqit's and that his closing percentage is nearly 100%. If Arqit even comes close to the financial projections they have presented, which the CEO notes is a very conservative projection, then the company could be worth many multiples of the current $2.1

 

billion market cap. It also would appear, counter to many of the recent SPAC IPOs, that dilution should not be an issue going forward. In the SPAC transaction, the company has received $376 million in cash to the balance sheet, to which the CEO recently commented that the deal brought it ""twice the money that we need to fully fund our business"" and that ""We don't need to raise any more money, ever,"" he told CNBC. In late August I purchased a moderately sized speculative position in the SPAC. My only hesitancy in purchasing more is that generally, when a company seems to have a no-brainer, hugely profitable solution to a massive problem, red flags tend to appear.

 

So far, I have not found any true red flags with Arqit, but as I am not a cybersecurity expert, I will be keeping my position moderately sized until at least a few quarters have run off and I gain a greater comfortability with the progress of the technology and management. I am very excited to see how this company develops as it would appear they may have solved a truly massive problem that nearly all NATO countries have been losing sleep over for years, before it actually existed. If they are successful in the product roll out, shareholders are likely to be rewarded handsomely. I look forward to your comments and views of the company, thank you for reading and good luck!

So I’ve taken my daily Adderall, caffeine, and nicotine; I’m in a DD mood. I was requested by a few users to write an $MU (Micron Technology) DD. 

**Company profile:**

*“The world is moving to a new economic model, where data is driving value creation in ways we had not imagined just a few years ago. Data is today’s new business currency, and memory and storage are strategic differentiators which will redefine how we extract value from data to expand the global economy and transform our society.*

*As the leader in innovative memory solutions, Micron is helping the world make sense of data by delivering technology that is transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all. Through our global brands — Micron and Crucial — we offer the industry’s broadest portfolio. We are the only company manufacturing today’s major memory and storage technologies: DRAM, NAND, and NOR technology.*

*By providing foundational capability for innovations like AI and 5G across data center, the intelligent edge, and consumer devices, we unlock innovation across industries including healthcare, automotive and communications. Our technology and expertise are central to maximizing value from cutting-edge computing applications and new business models which disrupt and advance the industry.*

*From our roots in Boise, Idaho, Micron has grown into an influential global presence committed to being the best memory company in the world. This means conducting business with integrity, accountability, and professionalism and supporting our global community.”*
(https://www.micron.com/about/our-company/corporate-profile)

**Introduction:**

[MU 1D chart](https://imgur.com/ZVG0IKv)

**Don't sell MU now, it outperformed most of it's peers**
*”MICRON TECHNOLOGY INC was among the best performers on Friday. It returned +7.8% to close at 83.03. On a day when the overall market breadth was 44%, it closed higher than 68% of the market. In comparison, the benchmark SP500 index closed today at -0.0014%.”*

**This is going to be a DD focused on the value of the products (Micron and Crucial memory, data center presence, and consumer use), as well as the value of the company. MU is definitely a long term play, though there is a lot of short term interest at the moment that may cause a run.**

**It is worth noting that MU is a cyclical stock, dependant upon memory demand, hence why I have focused on future memory demand in my DD.**

Latest news: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/22/micron-stock-has-best-day-in-18-months-traders-see-bigger-breakout.html

Micron climbed a lot on Friday. This was due to an analyst at Evercore ISI adding the memory chip maker to his list of top stock picks. [He anticipates a return to earnings growth next year.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-stock-price-earnings-chip-shortage-51632864045?mod=article_inline).

MU was up 8.4% to $83.52 during Friday afternoon trading. It was the second best performer of the day for the S&P 500 (shortly before 3PM). Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse noted that though shares of memory chip makers such as Micron have lagged behind the [PHLX Semiconductor index since early June](https://www.barrons.com/quote/index/us/xnas/sox?mod=article_inline), he believes tides are shifting.

*“We believe negative sentiment was due to investor concerns over the sustainability of PC, handsets, and cloud demand, which was also compounded by DRAM spot pricing that began to flatten out in May/June 2021,” wrote Muse.*

Muse noted that WSt expectations for Micron’s Feb/May quarter earnings have been cut by 33%/31% respectively, since August. While there could be further downside, weakness is now priced in. He believes either Feb or May quarter will be a bottom for Micron’s earnings. Micron shares tend to outperform one or two quarters before a bottom in earnings, hence he believes the stock could begin a run soon.

*“And once they do—we think the stock action could be fast,” Muse wrote. “We also note most investors expected the memory trade to begin to work in 1Q22 based on our investor survey last month and would not be surprised to start seeing investors look to get positioned in the name ahead of January 1st, 2022.”*
*Other reasons for the climb:*
* Citi analyst Christopher Danely said in a research note that recent channel checks show there has been increased demand for DRAM memory among PC makers, and that a pricing correction in the DRAM market is “drawing to a close”.
* Danely also said the outlook for enterprise server sales in Q1 22 is better than expected. The server market is improving “due to recent increases in spending from cloud companies such as Meta and Google”. Danely maintained his buy rating and a $120/share price target.
* Earlier this week hedge fund Appaloosa Management said it recently sold off almost 3 million shares of MU, to leave the fund with 2.75 million shares.

**Higher future DRAM demand and how this affects Micron:**

Micron is a market leader in DRAM and NAND memory, with a market share of 20%/11% respectively. In 2021, DRAM revenues accounted for 72% of MU’s total revenues, and grew by 38% YoY.  [The company is improving its 1-alpha DRAM](https://www.micron.com/1alpha-dram-technology) to compete with Samsung/SK Hynix.
The DRAM market is expected to grow over the long term, due to rising DRAM use in smartphones, PC’s, consumer electronics, automotive and industrials. 

*Smartphones:* 
[Since 2016 the average DRAM capacity has risen from 2.4GB to 4.75GB (average of iOS and Android).](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/smartphones-dram-trends-2019-2020/) Micron has stated that 5G phones feature 50% more DRAM than 4G phones. It also expects that 5G and AI will drive new applications such as optimised video capture and editing, which will further fuel DRAM requirements. Phones are very much powerful PC’s living in our pockets now, and as software advances we can expect that DRAM requirements will increase. For example, think about how old iPhones struggle to run new versions of iOS, partially due to insufficient DRAM in older models.

[""Micron LPDDR5X DRAM to Feature in MediaTek Dimensity 9000""](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/micron-lpddr5x-dram-to-feature-in-mediatek-dimensity-9000)

*Data Center:*
DRAM is integral in servers, notably in data centre applications, it is rapidly evolving to support growing workloads for AI, big data and machine learning. Micron is working on DDR5 to support data center transitions to DDR5 platforms this year.
Data creation is projected to grow at a rate of around 23% in the next 5 years. This would require larger cloud infrastructure in order to handle this. Data centres are generally backed up by an SSD storage array, Micron remains committed to this through it’s NVMe SSD portfolio, and is introducing PCIe 4.0 data centre SSDs. As demand for cloud storage rises, Micron could see increased demand for these products. 

*PC/Gaming:*
Faster RAM leads to faster processing speeds. Intensive use of PCs such as gaming, video editing and streaming require better and more efficient RAM.
From Statista, the chart below shows increasing PC DRAM memory density, with the share of memory >[4GB increasing to 82% in 2020](https://imgur.com/w9w0xPq) 
(https://www.statista.com/statistics/781438/worldwide-computer-dram-shipment-market-share-by-density/)

*Automotive DRAM:*
Automotive DRAM only accounts for 1.8% of the DRAM market currently. However, advances in automotive tech such as autonomous driving and vehicle connectivity will drive an increase in this. The Tesla Model 3 has 14GB of DRAM, and next-generation models will use GDDR5 and are expected to have a minimum of 20GB. Although, the average vehicle is estimated to have only 4GB of DRAM in 2021. I expect newer/next-gen vehicles will continue to use even more computing power/DRAM, therefore increasing the market share of Automotive DRAM. Note that Micron are specialists in GDDR5 and 6 memory. Auto NAND accounts for 7% of the NAND market, [it is also expected to see rapid growth due to the rise of ADAS](https://www.eetasia.com/another-nand-flash-for-automotive-ota-ai-and-more/) and clusters of vehicle instruments added to infotainment (requiring greater storage capabilities).

*Industrials & Consumer Electronics:*
DRAM is used in systems/equipment in manufacturing processes. Industrial type DRAM is more focused on providing a stable solution for reliability. Automation and IoT (Internet of Things) is likely to increase demand for memory/increased memory. In consumer electronics, DRAM is used in tablets, wearables, games consoles, etc. This is the least significant growth factor but still important to note. 
Another important note is that the PS5 and Xbox use Micron GDDR6 RAM. Samsung and Micron both started producing GDDR6 RAM 3 years ago, while SK Hynix is still ramping up production. The PS5 actually uses Micron RAM (16GB GDDR6 SDRAM), while 512MB of SK Hynix DDR4 RAM is used for background tasks. THe Xbox Series X also uses 16GB of Micron GDDR6 SGRAM. 

**My Nvidia thesis:**

**I worked as a qualified IT Hardware, Networking and Software Engineer for 5 or 6 years, and am now an Engineering student at college. I’m a computer geek, especially for hardware. So I’m going to enjoy writing this part. I hope my knowledge lends to it.**


Although you won’t find much correlation in the [charts](https://imgur.com/o3EaSAV), apart from the recent semi-boom. Nvidia and Micron are very strongly linked. 


*Increasing penetration of GPU’s in data centres*


Recently, data centres have developed into the fields of AI and Machine Learning for functions where a solution is required via rapid iterations. This works well with GPU’s. GPU’s lend themselves perfectly towards [Machine Learning (ML-OLD) functions in data centres](https://www.eetimes.com/ai-chip-menu-expands-for-data-centers/).

Now remember that GPU’s are highly memory intensive. 
This is corroborated from the data specs of Nvidia’s newest chip, the A100 GPU just released, [designed for AI in data centers](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258419/nvidia-ampere-gpu-ai-data-centers-specs-a100-dgx-supercomputer).
[You can also read more here.](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/ampere-architecture/)

“The first GPU to use Ampere will be Nvidia’s new (as of 2020) A100, built for scientific computing, cloud graphics, and data analytics. Nvidia new A100 GPU will also include 19.5 teraflops of performance, 6,912 CUDA cores, *40GB of memory*, and *1.6TB/s of memory bandwidth.”* *There’s also a version using 80GB!*

“*Smarter and Faster Memory*
A100 brings massive amounts of compute to data centers. To keep those compute engines fully utilized, it has a class-leading 2 terabytes per second (TB/sec) of memory bandwidth, more than double the previous generation. In addition, A100 has significantly more on-chip memory, including a 40 megabyte (MB) level 2 cache—7X larger than the previous generation—to maximize compute performance.*”

I cannot find any sources (after half an hour of searching) that specify the exact manufacturer of the A100’s memory. However based on my experience, Nvidia consumer GPU’s use either Micron, Samsung or SK Hynix memory. Micron *does* manufacture the [HBM2E memory used in the A100](https://www.micron.com/products/ultra-bandwidth-solutions/hbm2e#:~:text=HBM2E%20%7C%20Micron%20Technologies%2C%20Inc), hence I suspect Micron is one of their memory vendors for their data centre GPU’s. 

I found that the Nvidia DGXA100 system (the world’s first AI system built on the A100 Tensor Core GPU, using 8 A100 GPU’s with up to 640GB of GPU memory), actually happens to use [Micron NVME drives](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/pdf/dgxa100-service-manual.pdf). See below:

*GDDR6X and GDDR5X memory in Nvidia high-end graphic cards:*
The GTX1080, 1080Ti, and Pascal Nvidia TitanX all used GDDR5X memory.
The RTX 3080 and 3090 GPUs use GDDR6X memory.
Who is the world's only manufacturer of GDDR5X and GDDR6X memory? Micron. 
*“Micron has created the world’s fastest discrete graphics memory solution, GDDR6X. GDDR6X was launched with NVIDIA on the GeForce® RTX™ 3090 and GeForce® RTX™ 3080 GPUs (including Ti) to take graphics beyond gaming into true AI. Watch to learn how Micron was able to achieve incredible speeds up to 1 TB/s system memory bandwidth.“*

[Read more here.](https://www.micron.com/products/ultra-bandwidth-solutions/gddr6x)

[Comparison between GDDR5X, GDDR6 and GDDR6X](https://imgur.com/fl8FY68)

This means Nvidia is dependant on Micron to deliver/manufacture their higher end GPU’s (as Micron are the only manufacturer of GDDR6X memory). Furthermore, Micron GDDR6 memory is commonly found in RTX3050, 3060, 3070 (including Ti) GPU’s. They are not the only manufacturer for this, but are frequently used, for example my RTX 3060 laptop has Micron memory, and my RTX 2070 Super has Micron memory. I use them for crapto mining, and the memory overclocks well. 

**Overall I would conclude as long as Nvidia remains strong/bullish, you can be bullish on Micron as Nvidia are dependent on them for their products, particularly in the high-end.**


**The AMD link:**

Although not as dependent on Micron as Nvidia. AMD [are using Micron GDDR6 memory in their RX6000 series graphics cards:](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-delivers-high-performance-gddr6-memory-amd-radeon-rx-6000)

“Micron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU), today (November 1st) announced that its high-performance 16Gb/16Gbps GDDR6 memory solution is now available with AMD Radeon™ RX 6000 Series graphics cards built on the AMD RDNA™ 2 gaming architecture. Using Micron’s advanced 1z process technology, this latest version of GDDR6 enables up to 512GB/s system performance for demanding applications like gaming and graphics. Today’s announcement continues Micron’s rich history of innovation and collaboration with industry leaders to deliver breakthrough performance that enables the most advanced gaming solutions.

“Radeon RX 6000 Series graphics cards were built to deliver high-performance, no-compromises gaming experiences, and the addition of Micron memory to the product line will help us meet that objective,” said Scott Herkelman, corporate vice president and general manager of the Graphics Business Unit at AMD. “Micron has a strong history of developing advanced memory products, and we worked closely with their engineering team to optimize GDDR6 for RDNA 2 architecture-based graphics cards, giving our board partners more choice and flexibility to produce additional designs for gamers.”

**Is Micron a buy right now?:**

For the past half year, Micron shares have been trending downwards, however this has changed in November. The shares trended downwards due to a difficult pricing environment for its PC memory products, and macro developments have had their part to play in the downtrend (‘mostly the supply chain issues behind a lack of non-memory components which has led to some customers cutting back on memory and storage purchases’).

Micron has recently stated that over the next 10 years, it intends on spending $150 billion (combined) on Global Manufacturing and R&D. Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill believes this plan has brought questions of “potential over-capacity issues and whether a plan like this would be a large drag on free cash flow.”

Micron believes that “secular growth drivers” such as 5G and AI use cases should see increasing demand for DRAM and NAND. **I covered this in the ‘Higher future DRAM demand and how this affects Micron’ section of my DD. Thus I think Micron is justified in this belief and spending plan.** Gill thinks it’s a good move, and worries are overblown.

*‘“The current spending plan,” said the 5-star analyst, “When annualized and put into context, is nothing out of the ordinary and should neither cause significant increases in industry capacity (so there should be no resulting price wars from the competition) nor be a significant drag on free cash flow, which would continue to grow and reach historical highs as a % of sales.”’*

Gill agrees with Micron, in that continued demand for DRAM and NAND based on 5G/AI drivers is important to focus on.

“In fact, Gill thinks the company will have enough free cash flow to provide it with a “high level of capital return flexibility,” which during cyclical sell-off periods, for example, could see the company repurchase shares. Additionally, should the need arise for “competitive reasons,” it will also provide a “safety buffer” for more R&D or CapEx spending.”

Gill reiterated a Buy rating for MU stock with a $130 price target. 14 other analysts join Gil on the bull list, with another 6 holds and 1 sell, the stock has a moderate buy consensus rating (as of Oct 27 2021, I’ll add more recent figures in the following section). 

[“The 47 rating InvestorsObserver gives to Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) stock puts it near the middle of the Semiconductors industry. In addition to scoring higher than 38 percent of stocks in the Semiconductors industry, MU’s 47 overall rating means the stock scores better than 47 percent of all stocks.”](https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/stock-update/does-micron-technology-inc-mu-have-what-it-takes-to-be-in-your-portfolio-friday)

**Has Micron Run Its Cyclical Course?:**

I will be heavily sourcing from [this great and recent Nasdaq article](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/has-micron-run-its-cyclical-course) for this section.

‘On the face of it, year-to-date, Micron’s stock price is almost at the same level. However, its stock has been on a 2021 roller-coaster ride. It opened 2021 at $77.42, and hit $95.3 in the first week of April. Since then, the stock steadily fell until it hit $67-levels in October. It spent time consolidating in October before starting to rise again.’

This fall is due to Micron’s cyclical nature of business. The stock moves based on the demand/supply for memory. ‘When the world needed semiconductors, the stock moved up. Now, as the world is slowly opening up, there was a fall in its stock price. However, Micron stock seems to have bottomed out.’

The company has beaten earnings expectations in the last four quarters (each of), the company has delivered profits and has not disappointed investors. 

‘Micron Technology president and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said that the demand outlook for 2022 was strong, and Micron would continue to deliver innovative solutions. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the company’s guidance is $7.65 billion in revenue, with a gross margin of 46%.’

A June report by Global Market Insights states that semiconductor memory market revenue will cross $180 billion by 2027. It said, “The growing uptake of Dynamic Random-access Memory (DRAM) in gaming consoles, PC hardware, and high-performance computing devices will support the industry growth.”

Micron has stated that memory and storage are a growing portion of this industry, representing approximately 30% of the semi market. The company also stated that government support would be crucial for its expansion plans, as memory manufacturing in the US costs around 35%-45% more compared to lower cost markets. ‘Funding to support new semiconductor manufacturing capacity is a must, said EVP of Global Operations Manish Bhatia. He added, “Sustained government support is essential for Micron to ensure a resilient supply chain and reinforce technology leadership for the long term.”’

‘The top three companies in the sector invest billions of dollars every year to manufacture chips. These chips are increasingly getting more complicated and expensive with every passing generation. It is very unlikely that price wars will break out over market share. The game will be played on quality.’ **Refer to my section about GDDR6X memory, Micron is delivering TOP quality.**

Investors (regards) will have to accept that the company stock price is generally going to be volatile, due to its cyclical nature. However you can take comfort in the fact that the lows/highs for the stock will generally move up. ‘The company has realized this and has purchased 15.6 million shares of its common stock for $1.2 billion during the fiscal year of 2021.’
[Here is a useful article explaining the volatility of MU this past month.](https://investchronicle.com/2021/11/16/here-is-why-micron-technology-inc-mu-stock-volatility-recorded-over-the-last-month-was-2-30/)

‘Tipranks’ Stock Forecast Tool indicates 15 out of 22 analysts have given MU a Buy rating, while six analysts have a Hold rating on the stock and just one has a Sell rating on the stock.

The average Micron price target is $96.09, which indicates 24.2% upside potential.’
‘A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Barclays decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $110.00 to $87.00 and set an ""overweight"" rating for the company in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. JPMorgan Chase & Co. decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $140.00 to $100.00 and set an ""overweight"" rating for the company in a report on Friday, September 24th. UBS Group decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $95.00 to $90.00 and set a ""buy"" rating for the company in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. Morgan Stanley restated a ""hold"" rating and set a $75.00 target price on shares of Micron Technology in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. Finally, The Goldman Sachs Group decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $104.00 to $88.00 and set a ""buy"" rating for the company in a report on Thursday, October 14th. One equities research analyst has rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have assigned a hold rating, twenty-three have assigned a buy rating and two have assigned a strong buy rating to the company's stock. Based on data from MarketBeat.com, the stock has an average rating of ""Buy"" and an average target price of $103.31.’

**Upcoming Quarterly Sales/Next Earnings:**

[Analysts expect that Micron will report $7.66 billion in sales for the current quarter](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-mu-consensus-analyst-rating-2021-11-2-3/), according to Zacks Investment Research. The highest sales estimate of 6 is $7.67 billion, and the lowest is $7.65 billion. Micron posted sales of $5.77 billion during the same quarter last year, indicating YoY growth of 32.8%. Next earnings date is Monday, December 20th. 
On average, analysts expect full-year sales of $31.34 billion (for the current financial year). For the next fiscal year, analysts forecast reported sales of $35.60 billion on average. 
Micron last issued its earnings results on Monday, September 27th. “ The semiconductor manufacturer reported $2.42 earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, topping the Thomson Reuters' consensus estimate of $2.33 by $0.09. The business had revenue of $8.27 billion during the quarter, compared to analyst estimates of $8.21 billion. Micron Technology had a return on equity of 15.98% and a net margin of 21.16%. Micron Technology's revenue for the quarter was up 36.6% on a year-over-year basis. During the same quarter in the prior year, the firm earned $1.00 earnings per share.”

“very nice rally after a downtrend breakout here on MU ! today we are approaching a big resistance zones on the RSI and chart.

We can break resistance and continue a rally to all time high next week, but I think we will most likely see a few more weeks of consolidation first so the RSI can cool off.
“

**[MU Long setup](https://imgur.com/ShnyQn8) - Nov 18:**
“MU after correction, going for final push for W-1 of W-5”

**[MU TRADE IDEA](https://imgur.com/z3mjHUK) - Nov 16:**
“Upside looks limited from here. Expecting us to pullback into a corrective wave 2 into a very buyable dip around $70. Be patient on this one, it's only getting started” My gut says this guy is incorrect tbh, given the recent push. 


**[After 200 days we can see a breakout](https://imgur.com/Vmhx9Al) - Nov 12, very in-depth:**
“Today we will take a look at Micron Technology , a company that engages in the provision of innovative memory and storage solutions. Time to check the Technical elements on the chart:

1) From 2018 until November 2020 the price was inside a massive range until we saw the breakout of it and a 50% bullish movement from that situation towards the top of the bullish impulse

2) From April until today the price has been consolidating on a clear corrective pattern where we can define both top and bottom edges

3) How can we know that the structure is finished? Two reasons here: first we have clear edges (previous item) and second the structure has made contact with a key level, in this case, the ascending trendline.

4) Now we have a breakout of the corrective pattern. Remember that Technical Analysis is a statistical discipline, which means that we are never gonna have certainty about a situation. However, we know that if we engage in quality situations over certain periods, we will be able to observe consistent results.

5) We are not taking setup on this stock, (we already have exposure on other assets). However, it's an interesting situation to wait for a throwback (retest of a broken structure). IF that happens, we have defined an activation level as you can see on the chart (ALWAYS ABOVE THE TRENDLINE)

6) Depending on how aggressive is the setup you are taking, the invalidation level can be: FIRST below the whole structure 65.00 / SECOND below the throwback (this setup provides a massive risk to reward ratio, however, is prone to a quick stop loss)

7) Targets: IF I would be executing a setup here, I would protect my setup once the price reaches the previous top, which shares a major resistance zone that you can see on the weekly chart (2% below that, I want to be risk-free) / Now, the places to close setups on profit can be the first or 2nd Fibonacci extension . The expected duration of a movement like this may be between 200 to 300 days.

8)RISK: This is the formula I use to trade: I never have more than 5 setups at the same time NEVER EVER. And the maximum % of risk I take on any setup is 3% (ONLY with a STRATEGY THAT YOU HAVE a lot of EXPERIENCE WITH). Let's understand this better, most of my setups happen on the daily chart , which means that time resolutions are between 2 weeks to 3 months. Another rule I use is that my setups must happen on uncorrelated assets example: NFLX / BTCUSD / XAUUSD / FCX / AMZN . So my worst-case scenario is losing all at the same time which means a -10% to -15%. That's more than acceptable for me. And the most probable thing is that I would be able to open 4 to 5 new setups 1 to 2 months later. That's why this type of trading style is so secure. Even in apocalyptic scenarios, you would face a manageable loss, and it will take you time to develop new setups (you avoid impulsive trading)”

**’I’m a regard that wants to YOLO options, what do I do?:**

*Disclaimer: I have a good history with options, but I only trade (for the most part) 1 month, or 6 month options, or 1 year or 2 year LEAPS. I would advise to go for LEAPS and shares for this stock - either ITM or slightly OTM. If it becomes ITM, you can always roll to a higher strike if you wish.*

*High-risk:*
Be regarded and YOLO to play earnings on December 20th. I would suggest either buying ITM 80c or slightly OTM 85c for December 23 or December 31st. 90c if you like crayons. 

* [December 2021 options chain](https://imgur.com/QD3ROzy)

*Medium risk:*
Buy 80c, 82.5c, 85c for April, June, July or September. Or if you’re regarded 87.50 and 90c.Play on the thesis that MU has a lot of value, will do well in December earnings (maybe), has great products, and that the downtrend is beginning to turn into an uptrend as I believe. I would suggest buying shares also.

*Low(ish...they’re still options) risk:*
Buy 80c or 82.50c for Jan 2023, June 2023 or Jan 2024. Medium/low risk is 85c. Medium/low risk but still regarded is 90c.  Even better would be to buy warrant options.

Medium/low risk:
Buy 80c or 82.5c for 2022 and LEAPS for 2023/2024. Maybe warrants, if that is possible for you. Also buy shares. 

*My position:*
I'm a Europoor with a small account. I got up to $8000 from $1500 (largely AMD and NVDA gains) this year but I had to spend it on life shit. So I've started agan from $336, up to $551 now from NVDA and FB calls, as well as some daytrading.

$134.33 of 12.21 86c warrant calls
$69 of 03.22 90c warrant calls
$69 of 06.22 96c warrant calls
As of 14:47
(account value has increased to $620)
edit: Bought $40 more of 06.22 at 15:07, other positions have increased in value.

Yes I'm regarded.


I hope my small position assures you this is not a P&D (I hate them), I simply love writing DDs and am trying improve my skill at them (and share my in-depth research).



**Where should I enter? (options or shares):**

Look out for a mini-dip on Monday or sometime next week. Enter there. Consider using DCA to get a better average cost over multiple dips.

**Conclusion:**

I think this DD speaks for itself. Micron has great drivers/catalysts to drive the price upwards. It is investing heavily in itself. Nvidia is dependent on them. I am very bullish on MU after doing this research. I will try to open a position of LEAPS and shares as soon as I have the funds. 

**TL;DR:**

* MU bounced on Friday, perhaps this is the sign that its downtrend is reversing.

* Higher future DRAM demand will push up Micron. DRAM is used in Smartphones, Data centres, PC/Gaming, Automotive, Industrials and Consumer Electronics. Increased demand in these sectors will drive up Micron’s value. 

* Nvidia uses Micron memory in it’s data centre GPU’s.

* Nvidia’s ONLY supplier of GDDR6X memory used in higher-end gaming GPU’s is Micron. Nvidia is dependent on them for this high-performance memory.

* AMD are using Micron GDDR6(not X) memory in their RX 6000 series GPU’s.

* Micron’s downtrend has changed in November. 

* Micron intends to spend $150 billion combined on Global Manufacturing and R&D.

* $130 price target from Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill.

* Micron moves based on the supply/demand for memory.

* Micron may have bottomed out now, and is due to go up.

* ‘Tipranks’ Stock Forecast Tool indicates 15 out of 22 analysts have given MU a Buy rating, while six analysts have a Hold rating on the stock and just one has a Sell rating on the stock.
The average Micron price target is $96.09, which indicates 24.2% upside potential.

* [Analysts expect that Micron will report $7.66 billion in sales for the current quarter](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-mu-consensus-analyst-rating-2021-11-2-3/), according to Zacks Investment Research. The highest sales estimate of 6 is $7.67 billion, and the lowest is $7.65 billion. Micron posted sales of $5.77 billion during the same quarter last year, indicating YoY growth of 32.8%. Next earnings date is Monday, December 20th. 

* On average, analysts expect full-year sales of $31.34 billion (for the current financial year). For the next fiscal year, analysts forecast reported sales of $35.60 billion on average.

I’ve got 10k on 12/17 200p, 60 contracts. Will most probably add more eod. 

My discussion topic: As things return to normal and as major competitors such as Cisco’s WebEx, Google’s Meet, and Microsoft’s Teams encroach on zoom, it’s not looking good. 

But the stock is down from the lofty $400s already. Obviously I think it could fall further. I think they are the next Skype: video conferencing is only valuable when packaged with other business services. It’s also just as easy to use FaceTime or Google Meet. I don’t see zoom having any moat or innovation that can’t be copied. 

Counter argument to this is sectors that don’t use tech stacks heavily have adopted zoom. I’m thinking Law, Academia, other light business etc. Also there is some stickiness in the space, particularly for older generations. 

Currently the stock trades at a PE multiple of 76. That’s a tech company valuation which is universally predicated on continued growth and growth potential. 

I’m skeptical their forward guidance will indicate future growth. So a better multiple might be more along the lines of 30-50, which represents a drop of 50% to 33%.  

Thoughts?

Edit after ER:

the initial reaction looks positive. It might turn around based on guidance. Let’s see what the guidance is.

Second edit:

Yea bitches that’s how we do!

Third Edit:

ZM never dies, but hopefully by tomorrow it will have sunk some more.  IV crush will be a bitch but December options will hopefully be ok. 

Final verdict: ZM did not plummet much after earnings.

qwqu4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qwqu4k/aur_automating_your_portfolio_with_selfdriving/,$AUR: Automating Your Portfolio with Self-driving Tech DeSPAC Play🔥,473,186,2021-11-18 22:24:31,"Alrighty degenerates I got a play that will drive itself to profits. I’ve been on the lookout for amazing deSPAC plays that have potential and this one takes the cake, pie, and pretty much all the goods you will ever purchase in the future into your hands. It's a self-driving vehicle technology business that's going to revolutionize the way we travel and move goods. They’ve partnered with all the big names like Uber, Fedex, Volvo, Denso, Toyota and trucking industry giant Paccar. To bring us everything from self driving taxis, cars to fully autonomous trucking industry that will define the future. And it's all being led by individuals that have made amazing advancements to self driving technology and now   have joined together to revolutionize the industry.

The DeSpac trend continues with recent deSpacs plays getting hyped and shit on daily. But they all tend to do one thing and it's one thing we can count on. And that’s moving up in price once the information about the company is made aware to the masses. This isn’t a low float play as far as I can tell. But that won’t stop it from running and with the potential of this company that's a sure thing.

**Aurora Driver** \-designed to enable any vehicle from Class 8 trucks to regular cars to become autonomous and move safely and efficiently with human drivers which makes roads and the rides much safer without the possibility of human error.

**Aurora Connect**\- Driverless  Ride Hailing Service that will replace drivers for companies like Uber. Aurora Acquired Uber’s self-driving unit, Advanced Technologies Group last year in order to get market share in the robotaxi marketspace.

**Aurora Horizon** \-Bringing autonomous driving to the trucking industry which will make it cheaper and more efficient to transport goods and cheaper as well without the need to pay for a driver which currently is around 50% about transporting costs. Which is going to make it more lucrative for the shipping industry. It's already on the road and making test runs that serving the needs of Fedex and more companies in the future will follow.

&#x200B;

[Market Share Aurora has due partnerships ](https://preview.redd.it/cf0vb3ol5d081.png?width=1517&format=png&auto=webp&s=84a26a9433682c4db6697710229bcd24bddf5fa4)

Aurora is being led by the best Autonomous Driver Technology Innovators of the decade. Chris Urmson, previously head of the Google Self-Driving Car project, formed Aurora in 2017 with Sterling Anderson, who led Tesla’s Autopilot program, and Drew Bagnell, a Carnegie Mellon University computer scientist and former member of Uber’s autonomous vehicle team, Uber ATG. These are the best people that the industry has to offer and they're all working together to take us to the future of Driverless Vehicles.

Now with this being a recently formed deSpac most of the float is under a lock-up agreement. And with share redemptions and other stuff that make a deSpac plays so enticing the float you see is not the actual float. If you don't know what that means, well, you're shit out of luck. I'm not going to explain how SPACs have huge floats and are allowed to have options traded on them, but then when they go through with a merger a lot of that float vanishes due to redemptions. Now I don’t know the number of shares actually being traded because I'm not a lawyer and can only understand so much of 8-k filings before it goes over my head. But I’m confident that the actual number of shares being traded is way less than stated.

My positions are 2500 shares, 100 15c Dec 17, 50 12.5c Dec 15c and 25 20c Mar 22. Now if you have big balls and want to go in on Nov 19 options that could work out aswell. I’ll be buying some on open. Just bought 100 12.5c Nov 19 there cheap as fuck right now.

**Edit:** **The recent Apple news has me even more bullish of the AI driving Sector and of Aurora because of their top of there class team working on making it happen. Its always possible that Apple could use Aurora software in there cars in the future! Bullish**

**CNBC Talked about Aurora Recently Its getting exposure ;) If anybody can get a clip that would be awesome.**"

Tables of stocks found below.  My diamond hands are so rough on my fleshy...forearms. I can't type anymore.

# Observations/Assumptions

Before  you jump down my throat, these are simplified observations/assumptions,  not internationally agreed upon mandates from heaven. Okay, now you can  jump down my throat.

* Companies  with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a  sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies  missing one or more of those attributes.
* For most people it is impossible to time the market
* Stock prices have all available information priced into them.
* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.
* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)
* [Index  fund returns, such as the S&P 500, are now predominately determined  by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)
* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).
* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 (yes, simplified)
* During times of volatility, companies that had poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.
* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.
* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:
   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp)  even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have had  losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing in  that same set of stocks in the same proportions.
   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don’t want to support.
   * Due  to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the  index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when Tesla  was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on 11/16/2020,  forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up the price,  which had already been driven up by people buying the stock knowing it  was then going to get added to the index forcing more people to buy the  stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular, that’s because it is.

# Hypothesis

Using  industry benchmarking against the best of the best of the best  companies in each industry in order to purchase only the best companies  in equal measure should provide a well-diversified portfolio that over  the long term should be able to beat the S&P 500.

# Experiment 2020

750  largest US stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry  (Industry details available further down the post). Stocks were given a  score based on their relative percentage compared to the industry index.  For example, each companies’ average ROE of the last 4 years was  compared to this index value with the following type of breakdown:

* ROE < Index ROE = Poor = 1
* ROE > Index ROE = Moderate = 2
* ROE > 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3

For  example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was  10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,  they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they would  receive a moderate rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would receive a  great rating.

This was done for all of the metrics below:

* ROE
* Revenue Growth %
* EBITDA %
* FCF %

The  relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there  was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth  only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be  decreased to 125% for a better distribution.

Any stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.

[ROE Example](https://preview.redd.it/t7l27u9tu6081.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f904309edb170cc8679189ea62f7bbe057646a3d)

ROE Example

That left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.

This  left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the  company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently  in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them  being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire? Has  WSB said it's a buy? Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason  that I want to exclude them?

That left 26 across 7 sectors.

**2020 Industry Breakdown**

These  26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and  September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total  purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.

2020 Experiment Results July, August, and September 2020 purchases to 11/16/2021

* **S&P 500** total return reinvested dividends: **49.09%**
* **My 26 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **61.53%**

Can we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.

# Experiment 2021

2,850  tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.  The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:

* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company
* Profit Margin – shows how effective the business is at making money
* Operating Margin – shows how much money the company earns on its revenue
* FCF Margin – shows how efficient a company is with their cash
* EBITDA Margin – shows a companies’ operating profitability
* ROE – shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money
* ROA – shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits
* ROIC – shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns
* Debt/Equity Ratio – shows the financial stability of a company

More  metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to  determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to  median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of  the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:

·  3 stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over  the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry is  then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that benchmark.

Each  stock was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the  metrics and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite  score out of 27, from 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the  metrics. The scores are based on how much better they are then the  average. I measured them against the benchmark using the same  methodology as previously performed: Poor < 100%, Good < 150%,  Great > 150%. Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the  particular metric to find a useful distribution.

I  also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst TICKER THAT SHALL NOT BE NAMED (evidently a stock that cannot be named because I was banned the first time I posted this) with a score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9 categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn’t match the original  input (congratulations on your reading comprehension), this is primarily  due to mergers/acquisitions or the stock being taken private. Another  stock was acquired during the analysis, changing the max number yet  again.

Here is an example showing Aerospace & Defense scoring:

[Aerospace & Defense scoring](https://preview.redd.it/5r8i1qb0v6081.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=947be14d943204b8211c0933e9c1f1a41d4a1986)

Here is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the company’s most recent year):

Here is an example of the visualizations for the data:

I  applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at  the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock  that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a  high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.

Next,  I read the description of \~300 stocks and looked through their  financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off  their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly  leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that  Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns  Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them (how could you not?), no  there are not great synergies between the sectors of the business, yes,  they are aware of this. I also eliminated industries I wasn’t interested  in reviewing, such as REITS due to the need to look at different  metrics like FFO, Oil and Gas because it’s oil and gas, etc. These  activities eliminated \~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I’d  need to build a separate model.

I  then looked at each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made  the cut. Are all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are  the profit margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt  situation, did WSB say it's a buy, etc. Who deserves to be on this list?  This eliminated \~75.

We were down  to 84 stocks at this point. I then looked at each company's investor  presentation, annual report, etc. to better understand what the company  does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was not nearly as thorough on  this portion this year compared to last year just due to the substantial  increase in companies, 26 vs 84. My hourly wage at McDonald was going  to be better than my returns from the analysis if I took too long. I  only eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83  companies across 31 industries. Breakdown below:

I then purchased all of these in equal proportion in April, May, and July of 2021.

2021 Experiment Results April, May, and July 2021 purchases to 11/16/2021:

* **S&P 500** total return including reinvested dividends: **11.93%**
* **My 2021 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **14.26%**

# Industry Classification

* For Experiment 2020, the Sector was used to determine how companies should be compared.
   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.
   * This  seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each other  that aren’t really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE below.
* For Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.
   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.
   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).
   * I  ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further. Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less than 10  stocks. I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical issues dealing  with averages/medians that were negative. There were also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they could be combined such  as biotech and pharmaceutical.

# Notes

I  partnered up for both the 2020 and 2021 experiments. This was critical  for both expanding my initial idea, brainstorming methods to build the  model, and reviewing the work done for errors. This was a team effort,  and I by no means deserve all the credit or hate.

All returns are showing reinvested dividends in the total return.

It seems towards the end of the rotations we've been having starting with value stocks and ending with mega pumps from SPACs, companies with zero revenue \*cough Rivian\*, and weed stonks.

**Catalyst**

Rumor has it, that Rep. Mace (R) from SC is proposing a bill to legalize Marijuana at the Federal level. ""Those who’ve [seen](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-12/republicans-pot-bill-to-propose-lower-taxes-more-state-control) Mace’s draft say it would regulate cannabis more like alcohol"". This bill coming from the republican side may garner more support than Sen. Schumer's already proposed bill. "" Mace’s proposed excise tax is 3.75%, according to Cobb -- a fraction of the 25.5% that Schumer’s legislation would put on marijuana products."" Personally, I've heard this bill could be brought forward as early as Monday 11/15. But, that's just chatter.

**Well, which dank stock should I buy?**

I've looked at various companies and honestly diversifying into a few may be worth it. However, I have the greatest conviction in **$TLRY** the largest market share in Canada, Germany, and ties to the US with Sweetwater brewing. Those with the greatest dependence on the US may outperform. But, screw the fundamentals because that's not how this market works.

\*for simplicity I'll just illustrate $TLRY to represent the Marijuana sector since it has the largest market cap\*

**Institutions buying $420M+?**

In general, Institutions have been buying these Cannabis companies as they blew off earlier in the year. Heaviest buying has been in $TLRY with the heaviest selling in $SNDL. Interestingly most of the buys come during Q2 which means most of these institutional apes are holding some serious bags. They could be down anywhere from -4% to -33% depending on when they bought in Q2. So, don't be surprised if this gets pumped and ultimately dumped to lighten their bags.

**Leaders in the Sector?**

**$ACB** and **$SNDL** currently lead the move upward as they are right at their 200-day moving average. Does that mean they'll continue leading the way? I don't know. Does that mean the others have more to run? I can't see the future, you twit. As a result, diversifying in this sector might be the way to go.

**Crayons**

It appears **$TLRY** has started to round out and will try to push hire. The green lines are historical supply/demand lines at candle closes. I'm setting my stop near the recent low of $9.98 and will continue to sell out starting at $15.50 to $30.00 for a gain close to between 20% and 130%.

**Social Traction**

Another reason I am choosing to look at **$TLRY** is because of all the weed stocks, **$TLRY** gains the most attention on google trends and is the 2nd most mentioned on WSB behind **$SNDL.**

**Positions**

I literally have none and plan on buying Monday with any of you that like the stock(s). I'll update after buys are in.

Most people will say they are losing revenu and market. 1) No Recent Tech IPO is profitable, they need money to grow and the IPO provide that money those high growth company needs. 2) Wish lost market share, howerver they are implementing a lot of correction before squeezing the ads for the whole entreprise to be profitable. Still, 90 millions users on a stock that is pretty much woth 1 Year of sale is insane, My Target is 30+ in 2022. 

Here is few takeaways after last earning call :

1) 5$ is truly the historical bottom

2) Wish will grow to be a much better profitable company, with better retentention

3) We will see significant quality upgrades on the products in 2022

4) Wish is making deals like there is no tomorrow with a lot of company

5) Ceo and founder stepped down without any fight …

 All the steps are in place for a turnover within a year. This is ridiculously undervalued. Top that with a ceo replacement and 243 jobs posting within a month, I would say things are moving in place and someone has a clear plan with this company. You dont hire so much people if you are not planning on growing 🧐. Why is the replacement of the CEO important, because it means changes are coming :   “if you believe that your company is planning to merge, or has secretly already agreed to merge, and the announcement might not be for several months, then the resignation of key employees can be seen as bullish.”  To me is very strange to see $WISH CEO steps down so easily, he seems someone that would fight until the end and we saw that on the past.. For that reason I think that we would have a buyout coming.. 
So let’s put pieces together. Wish has been posting a lot of executives positions on linked recently. A lot of the management team comes from tech and google. Now the new cfo Vivian managed buyout for two previous companies. Seems like wish will follow the track of a potentail buyout opportunity or a great future growth.

WM Holdings DD,114,69,2021-11-13 08:06:22,"WM Holdings is in my opinion is misunderstood and undervalued. I have been following the company since February 2021 a few months before it went public via SPAC financing on 06/10/21. Until recently the stock had a solid level of resistance around $12 and fell to roughly $9. Why is the stock being beaten down? Is this indicative of the company’s performance or overly pessimistic sentiment?  I will dive into my take on this, and why the recent price movement and price trends are not concerning from my perspective.

 
I see the current price as a tremendous opportunity to buy and hold and take advantage of the cannabis industry without any direct exposure to regulations that companies handling the product face, and risk of product oversaturation in markets that growers will face post-legalization or decriminalization on the Federal level. I will speak to federal legalization, but what I mean is any material movement on the federal level, be it decriminalization or delisting as a sch. 1 substance.


Please note, this is not a get rich overnight stock, however, this is a solid stock to get in early on and hold through any movement on the federal side. Hear me out on this, because at the very least you should be watching this company.
 

It is not my intent to discuss the company’s generic background. I am not discussing their history of profitability and YOY growth since 2008. I find given their business resets in the US and Canada, historical sales and earnings are irrelevant outside of the fact that they are an early-market leader and have experience via early establishment in the industry. I am also not diving into the newer management and their autobiographies, as this is all basic qualitative information that is nice to know, but I find it mostly irrelevant, and you can easily find this in the analyst presentations linked at the bottom.

 
Personal Disclosure:

This isn’t financial advice or persuasion. All data provided is presented for discussion and educational purposes only, and most of all is my limited and subjective opinion. This is my personal take on what I believe to be an undervalued company. I believe the company is undervalued due to the companies’ strengths, the lack of understanding on how the company generates sales, and the unreasonable hesitation of investors due to being scared of weed stocks. MAPS is different than most weed stocks, and I’ll explain why.

 
I have watched this stock daily since February 2021, and have kept up with news and analysts presentations. I am not an expert by any means. I personally do not use MAPS  App or website regularly, although I have years ago. I have friends/acquaintances that use the app in the Los Angeles area for personal consumption reasons. My post is in no way sponsored by WM or WM Holdings or of any outside interests. I come from a background in commercial banking and credit underwriting, which is not the same as securities analysis or investment banking, thus this is my unqualified opinion. 


I simply see value in SAAS side of the business, and the stickiness of their products in addition to the competitive advantages offered to the company due to its high liquidity in going public, it’s early entrance into the industry, and it’s placement as an industry leader spearheading legalization efforts. The fact this company had over a decade of consecutive profitability initially caught my attention due to no one else in the cannabis industry having any similar performance or experience.

 
There has been a lot of pessimism around this stock due to the current price movements. I feel like this is just short term, and I am not at all concerned. I have ridden from $29 down to $11.91 with about 4,900 shares in my IRA, and have about 1,200 shares at $13.30 in my brokerage. This is all based on my perceptions alone based on readily available information. Invest at your own risk.

 
1-year Price Targets:

I will link at the end of this post the actual documents/presentations that I have access to.

 
• Piper Sandler - $16.00 (82.85% upside from 11/21/21 low of $8.75)

• JNP - $21.00 (140% upside from 11/12/21 low of $8.75)

• Truist - $18.00 (105% upside from 11/12/21 low of $8.75)

• Canaccord - $21.00 (140% upside from 11/12/21 low of $8.75)

• BTIG - $17.50 (100% upside from 11/12/21 low of $8.75)

• Stifel - $19.00 (117% upside from 11/12/21 low of $8.75)

• Average – $18.75 (114% upside from 11/12/21 low of $8.75)

 
 
Let’s start by discussing the obvious cons and get into the pros later. The stock has seen declines in price, and they’re not pretty. I believe this is driven by overly pessimistic market sentiment which is in turn creating opportunities to be taken advantage of. I believe there is an overreaction on future guidance numbers vs the company’s actual strengths and understanding the business cycle. Why panic over a single quarter that hasn’t been realized? Nothings changed in my mind.

 
Why did the Stock Price decline after Q2 earnings release in August 2021?
Q2 was the companies first quarter under it’s belt as a publicly traded company. Q2 Revenues increased 21% to $47mln (55% adjusted YOY growth). Additionally, Adjusted EBITA of $8.5mln was down YOY, and Wall Street was not excited. 2021 Guidance was reaffirmed.
 

• At face value, Q2 information didn’t seem all that exciting for a growth company. However, there are important adjustments to be made to understand the company’s normalized performance. Earnings were down YOY, but this was driven by one-time costs associated with the 06/10/21 merger in addition to prior year inflated earnings discussed below.

• YOY revenue growth of 21% was driven by inflated prior year sales from non-licensed dispensaries. The company conducted a “reset” in its Canadian markets and eliminated ties with all non-licensed dispensaries via delisting from the MAPS marketplace. The company similarly had a reset in US business around 2019. When adjusting YOY growth to account for eliminating prior year illicit sales, the company saw a 55% increase in legitimate growth centered in US markets. This is material since the US market upon any Federal level movement will be much bigger than the Canadian market.

• It is important to note that the biggest difference between Adjusted EBITA and EBITA is that Adjusted EBITA subtracts the Change in fair value of warrant liabilities which was $38mln at 06/30/21. There are other offsetting line items however, this is biggest differentiator between EBITA and Adjusted EBITDA. The company doesn’t pay warrant liabilities until exercised. Until then the liability is based on outstanding warrants and stock price at the time of reporting. Adjusted EBIDTA in my opinion is for discussion purposes to demonstrate what earnings would be if the company paid warrants at that time.

 
Q2 Quick Highlights:

• Revenue: $47mln (21% YOY increase; 55% adjusted)

• Gross Profit Margin: 95.93% (95.21% in prior year)

• Operating Income (loss): ($15mln)

• Net Income: $16.8mln (78.72% YOY increase)

• EBIDTA: $17mln (67.90% YOY increase)

• Adjusted EBITA: $8.5mln (18.27% YOY decline)

• Q2 Monthly Active Users “MAUs”: 12.3mln (75% YOY increase)

• Q2 Average Monthly revenue per paying client: $3,706 (24% YOY increase; 21% adjusted)

• Q2 Average Monthly paying clients: 4,221 (2% YOY decrease; 28% adjusted)

Why did the Stock Price decline after Q3 earnings release in November 2021?

Q3 was the companies second quarter as a publicly traded company. Q3 Revenues met guidance and increased 9% YOY to $50.9mln (46% YOY adjusted growth). Additionally, Q3 adjusted EBITA of $10.4mln was down YOY, but exceeded Q3 guidance expectations. The stock fell primarily due to Q4 Guidance which was adjusted downward to $50mln-$52mln revenue expectation ($16mln down from annual FYE 21 guidance of $205mln), and $3mln-$5mln adjusted EBITDA expectations ($17mln down from annual FYE 21 guidance of $50mln).
 

• Stock price fell due to Q4 Guidance adjustments largely based on the decline of Adjusted EBIDTA.

• Legitimate Q3 Revenue grew 46% YOY when excluding sales associated with Canada-based operators who failed to provide a valid license. Gross Profit margin increased to 96%.

• The company’s net income of $49.2mln reflected a 217% YOY increase up from $15.5mln in the prior year. This was primarily driven by $46mln which came from the change in FMV of warrant liabilities. It is important to note that the FMV of warrant liabilities is represented as both income/expense on the companies profit and loss statement, and as a liability and equity item on the balance sheet.

• While guidance on sales and earnings was adjusted downwards, anticipations are still that cash flow will be positive. Additionally, the guidance was for Adjusted EBITDA which is materially impacted by FMV of warrant liabilities which may be dramatically different at 12/31/2021 depending on the factors at that time.

• The company is still highly liquid post acquisition of Sprout, and the parent companies of Cannveya and CannCurrent. This is due to June 2021 SPAC financing, which is really the only funding they could reasonably obtain, given the listing as a Sch. 1 substance. The intention was to prepare for Federal movement early to obtain an advantage and head start via Mergers, Acquisitions, marketing campaigns, and growth to generate returns.

• The company’s largest liability is centered in Warrant Liabilities which is determined as of the date of the information provided and is impacted by warrants outstanding and stock price at the timing that information is reported. The warrants have a strike of $11.50 and expire after 5-years or if the stock trades at/above $18 for 20/30 trading days.
 

Q3 Quick Highlights:

• Revenue: $50.8mln (9% YOY increase; 46% adjusted)

• Gross Profit Margin: 96% (95.47% in prior year)

• Operating Income (loss): $4mln

• Net Income: $49.2mln (216.84% YOY increase)

• EBIDTA: $50.5mln (206.14% YOY increase)

• Adjusted EBITA: $10.4mln (36.96% YOY decline)

• Q3 Monthly Active Users “MAUs”: 13.9mln (37% YOY increase)

• Q3 Average Monthly revenue per paying client: $3,817 (7% YOY increase; 18% adjusted)

• Q3 Average Monthly paying clients: 4,444 (2% YOY decrease; 24% adjusted)

Alright, now that we have discussed the last two quarters, why the price has fallen, adjustments that should be considered, it’s time I substantiate my opinion.
 

Services & Revenue Generation:

 
1. WM Holdings source of revenue and product offerings:

The market has been overly pessimistic about MAPS since the start. Initially when the company announced it’s intention to go public via Silver Spike, I recall reading articles that spoke to it simply being an overvalued listing service. I feel this is a gross misrepresentation of the company’s potential and a lack of understanding on how the company generates revenues. There are two sides to the company’s revenue generation. WM Holdings generates approximately 77% of sales from various advertising products (Maps Market place, app & website), and the remainder comes from selling subscriptions to SAAS solutions for businesses. It offers both B2B (Business to business) and B2C (Business to client) solutions.

 
• Q1 2021 revenue = 55% featured listings, 23% SAAS subscriptions, 22% nearby listings, promoted deals.

 
• Advertising Breakdown:

1. Futured Listings allows for clients to drive additional traffic to their site through prominent placement on the WM marketplace. Keywords are priced at $0.49 per click which is attractive relative to industry comparisons. This currently accounts for 55% of total MAPS revenue in Q1 of 2021.

2. Nearby listings allow retailers to increase presence in adjacent regions/markets.

3. Promoted deals allows for retailers to showcase discounts and promotions through the MAPS deals page

4. Display advertising allows banners throughout the WM website

 
• SAAS Business Breakdown:

1. WM Marketplace is the product most are familiar with, which consists of the company’s website and Android/IOS apps.

2. WM Pages is a listing page with product menu where clients can also provide license information, hours of operation, contact info, discount policies, and other information.

3. WM Orders provides reservation of products for pickup or delivery which allows retailers to confirm availability of products, complete orders, and process payments. (The latter two occurring outside of WM listings marketplace)

4. WM Dispatch is logistics and fulfillment software that allow for real-time routing for legally compliant delivery and tracking of product.

5. WM Retail is a retail point-of-sale system providing inventory management and compliance reporting functionality. The POS system is integrated with WM Pages and WM Orders.

6. WM Dashboard provides data analytics. More specifically, it provides insight on user data and traffic trends on a client’s listing page.

7. WM Store is an orders and menu embed that allows retailers to import their listing menu or WM orders to their own white-labeled WM store website or external third party site. This allows retail businesses to manage their online presence, inventory, and compliance workflows on the WM website and separately branded sites. This does not include product availability confirmation, final order entry, order fulfillment, or payment processing solutions.

8. WM Exchange provides access to the online wholesale exchange allowing retailers to explore brand catalogs and identify wholesalers in order to obtain inventory and manage customer relationships and wholesale operations.  Additionally, this solution offers compliance features such as invoice and transportation manifest generation and recordkeeping. WM Exchange is presently available in California, Oklahoma, Michigan, Maryland, Missouri, and Maine with future plans for expansion as allowed.

 
2. Competition:

Competition such as Leafly, Dutchie, and others only target specific products that WM Holdings offers. While Leafly enjoys the same amount of Monthly Active Users, MAPS appears to be monetizing at a higher rate with a targeted audience more weighted on the west coast.

 
Competition does not provide all of the same business solutions, but most importantly, do not offer a marketplace which differentiates WM. The company’s competitive advantage is quite simple in that it provides a wholistic and comprehensive approach for the cost, compared to any technology solution provider in the industry, which provides more value. Additionally, they provide retailers compliance tools which is a key competitive advantage.

 
The company’s time in the industry has positioned it well for post-legalization/decriminalization. They have been spearheading lobbying and legalization efforts which will benefit them.

 
JNP provided the following information from 5 customer relationships

• 100% of WM customers indicated low odds of switching vendors

• 100% of WM customers picked WM over the competition due to performance

• 100% of WM customers also evaluated Leafly

• 80% of WM customers indicated spending with WM would increase in the next 12 months

 
3. Legalization Trends:

People always talk about how this industry is highly regulated, which is pretty obvious, but also doesn’t mean much at the same time for a company that isn’t touching product directly. As a SAAS company, WM Holdings doesn’t directly touch product, thus they are not regulated in the same sense as a grower/retailer. (Does Square fall under food handling regulations and risks? Does Grubhub? No! They simply service the industry) 


Additionally, CEO Chris Beals has indicated the company will never ger involved with direct handling the product due to the headache of risk and compliance on city, county, and state, and federal levels. This insulates the company from the industry as a service company. It’s also the hurdles Amazon has to overcome if they want to ship the product.

 
It is important to note that the DOJ withdrew its prior subpoena and does not intend to pursue further investigation into the matter. In September 2019, WM Holdings received a grand-jury subpoena from the DOJ which was related to the company’s prior listing of unlicensed dispensaries. The company had conducted a business “reset” to delist illicit or non-licensed retailers, similar to what it has done in Canada.

 
• Present trends are favorable for the legal environment with the most recent development being a GOP sponsored bill for a way forward on the federal level. This is huge since this is the first time the GOP has been willing to discuss a path forward. For the last decade, the same bills have been proposed only to die in the senate. This has changed, and both sides are at least open to discussion.

• Prior top justice officials from the DOJ (highest ranking law officials in the nation) have discussed the great potential of legalization, and their expectations of this occurring. This information is available online via news articles.

• The supreme court, while it did not directly rule on legalization, Justice Thomas in his dissent in June 2021 questioned the listing as a sch. 1 substance while every attorney general over the last decade or so saying they would not enforce. He stated that this was inherently contradictory, and Justice Thomas questioned the point of even listing it as an illicit substance when enforcement was not followed through on.

• Recent studies have shown that the majority of US adults now favor legalization for both medical and recreational use. Record breaking tax revenue and product usage was reported in 2020, with trends indicating increase in these areas. This has led states sitting on the sidelines to now become interested in their own way towards legalization.

• While there is concern about Amazon or Google competing upon federal movement forward, this seems doubtful based on current proposed legislation, and management’s prior comments. The company isn’t getting into logistics due to the headache of compliance. Additionally, so far proposed legislations on both sides restrict advertising, which is in WM’s favor, and will prevent Google or Facebook from competing. Amazon has made political contributions for lobbying efforts, however given the size of Amazon and their historical donations, this doesn’t seem as serious as it could be.

 
4. Valuation Assumptions:

Many of the price target estimates are based on unrealistic conditions that penalize the stock.  This also includes the companies initial guidance projections which did not include recently legalized states. Many do not include 2020 election results or subsequent legalization that has taken place. Many also ignore any future legalization whatsoever for base case discussion and apply arbitrary industry discounts as high as 20%, because they claim that investors are too worried to invest in MAPS due to cannabis risk, thus investment supply is short. 


I find this laughable, considering I do not see any cannabis related risks to this company. They do not handle the product directly, the DOJ dropped its subpoena, and if there was any period to be concerned it was the company’s first 8-year from 2008-2016 when California had yet to even legalize with Prop 64.  For MAPS to be in trouble, their dispensary or retail clients would have to go under. 
 

• Piper Sandler Base Case scenario of a $50bln US market assumes no regulatory changes, and no further legalization is achieved through 2030.

• Key Assumptions for some of the analysists assume no new states legalizing in 2021-2022, new states tricking in 2023 and onwards, and no federal legalization through 2030.

• Arbitrary industry discounts such as 20% due to industry risks. Many of the analysts utilize 15%-16% discounts.

 
 
Conclusion:
 

I see this company as the leading SAAS for the cannabis industry. It has us consistent performance and has gained a lot of experience over the years, but it’s gross profit margins are insane. I have yet to see a cannabis related company achieve their same metrics (MAPS is quasi-cannabis in my mind since it is a service company). 


Acquisition of Sprout for its client relationship management functionality is a positive sign in my opinion. They’re positioning to take advantage of states that are legalizing ahead of the curve.


MAPS has no risk in terms of regulation. The DOJ dropped its subpoena, and there is no more risk on that front. They do not handle cannabis directly they simply provide software solutions and advertising solutions to the industry.


Cannabis product differentiation doesn’t really exist. It’s similar to produce, you don’t buy fruits and vegetables because of loyalty to the farm that grew them (unless you know some farmers personally), because there is no differentiation between end user products. As such, growers are price takers. This makes them reliant upon MAPS as consumers have no brand loyalty to cannabis products. Traffic to dispensaries tends to be by foot, and convenience. MAPS benefits here since consumers use their listing services to find what the hell is nearby. MAPS has dominated the fractured California market because of the lack of brand recognition, and I anticipate them doing the same elsewhere due to their favorable client ratings. Clients even admit even though they aren’t the cheapest they provide the most value, especially with their assistance with legal compliance.


Additionally, no one else can really compare to what MAPS is offering. No one is providing vertically integrated solutions on the same scale, and in a manner that communicates across products. MAPS products work with one another and provide a lot of data points to wholesale and retail operations. This will put maps ahead of the competition who compete on a smaller scale against specific products. With MAPS dominance, it’s hard for businesses to leave. Their products are sticky and the more a retailer has, the harder it is to leave. They aren’t even monitoring their database yet.


The company’s unique strengths combined with their profitability and growth are material to me. Their monthly average users, and average clients are increasing quarter over quarter. Sales continue to increase as well. 


Everyone recently panicked over expectations of a single quarter yet to be realized. FYE 22 is projected to still be profitable, and I think it’s ridiculous to freak out over a single quarter for a company with so much potential. This hasn’t made the company insolvent or illiquid, they are very much liquid and capable of further growth and M&A. As far as I’m concerned their prospects are unchanged. 


It is important however, from a stock price perspective to keep in mind warrant dilution. Once the stock is $18 for 20/30 days that could impact shares. I don’t know what the impact will be. I have heard rumors about the shares being in short supply based on the initial offering, and how many insiders own them. Although I cannot substantiate it, what I heard was that if there was a huge run in this stock the low float would drive up the price. I can’t speak to this, the YouTube video is no longer posted from what I can see. 


However, I do recall hearing about notable short interest on this stock. I’ve seen a lot of large volume after hours purchases, especially around the $12-$14 range. This stock typically runs on low volume. It has done so with the exception of 11/12/21. 4K shares driving the price up/down a lot. $12 was the floor of resistance for a long time and anytime it fell below it would shoot back up. Seemed to bounce between $12-$15 range for a long time. No idea if this helps, just my personal observations. I believe any price under $15 is solid, anything under $12 is killer. Considering the current price is hovering above $9, and warrant strike price is $11.50, I’d say it’s a hell of a deal right now, just in time for Black Friday.

If nothing else, the fact that it's broadly held the line since its ER is saying something.

Piotr Szulczewski being removed as CEO screams that the leadership team mean business. The ""old guard"" has gone. 

They're in survival mode, and anyone that has recently joined or will be joining the c-suite will be under no illusions.

$WISH's leadership team is addressing the loud and clear feedback about their current business model and are pivoting. What's more, they have the balance sheet to execute a pivot; it's not too late despite what the bears will tell you. The key areas (at a very high level) of focus are:

&#x200B;

* Increase users' confidence in their marketplace ($WISH Standards)
* Provide a more differentiated and engaging user experience ($WISH Clips)
* Logistics

&#x200B;

So who is this team assembling $WISH's rocket ship?

**Jackie Reses (Executive Chair) -** ***Joined in May 2021***

Formerly Executive Chairperson of Square

She has helped technology, e-commerce, and high growth start-ups launch new products, markets and revenue streams.

Before Square, she was the Chief Development Officer at Yahoo, where she ran partnerships, acquisitions and investments, significant corporate tax transactions, and human resources. She also served on the board of Alibaba Group, where she helped steward the company's transition from a private to a public company.

**Farhang Kassaei (Chief Technology Officer) -** ***Joined in July 2021***

Formerly Senior Director of Software Engineering at Google

He oversaw the development and roll-out of full-stack commerce capabilities across Search, YouTube, Assistant and Local, and Google Express local shopping and delivery products. He also managed the infrastructure enabling Google Product Listing Ads globally.

**Tarun Jain (Chief Product Officer) -** ***Joined August 2021***

Formerly Director of Product Management at Google 

He incubated and led the development of Discovery Ads, bringing inspirational and engaging commercial ad experiences to YouTube, Gmail and Discover. Before joining Google, he served as Senior Director of Product Management and Head of Product (Ads) at Flipkart. He played a crucial role in driving customer growth through a series of personalization and merchandising solutions. He also led the development of several innovative payment solutions, further enhancing business performance.

Tarun Jain also previously served as Group Product Manager for Commerce, Media and Ads at Twitter and Senior Product Manager Lead for the Bing search engine.

**Vivian Liu (Chief Financial Officer) -** ***Joined October 2021***

Formerly served as Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President of Shutterfly.

She played a critical role in helping Shutterfly navigate the pandemic while transforming the business to achieve accelerated topline growth and EBITDA improvement. She re-established the corporate development function, which successfully acquired Spoonflower in 2021, significantly expanding Shutterfly's addressable market. She also focused on driving operational efficiencies, including co-leading the company-wide implementation of an SAP platform.

# In summary

The above hasn't joined the company to simply ""improve"" $WISH, just like Ryan Cohen didn't get involved with $GME to improve GameStop. They've joined to dramatically pivot the company and bring together their past successes to turn this e-commerce platform around.

Most of the c-suite joined in the second half of this year - right in the middle of the shit storm. This is their time to shine; for the company and their careers.

Yes, this is a gamble, but at \~$5, I don't think there's a better gamble out there.

Before last earning and in few prior days to this I have seen $ZM pop op on my radar. Both times it came from no where with a thought ""Zoom is still a thing?"". So I did little DD on it. 

We all know that ZOOM is another virus baby and before that not a soul cared about their existence. For past months it have been down trading and being in the industry where meeting and calls are very common I am yet to see any large corporate use ZOOM. Teams have been a standard in engineering field where I work. Cut to the chase here is what statistics have to say. 

&#x200B;

1. According to ZOOM website traffic, it have picked up slightly after last yearnings, and now down trading again after a minor recovery. My bet it is due to College and High School students in some places still needing to use it and starting school in August. Now it is dropping again because of breaks and more in person schooling start being available across states. (My uni uses teams)

[Source 1 for ZOOM.us traffic. ](https://preview.redd.it/hnv4crt873z71.png?width=2227&format=png&auto=webp&s=20ea9b67258483eae02da73e83a94187d2c335f9)

   2. This can also be see from a second source. 

&#x200B;

   3. Another aspect I looked at was the trending rank of the app in the app store. In the USA it is on down trend the most, followed by UK. 

[ZOOM app rank](https://preview.redd.it/l6n21ks383z71.png?width=2120&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2bda9a23a457eb7dcb1fb8bc143b389dd06f515)

4. Google statistic showed over all down trend. This chart was based on search, words, and news. As we can see it is been going down hill ever since we started going back to normal.  

[Google trends on ZOOM](https://preview.redd.it/y9z8qwti83z71.png?width=1539&format=png&auto=webp&s=a20eb2d3d93ef1dac1d0ea5cdf21b0e4ca82c24b)

5. Their website have also had a down turn of organic searches ever since June. 

&#x200B;

[Zoom website organic searches ](https://preview.redd.it/wv5a1kt493z71.png?width=2137&format=png&auto=webp&s=564552cbdcaf3fa2080f90169779491b3ea3aa44)

&#x200B;

Zoom works with corporations and makes money of the contract with large corporate America. Many of those use Teams and have already opened their offices therefore people work in person. Their expectation of growing is just not there and Teams being a Microsoft product that will come with Office 365 subscription there is little for ZOOM to hold ground with. 

Base on data and the fact I am yet to see anyone use zoom, or even speak about it, I believe it will flow on next earnings and puts will print.

Position: $230 Puts that expire on 11/26 and $220 Puts expire on 12/03

Ticker: RELY

I’ve   been meaning to write this DD for a while, and with Remitly’s first quarterly earnings meeting having just concluded and the ensuing  price drop I believe right now is one of the best times for entry in this  hidden gem. While I don’t believe this is going to explode on some  large catalyst, I believe there’s an opportunity here for a movement to   the $45-50 levels in the next few months. We're currently sitting at a  strong support around $30. This is a fairly short and simple DD because there isn't anything crazy going on here, just a stock I believe to be trading at a tasty discount.

**Who is Remitly?**

Remitly is a recently IPO’d company that handles international  remittances. Remittance refers to transfer of money by foreign migrants  to their   home countries. It consists of several channels such as banks,  money  transfer operators, mobile network operators, and others.  Remittance   has increased massively in recent years due to businesses  involved with  customers & clients working overseas. The opportunity here is huge, there are over 280 million immigrants and the global  remittance market exceeds $1.5T annually.

Main competitors include Western Union as well as MoneyGram.  However 90% of Remitly’s business is driven by digital methods,  compared to 20% at these dinosaurs. Remitly’s users absolutely love the  product – their app on Google Play has 285,000 reviews with a 4.8/5  rating.

RELY is currently trading  close to 40% off it’s IPO highs. The only  news that has come out about   Remitly since the IPO has been the  announcement of a partnership with   Facebook on their NOVI wallet to  power cash pickup in Guatemala. I  consider this type of partnership  neutral/bullish but it seems to have  been taken negatively by the market  given all the negative sentiment around Meta. I still do not believe that this drop is in any way warranted…

Remitly announced their Q3 2021 earnings on November 10 after market close.

* Revenue totaled $121.2 million, compared to $71.8 million, up 69% (giggidy) year over year.
* Net  loss was $13.0 million, compared to $2.4 million net loss. The  increase in Remitly’s net loss was primarily due to the $6.9 million    non-cash donation of common stock in connection with their Pledge 1%  commitment, as well as incremental stock-based compensation expense.
* Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $0.3 million, compared to $0.6 million.
* Send volume increased to $5.2 billion, from $3.2 billion, up 61% year over year.
* Active customers increased to 2.6 million, from 1.7 million, up 51% year over year.
* Average revenue per active customer increased 12% year over year to $47.34.

**Analyst Coverage**

Analysts have been generally quite bullish about the stock, with an  average   price target of $51, representing a \~65% upside form the current  price   of $30.

Let's dig in. You all know, that 4% of the US workforce quit over ""gains"", be it crypt0, 0DTE SPY calls or whatever thing gave them free money. Now listen, what happens, when inflation further rises, to say 10% or 20% and your cost for heating, food or rent goes up by even more? Well you have to liquidate some of your precious assets. Maybe ETFs, maybe real estate, whatever your girlfriends boyfriend lets you sell.

Now, you quit your job or moved to WFH, because you got so much money from them stonks and now the prices for your favourite banana starts to rise. How long will your money last?

Have you ever heard of the ""The Inelastic Markets Hypothesis""? Well, i saved you a google search, [here is the paper.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3686935) Also i saved you from reading it, this is the main outcome: ""...we find that investing $1 in the stock market increases the market’s aggregate value by about $5.""

If now your average ape begins to liquidate, what happens? Right, markets tank. And not just a bit. Let's say 4% start to liquidate, this might be more than enough to trigger a domino effect, which could start the gayest bear market of everything.

TL;DR
Am a gay bear, markets tank due to inelastic markets and 5x effect from liquidations of poortards.

# [Stock futures inch higher after sell-off induced by hot inflation data](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures inched higher in early morning trading on Thursday following a tech-driven sell-off on Wall Street.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose about 40 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures added 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.7%.
*****
> Disney shares fell more than 5% in premarket trading after the media giant missed on the top and bottom lines of its quarterly results. Disney+ subscribers also came in short of estimates.
*****
> The major averages dipped on Wednesday after a hot inflation report pushed up bond yields. The rise in yields especially pressured growth pockets of the market.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 240 points. The S&P 500 fell 0.8%. The Nasdaq Composite was the relative underperformer, dipping 1.7% as Facebook-parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet all closed lower.
*****
> The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 dropped 1.6% on Wednesday.
*****
> Fresh economic data released Wednesday showed persistent inflation. The consumer price index, which tracks a basket of products ranging from gasoline and health care to groceries and rents, rose 6.2% in October from a year ago, hitting its highest level in three decades. On a monthly basis, the CPI increased 0.9% against the 0.6% estimate.
*****
> “Inflation remains stubbornly high, to the surprise of many that expected prices to come back to earth sooner,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial. “The truth is you can’t shut down a $20 trillion economy and not feel some bumps as it restarts, but we are hopeful the supply chain issues will resolve over the coming quarters and inflation should calm down as well.”
*****
> Following the CPI data, traders moved up their expectations for when the first Fed rate hike would occur. The Fed funds futures market now sees greater odds of the central bank’s first full rate hike coming in July 2022.

Non-intrinsic value related reasons for undervaluation:

* Boring business model is unappealing in environment of high pace, growth stocks
* Nearly zero interest rates hurting insurance companies
* Uncertainty about whether COVID will result in more insurance losses (especially throughout the world as Fairfax has a major global footprint)

Why it’s a good long term play: 

* Investment portfolio is about 1/4 of the total portfolio
   * Currently uses a value approach, which, though performing suboptimally in the past, has seen a revival in the pandemic (a buffer against cyclicality)
* Underappreciated at p/e value of around 3, and 80% price per share to book value per share.
* \~94 combined ratio. This means that the company is earning more in premiums than it is paying out in losses + expenses. Very healthy considering FFH’s investment income
* If there is high inflation, then higher inflation → high interest rates → help out insurance companies like fairfax financial 
* Not a high growth play (stability + stable \~3% dividend yield) 
* While value investments of Prem Watsa have performed suboptimally in recent years to the pandemic, the pandemic has led the company’s value investments to improve substantially to $1.290 billion in Q2 2021. 
* The company recovered to 2019 profit levels but is still undervalued, implying significant upside.
* [Consistent increasing dividend payments](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/TSE/FFH/dividend/) and [share buybacks ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.marketscreener.com/amp/quote/stock/FAIRFAX-FINANCIAL-HOLDING-1409991/news/Fairfax-Financial-Holdings-Limited-announces-an-Equity-Buyback-for-2-602-760-shares-representing-9-36546959/)(increased nominal dividend by about 30% from 2020 → January 2021).

Limitations:

* Lack of a clear catalyst to move the stock price higher
   * It seems like investors are already aware of the increasing dividend and share buybacks (not likely to be a major catalyst)
* Potential for Prem Watsa’s value investment strategy to falter in the coming years like it did in the past several years.
* Approximately 70% of provisions are IBNR (Incurred but not reported), while only 10% have been paid.

**Valuation**

* Fairfax’s price to tangible book value is **1.24** compared to comparable Canadian insurance Companies **1.78** for Sun Life Financial and **1.14** for Manulife FInancial Corp.
* PE is **4.00**. It is significantly smaller compared to comparable Canadian insurance Companies **12.27** for Sun Life Financial and **6.87** for Manulife FInancial Corp. Source: Google Finance

**Special valuation metric for FFH:**

* “The consolidated combined ratio of the insurance and reinsurance operations was 94.3%, producing an underwriting profit of $227.9 million, compared to a combined ratio of 100.4% and an underwriting loss of $13.3 million in 2020, driven by lower COVID-19 losses. The insurance and reinsurance operations experienced growth in net premiums earned of 20.4% and net favourable prior year reserve development of $31.6 million.”

Return on equity (ROE) 16.76%

Return on assets (ROA) 3.98%

**Mean Analyst Price target:** USD$ 569.37. Current price (USD 424). The average analyst price targets are consistent with our finding that FFH is undervalued. [Source](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/TSE/FFH/price-target/)

\*this is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor blah blah blah

TLDR: I am confident in CEO Prem Watsa’s ability to turn around the significant value investments portion of the company, attracted by the <1x price to book value per share, as well as the potential for interest rates to rebound significantly."

# [Stock futures are lower ahead of key inflation data](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. equity futures nudged lower early Wednesday as investors await key data that will indicate how much rising price pressures are accelerating.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures shed about 60 points. S&P 500 futures dipped 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.6%.
*****
> Investors are holding their breath for the latest consumer price index reading, which the Labor Department will report Wednesday before the bell. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect a 0.6% increase, or a year-over-year gain of 5.9%, which would be the most in 30 years. They expect core CPI, which excludes food and energy, to have risen 0.4%, or 4.3% year-over-year.
*****
> With Thursday a government holiday due to the Veterans Day observance, the department also will release its weekly jobless claims count a day earlier than usual. The Dow Jones estimate is for 265,000 first-time filings for unemployment insurance, which would mark a fresh pandemic-era low.
*****
> In regular trading Tuesday, the Dow lost about 0.3% to close at 36,319.98. The S&P 500 fell 0.4%, snapping an eight-day win streak, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6%.
*****
> The sell-off in Tesla continued as the electric vehicle stock fell more than 1% in premarket trading Wednesday, a day after ending nearly 12% lower and more than 16% down on the week.
*****
> “The weakness in Tesla (which is largely technical, not fundamental) is also weighing on the consumer discretionary sector within the S&P 500 today, and the October PPI may also be doing so as business input prices continue to rise,” Goldman Sachs’ Jeff Currie said in a note Tuesday.
*****
> “The prospect of Covid transforming from pandemic to endemic, and the potential for supply chain congestion to moderate are all likely to continue to drive growth, albeit more slowly,” Currie added.
*****
> On Tuesday morning, the Labor Department reported a 0.6% increase in the October producer price index, which iwas in line with the Dow Jones consensus estimate. Wholesale prices jumped 8.6% in October from a year ago, however, the hottest annual pace on record in almost 11 years.
*****
> “Investor worries came to the fore again today,” Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company, told CNBC. “The inflation narrative is still out there and needs to be resolved. We think investors will see inflation abate in the coming months as the Fed remains accommodative, people come back into the workforce and consumers shift from buying goods to services… and we expect that will pull the market higher as we move toward the end of the year.”
*****
> Earnings season continues to be strong, with most of the S&P 500 companies who have already reported earnings beating estimates, according to FactSet. Disney, Affirm, Bumble and The Honest Company are all scheduled to report Wednesday after the bell.

qqseif,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqseif/what_is_the_best_time_to_buy_an_ipo_i_analyzed/,"What is the best time to buy an IPO? - I analyzed 1,000+ IPO's over the last two decades! Here are the results!",1735,194,2021-11-10 19:32:55," Given the growing hype surrounding the [$65 Billion Rivian IPO](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/05/rivian-raises-ipo-price-range-and-could-now-be-worth-up-to-65-billion.html) \[1\], I felt this is the perfect time to follow up on my [first analysis on IPOs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny6wpp/i_analyzed_3600_ipos_over_the_past_two_decades_to/). In the previous analysis, we realized that the majority of gains were made from the listing itself and those who invested on listing day gained a measly 1.3%. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/f4e0nywl7ry71.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c9bb06a416c3cdedcd34b3e91c6f43af1e97f8b)

In most cases, [less than 10% of the total IPO](https://money.usnews.com/investing/investing-101/articles/how-to-buy-ipo-stock-at-its-offer-price) is allocated to retail investors. Adding to this, a multitude of other factors such as your brokerage account, account balance, the historical trading pattern will all contribute to whether you get the IPO shares or not in the end \[2\].

Given that the chances of you making it into the IPO allotment are bleak, what I wanted to analyze is, if we miss the IPO bus,

**What is the best time to buy into a recently IPO’d stock?**

Should it be on the listing day itself or should you wait a day, week, or even a month for all the hype surrounding the IPO to die down and the stock to come back to its “real” valuation \[3\]?

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n5wmym9n7ry71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3106183b0670cb5c790d5034bf7ee76a4ca194b)

**Data**

I have leveraged the same data source (iposcoop.com) that I used last time. They have documented almost all the IPOs from 2000. But for this analysis, I also needed stock price-related information for periods long after the stock had been listed in the market.

The stock price information was obtained using Yahoo Finance. After all the quality checks, we are left with 1,063 IPOs from 2000-2020. All the data used in the analysis has been shared through a Google sheet at the end.

 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/9skwwgan7ry71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=9789e067c476b12b7b962d587c002320623c388b)

**Analysis**

Since the idea is to find the best time to invest in an IPO, we have to compare the returns for multiple time periods. I calculated the one month and one year returns in case you had invested on the day of the IPO as well as if you had invested in the stock after

1. One day
2. One week
3. One month

The returns are then compared against each other to find the optimal time to invest in the stock after it has IPO’d. The returns were finally benchmarked against SPY to see if it makes sense to put in all these efforts - only to maybe underperform the market!

https://preview.redd.it/w2qnh2an7ry71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e659778bbe8aaf8893f5d6f2ea21288ef4b7a71

 **Results** 

[ All calculations are done using the adjusted closing price  ](https://preview.redd.it/vknekrzo7ry71.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fe4c5b99687e881d342df706a16fcd0ac0f255f)

Surprisingly, the gains you would have made from the IPOs are inversely proportional to the amount of time you waited for your investment. On average **the most amount of return is obtained by someone who invested on the day of the IPO itself**. The more amount of time you wait for your investment, the lesser your return is!

But what if you are not interested in the short-term returns? What if you are a buy-and-hold type of investor?

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/uazvvt0q7ry71.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=38ff88f577596544308b493f072d66240507cc7d)

If you are a long-term investor, **you would be better off buying the IPO after waiting for a week**, as it generated the most amount of return. But what is interesting is that waiting a week for the hype to die down would only increase your return by 9%. Waiting any further would only ***decrease your overall return.***

So if you are planning on buying into an IPO but did not get an allocation at the listing price, you can wait a week so as to see how it performs in the market, avoid any large swings that the first week might cause, and still come out on top over the long run!

Now, let’s compare the performance of IPO stocks against SPY. After all, even though you are getting a good return on your investment, if it does not beat the market, you would have been better off just investing it in SPY rather than doing all this research on IPOs.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ehviuevq7ry71.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=880c9f18392da5832a239819b38cd6dc04893875)

IPOs’ returns on average ***beat the market*** over the last two decades. The trends are similar to the ones observed earlier with the delta over the market return depending on how much time you waited before investing into the IPO and generating the highest amount of delta by waiting one week from the day of the IPO.

Now it would be amiss not to discuss the inherent risks associated with investing in an IPO. Out of the 1,063 IPO’s in our analysis, only 62% of them gained in value and only a measly 29% of the IPOs beat the market over the long run. The outperformance over the market is coming due to a few outliers (Tesla - 25,000%+, Shopify - 5800%+, etc.) If you miss out on the top 1% of successful IPOs, your returns would be much lesser than the market. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/5np1iman7ry71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed89afca9e90fdc3288899fcab548a8155beecdc)

**Limitations**

The above analysis comes with some limitations that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy

1. The number of IPOs in the analysis is approximately 1/3rd of the total IPOs which occurred during 2000-2020 \[4\]. I don’t think this is a major concern since our sample of 1000+ stocks would be much more than enough to give statistical significance to our analysis.
2. Another limitation is that the delta that you are observing here might just be due to the additional risk that you are taking by buying into lesser-known/small-cap companies. The risk-adjusted return might give a different result.
3. Continuing from the above point, we are currently in a massive bull run with ATH being broken every week. So the additional risk you are taking will be well rewarded but the outcome might look different if we do the same analysis in the middle of a bear market.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/qk5hm49s7ry71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=77fe292757c841d6ecd666b499a9315e48595f25)

**Conclusion**

Buying into an IPO is an exciting prospect. Our analysis proves that even if you miss out on getting the IPO allocation, it’s still possible to beat the market by investing after the stock is listed on the market.

As I [explained in my last post on IP](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny6wpp/i_analyzed_3600_ipos_over_the_past_two_decades_to/)O, investment banks are incentivized to slightly underprice while listing (unless it’s a really popular company) so that the IPO issue is 100% subscribed (their fees are dependent on a successful IPO) \[5\].

Whatever the case may be, if you are planning on holding on to the IPO only for a short period of time, you can maximize your returns by investing in the IPO as soon as it’s listed whereas if you are a long term investor who is planning to hold on to the stock for a very long time, its better to wait a week or so for the stock price to settle before making your move!

Until next week…

**Footnotes**

\[1\] The company has [only built and delivered 56](https://insideevs.com/news/542908/rivian-production-numbers-first-month/) vehicles as of Oct21. If Rivian IPO’d at $65 Billion, it means that each vehicle it delivered added more than $1 Billion in value to its shareholders. A similarly valued Ford delivered 4.1 Million vehicles in 2020. Truly wild times we are living in!

\[2\] Brokerages tend to allocate IPO shares to their premium clients - [In the case of TD Ameritrade](https://www.tdameritrade.com/investment-products/IPOs.html), your account must have a value of at least $250,000 or have completed 30 trades in the last 3 months.

\[3\] Take the examples of Robinhood and Coinbase IPO. Robinhood tanked on listing day losing 8% only to rally almost 100% in the next one week before coming back down to near its IPO pricing. Coinbase also had a wild ride on listing day with the share price going as high as $429 before crashing back down to \~$310.

\[4\] The major limitation was the absence of financial data in Yahoo Finance for certain stocks.

\[5\] There are a lot of contradictory opinions regarding this with [some research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0275531918309280) showcasing that IPO’s are usually undervalued while [others argue](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/17/3/811/1612977?redirectedFrom=PDF) that IPOs are overvalued. I guess you can twist data however you want to tell your story.

1) Make sure the ad is shown (not behind a window etc)

2) Detect bots and don't lose impressions to fraud  
3) Analyze the page ad is shown on semantically for brand safety and targeting

This is a strongly growing market. Major advertisers want this type of solution that preferably serves them across all geographies and platforms. That's why DV has offices all over and keeps adding new platforms, such as recently TikTok. The advertisers don't want a platform provider to do this verification themselves, so e.g. Google stepping in and taking over the market is not likely. 

DV has very strong tech - I sold them some from Finland.

DV' has been following ""rule of 60"", with revenue growth % + ebitda % being greater than 60. 

It IPOed in April at $36, and has been as high as $48. Last night closed at $33.7. Third quarter financials coming today after market close. I don't know what they are like, but I'm sure this stock has good long-term upside potential."

/1. INTC is the only real US chip manufacturer that can reasonably compete with Korean Samsung and Taiwanese TSMC (-100 credit score for acknowledging Taiwan). It is getting lots of literal boat load of cash(probs something like $50B equivalent) from the government that is positive for the shareholders, while maintaining the buybacks and dividends.
Yes, TSMC and others are also hedging and gonna start making some chips in USA but realistically the gubment will give most of the cash to INTC.

/2. US gubment is in a cold war with China, this means it's also a technological warfare. This means supercomputers, missile, Starlink chips(private company) etc and Intel is likely going to be one of the prime suppliers of this boom in tech investment.

/3. TSMC and Samsung are pretty much bottlenecked. Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Mediatech, Broadcom, various carmakers, electronics manufacturers etc and not to mention Intel themselves are a big buyer. Specifically, Intel and Apple has bought out all capacity of TSMC 3nm(equivalent to Intel's 5 nm probs, I forgot). This means there is an enormous demand that is not being fulfilled and Intel launching their foundry services and already signing deals with Qualcomm, Amazon is a big deal.

For reference, TSMC's market cap is bigger than 3 Intel (yes, that's a unit I invented). In 2024-2025, you might even see Apple, NVIDIA and the likes fabricating their chips from Intel just to give a big F U to TSMC (who is currently slightly overcharging if the rumours are to be believed).

/4. Intel is launching a GPU. The GPU market is also in a huge bottleneck due to higher demand from gamers and corn miners. Everyone expects that they are likely to sell their GPUs very easily. Think about this for a sec. Intel is just about to become one of the players in this huge GPU market.
Which would also make way for their server GPUs and AIs and the likes.

/5. Think 10-15 years from now. Your fridge, doorbell, light, heating system and every ducking thing will have some chips and Intel is likely to remain a dominant player in this market. I think this will be bigger than the current entire semi market as it is. IOT is just getting started.

/6. Intel is one of the forerunner player in AI techs like autonomous vehicles through their various investments(Mobil eye for one) and will likely remain so. I don't know how big this will be in 10 years, but it's likely that Intel will be one of the bigger players in the market like Google (through Waymo), Tesla and NVIDIA.

/7. Intel also recently launched their big little architecture, where it has already became competitively better than AMD especially in gaming with low power consumption and huge power. Not to mention being very power efficient most of the time for using its efficiency cores most of the time. Not that it matters that much, seeing the gamer Steam reports, very few people actually play on the latest of the latest gen. But, that's also something that's worth noting at least. 

However, the vast majority of pc sales is in just your average boomer laptops and desktops. And they have a good lead there.

*Tips for those wanting to build a high end new pc. Wait for Intel's lineup to be available broadly, high end pc gamers will dump their last gen AMD chips for the Intel one in the second hand market, causing a flooding of cheap AMD CPUs, buy one of them. Source: Did this once.*

/8. One worrying factor is in the server market. Everyone seems to be launching their own server chips and AMD is very competitive and eating away market share. But Intel's management seems to be guiding us towards the right path. If their predictions prove to be right, they are on the right track.

/9. Intel announced that they will launch Angstrom scale CPUs in the future, that's good I guess. They are also working in RISC-V and other CPU architectures.

/10. Pat has an approval rating of 96% in Glassdoor and the employees would recommend others to work in Intel 89% of the time. This is a huge ass jump for both scores from the Bob Swan era. Go to Wayback Machine, you will see. This means a noticeable change has taken place within this huge organisation in such a short time.

/11. Intel stock always seem to have price support at around $50. And it's near that range right now.

/12. Most analysts are bullish on the stock. Comparatively cheap stock in this clown market. Wanna buy a $5.48B gravity powered truck company anyone?

/13. Intel actually has one of the highest talented employee pull who can be expected to deliver. Contrary to popular belief.

**Bear Cases**

/1. This is a boomer stock according to reddit's circejerk. So, it's difficult to convince people that it is actually expected to grow around 11% CAGR just by the current demand circumstances alone by management's conservative estimates for the next few years. This is mega bearish. If the market doesn't care about a stock, no matter what the management do, the stock will not perform.

/2. Intel has repeatedly failed to prove that their foundry division's predictions are reliable. If they went fabless like AMD, it would have probably rocketed already. But a big part of the cheapness of the stock comes from the unreliability of their foundry division. Yes, the management has finally started getting serious about their foundry, but one cannot ignore their past failures.

/3. Government contracts and the likes are not completely free money like some of you believe, delays in delivery and contract fulfillment could make what is essentially a free money glitch to a costly mistake and a billion dollar loss with a brink of an eye. The terms are generally very strict, so Intel has to deliver.

/4. Investments are going to be a lot and semiconductor industry being cyclical means, if Intel fails to deliver, its market share will be eaten away and lose billions in potential profit.

/5. Stock seems to be largely rangebound like Microsoft was for 15 years.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bandwidth-announces-third-quarter-2021-211200743.html

**TL:DR. Bandwidth is drastically undervalued compared to other tech on the market, when comparing the revenue growth. They are value the same as they were pre-pandemic, but have since acquired a company to go global, and revenues have grown about 100% since back then. short interest is 17%, it is low float and low volume. a turn around could blast this company to space, just like it did at the start of the pandemic, when it ran from high $70s to $196🚀 🚀🚀 🚀**

Alright you nerds, let's talk about a little known company called [Bandwidth Inc.](https://www.bandwidth.com/) ($BAND), and one of the most undervalued tech plays on the market.

**Who they are and what they do :**

Bandwidth is a CPaaS company, Communications Platform as a Service. They are a B2B company that provide APIs to enterprise customers, that allow them to integrate phone calls and text messaging into software and apps. Ever call into a Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or WebEx meeting on your phone? That is Bandwidth. Ever make a call through Google Voice? That is Bandwidth. Basically any apps or software that have native calling or texting built into will use Bandwidth or a competitor like Twilio.

**Some other examples of how the products and services work:**

* Service/Call center software, would use Bandwidth APIs to built the calling into the software, or if you are texting with a support center.
* 2 factor authentication texts
* making a call from you Amazon Alexa or Google Home
* Alert texts for things like Open Table, WaitMe, or Lyft
* Advanced Emergency/911 services, that allow for more accurate location mapping when people call from big office buildings. they can see what floor and where on the floor the call is coming from.

**Let's look at some bullish shit going on with them:**

* [Big Partnership with Microsoft](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bandwidth-announces-duetsm-for-microsoft-teams-a-comprehensive-solution-for-direct-routing-and-dynamic-e911-301099985.html)
* [Big Partnership with Zoom](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bandwidth-announces-charter-membership-in-zoom-phone-provider-exchange-301376925.html)

* [Bandwidth is expanding globally.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bandwidth-completes-acquisition-of-international-cloud-communications-leader-voxbone-301164856.html)

&#x200B;

**Let's look at the huge growth over the past 3 quarters:**

>**Fourth quarter total revenue of $113.0 million, up 82% year-over-year**

[**https://investors.bandwidth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bandwidth-announces-first-quarter-2021-financial-results**](https://investors.bandwidth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bandwidth-announces-first-quarter-2021-financial-results)

>**First quarter total revenue of $113.5 million, up 66% year-over-year**

>**Second quarter total revenue of $120.7 million, up** **57% year-over-year**

&#x200B;

Some technical info:

Band is sitting at the lower bound of a multi-year trend, after having huge growth over the past year and a half, and expanding internationally. It is sitting at a fairly oversold level on the RSI, and right at a huge column support area. It stands to reason that we will see a bounce up from here, at least to the next supply zone in the $115-120, but could trend back up as high as the upper trend line in the $160-170 area. 🚀 🚀🚀 🚀

**Short interest is also sitting at 17%.** Not a huge amount, but with such low float and low volume, this bad boy can easily be blown sky high.

So why id BAND valued so low? My theories are that:

* They are somewhat miscategorized. The price clearly tracks with telecom infrastructure, which is somewhat justified, in that they have a nationwide network. But not justified, because they are being compared to cash dinosaurs, and not the high growth software they are providing.

https://preview.redd.it/8jii5se69ey71.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea93d51f632e48aadbcf9b416e1eedc5de165f14

* Because they are low float and low volume, when ETFs and such sell that sector, they get shoved around more that usual.
* I think there is a fundamental misunderstanding in the market of the company, what they do, and what the potential is. I believe this incorrect categorization will change over time, and the stock is being sold at bargain barrel prices until then.

**Positions**: Currently 1150 shares. Options could be played, but the volume is low, so spreads are a bit wide. Also, it is hard to say how long a it will take for the market to realize it is missing out. Selling puts is probably free money. OTM Leaps or debit spreads could work.

**Edit**. Forgot to mention that earnings are at the end of the day today. This could be where the big uppies get underway."

The stock has been volatile but its interesting to note the volume had been low yet the stock price had been holding. Short interest is high as many got trapped when it ran from $10-40. CTB is over 500% and there is 100% share utilization. Ortex data has been posted online and can be checked to verify but it seems like an amazing setup. If volume increases this week, this one should soar.

To start out, the company has been absolutely printing money, with a current P/E ratio of 33.50.  If you take just their most recent Q2 earnings, their P/E ratio is 13.56.  Compare that to any other rapidly growing tech stock, I’m talking Square, Snapchat, AirBnB and other “popular among youths” stocks with P/E ratios of 100+.  Yes, this is largely in part to Coinbase absolutely crushing Q2 earnings, but at the rate things are going, I don’t think that earnings report was an anomaly.

According to multiple websites I found with a quick google search, Coinbase is now the most downloaded app on the App Store and second on the Play Store.  I’ve seen the new ad campaigns all over the place, which is always a good indicator of a company becoming more established.  With customer acquisitions skyrocketing and the cryp\*o market as a whole reaching all time highs, I see no reason Coinbase can’t demolish earnings the same way it did last quarter, perhaps even harder.  But this brings me to the one critique many have of $COIN: it follows the cryp\*o market too closely.  For example, if bi\*coin goes on a run, you can expect $COIN to follow it, and vice versa.  But this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, nor does it have to be permanent.

The cryp\*o market as a whole has been on a tremendous bull run since its inception (for the most part of course), and with serious attempts at integrating cryp\*o into day to day life, I don’t see this changing anytime soon.  Bi\*coin has dominated the cryp\*o space, and much like $COIN, other cryp\*os have a habit of following the price of bi\*coin.  However, other cryp\*os are starting to emerge with rocketing market caps, each one making bi\*coin a smaller piece of the overall pie.  With alternative coins like  diverging from bi\*coin, the cryp\*o space is likely to become more diverse as time continues, much like the stock market is today.  This will hopefully make for a healthier, less dominated market that will be less volatile as a whole.  So if bi\*coin has a rough day, other futuristic magic internet money can cushion the blow if they’ve diversified the market enough at that point.  Besides, bi\*coin, despite having harsh swings, does majorly trend upward, so even if bi\*coin stays at the top,  $COIN following the cryp\*o market might not be so bad.

So, to sum up what’s been stated, Coinbase has been growing rapidly, is extremely profitable, and has been majorly underestimated by investors across the board with a track record of demolishing expectations on earnings and customer acquisition expectations.  The only caveat for some being that it follows the price of a volatile market too closely, which is hardly a bad thing given that market’s history in the long term is very green, and hopefully won’t be the trend for the stock forever anyways.

But do you want to know why I REALLY believe in Coinbase? Well, put on your tinfoil hats, because things are about to get fringe.

To start, why has Tesla recently become a trillion plus dollar company?  Is it because of their profitability?  No, their P/E ratio is over 350.  Clearly it’s because of the prospect of what’s to come.  The eventual decline of oil as the most environmentally conscious generation grows up and the world’s energy becomes renewable.  Everyone drives a Tesla, and lives on a clean, smog free planet.  When you buy into Tesla, you’re not just buying into a car manufacturer, you’re investing in the prospect of what’s to come, and what Tesla represents as a whole: a bright optimistic future, and a revolutionary macroeconomic change.  So, if this is the case, what does that mean for Coinbase?

Well, I can see $COIN becoming a similar thing; a stock that not only is tied to a growing, healthy company, but as a way to buy into the overall long term trend of cryp\*o becoming mainstream.  Since Coinbase is the premier means of dipping your toes in the cryp\*o seas, buying the stock means you see the value in the cryp\*o market in the long term.  $COIN could grow to represent the anticipation of the cryp\*o market growing, just the same way I believe $TSLA represents the anticipation of an eco-friendly renewable future.  In the same way, it paints a bright optimistic future: the death of banks as cryp\*o rises and everyone races Teslas to compete in the annual Do\*ecoin Cup.  And investors eat up investments that emulate a bright future like candy.  Take weed stocks, the companies aren’t too great in their fundamentals, but, again, they represent a bright, utopian future for pot enthusiasts: weed being mainstream.

But Coinbase still diverts from these companies paving the way for a utopian future in one major way:  IT PRINTS MONEY.  So even if you don’t believe my philosophy that investors buy into companies because of what the perceived success of the company means as a whole (bright, utopian future on the horizon), the company is still phenomenal in its fundamentals.

I’ll be watching Monday’s earnings with my whole 6 shares (shallow pockets boohoo) and a bag of popcorn in hand, as I watch the next trillion dollar company climb to the moon.

&#x200B;

Post earnings damage control edit:  Well guess I'll hold that.  The gay bears win this round, but I'm here for the long game.  With Q4 already setting records for cryp\*o, I have no problem holding the shares for another 3 months at least.  

Not every rocket flies straight.

Carry on fellow $COIN believers.  "

NRG - an energy company with good dividends, ever increasing earnings, becoming more profitable by the quarter, a really good P/E, and surging revenue... it has everything needed to give boomers a hard on despite their ED.

Their most recent quarterly earning is even beating the traction of tesla, facebook, google, palatir, ect.

And this causes it to drop 10% on open? Am I missing something? Did the CEO get caught tugging the hog to iCarly and it just hasn't hit the press? This makes no fucking sense.

I don't own much of it, only 86 shares. But I'm tempted to buy the dip but I am clueless why there is even a dip. Can one of your smarter retards explain this to me?"

\- DropBox is profitable, and growing

\- HelloSign (owned by dropbox) operates in the high margin electronic signature space and is starting to really contribute to revenue

\- P/E is around 30 and dropping as revenue has been increasing year over year for 5+ years with share price relatively stagnant (except for run-up this year after bottoming out).

\- Integration of service with Atlassian, Zoom and many other service providers has the potential to drive growth from outside their own free user base

\- DropBox may also be a solid candidate for a takeover by a larger player. They have a massive free userbase, great name recognition among users, and solid technology.

Personally I believe that DropBox is an uncut gem that have gone largely overlooked by ecosystem investors due to their heavy reliance on free users. This is changing and people may not in large have noticed their more enterprise friendly newer offerings.

My expectations is that DropBox beat their quarterly expectations as usually, but also trigger a revaluation based on showing substantial revenue growth in high margin enterprise/business solutions and integration. While also growing HelloSign substantially.

DropBox report their earnings after market today, and I think they could be gearing up for a rally towards ATH of around $40 and possibly towards $60-$80 near term as investors re-evaluate the long term case.

Disclosure: I own a mix-bag of near the money short and medium term call options ranging from 11/5 $32 to 12/17 $36.

Q2 Revenue came in at 1.3B and estimate is 2B, though a beat on revenue is already priced in with the trend seen in consumer spending and BKNG ([bookings.com](https://bookings.com))'s earnings.

All the data points to a roaring quarter for travelling, from airline, hotel and now BKNG's ER. Increase in travel is priced in. However, BKNG revenue came in at 2.16B for Q3 vs 1.14B in Q2, assuming ABNB did not lose market share, there's a lot of upside potential still. Reviewing alexa metrics and google search trends, I'm not seeing signs for a loss of market share, so in the best case scenario, we could see 2.6B for revenue. Given the pricing power companies had in the last quarter and there was no reduction in host fees (ABNB's \~15% cut), I'm expecting a revenue surprise without a miss a profit margins.

This would put ABNB's price/sales numbers in the same ballpark as BKNG, and given the growth trajectory of ABNB, this means tendies for years to come.

I don't care. Your loss. One of the potential greatest earnings beats of all time is coming 11/10 (quick discussion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pawnga/opendoor_is_on_pace_to_blow_away_q3_estimates/)). This is on top of a stupid discount with the stock being coupled to $ZG's downfall. This will de-couple.   


Keith Rabois: PayPal mafia, Musk and Thiel friend, edgy fuck-you attitude online. This man is somehow so under talked about in this thread and is one of the kings of tech and Twitter. Keith should be a legend of this sub. He is right time after time. He doesn't care about discourse. He just executes. Opendoor has been his long time baby, which he has waited to start to get the timing right. Co-founder, now executive chairman, and a Twitter account that is tweeting out borderline NMPI.   


Longterm, $OPEN is going to have similar / greater top line numbers as Walmart. People are concerned about a downturn in the housing market being non-survivable. Wrong. The model has been back-tested through the 2008 crisis and beyond. Opendoor can still make money. The collapse in housing markets are much slower than you want to believe, and with the right vertical model in place, Opendoor can make money while losing a couple of basis points. They are so misunderstood, and this is the discounted time to join.  


Opendoor has an actual model. They understand how to price homes and when to pull on/off on different regions, and they don't overreact to the market to end up fucked by 700 basis points ala Zillow. Opendoor also doesn't have the same fiduciary responsibility that Zillow does. They have to (and are) making this model work. Zillow simply had to pull out for two reasons: 1) they didn't know what they were doing. 2) they owed a fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders to quit while they can and focus on their main model (which will also get swallowed in the coming years). This is now Opendoor's market to run with. Google ($OPEN) vs Yahoo.  


To the tweets. Rabois is addicted to Twitter. Similar to Elon, but different. In some ways more professional, in some ways more unhinged and quite a few red pilled based takes. Anyways, he's been obsessed with tweeting Q3 takes, while searching and favoriting $OPEN tweets, and engaging in discussion. He calls doubters stupid in public. Here are a few from the past few weeks:  


1. ""Opendoor does not lose money."" [here](https://twitter.com/rabois/status/1450115678346924038?s=20)
2. ""wait until Nov 10 and you will concede I was correct"" [here](https://twitter.com/rabois/status/1453880268851404806?s=20)
3. ""nope.  TKO.  Opendoor is doing better than ever."" [here](https://twitter.com/rabois/status/1449792434062438406?s=20)
4. ""they are going to look like the Tesla cynics in 3 weeks."" [here](https://twitter.com/rabois/status/1449787713394253825?s=20)
5. ""Selling or shorting Opendoor due to Zillow’s flaws is akin to shorting Google due to Yahoo’s inability to monetize search well or return long tail queries properly."" [here](https://twitter.com/rabois/status/1455564619494436870?s=20) 
   1. Note here: short numbers that kicked in after the Zillow earnings are not public yet, and will not be public before earnings. Give the action a look and you'll see a bunch of shorts likely kicked up, and will be put in a need to cover position based off the earnings and a longer short ratio.
6. ""LOL.  We are consistently profitable.  We know exactly what we are doing."" [here](https://twitter.com/rabois/status/1449783187656355846?s=20)  


This is more than just pre-bragging earnings. Chairmen and founders used to be more discreet by taking lavish vacations before earnings. Then Michael Jung from NYU published research to connect behavior to upcoming releases and it all stopped. Keith is straight up dancing in public. He's celebrating Zillow taking a beating. He's also publicly called Zillow becoming a disaster [from the archives](https://twitter.com/rabois/status/984609468355719168?s=20).

Analysts like Opendoor. The cap table is ELITE. Real Estate agents provide negative value in a broken industry., which leads me to one final point. The effects of the tech industry and Keith's pinned tweet which he bases his career on:  


&gt;***Formula for startup success: Find large highly fragmented industry w low NPS; vertically integrate a solution to simplify value product.*** 

  
iBuying is just the entry. Cash flow heavy, with a potential to open up a MASSIVE vertical moat. Open has already completed 2 acqui-hires this year. This is a $5TN company in the making and it's currently valued at \~$13BN.   


If you're an agent in the industry and are mad about Opendoor, don't come in and say it won't work. You're wrong. Take your massive winning year and hedge against your job being automated away. You'll get to retire even sooner. This is the way.

UPDATE: is [this](https://twitter.com/rabois/status/1456040836215590913?s=21)  a MNPI bomb??
&gt;***it was true in Q3.  Buying &amp; selling homes was absolutely profitable.  read the s1***

UPDATE 2:

Market open, Opendoor released a tweet introducing a new product

&gt;***Say hello to Opendoor Complete—a new product experience that combines selling, buying, and closing on a home into one simple transaction so you can move seamlessly.***

I would not want to be Zillow, Better, Redfin, Rocket etc etc etc right now. This is still just the beginning. Multi trillion dollar company in the works. Growth isn’t priced in. Huge discount, and upcoming earnings beat for short term rocket. We’re about to de couple from all competitors. 

Note: I’m more than 40% positive on the day after posting the DD. Not selling for a long time, but I will take gains on the short dated calls post earnings. Cheers.

UPDATE3: another acquisition announced to introduce a deeper vertical with integrated lending. This will likely be an important note in Wednesday’s earnings call even though unrelated to Q3. More revenue streams. More future bps per transaction. More room for margin of error per transaction. More ability to outperform a market downturn on top of the liquidity premium that Opendoor will provide"

A community that defines itself like this is not a confidence-inspiring place to get stock picks to YOLO your next paycheck into. I think, being the only place where losses are celebrated as much as the wins should make you seriously question the incentive of folks who are making the recommendations!  

Whether it’s for the insane YOLOs posted every day, or breaking Robinghood with infinite leverage plays, or the legendary short-squeeze involving GME, here is where the action goes down!

But what I am interested in is to see if **we can beat the** **market** **by using the stock picks made on wallstreetbets!** After all,

https://preview.redd.it/r0cedr2igbx71.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=3080567a78e82b0344ec4a65788d2b4f794159e9

**Data**

Reddit’s PRAW API and Pushshift API were used to obtain the data for this analysis. There were more than 20 million comments and posts made on WSB in 2021. I have had a VM running for collecting the live data from all the financial subreddits since Dec’20.

The summary sheet containing the analysis will be shared at the end in a Google sheet but if you want access to the full historical data, you can get it from [Pushshift API](https://github.com/pushshift/api).

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/gpp85mcjgbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a9916acb77466874f188e0061692d05129a058a)

**Analysis**

Ahh, this is where it gets tricky. There are multiple ways to consider what constitutes a recommendation from WSB. Since there are millions of comments, it’s not realistic to invest in each and every recommendation made on the subreddit.

So what I have done to simplify this is to calculate the most popular tickers for each day \[2\]. Why I settled on this logic is because a stock from this list is what a person is most likely to see when he/she would randomly browse through the subreddit and the higher the number of mentions, the more the chances of investing in the said stock.

Considering the practical limitations, I kept the cut-off at the top 10 stocks. Once we have found the top 10 discussed stocks of that day, we invest in them at the market close. Then we calculate the returns generated by the stocks over the next

a. One Week

b. One Month

c. Till Date ( From the date of investment to Today)

The benchmark for comparison is SPY\[3\]. We will compare the returns against SPY to see if the most popular recommendations generated by the platform can beat returns by SPY during the same time period.

**Results**

Before we jump into the returns, here is a visualization of **how the most popular stocks have changed over the last year in WSB.**

https://reddit.com/link/qlscp1/video/t2ii3hjlgbx71/player

 *In case the visualization is not loading,* [*check it out here.*](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7685282/)

We would have made a grand total of 2,613 investments \[4\] in 2021 following this strategy. We would have lost money on more than 51% over the next week and more than 60% over the next month. But if you consider till date, we are slightly above 50%. If you compare this to SPY, its an extremely poor performance, as during the same period SPY would have given a positive return of 66% over one week, 76% over one month, and 100% Till Date (as SPY is trading at an all-time high now)

But, the stock market rewards predictions disproportionately \[5\]. Out of the 100 stocks you pick, even if you get 99 wrong but get one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still be extremely high (which is what WSB is aiming for - it’s definitely not for safe plays).

So, how has the average performance of WSB picks fared?

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/d4hwo3kngbx71.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6a3ef5cbe1cf152ae89981ea81c82ad035daf66)

Would you look at that! **WSB recommendations have hands down beaten SPY across all time periods.** It gave a 2% overperformance over the period of one week and 2.2% over one month and a whopping 6% if you had held on to your stocks.

But keep in mind that your performance is skewed towards a few stocks which got featured repeatedly in the top 10 list.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/9k19tq9ogbx71.png?width=715&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e3401b02342b1880922e094911dcdf1c75d00c3)

GME has been in the top10 discussed stocks in 100% of the days and on average you would have gained 73% if you invested in it every day. Both AMC and TSLA are close followers with both of them giving substantial returns. Among the other ones who have made the list repeatedly, only BB, CLOV, and WISH on average have lost money \[6\].

Now that our main question is out of the way, we can really do a deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns.

https://preview.redd.it/h1zt22jpgbx71.png?width=725&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c2fd19ce44a58f79c92473a5cab4a1908c1d0f8

Unsurprisingly, Gamestop and AMC are at the top of the pile with GME returning an insane 788% in one week. Even if you remove GME and AMC (due to the unlikely scenario of a short-squeeze), the other 3 stocks would have doubled your investment in one week. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/szf7uirqgbx71.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf59305c3719d840617a4fc81fc94938313497b3)

For every winner, there are bound to be losers. If you bought into GME at the top of the rally, you would have lost 73% of your investment in the next week. All the other companies on the list had a brief jump in popularity but folks who invested in that ended up holding the bag.

But what if you did not want to invest in 10 stocks every day. What if you only wanted to invest in the **top stock of the day** (ie, the one creating the most discussion)? Would you have beaten the market?

https://preview.redd.it/b1qn01irgbx71.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=02933cb4b8f3039b4088c98da4923ef049099aab

Unsurprisingly, you would have beaten the market by a wide margin. This is mainly due to the insane returns generated by GME, AMC, TSLA, etc. which came to the top of the list. You are just being rewarded for the high amount of risks you are taking by putting all your investment into a few stocks \[7\].  

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n2mtnnbjgbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=50e4f09865adc8c40f285c7eec6e24243ff2954b)

**Limitations**

There are some limitations to this analysis which you should be aware of

* As explained in footnote-1 there are 8-12 days of missing data - though this is not going to affect the results in any significant way as it’s lesser than 5% of the total days in the analysis.
* This analysis does not consider Options which is a big part of what WSB is made of. The returns from options can be wildly different from what we are observing in the case of buying stocks
* We have just considered the last year of data where it was predominantly a bull market and meme stocks have made insane rallies. The results might be different if we expand our time horizon.
* Finally, the above analysis only considers the chatter and not the sentiment about the stock. I would invest no matter if people are saying positive or negative things about the company. My hypothesis is that we would be able to generate more alpha if we can distinguish the sentiment in comments. A part-2 of this analysis incorporating sentiment is in the works — stay tuned!

**Conclusion**

Before starting the analysis, I fully expected to end it with

>The real returns were the friends we made and the fun we had along the way!

I was expecting that the chatter in WSB would be a lagging follower of the stock price rally and the people who invest in them would end up holding the bag.

But I was pleasantly surprised to see that on average the stock that made it to the trending list beat SPY in returns, that too ***across different time periods.***

Either it’s due to the self-fulfilling prophecy of stock price rallies leading to more chatter that will lead to more investments that will cause the stock to rally even more. Or it might just be that WSB is the place where we can successfully leverage the [Wisdom of crowds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wisdom-crowds.asp).

Whatever the case may be, you truly would need nerves of steel to keep holding on to a stock that rallies 700% in one week only to drop 70% in value next week and then finish net positive by the end of the year. For that, you are rewarded with market-beating returns!

**Footnotes**

\[1\] During the GME rally in January, the traffic was so high that the VM failed. I have used Pushshift to fill in the details wherever possible, but keep in mind that there are 7-8 days of missing data from 28th Jan to 8th Feb and 4 days of missing data in April 2nd week.

\[2\] To find the most popular tickers I used a base of around 9,000 stock tickers that I got from IEX cloud. The program would flag if any of these tickers were present in a comment or post. This is by far the most data-intensive exercise I have done. if you hypothetically consider the loop as a cross join, we processed more than 200 Billion rows to find the most popular tickers.

\[3\] If SPY was in the top 10 tickers, we would invest in that as well. I feel that this would slightly reduce our risk profile.

\[4\] It’s lesser than the expected 2,900 investments as there are some days in between where we had data loss (footnote 1) and also some stocks got delisted or underwent mergers (eg. Aphira) due to which we could not get the financial data from Yahoo Finance.

\[5\] Take the classic example of Keith Gill (aka DFV). He at one point had a $50MM return using a 50K call option. Even if he had another 99 50K call options in other stocks which expired worthless, just this one right pick would have made him a net profit of $45MM. This phenomenon is known as [black swan farming](http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html).

\[6\] This is very surprising given the amount of risk we are taking investing in meme stocks. Also, in my mind, you cannot complain about the skew towards a few stocks as it’s bound to happen. Even in the case of S&P500, a vast majority of returns are [driven by a few tech stocks](https://www.ajg.com/us/news-and-insights/2020/dec/s-p-500-index-top-heavy-tech-heavy/).

\[7\] The Beta of this portfolio would be through the roof and you beating the market is more probable as we are in a rally. Remember, [what Beta giveth, Beta can take it away](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) just as easily.

Their phones are becoming commodities with negligible upgrades, the prices are comming down, their eco system is under threat with a recent court ruling regarding monopolistic pricing with apps on their closed eco system. Their long awaited ventue into into cars is too late to the party and still to far away, if they even get it off the ground.

The Pipes vs. the Hardware. By pipes, I mean verizon, at&t, and t-mobile.  They spend billions at auction to buy spectrum from the federal gov to send gsm, Lte, and cdma signals to your phone and now moving into the 5th generation. Appl provides the hardware, the carriers provide the pipes that bring it to the hardware.

The pipe carriers pay full price for Appl phones. Again, the carrier pays full price to appl for the phone.  Those prices you pay are subsidized by the carriers in the form of your 2yr contract. The carrier makes its money off the contract minus the amount it subsidizes to you the buyer. Thats why you get the subsidized price on your phone every 2ys on your contract with trade in. This is very lucrative  to both the carrier and to appl. A revolving 2yr annuity for the carrier, and short new purchase cycle for appl.

What if I told you appl is working on bypassing the carriers. Well, they are. They have already embedded in the 13 a qcom gx chip in addition to the development of the m1 that uses mvno tech to use multiple carriers at the same time. Goggle is already using this with google-fi in their own eco system.  Appl is already beta testing it's own version with the 13 in europe. This is just the first step. Appl is investing heavly in new satellite technologies to beam directly to your appl phone. There are those who say the speed is too slow and this can only be used in rual area's and in emergencies with no coverage.Tell that to Musk and his new venture into satellites.This technology is comming sooner than you think.I believe this is comming. The money that verizon, att, and t-mobile make, prints into the 100's of billions. Imagine if appl takes even a quarter of this away from each of them. Will appl control it's own pipe, and be it's own carrier. I think it will or a least on a quasi level 8n the not too distant future,  and it's printing gobs of money now while I wait. That's why I'm long. Thanks for reading. Good luck with your trades and investments."

There has been a lot of bullish due diligence (DD) done on this ticker over the last year, and I'm going to compile some of the best here, without including other speculative DD which is convincing but not worthy of this post - where I will focus on the most solid DD.

Some quick overall background first...

**Microvast Description**Founded in 2006, Microvast is a technology leader that designs, develops and manufactures Li-ion batteries and materials. The company is renowned for its cutting-edge cell technology and its vertical integration capabilities which extends from core battery chemistry (cathode, anode, electrolyte, and separator) to battery packs. By integrating the process from raw material to system assembly, Microvast has developed a family of products covering a broad breadth of market applications. Microvast’s batteries are integrated in more than 30,000 vehicles, running in 160 cities across 19 countries, and have traveled over 3.8 billion miles.

And now that you know what Microvast ($MVST) is, here are my top reasons / DDs on being bullish:

# #1 - ""In 2019, at the request of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Microvast began the process of establishing a Li-ion battery facility in the United States.""

Suncor (SU.TO, SU) did too and now it’s the easiest win of all time 🚀🚀",62,35,2021-10-30 11:30:04,"https://www.suncor.com/en-ca

I’m Canadian so all numbers are in CAD except oil price.

Positions: Feb/22 $34C, June/22 $34C, Jan/23 $40C

Pre Covid Suncor was $42, dividend $0.42/quarter and oil $60/barrel

Now Suncor is $32, just announced this week $0.42 dividend is back and oil $83/barrel

Suncor Q3 results announced yesterday were amazing. Almost 700k bpd production at nearly $74us/barrel brought in $4.5 billion CAD cash flow. That’s 9% of the market cap earned in cash in ONE quarter. $2 billion went to paying down the $15 billion debt, $704 million share buy backs and $309 million dividends and announced doubling the dividend to pre Covid level of $0.42!

The current share price provides a 5.15% dividend return. Boomers and hedgies LOVE big dividends and will be buying hard. SU will be on every list for folks that google high dividend stocks until the SP rises to $42/ drops to 4% yield.

Suncor has been buying back shares nearly all year at approx 2 million shares/week. They increased the NCIB expiring feb 7th to 7% of float. To meet this goal buy backs will have to increase to 3 million shares/week.

Oil price averaged $82 in October, $8 higher than these Q3 numbers. Assuming this average holds in a currently ultra bullish environment we can expect $600mil MORE cash flow in Q4.

Currently 26 million shorts. They are fukt and will be adding to the slew of buyers.

Newly built Fort hills asset has been struggling to reach capacity and is announced to be working by end of this year. Expect Q1 2022 to pass 750,000 bpd.

And best of all it’s a boomer stock so options are cheap!! My feb $34’s were only $1.65!! Expect $40 by the dividend date in December. I’m playing even longer dates to see Q4/Q1.22 results. They will be huge and possibility of oil shortage in that time frame."

qimm2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qimm2r/the_current_state_of_the_shipping_industry/,The current state of the shipping industry,786,521,2021-10-30 05:16:56,"Hi everyone, I currently work in the shipping industry and would like to give you some insight about what's going on in Long Beach right now, and how Biden's imposed ""emergency fee"" to alleviate congestion is actually making things worse. I hope this provides some of you with useful information. 

Here's some background for those of you unfamiliar with ocean imports. When vessels come to Long Beach port, the containers are unloaded and delivered to the terminal. From there, containers are either delivered to CFS (container freight station) for unloading, or the entire container is delivered to the customer that purchased the goods. 

Right now, containers are stuck in the terminal unable to be delivered to CFS or to the customer's warehouse. This is due to a lack of truck drivers and chassis (equipment used to transport containers). Not only is this bad because customers can't get their goods, but there is also something called a ""last free date"" which is the date by which the importer has to get the container out of the terminal. If the importer is unable to get the container out by the last free date, shipping lines will charge importers significant extra charges (called demurrage charges) for each day that the container isn't picked up (usually $200-350 per day, depending on the shipping line). Well, since there is a lack of truck drivers and equipment, there is literally no way to get the containers out of the terminal. Every day that goes by, charges are being added onto shipments, which ultimately ends up on an invoice billed to the customer. Some demurrage charges are able to be contested and refunded, but a refund does not always happen. 

That isn't the worst part. Biden recently began imposing an ""emergency fee"" onto shipping lines to help combat port congestion. But guess what? Shipping lines are recently announced that they are going to start billing importers somewhere around $150 per cubic meter in additional fees. To put this into perspective, a 40 foot container, lets say has 60cbm of goods, will be charged an extra $9000 by shipping lines. Biden's emergency fee literally does nothing to address port congestion, and actually makes things WORSE.

Here's what I'm afraid of. When demurrage charges get so high, customers could simply choose abandon their goods at the terminal. The cost of demurrage and other stupid fees could EASILY surpass the value of the actual goods. Why would a customer want to pay more than the goods of the shipment to have the shipment released to them? This poses a huge risk to shipping lines, importers, and everyone involved in the shipping industry right now. Also, don't get me started on per diem (for those of you interested, just Google it, it's an additional fee resulting in customers being unable to return their containers back to the terminal in time)

The amount of fees piling on that will ultimately land on consumers, combined with the demand for goods, is honestly kind of scary, and I have no idea how this is going to end if we don't get some kind of divine intervention ASAP.

tldr; bad things are brewing in the shipping industry right now, and it has only been getting worse."

Why I think you will see massive institutional volume this morning and how you can benefit (FB Oct 29 330 Calls),61,62,2021-10-29 20:40:01,"I made a post yesterday but forgot to post position and got deleted, so first and foremost

They currently sit at 50 cents premarket.

Wednesday morning you saw massive Bull volume entering Google, despite only being up 1% premarket off strong earnings. Initial volume trading institutions to jump in and pump Goog to new all time high. 

https://preview.redd.it/f6c0705wrdw71.png?width=507&format=png&auto=webp&s=674029e01b66d8bd8dc46e575cc3f44c67024193

Yesterday we saw SHOP down premarket off mediocre earnings, and when SHOP bulls jumped in buying the dip, that triggered institutions to pour volume in, pumping off **1328** low all the way up to  **1504** high in less than 90 minutes. Oct 29th calls went from .25 cents to **22.75**.

I believe we are going to see the same today with FB, especially with Cathie Wood Jumping in. FB has been beaten up over the last 2 months and has dropped from and ATH of **382** and now sits at **320** premarket. Bull volume will be pilling in and will fill the quick drop from $**340**. If this happens, **OCT 29th 330** calls will go from **.50 to over $10. 20-1 risk to reward.** I am further convinced of this with AMZN and AAPL earnings misses, institutional money will flow into Greener pastures. 

I think longer term options are a great play as well, but I think todays calls is the best risk to reward based on previous patterns observed this week.

I am not a financial advisor, this is just my opinion, do you own DD and join me in the METAverse with the Zuckerbot."

# [Dow futures edge higher a day after hitting another record](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/26/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock index futures nudged higher during early morning trading on Wednesday after the Dow and S&P closed at record highs as earnings season continues.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 33 points. S&P 500 futures were off flat while Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 20 points.
*****
> During regular trading Tuesday, the Dow advanced roughly 15 points to end the day at an all-time high. It was the 30-stock benchmark’s third straight day of gains and fifth positive session in the last six. Earlier in the session the Dow had jumped about 150 points to also hit a record intraday high.
*****
> The S&P gained 0.18% for its ninth positive session in the last ten, and also hit both a record intraday and closing high. It was the benchmark index’s 70th intraday high of 2021, and 57th record closing of the year.
*****
> The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.06% for its third positive session in four. Facebook weighed on the tech-heavy index, with shares of the social media company dipping 3.9%.
*****
> Microsoft and Alphabet were among the headline reports Tuesday after the market closed, with both topping revenue expectations. Microsoft shares rose 2.3% in premarket trading.
*****
> Texas Instruments shares tumbled 4% premarket after the company missed revenue estimates while Visa fell 2.5% despite beating on the top and bottom lines. Enphase Energy leaped 12.7% after reporting record revenue in face of supply chain headwinds.
*****
> Coca-Cola rose 2.6% premarket after the company posted a beat on the top and bottom lines and raised its outlook, saying the business was getting stronger particularly in areas where the Covid recovery has been the best.
*****
> “This earnings season has been about pricing momentum and whether consumers are able to handle surging costs,” noted Ed Moya, senior analyst at Oanda. “So far it seems the consumer can handle it,” he added.
*****
> So far roughly 30% of the S&P 500 has reported earnings. Of the names that have posted quarterly updates, 82% have topped earnings expectations, while 80% have exceeded revenue estimates. Strong results have been key to pushing the major averages to new highs.
*****
> “We see signs that there could be more gains to come in the final two months of the year,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial. “Seasonal tailwinds, improving market internals, and clear signs of a peak in the Delta variant all provide potential fuel for equities heading into year-end, and we maintain our overweight equities recommendation as a result.”
*****
> Robinhood shares were getting slammed, down 11% the day after the trading app reported revenue well below expectations primarily due to weakness in trading.
*****
> A busy earnings week continues on Wednesday with Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Bristol-Myers, Boeing, General Motors and Harley-Davidson among the names on deck before the market opens. Ford, eBay and Yum China will provide quarterly updates after the market closes.
*****
> On the economic front, U.S. durable goods order data will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET.

qge5g8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qge5g8/amd_q3_earnings_predictions/,AMD Q3 Earnings Predictions,22,28,2021-10-27 03:29:11,"There has been a lot of developments in [$AMD – Advanced Micro Devices stock](https://utradea.com/positions/AMD-Stock-Investment-Update-and-Earnings-Prediction), since I last covered them on June 21st. My previous coverage was my initial coverage of their company, and gives an outline of their whole company, financials, and other important information, which can be found [here](https://utradea.com/positions/AMD-is-a-fantastic-investment-idea). However, this analysis is not going to repeat this, rather it is designed to update you with recent news, events, and SEC filings to stay up to date on AMD’s stock.

**SEC Filings:**

Recently, there have only been 2 noteworthy SEC filings, which are:

*Current Report (8-K):*

On October 26, 2020. AMD entered into a merger plan with Xilinx Inc., making Xilinx a subsidiary of AMD. This merger proposal was officially passed by the UK Competition and Markets Authority on June 29th, making Xilinx an official subsidiary of AMD.

*Quarterly Report (10-Q):*

On July 27th 2021, AMD released their Q2 2021 financial results. Overall AMD beat their earnings estimates by over 16%, and they raised their guidance. Both of these factors are bullish and assisted in AMD closing 7.5% higher on the trading day following this earnings release.

The most important factors from this report were that AMD increased revenues 100% YoY (12% QoQ), increased their gross margin by 4 percentage points YoY (2 percentage points QoQ), had a massive increase in their operating incomes and net incomes both YoY and QoQ, and lastly, they announces a $4B share repurchase program.

**Recent News:**

*Windows 11 Updates:*

Recently, Windows 11 has released an update which has slowed the performance of AMD’s CPU’s. AMD is looking into their slower performance with this update and said that they are aiming to fix this problem by the end of the month (October 31st 2021). However, if these problems persist, many people may switch over to another brand of CPU’s (ie. Intel). This will not only cost AMD revenues, but it will be giving those revenues to AMD’s direct competitors.

*AMD Stock Performance:*

Overall, AMD has performed very well since my coverage and is up nearly 50% since my post. There have been a lot of catalysts over this time frame that have led AMD to have sustained such large growth over the past 4 months. Firstly, AMD beat earnings and raised their guidance, which immediately boosted the stock 7.5%. Furthermore, AMD has gained partnerships with elite companies including Tesla and Google.

Q3 2021 Earnings:

AMD is reporting their earnings today (October 26, 2021) after market close. This is sure to be a catalyst for movement in their stock. In the next section I will give my earnings estimate and how I would play it.

**Earnings Estimate:**

I am trying to get this out quickly, so I do not have time to take you through my reasoning for my earnings predictions.

*Revenues:*

I think that AMD will report quarterly revenues of $4.4B, which is 7% higher than AMD guidance suggested, and 7% higher than the average analyst earnings estimate of $4.12B. I think that the growth in their revenues will be the cause of a large growth in their data center revenues.

*EPS:*

I believe that AMD’s EPS (based on my revenue projection) will be $0.72/share, which would indicate an earnings beat of 7.5%.

Overall, I think that AMD is going to beat earnings, but by a relatively small margin. However, it is difficult to predict how the market will react to this. As a result of this, I am taking a more neutral and safe approach through a bull call spread of 126/132. This would cap your losses at $174/bull call spread, and yield a max gain of $426/bull-call spread."

I’m posting it today since I already typed it up, but I can’t predict how Peloton will move in the next week. Take your positions early at your own risk.

Note on quarters: Peloton’s financial quarter differs from our calendar. Their upcoming report will be for Q1 2022, covering July – September 2021. When I refer to their “full-year guidance”, this covers the months July 2021 – June 2022.

**Situation:**

Peloton is a Covid stock darling that has retraced significantly from its ATH. Their report for Q4 2021 (covering April – June 2021) could be considered their first post-Covid earnings report, and disappointed the market. Based on the guidance they provided, I think they will also underperform the lowered expectations in this quarter, and cut full-year guidance.

**Peloton business:**

Peloton earns money in two main ways: Selling low-margin hardware like their Bike and Tread (70% of revenue) and selling high-margin subscriptions to their library of workout videos (30% of revenue).

Peloton has two types of subscribers: Connected Fitness (CF) subscribers (those who own a Bike or Tread) who pay USD \~40 per month, and digital subscribers (those who only use the app) who pay \~USD 10 per month. The former type is far more important for their revenue and profits, although the digital subscribers are considered an important acquisition funnel for future CF subscribers.

**Peloton gives optimistic guidance for 2022:**

On their most recent earnings call, Peloton gave a few pointers to their expected full year performance. I’m going to use these to triangulate expectations for subscription revenue and hardware revenue for the full year.

Here are the cold hard expectations we know from management: full-year revenue of 5.4 billion (800 million in Q1), 3.63 million Connected Fitness subscribers (2.47m in Q1). On the call they indicated that they expect Q2 and Q3 combined to be 60% of their annual revenue.

Based on this I constructed the following table. Numbers in black are given by management, numbers in blue are my deductions/triangulations.

In this context I think it’s interesting to look at Hardware revenue over time, starting January 2020, their last “pre-covid” quarter.

Orange: upcoming quarter; green: future FY 2022 quarters

This chart reveals something interesting: while Peloton expects relatively weak sales in the upcoming quarter (17% y-o-y decrease) they assume that ALL THREE future quarters will significantly outperform the respective quarter from 2020 (covid year) in order to hit their full-year guidance. In total, they expect hardware revenue from October 2021 – June 2022 to increase 34% compared to the period from October 2020 – June 2021. Considering the they just decreased the price of their flagship Bike by 20%, this implies that they will sell **40-50% MORE** units this upcoming year than they did during the Covid year. I’m not a scientist but I find this staggeringly unlikely. In the next chapter I’m going to show a few data points that bolster my disbelief in this bold guidance.

**I don’t think they’re going to hit these guidance numbers, guys**

App downloads

Peloton’s app downloads show a tale of two cities. On the “top grossing” chart (= how many people sign up for Peloton subscriptions through Apple), Peloton has been extremely steady for 1 year. This is a proxy for existing subscribers. The numbers reflect the extremely high satisfaction of existing subscribers and their fantastically low churn (significantly below 1% per month). People who signed up for Peloton during Covid don’t seem to be quitting. So far so good.

&#x200B;

The “free chart” (how many people download the app) shows a very different picture. This is a proxy for  new subscribers and new hardware sales. This number unsurprisingly peaked in April 2020 and was strong through 2020 due to Covid. It absolutely nosedived in April 2021 (right around the time vaccines became widely available in NY and California, two of Peloton’s biggest markets). Since then, Peloton has almost completely dropped off the app charts, meaning that they are acquiring very few new users. Everyone who buys Peloton hardware is all but required to also download the app on their phone. Remember how they expect future hardware sales to be much higher than they were during 2020? Hmmmm.

&#x200B;

Subscriber additions

Net Digital subscriber additions (those who use the app but don’t own hardware) were negative in the most recent quarter, for the first time since Peloton went public. Peloton considers this an important funnel for customer acquisition – if the number of people trying out their digital subscription decreases, you’d logically also expect the number of people buying hardware to decrease.

&#x200B;

Reddit follower additions

The biggest Peloton subreddit is adding fewer and fewer subscribers this year, compared to 2020. Kind of the opposite of what you’d expect from a company that wants to sell more hardware than ever before.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lye47ui7buv71.png?width=716&format=png&auto=webp&s=69a5b3391b2eb76488b0360854ebe4901aac9223

Tread popularity

Despite the infamous safety incidents in 2021, Peloton has been pushing the Tread very hard, acting as if it will become as popular as their Bike and even claiming that many people who already own a bike would buy a Tread \*in addition\*. The numbers speak a different language. The share of running classes (black color) taken decreased significantly in FY 2021 – this despite the fact that anyone can take a running class, even if they don't own the hardware.

&#x200B;

High inventory, low customer deposits

During 2020, Peloton sold essentially every singe bike they were able to produce, and customers had to wait up to 3 months for delivery. This has moderated \*significantly\* in the most recent quarter. Customer deposits (money received from customers for hardware that wasn’t delivered yet) was at an all-time low. This indicates a significant relaxation in demand. Peloton significantly increased their supply chain ability during Covid, and it looks to me like they overinvested. In 2020 there was a huge rush to grab one of their products. In 2021, you can basically order one and get it delivered almost immediately. Given this relaxation in demand, I find it very unlikely that they would be able to actually deliver more product than last year

https://preview.redd.it/16fmynebbuv71.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfd45634f2586cd7fb9b281fb80838a40672bd12

&#x200B;

**Summary**

Peloton has lofty goals for 2022 and I don’t think they can fulfill them. Existing subscribers are clearly extremely happy and stick with them (I’m one of them), but they are having big trouble expanding to new customers outside of the coastal elites. Even in other “rich” countries like Australia and Germany, Google Trends and app download data point towards significant demand decrease after an initial period of hype, despite costly marketing campaigns (including TV ads during prime time).

While Peloton is still valued like a growth stock (\~6 P/S ratio, despite not expecting to be profitable until 2023), I think expectations are too high. I expect them to cut full-year guidance during the next earnings call, leading the stock to tank.

Germans know how to manufacture cars but they are too rigid for adapt change in technology. They have been giving lip service to EVs for 6 years and so far they have too little to show for 6 years of so called pursuing EV strategy. Remember BMW i3?

**A word about Europe. In many ways Europeans care about the environment more so than people elsewhere. People there see EVs as the new hot thing while in US there are some people/politicians who are less open minded to EVs.

**Apple is the elephant in the room that no one talks about. My bet is that Apple will buy one of the smaller EV manufacturers (not the Chines ones) when they roll out their AppleCar (iCar?, iAuto?). Apple is flush with cash and bitter that it missed buying Netflix. They already sell computers, phones, and ear phones. The next product line for them to add is clearly cars and as Elon has mentioned Apple is working on EVs. Apple had approached Hyundai but that deal is dead; I can't remember the second company they approached for takeover.**

I have seen a Lucid Air, Polestar 2, and obviously many Teslas. They are all amazing cars and I prefer them to my BMW, my father's Porsche, or my mom's Mercedes (low key showing off). I would even argue that current EVs are far superior in performance and creature comfort than super cars.

**My EV investing is focused on global companies with heavy European representation who can be good takeover targets for Apple, Alphabet/Waymo, .... I dislike Chinese companies because of the political risk as we saw in the past few month. Tesla is an awesome choice but it is too large to generate alpha that the smaller EV players may generate. I imagine a future where Apple/Google is FOMOing in autos, bringing out their version of self-drive, and competing with Uber/Lyft. We are one year away from massive merger and acquisitions in this space.**

**Introduction:**

For anyone that points out that DWAC/TMTG/future combined entity is pre-revenue, then you're absolutely right. But this stock obviously is not about revenue now, but downstream profit potential. Obviously, any projection of this sort into the future is subject to a great deal of uncertainty, but I will do my best to quantify future prospects.

As a bit of backdrop, the whole merger process with SPACs is a bit complicated, but roughly current stock prices imply a value of $8B. Warrant prices imply a value of a bit less than $4B.

**Overview of major business segments:**

First, let us look at some of the potential segments of DWAC as a business:

* Social media. The SEC filing announcing DWAC/TMTG merger specifically mentions Truth Social by name. Within Truth Social, we could see multiple elements.  

   * A broad based social network (as an alternative to Facebook, cap \~$1T)
   * A microblogging service (as an alternative to Twitter, cap \~$50B)
   * A video hosting service (as an alternative to YouTube, part of Alphabet/Google but reasonable estimate of $500B value added). (Some thought DWAC/TMTG may acquire Rumble and could be announced tomorrow, but could be some other announcement by Rumble.)
* Streaming media/video on demand service. The SEC filing mentions specifically mentions a product titled TMTG+.

**Social Media deep dive:**

Let's begin breaking down a few things. Facebook has \~260M monthly active users in the US and Canada and 2.9B worldwide. Many of the worldwide customers are significantly less valuable, and the US/Canada market was responsible for nearly half of 2020 revenue. Likely, the margins are slightly higher in the US because it is wealthier than most. As a rough estimate, FB's North American portion of the business is currently valued at around $600B (of it's total $1T market cap).

Twitter recently announced it had 206 million ""monetizable daily active users"" (not children) world wide. 25% of these, or 51 million are US based. The most recent data I have is Q1 2021, which shows about half of Twitter revenue is US based. In other words, Twitter's \~50M monetizable users in the US contribute to a company worth roughly $25B.

These numbers fall in line with Metcalfe's Law, which states the value of a network is roughly proportional to the square of the number of users. Because FB has roughly 5 times as many users in North America than Twitter, than it should be worth about 25 times as much. $600B/$25B = 24, so we are pretty close here.

So what's this all mean? Let's run some scenarios. Suppose Truth Social is a free to use platform. The US and Canada populations are, combined, around 370M. Let's suppose for now 10% of this population uses the platform on a regular basis. I think this is conservative, as about half lean conservative, so this would imply one fifth of the target market engaged. If we apply Metcalfe's Law, we get to a value of (37/50)\^2 \* $25B = $13.7B. If 20%, rather than 10%, the value goes up not two-fold, but four-fold to $54.8B. If 25% (half of right of center), this pops to $85.625B.

Keep in mind the above is values are ignoring conservative/populist movements in other countries which may provide additional revenues. Brazil (population > 200M) is a huge market with a populist Trump ally, and the CFO of DWAC is Brazilian. There exists a sizable populist segment in Europe, especially in eastern Europe as well.

Critique 1: ""They don't have that kind of userbase yet.""

Response: Absolutely true, and there is execution risk. However, current market values are significantly below long run potential. Personally, I think it is reasonable that 20% of America will be active, but discounting at 15% per year with 3 years to ramp, that is $54.8B/(1.15\^3) = $36B current value.

Critique 2: ""Advertisers will not want to advertise on the platform.""

Response: That may be true to some extent, but companies still mostly care about $$$. Even if some advertisers refuse to use the platform those who use the platform may be met with higher engagement from users, who see a company that possesses similar values to them.

One last thought on the social media front: a monthly subscription as an ad-free alternative may be possible.

**Streaming Media/On Demand deep dive:**

To begin, I think it is helpful to present some numbers of other streaming services.

* Netflix, the behemoth, has 214M paid monthly subscribers. As of Sep 2021, annualized revenue is $30B. That comes out to $12 per user per month worldwide. The US figure may be closer to $15/month average.
* Disney+ had 116M paid monthly users (and growing) as of July.
* Discovery+ bundle has 18 million paid monthly users.
* Peacock (NBC Universal) has 54 million users, with nearly 5 million using the premium (ad-free) version, with the other opting for the ad-filled version.

What is the point? People are becoming much more comfortable with paying for a bundle of content they care about. Let's run some hypotheticals:

* $15/month for streaming bundle
* 20 million subscribers (about 5% of US/Canada or 10% of conservatives)

The above results in $144/year \* 15 million = $3.60B of streaming revenue annually. Keep in mind, the type of content here is not likely to be extremely expensive to produce, like Netflix's huge investments. Suppose this can be produced at $1.5B. That's $2.1B in profit that that segment alone. A $2.1B profit. If it can expand at 3% per year from there with a cost of capital of 10%, that segment would be valued at $2.1B/(10%-3%) = $30B.

Obviously, we are not there yet. And risk to get there is large, but even discounting it by 15% per year for 3 years, we get $19.72B

**Total Value and Current Stock/Warrant Price:**

The above gives the two primary segments a present value of $36B and $19.72B, totaling $55.72B. Even if you think I am being exceptionally generous and you think the company is worth 5 times less today ($11.14B), then the stock right now (valuation of $8B) is still 39% undervalued. Even if you think I am overvaluing the company by 10 times, then a $5.572B valuation (compared to $4B warrant), then warrants are undervalued by 40%.

**The Trump Card:**

The final element here is to point out the obvious. There are 80 million Trump voters, over 100M Trump supporters, and tens of millions of other, who might not like Trump, but are tired of big tech censorship and monopolistic behaviors. Trump is a unique figure who has the capacity to funnel that energy and support to a particular business venture. His megaphone is unrivaled. Many of his supporters are supremely loyal and would subscribe, even while the product is unpolished, to show support to a movement.

**Tl;dr:**

There is a legitimate case that the long-run prospects of DWAC/TMTG is massively undervalued."

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Jetblue is inefficiently priced.** Historically Jetblue moves roughly **4%** post earnings (inline with all the other American airlines),  yet this quarter, the options are pricing in a move of roughly **10%**. If we sell straddles or strangles, we can collect this extremely inflated premium with very little risk on our end. I looked into the entire sector as a whole since I planned on trading it last week, and I came across nothing that would’ve fundamentally caused this spike in volatility in airlines, or Jetblue specifically. The odds are awesome on this trade, and I plan or robbing some gamblers next week. For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)

&nbsp;

- **Twitter is inefficiently priced. Avoid it.** Historical move of **6.5%**, priced move of **11%** - on paper, this trade gives us insane edge, but I’m still not touching it, as we saw what happened with $SNAP on Thursday. Although Twitter dropped 5% as the market tried to price $AAPL’s privacy policy in, I don’t feel like taking on additional risk because the fundamentals have shifted right before its’ earnings. Normally I would take this trade 10/10 times simply from a pure numbers standpoint, but I’m not as confident anymore because of the added volatility created by $SNAP. 

&nbsp;

- **Oil stocks tend to experience Post Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD).** PEAD is the phenomenon where a stocks price will drift in the direction of an earnings surprise for several weeks following an earnings announcement. If a stock beats, it will continue to grind up for weeks following the ER report, and vice versa if it misses. This is especially true among oil stocks - check the charts if you don’t believe me. The best way to play oil this quarter would be to capitalize on this effect, and do **monthly** call or put debit spreads based on the results that come out Friday. To those curious, standard weekly options provide no edge at the time of writing, so it’s best not to gamble this time round.

&nbsp;

- **Collateral Plays are your friend!** If you’re bullish on big tech, look to long $QQQ this week to alter your risk exposure and bag some safer gains. If you’re bearish on oil, look to short $XLE instead of any of the individual companies for an added safety net. If you think $AMD is gonna knock it out of the park, look to play $NVDA or $SOXL instead. There’s lot’s of opportunities for collateral plays this week, and I’ve just barely scratched the surface. If you wish to learn more about collateral plays, refer to [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

#Summary and Conclusion

We've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly!  If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me!

So why is this company so exciting? Here’s a brief overview.

WHAT DO THEY DO?

Desktop Metal operate in additive manufacturing (i.e. 3D printing) in almost every area you can imagine, and the company’s technology is protected by over 300 patents with further pending. The company itself originated from the 3D printing of metal products, and their machines are designed to be **faster, smaller, cheaper, safer and without needing a trained operator.**
However, the company has also made some high-profile acquisitions to further diversify and expand their consumer base. 

They have acquired Aidro, who specialise in the design and production of **valves, manifolds, hydraulic components in the creation of fluid power systems**. *(Think aerospace, oil and gas, agriculture)*

Also, the acquisition of Aerosint and its technology means that **the powder deposit system in their printers is greatly improved, speeding up production of a wide range of polymers, metals and ceramics by up to 100x**. *(Think everything from small components, large components, to whole products, and entire buildings). 

Additionally, the acquisition of Adaptive3D and their printable materials further expand and optimise the manufacturing of plastic and rubber products. 

The company also acquired EnvisionTEC and their photosensitive polymer technology *(plastics whose properties change with light)* and bio-fabrication in the areas of orthodontics and orthopaedics mainly. Additionally to this, the acquisition of Beacon Bio has further opened the door to biotech through the development of **regenerative medicine techniques, being able to print new skin, arteries, teeth, ears, and an unfathomable array of other tissues**. These two acquisitions led to the launch of Desktop Health, focussing on dentistry, dermatology, orthopaedics, plastic surgery and regenerative tissues.

Most recently, the company announced the **acquisition of ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE), one of their main competitors** and until recently the #1 stock in ARK Invest’s ETF. They also hold a stake in Shapeways after their IPO. 

Desktop Metal also have brought forward **Forust**, which aims to create **sustainable and high-volume 3D printing of genuine wood products through the recycling of existing/scrap wood **and separating the components (cellulose/sawdust and lignin) before reintegrating them in the printing process, addressing a $1.3T 

In addition to all of these acquisitions, DM also inherit existing relationships and clients of these subsidiaries, as well as **having their own distribution chain in over 65 countries**. It’s also key to note that the digital nature of CAD and 3D printing means that **overall manufacturing efficiency and costs come down** as there is limited room for error and potentially zero fees from importing materials and components across borders. 

BACKERS AND CONSUMERS

The company is backed by many very prominent names, such as Google, BMW, General Electric, Lowe’s, Saudi Aramco, Caterpillar, ARK Invest, Chamath Palihapitiya (to name a few), and features consumers such as Amazon, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Goodyear, Continental, Michelin, Boston Scientific, LG, Ford, Nissan, Hyundai, Smile Direct Club, Adidas, Bosch, Medtronic, Cartier amongst many other notable clients. The upside is also that the percentage of these sales is not especially focussed, and so **DM’s success does not rely too heavily on any one company’s commitment to their products**. They also upsell the services relating to product maintenance. 

FINANCIALS

Since 2015, the company has accumulated some $711.8M in funding, the most recent being the result of a SPAC merger - initially valuing the company at $2.5B. The company’s market cap currently sits at around $1.8B, while their **assets to liabilities are $1.02B and $59M, respectively**. Revenue was up 68% 2021Q1 to 2021Q2 totalling $19M, and nearly an 800% increase from 2020Q2. The company is also forecasting revenue of $100M for 2021 alone, which is expected to grow by 88% in 2022 by analysts’ consensus. While the company is generating losses, the revenue and consumer growth is undeniable and the company is particularly well positioned by their balance sheet compared to the competition and focussing on both organic growth and strategic acquisitions to attain exponential growth compared to their main rival 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), to who there is an argument for comparatively decreased upside potential. 

STOCK

As a whole, the 3D printing market is expected to grow from $12B to $150B by the end of the decade, and **even a 5% market share would result in an annual income of around $7.5B and growing as well as a stock price around $130**. The company is trading at a P/S in the high teens which isn’t exactly unreasonable in current market conditions, and I believe the company is fundamentally undervalued after being beaten down from an all-time high of $34.94 in February to a low of $6.82 in the past month. **The stock currently trades at $7.02, and average analyst estimates place this as over $10, with $30 on the high end**. It currently appears to be moving out of the medium-term downtrend with a variety of positive indicators which may present a solid buying opportunity. 

I feel quite certain that Desktop Metal will become the market leader of a huge TAM if they can maintain their current trajectory, despite sacrificing near-term profitability in favour of strong investment and one of the biggest growth stories of the next decade. I’ve found it quite challenging to wrap my head around the sheer scope of this technology, and  after watching patiently and investigating the competition I believe DM is the standout. 
I am currently DCAing into this stock while it remains under $8, which I believe to be fair value (and perhaps significantly undervalued in current market conditions). What are your views?😊"

Well, here we are.. and I say to you, “What is the Metaverse, anyway?” I'd like to argue ROBLOX ($RBLX) is going to be the leading force in this industry. Let me state some facts:

1. Roblox increased it's engagement FROM 2.1 billion hours in Q1 2018 TO 9.73 billion hours in Q2 2021. Are you fucking kidding me? This is more time than people spend on Youtube, Facebook, and Instagram.
2. Speaking of engagement, that's over 2.5 hours per day per user.
3. In Q1 of 2018 they rolled in 59.72M in revenue. Most recently in Q2 of 2021, their revenue is 454.1M. That's a 660% increase in 3 years.
4. There are over 40 million games on ROBLOX, created by over 9.5 million developers.
5. 83% of users on Roblox are under 25 years old. Most of which are still eatin tendies and being introduced into forums like WSB. Prime age demographic to evolve these chimps into apes.

IMO, the metaverse is going to be the breakthrough consumer technology we'll see in the next decade that bridges the gap to a new digital frontier.. The great “wild west” much like the internet was pre-2k.

This shit gets me excited. I like this stock.

&nbsp;

What’s poppin bull gang, Flux here with a detailed writeup of one of my personal earnings trading strategies! When looking to play earnings, the average trader just picks a random strike, buys a binary option, and hopes for the best. Absolutely no time is spent looking for the optimal strike, or analyzing if the option itself carries a reward proportional to the risk you’re taking on. No strategy is employed whatsoever. After inevitably getting blown out, they complain about how earnings is rigged, and it’s basically like gambling. Although true, given that you know how to spot inefficiently priced options, you can gamble with edge, and ultimately come out ahead more often. Think of it like card counting - you’re still gambling, but with significantly better odds.

# The Beauty of the Straddle

If you’ve been keeping up with my [Historical Post Earnings Moves Spreadsheets,](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog) I’m sure you’ve come to realize that I ***love*** my straddles and strangles. These option strategies don’t care about the direction of a given move, but the magnitude of the move instead. Straddles and strangles are perfect for earnings plays because the moves are big, and the directional of them is usually random. Binary calls and puts pale in comparison to the power of a straddle, simply due to it’s massive coverage. Gone are the days of losing an entire investment simply because you misjudged the direction of a move. That being said, straddles can be ***expensive***. You can’t just go around buying straddles and strangles on everything. Options around earnings are often priced efficiently, meaning that you’d be taking on a risk proportional exactly to that of the reward. Since **options is a zero sum game**, you would eventually come all the way back to square one - your initial investment. No more, no less. As a result, in order to generate consistent profits, we need to be smart when employing this strategy.

&nbsp;

# Pricing Inefficiencies

In order to consistently trade straddles around earnings, we need to look for pricing inefficiencies. These can be identified through a variety of means, but the easiest way (and my personal favorite) is to look to the historical post earnings moves. By looking at the ***magnitude*** of the average move post earnings in relation to the move that the options chain is currently pricing, we can easily identify if we have an edge in any given trade. Let’s look at an example.

&nbsp;

**Let’s say that historically, on average, stock $ABC moves 5% post earnings.** However, this earnings season, the options chain is pricing a 2.5% move for $ABC. I’ll take this trade 10/10 times, since I know that on average, $ABC moves 5% post earnings. The options are inefficiently priced relative to the historical move of $ABC, and as a result, I have an insane edge in this trade. **With this pricing structure, if I run a straddle on $ABC, on average, I will double my money.** I know this situation sounds a little too good to be true, but I’ve actually ran into this exact scenario a handful of times throughout earnings season.

&nbsp;

**The same is true on the flipside.** If $ABC moves 5% historically on average, and the options chain is pricing a 5% move, I skip the trade. There’s no edge to be gained there as options are priced efficiently. The trade is zero sum. I will win the same amount of times that I lose, given that all other factors remain consistent.

&nbsp;

The trickiest part of these trades is figuring out the expected move that the options chain is pricing, and finding out the average historical post earnings move of a given stock. Luckily for you guys, calculating the expected move on any option chain can be done in 15 seconds, and I post the historical post earnings moves of all stocks on a weekly basis on Twitter, Discord, and my blog! 

&nbsp;

# Calculating the Expected Move

I’m looking to keep this as simple as possible, so I’ll be giving you the napkin math version. In short, the percent move needed to break even from an ATM straddle is the expected move the options chain is pricing in. In order to calculate the expected move of a given option (and thereby the entire chain), we need to take the price of an ATM Call and an ATM Put and then add them together. We then add this number to the current underlying stock price. From here, we can calculate the percent move needed to break even from the current underlying price, thereby finding the expected move of the given option. Let’s go through an example.

&nbsp;

$ABC is currently trading for $10. An $ABC 10C is trading for $1. An $ABC 10P is also trading for $1. 

We can add the value of our options up to get $2. We then add this number to the underlying stock price of $10.

1$ (Call Price) + $1 (Put Price) + $10 (Underlying Price) = $12

&nbsp;

From here, we calculate the percent gain needed to get from $10 to $12. I’ll save you the boring math, and tell you to google “percent gain calculator” and punch in the numbers. Most of the time you can also use basic head math to get a rough estimate of this number. In this case, in order to get from $10 to $12, we need a gain of 20%. Therefore, in our example, the options chain is pricing in an expected move of 20%. I feel like I made this simple concept overly complex, but y’all get the idea. 

&nbsp;

**TLDR** ; The percent move needed to break even from an ATM straddle is the expected move the options chain is pricing in.

&nbsp;

# Identifying Trading Opportunities

Now that you understand how to find the expected move of a given options chain, you can start to identify potential trading opportunities. **Whenever you see a scenario where the expected move is vastly different from a stock's given historical move, there is often a trading edge to be gained.** There’s three situations that you’ll find yourself faced with, thereby giving you three strategies you need to employ.

&nbsp;

- **1) Options are cheap relative to the historical post earnings move.** $ABC averages a 5% move, but options are only pricing a 2.5% move. In this situation, we want to buy a **long straddle** to capitalize on a large potential move. On average, you’ll double your money on this trade, as $ABC tends to move much more than the 2.5% the options chain is pricing.

&nbsp;

- **2) Options are expensive relative to the historical post earnings move.** $ABC averages a 5% move, but options are pricing a 10% move. Although riskier, we can opt to run a **short straddle** (or strangle) to capitalize on a smaller than expected move. On average, you’ll get to bag most, if not all of the premium you collect on this trade, since $ABC tends to move less than the 10% the options chain is pricing.

&nbsp;

- **3) Options are priced properly relative to the historical post earnings move.** This is the most common scenario. $ABC averages a 5% move, and options are also pricing a 5% move. There is no edge to be gained, therefore we just **skip this trade** and move onto the next one.

&nbsp;

Keep in mind that for situations one and two, your edge needs to be meaningful! If $ABC averages a 5% move, but options are pricing a 6% move, it may be in your best interest to skip the trade! Although you technically have some edge, it may not be enough to offset the potential risks you're taking on!

&nbsp;

# Finding Historical Post Earnings Moves

**This information is often paywalled, and you’d be hard pressed to find a consistent source for this data.** Luckily for you all, I put out this data free of charge across my various social platforms. You can consult any one of my free spreadsheets, and instantly find the historical post earnings move of any given stock. From there, you can take the absolute average move directly from the spreadsheet (I calculate this number for you guys too!) and compare it to the expected move that an options chain is pricing. You’ll quickly be able to see if there are any inefficiencies, and will therefore be able to make these trades for yourself! Feel free to check out my blog, or my socials if you wish to consistently receive this info on a week by week basis!

&nbsp;

# Trading Guide

This is a relatively straightforward process. **Once I find a pricing inefficiency, I throw on a long or short strangle an hour or so before market close during the trading session before the inefficient company reports.** I then sell or buy back the given strangle the following day. This trading strategy comes with many perks, my favourite of them being the consistent winners. On average, you will be making significantly more money than you lose. When you do inevitably lose, your losses will be shielded because all of your trades have a relatively large buffer. If a given historical move is 10%, with options pricing a 5% move, if I only get a 4% move, I get to keep more than 80% of my initial investment, meaning I get to live to trade another day.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

Find a pricing inefficiency. Throw on a straddle. Reap the rewards. It’s that simple! Obviously, this method is far from perfect, but I do hope that I inspired a handful of you to approach your earnings trades differently!

# [Dow futures jump 160 points as investors bet strong profits will continue to lift market](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures gained on Tuesday as major companies continued to report strong third-quarter earnings, easing concerns that persistent Covid cases and rising costs would derail corporate America’s profit recovery.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed about 164 points, or 0.5%. S&P 500 futures added 0.5% and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.4%.
*****
> The Dow and the S&P 500 come into Tuesday both sitting about 1% from record highs.
*****
> Dow member Travelers saw its shares gain more than 3% in the premarket after the insurance company’s quarterly earnings report topped expectations.
*****
> Fifth Third Bancorp shares ticked up in early morning trading after its profit and revenue beat Wall Street estimates.
*****
> Procter & Gamble continued the bullish trend with better-than-expected earnings, but its shares dipped more than 1% in premarket trading. The consumer products giant said it is raising prices to cover rising commodity and freight costs and warned that inflation may continue.
*****
> Johnson & Johnson also beat third-quarter earnings expectations by 25 cents per share, but saw its shares dip in early morning trading.
*****
> Elsewhere, Walmart shares gained around 2% in the premarket after Goldman Sachs added the big box retailer to its conviction buy list, saying the stock could rally nearly 40%.
*****
> As of Tuesday morning, 82% of S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings beat expectations, according to FactSet. Taking into account those reports and estimates for those to come, third-quarter profit growth will come in at 30%, according to FactSet.
*****
> Other major reports after the bell Tuesday include Netflix and United Airlines.
*****
> On Monday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite notched their fourth day of gains. The S&P 500 rose 0.34%. The Nasdaq was the relative outperformer, gaining 0.84% as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet all closed higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 36 points, dragged down by a 3% drop in Disney’s stock.
*****
> While reports have been strong, investors are looking for commentary from corporate America about supply chain issues and inflation.
*****
> “The financials got earnings season off to another strong start, but let’s be honest, COVID and supply chain issues aren’t going to impact this group. Now it gets very interesting to see what other industries will have to say about the health of the economic recovery,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.
*****
> Netflix could set the tone for technology earnings this season. Three months ago, the streaming giant forecasted paid net subscriber adds of 3.5 million, while analysts expect about 3.84 million, according to StreetAccount. Analysts are also forecasting fourth-quarter subscriber guidance of 8.5 million, which would be the highest outlook since the first quarter of 2019.
*****

*****
> Earnings from United Airlines should give investors a gauge on the travel recovery from the pandemic and Procter & Gamble earnings could show how strong the consumer is in the goods sector.
*****
> Stocks are coming off of a winning week but have been volatile since September. Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist Mike Wilson — who has been calling for a correction in the broader market — told clients on Monday that although fundamentals are deteriorating, the market seems to be resilient to a bigger pullback.
*****
> “Whether we end up getting this finishing move at the index level this year or not will depend largely on retail participation, the message that 3Q earnings brings from a guidance standpoint, and the path of PMIs into year end,” said Wilson.
*****
> Economic data from China weighed on investor sentiment after it reported low GDP and industrial production for September that fell short of expectations. Industrial production in the U.S. also fell for September as supply constraints continued to hinder manufacturing, the Federal Reserve reported Monday.

I am drunk and the wife sent me to the couch tonight so why not dabble in some random dd and speculate earnings on AMD  with some hosers like myself.  I am gonna add my 2 cents on AMD. Please keep in mind that I again am not an expert and I have lost money in the best bull
market in history. I am degenerate who has been playing weekly’s on AMD so please let me know your thoughts. I am bullish on AMD. Since last week I gave it an 8% run up till earrings that was on the 12th opened at $104, and we have passed $113 already. Predictions are that AMD will run till earnings dip and then run again. My reasons are as follows. 
1.) TSLA earnings on 10/20, AMD chips are used in production of Model S and Model X, TSLA’s record number of sales in China  is a good indicator, musk tweets about AMD being good to work with on 09/21. I think Elon fucks. Sales of those two models are important as shit could that be another market share for AMD? 
2.) APPL cucked INTC today with their new chip. 
3.)Still waiting more info on the XILINX deal, 4.)TSM beat expectations
5.)INTC earnings on 10/21 expecting another move on AMD in anticipation of their earnings regardless of the results.
6.)Also need to consider the recent partnerships with Microsoft and Google.

Has it all been priced in? I am not sure we have ran over 8% since last week and had a major pop from the new graphics card. I am no expert and I don’t have enough time to dive into the rabbit hole of semi conductors. This is just speculation and not a reliable source of information but I feel like there are plenty more gains to be had."

qao0va,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qao0va/the_power_of_holding_through_an_uptrend/,The power of holding through an uptrend,116,36,2021-10-18 22:40:54,"Everyone even remotely familiar with the stock market has heard the saying “let your winners run and cut your losers”. Plug this catch phrase into Google and you’ll find hundreds of very vague “articles” of how, if you are lucky to catch that winner, you must let it ride, but barely anyone presents a real strategy of how that would be done properly, leaving novice investors diamond handing their stocks all the way up and all the way down again. Isn’t that a frustrating experience? Worst part is- this experience psychologically conditions the trader to pick up bad habits. After being caught out like that, it appears that the best thing to do is to grab that small profit market is giving you and get out till the next trade. Therefore the new trader is now conditioned to take small profits from numerous trades just to get caught in some random downtrend that wipes out all of the profits taken in months. That would mess with anyone’s psychology and more bad habits would follow… revenge trading, overtrading, picking risky and questionable investments, while to start with there was nothing wrong with the idea of holding your winners, it just had to become a real strategy with clear entry and exit points (more about it later) and strong reasoning of why the trade was entered to begin with. 

I’m going to explain why holding your winners works mathematically and can be one of the most lucrative strategies, how to pick your entries and plan exits and what type of set ups I’m personally looking for. I’m also going to outline the factors that should be considered a sign that this particular strategy should not be employed.

Let me start from the mathematical aspect of this strategy. 
Let’s say that the trader bought 1000 shares of stock ABC, that is trading at $10. The stock is in the uptrend, moving up 2% a day for the next 10 days. Here is how daily profits on $10,000 capital would look like:

Day 1 +$200       total profit $200
Day 2 +$204       total profit $404
Day 3 +$208       total profit $612
Day 4 +$212        total profit $824
Day 5 +$216        total profit $1040
Day 6 +$220        total profit $1260
Day 7 +$224        total profit $1484
Day 8 +$230        total profit $1716
Day 9 +$234        total profit $1950
Day 10 +$240      total profit $2190

As you see from the first column the trader is benefiting from the power of combined interest. The longer the trader holds the same position the more profitable each move up is, even if the stock is moving consistently by the same percentage. For example a 2% move on day 10 actually benefited the trader 2.4% from his original investment. This becomes even more noticeable as time goes on. On day 30 the mare 2% move would cash the trader $320 for the day increasing his original position by 3.2%. 

We have established that holding a stock through an uptrend becomes more and more profitable as time goes on. So what’s the problem? Well the problem seems to come from lack of planning and strategy and possibly conviction. 
Before buying any stock, I put in days worth of research, watch the stock trade for adequate amount of time to start seeing its “personality”, scout public forums for other opinions and things I have possibly missed or information that other people stumbled upon. But my research doesn’t end there. Technical analysis is just as important. I go over every angle. I find my moving averages, support and resistance levels, go over daily volume and volume per price (that’s to indicate where previous bag holders will be tempted to close their positions) , find levels where the stock is likely to experience volatility explosion (usually levels with previous low volume per price) and note where short sellers will be tempted to enter. By the time I’m done with my research there is very little that can surprise me about the stock. I know all the upcoming catalysts. Would technical changes happen I would be ready to notice immediately. I ask myself questions like “is company likely to dilute its shareholders and when did last dilution happen?”, “what could be possible negative events?” and “what would change my conviction about the stock and company completely?”. 

Once all of this research is done I don’t just blindly jump in. And it’s all so tempting! There are so many undervalued companies out there that fundamentally are amazing, yet charts or media sentiment are so ugly. Patience is the key. 
I wait for the stock to retest it’s long term support and confirm it. I start buying around that support level. Comfortably averaging in. This is not a day trade strategy, this is a swing trade strategy so I take my time to get comfortable in the position. It’s also very important not to overbet -even the strongest charts sometimes break and having extra capital can save your position in the unfortunate turn of events. But more about mitigating the risks later…. 

Once I’m comfortable in my new position I already am aware of resistance levels but I don’t blindly sell at those levels, that’s where continuous technical analysis comes in. I watch daily volume as my most important indicator and combine that information with volume per price to come up with probability of stock continuing the up trend. High enough daily volume on the green side will most likely push the stock through levels where other investors are likely to exit. Higher positive volume is also a repellent for short sellers. Biggest and the most profitable moves can happen once the stock breaks upwards of previous resistance. Not only short sellers, that were in the wrong, will be closing their positions repurchasing the shares, but new ones will not enter until they are confident that an uptrend is over. 

So knowing all this, where to take profits? 
I look for discrepancies that could possibly indicate that the chart is weakening. The key is to exit before a significant consolidation period. One of those signs is a large sell order in the order book that would be near impossible to fill with current volume. Others are: shrinking volume, lack of buy bids at lower levels in the order book, short term RSI is not resetting to oversold during fluctuations or general market condition is weakening. As long as I do not see any of these discrepancies, I believe that the position is better left alone to play out it’s full potential.  
Actively watching for discrepancies helps trader to take profits when chart is over extended. Waiting for the chart to break in an obvious way, such as falling back through moving averages, is also an option, especially if skills to look for discrepancies are not developed yet, but that would cost the trader some of his profits and psychologically is much harder to do. 

Since we have established an entry and exit points I’m going to quickly overview the type of setups I’m looking for. They don’t come around often, but can yield returns of 30%-200% within weeks. Latest examples of stocks, that I have personally traded, and achieved those results are BNGO, RKT, CLOV and SPCE. I believe that in the matter of weeks I’ll be able to add RIOT to that list, but the future is never certain. 
My main criteria while looking for this type of trade is finding companies with extreme fundamental changes, that is unnoticed or unacknowledged by the market. For medical companies it would be an important drug or equipment approval, for others -expanding contracts, expansion to new markets, or becoming profitable due to unexpected immediate growth. It also could be the loss of competition (right now it is the case of American based miners, due to China’s restrictions on miners). If the stock is undervalued without counting in the fundamental changes- it’s an added bonus!The best part about relying on fundamentals and research is -low risk for a loss. Even if the trader makes technical analysis mistake or gets stuck in an unexpected downtrend the stocks tend to come back to their fundamental value. With this strategy, having a little bit of patience, there is little reason to cut losses (contrary to a popular saying), unless of course there are major negative catalysts or new fundamental flaw. 
On the other hand it is wise to have extra capital, in case the trade doesn’t play out right away, and seas any opportunity to grab shares at a greater discount. Averaging down is a powerful risk mitigation tool, if used in the correct way. After establishing a comfortable position, I would not suggest to start averaging down any sooner than after experiencing at least a 20% loss, and only if fundamentals still stand (this percentage is applied to volatile mid-cap trades). Averaging down too soon takes away the trader’s edge and in most cases contributes to a greater loss initially. 
Once I find these stocks with huge fundamental changes I make sure to mark up all the upcoming catalysts (that’s what will kick off the trade and will allow the market to notice our company). For example earnings could be an amazing catalyst because analyst coverage comes soon after. 

We have overviewed our entry and exit points, type of stocks we are looking for, but what about the negative factors to watch out for? 
 

Well why don’t we come up with that together?"

qanwz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qanwz1/teamviewer_tmv_pushed_down_by_the_german_trash/,"Teamviewer (TMV) - Pushed down by the German trash magazine ""Der Aktionär"" and its paying subscribers by means of short certificates.",12,8,2021-10-18 22:35:19,"The German software specialist is basically an extremely solid growth company, but was unable to achieve its forecasts. Multiple sales revisions, but still highly profitable. Today, the CFO, who was responsible for the questionable sponsorship deals with Mercedes Formula1 and Manchester United, was removed. The share has lost about 80% of its value since its peak in February. The investor Permira still holds 20% in the company and has reduced its position for the first time at prices between 40-50 euros. Little needs to be said about Teamviewer's business model. The remote maintenance tool is absolutely top-notch, but margins will decrease in the future. Teamviewer has prepared itself in recent years, but especially for Industry 4.0. Its artificial intelligence for manufacturing and logistics has huge potential here. To get an idea of their knowledge and expertise, just take a look at their partnerships with Google and SAP.

Why is now exactly the right time to invest? At the current share price level, TMV is extremely interesting not only in the long term, but especially in the short term. In Germany, there is a trash magazine called ""Der Aktionär"". The online magazine is very popular because the content is short but concise. Basically, they sell a subscription model where they want to push certain values in one direction or another. Then, they specifically publish an extremely large number of articles on their target values, which they make available to the general public online. In doing so, they steer stocks in certain directions. Please note, the European or German market is a fraction of the US market and can be influenced much easier. For weeks they have been recommending an aggressive short certificate. Since the massive crash, ""Der Aktionär"" has revised its view. Now one suddenly advises profit taking. A bottom has been formed around 14 euros. Even the shareholder assumes a reversal in the direction of 16-18 euros. In principle, the short ratio is not high, but in the background, the short ratio should be many times higher. Note that TMV's ADR has a steadily increasing short borrow fee rate and is now over 90%. Now all negative news is really priced into the value. I would go so far as to say that more negative is priced in than is even there. When TMV starts its reversal, the numerous small investors will get nervous. ""Der Aktionär"" is already whistling its people back and preparing them for the breakup. A great opportunity!"

$AEO American Eagle outfitters runs American Eagle and Aerie, in the US and 200 international locals, and online. Mkt cap \~ $4b avg vol 4.8mill

Current P/E is sitting at 17.6 with a projected **forward P/E of only 10.1.**

The pandemic hit them hard with mall traffic so low but the past quarter EPS is up 803% Q over Q, and sales are up 35%, as foot traffic returns to stores.

$AEO is **sitting at support** like a coiled snake ready to jump. (LOOK AT THEIR CHART) It ran as high as $38 in June, and the fundamentals are better now then they were then. Current price is resting on $25 support, and they’re paying a dividend of $.72 about **3% while you hold** the shares for the ride up to $40’s.

American Eagle **recently acquired Air Terra** a middle leg logistics company that transports goods between the port of LA and Pennsylvania.  The need for these middle market logistics is so large that they are now not just using this for themselves but for their competition and other retailers in different industries. You may want to read about AirTerra because they **have huge advantages over UPS FedEx and the like.** You can read about it

**$SKLZ Investment Update:**

Hello all,

It has been nearly 4 months since I first posted my analysis of $$KLZ. Since then, this investment idea has done terribly and is currently down 62%. This update post will help you to understand why this position has performed poorly over the past couple months. Furthermore, this update will provide recent news and events that can help $SKLZ to turn around, and potentially reach my target price set out in my original analysis (found [here](https://utradea.com/positions/Why-SKLZ--Skillz-might-be-A-High-Growth-Stock-in--and-how-dilution-can-put-stop-to-this)).

**Recent SEC Filings:**

Over the past couple of months there have been a tremendous number of filings between SKLZ and the SEC, however, I have narrowed down these filings by finding/presenting you with the 3 most important filings over the past 4 months.

*Q2 2021 Financial Report (10-Q):*

On August 3rd, 2021, SKLZ released their Q2 2021 earnings report, which had some points that I would like to highlight in this section. 

Firstly, SKLZ reported their 22nd quarter of consecutive growth, this is expected as it is a young, high-growth prospect, however their growth rate is very high. SKLZ was able to grow their revenues and profits by a factor of 52%, however they reported a greater net loss, and lower EBITDA. Overall, there is a lot of revenue growth however none of this growth is being transferred into SKLZ pockets, which is normal for a high growth stock, but is somewhat worrying. I am looking for them t turn this trend around in the next couple quarterly reports and start to decrease their net losses or else I will exit the position.

Secondly, SKLZ acquired Aarki in July of 2021. Aarki is a demand-side marketing platform that has 465M active monthly users, data engines, and machine-learning algorithms that deliver high ROI to their advertising customers. This acquisition is very strategic and can help SKLZ to acquire users and monetize their platform more efficiently. This should help to drive in more revenues for both Aarki and Skillz.

Additionally, SKLZ entered into a strategic partnership with “Exit Games”, in which they agreed to purchase a $50M minority stake in Exit Games. Exit Games is a German company that allows developers to create and host real-time multiplayer games (like SKLZ). This deal gives SKLZ the access/rights they need in order to use Exit Games’ technology to accelerate SKLZ’s multiplayer game growth, and for SKLZ to use in their eSports tournaments/platforms.

Lastly, SKLZ announced their partnership with the NFL for NFL-branded mobile games. Currently there are 14 NFL-branded games being developed and SKLZ plans to choose just 3 of them to launch in 2022 or early 2023.

*Registration of Securities (S-1):*

On August 16th, 2021, SKLZ submitted/completed their S-1 filing, which means that they registered more Class A common shares. In this filing, SKLZ noted that they registered 4,401,615 shares at an offering price of $11.88, which diluted previously held shares by roughly 1%. These shares were granted to SKLZ CEO (Andrew Paradise) as a result of their “2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan”.

*CEO Compensation (Omnibus Incentive Plan) 8-K:*

On September 14th, 2021, SKLZ announced that they granted (not vested) Andrew Paradise a total of 16,119,540 Performance Stock Units (PSU’s) to be earned over the next year. Each PSU can be vested for 1 Class A common stock and is a part of SKLZ’s “2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan”. The 2021 and 2020 Incentive plans are nearly identical and follow the following framework.

This plan outlines the total compensation available for Andrew if he meets certain performance thresholds. The total compensation (16.12M shares) is divided equally into 4 tranches (think of a tranche, the same way you think of slices of a pie), each containing 4,029,885 PRU’s. Each of these tranches is unlocked when Andrew (and the company (SKLZ)) meet certain performance measures. 

These tranches are unlocked after a SKLZ market cap reaches a certain multiple during the timeframe. The 4 performance milestones are 2x, 3x, 4x, and 5x. If Andrew is able to grow SKLZ’s market cap by 4x, then he will receive 3 tranches (12.09M PRU’s).

However, if the market cap multiple is a fractional number like 4.2x, then Andrew will receive 20% of the 4th tranche, which would equate to an additional 805,977 shares (above the 4x multiple).

I think this is good news for shareholders as Andrew is heavily incentivized to pump the share price and keep it there for 60 consecutive days (which is part of the arrangement). It will be interesting to see what Andrew and SKLZ do over the course of the next year to achieve this, and it should be very beneficial for shareholders.

This plan was also mentioned with some additional details in my original analysis found [here](https://utradea.com/positions/Why-SKLZ--Skillz-might-be-A-High-Growth-Stock-in--and-how-dilution-can-put-stop-to-this).

*Appointment of an Officer 8-K:*

\*See this in my full analysis [here](https://utradea.com/positions/SKLZ-Stock-Analysis-A-much-needed-update)\*

**Recent News:**

*Big Buck Hunters Release:*

On September 23rd, 2021, SKLZ announced the release of “Big Buck Hunters” on their gaming platform, and for their eSports tournaments. SKLZ released Big Buck Hunters: Marksman” on their platform, which is their first ever first-person-shooter (FPS) game. This is important because SKLZ’s CEO Andrew Paradise has announced his willingness to expand into FPS games, and this is their first move into doing so. This genre of gaming is wildly popular and has a dedicated and active fan base, which can translate into tremendous sales if SKLZ is able to create a breakthrough FPS game in the future.

Since their release of this game on IOS, they have already ranked #3 in the App Store for “Popular Sports Apps”.

*SKLZ Workplace Awards:*

On August 4th, 2021, SKLZ was named one of “Fast Company’s” 100 best workplaces for innovators. SKLZ managed to crack #37 on this list, which is pretty high, and they are joined by the likes of Google, Moderna, Samsung, and General Electric. All of the companies that made this list are said to have “created and sustained cultures of innovation, even in remote work environments”.

This comes just months after SKLZ was awarded “The Best Place to Work” by both The San Francisco Business Times, and The Silicon Valley Business Journal. Both of these publications stated that SKLZZ is known for recruiting and retaining the best and the brightest talent”.

These awards are very good for the company as it should help them to attract top talent and retain their current talent. Furthermore, people who are happy at work and are in good work environments can be more [productive workers](https://businesstown.com/8-ways-increase-productivity-workplace/).

*Expansion into India:*

\*See this in my full analysis [here](https://utradea.com/positions/SKLZ-Stock-Analysis-A-much-needed-update)\*

**Potential explanations for the 60% decrease in share price:**

In this section, I will explain factors that contributed to SKLZ’s declining share price that I mentioned in my previous analysis, as well as factors that I did not mention in the analysis that had negative effects on their share price.

*Financial Performance:*

SKLZ’s Q2 financial report had some upsides and some downsides. However, I found that the downsides outweighed the upsides for the following reason.

SKLZ’s net loss increased by 300% YoY which is terrible, and signals that they are moving in the wrong direction. Furthermore, their Adjusted EBITDA fell by over $28M YoY, which is again not a good look. Although SKLZ has increased revenues greatly over the past year, they have not been able to convert that into a better bottom line, which is why investors are panicking and selling off their positions.

I say they are moving in the wrong direction as a result of their previous earnings reports. From 2018 to 2019 SKLZ was able to decrease their net losses, which got investors excited that they were making their way towards profitability. However, over the past 2 years (2020 and TTM) SKLZ’s net loss has grown by a factor of 10x. SKLZ performance in the net loss category over the past 2 years is one of the leading financial related reasons why investors are exiting their positions.

*Inflation Data (and 10-Year Treasury Yields):*

Since I posted this analysis in June of 2021, the high rate of inflation (5.4%) has persisted over the past 4 months. These high levels of inflation are not good for hyper growth stocks like SKLZ. Furthermore, during this same timeframe the US 10-Year Yield increased from 1.489% to 1.518%, which is also not good for SKLZ.

The reason that increasing yields/inflation are bad for hyper growth stocks is the fact that these rates are incorporated in the WACC, which is used to discount future cash flows. If the discount rate is higher (which is the case with a higher 10-Year Yield), than todays share value based on future cash flow would decrease as a result of todays money becoming less valuable.

*Dilution:*

\*See this in my full analysis [here](https://utradea.com/positions/SKLZ-Stock-Analysis-A-much-needed-update)\*

*Short Sellers and Cathy Wood:*

This is one of the factors that I did not mention in my previous analysis. Earlier this year there were 2 short-seller reports that were published, claiming that SKLZ was covering up revenue losses on their top 3 games, and that they falsified their revenues. This triggered several lawsuits and hurt SKLZ’s share price. 

These reports came out before I posted my analysis, however they have had longer term effects on the share price and was one of the reasons why SKLZ was down so much in July.

Another reason for their decrease in July can be attributed to Cathy Wood selling a somewhat large portion of her SKLZ holdings. In July Cathy sold over 1M shares which represented nearly 16% of her total holdings in SKLZ. The reason that this had such a large influence on the share price of SKLZ is because it initially gained popularity via Cathy and her conviction of the stock. However, many investors saw this sale as Cathy not believing in it anymore, which caused them to exit their position(s).

**Final Thoughts:** 

I think that SKLZ is headed in the right direction when looking at their recent partnerships, investments, and buyouts. I think that their strategies behind these moves (and their possible expansion into India) can serve their business very well, and set them up for future success, however, there are some current factors (like their dilution and financial shortcomings) that have restricted their share price from showing these successes. 

In terms of a valuation, I would have to use the same valuation that I achieved through my comparable analysis in my [original analysis](https://utradea.com/positions/Why-SKLZ--Skillz-might-be-A-High-Growth-Stock-in--and-how-dilution-can-put-stop-to-this), which found the fair value for $SKLZ to be $25.31. There are some flaws with this valuation, and there is more to be added, however I stick by my original valuation and think that there is a potential reversal coming in the next couple of months.

This is INSANE!! This ranges from connected cars to drones to medical devices to robots to assembly lines to DoD drones to planes!!! These are design wins in last 2 years so the revenue will show up once they start shipping product, it will be huge revenue!! Starting this quarter in December the revenue will show up!!

**Blackberry QNX now control 78% of EV car market and 24/25 top EV car makers are signed up to use BB QNX software platform.** 

**NOTE: BB QNX HAS A MONOPOLY WHEN IT COMES TO CONNECTED CARS ADAS AND CRITICAL CAR/IOT FUNCTION.**

Big news drop this week is Google and Qualcomm signing up to use Blackberry QNX Hypervisor. This means the chip will have QNX embedded capability that will allow Android to run on top of it for infotainment. This is bigger than sliced bread!! Every car will have BB QNX hypervisor inside providing safety and security to Android Infotainment. The BB QNX controls rest of the car software and modules like cluster, adas, and bunch of other functions.

Rigetti uses traditional superconducting quantum arrays that translate a little easier to conventional computers. The huge downside is the need for extreme cooling. Rigetti uses multi layers where the innermost layer is 100x colder than outerspace. Xanadu uses photonic systems that are great, and run at room temp but they need lots of additional hardware to work and will be difficult to scale down. Microsoft is working on topological arrays which would provide utility benefits but it hasn't been proven yet and they had to retract one of their papers on it. The point is that there are various methods to how you can create and manipulate qubits, the foundation for quantum computing.

IONq uses trapped ions, from a single atom of ytterbium. Technically a rare metal but it's not rare. Then they manipulate the ions using lasers to create the qubits on the array. Sh*t is bleeding edge and I understand .005% of it but I read everything I can find. It can run at room temp and be easily scaled. Basically IONq doesn't need all the extra resources to create and manipulate their qubits, so the cost and energy requirements are down. This also allows for upscaling arrays on existing hardware. Like they can turn a 16 qubit system into a 64 qubit system eventually using the same stuff  they just have to reduce the expected errors that come with quantum computing.

IONq got starting investment money from Amazon, Alphabet, Bill Gates, Samsung, Lockheed Martin, Hyundai, goldman sachs and more. They used that money to prove the tech works and are currently operating with Amazon Braket as their most powerful hardware supplier. Currently IONq has the most powerful trapped ion quantum computer in business operation at 32 qubits. The next closest comp is 16 qubits. And you can have 9 qubit, 11 qubits computers, it doesn't need to be doubled evenly like ram for instance. The CEO, Peter Chapman attended MIT when he was only 16 and was the technical director for Amazon prime before he founded IONq.


Remember when you see qubit numbers in the future and from other companies, what that really means.

Quantum computing is based on ""physical qubits"" and ""digital"" simulated qubits. Conventional computers use bits.

No matter what method you use, ions, photonic, superconducting, etc, You can't have a fully isolated qubit because then you couldn't interact with it to manipulate and tell it what to do. To get around this, modern quantum computing is based on running ""leaking"" environments with varying fidelity and trackable errors. We use the say 93% that is still functional to simulate more isolated qubits, and use those to simulate even more isolated qubits, in deeper layers until we have a fully isolated qubit we can error correct. 

Eventually we need 1 million qubit machines to simulate 10k error corrected machines. IONq just demonstrated how they can scale up to a million at a recent presentation. Eventually a QPU could really lead to some radically advancements in financial predictions, cybersecurity and encryption, biotech discovery, simulation modeling and on and on.

They merged with $600m , $350m of which is pipe investment that is locked up for 6 months from now. Ran to $12 before merger, tanked to $10 at merger, tanked to $7.30 during spy correction and tech sell off. It was mostly shorts based on volume. They have tiny revenue because they are just getting started but that doesn't matter imo. They had that white house presentation to show off and IONq is the only pure quantum computer company on the market so far, with rigetti ipo'ing in a few months.

The pipe investment unlocks in 5 1/2 months and that could be the only negative event coming up. I'll decide what I do with my shares, closer to the date, either hold or sell then compound my gains to hold, maybe for life. It's bleeding edge tech and to try to simplify it more, instead of linear binary data, 1s and 0s. The data can be 1 and 0 at the same time in any ratio, in any direction. It's a bigger technological leap than people understand.

Thanks for your time!

Google + Qualcomm partnership is huge.,1233,254,2021-10-14 08:42:43,"As you know, BB moved up 5% (50 cents) today on news that they have partnered with Google and Qualcomm. You're probably surprised it went up because it always goes down on news.

This news is different. This news is huge.

Everyone was quick to jump to the conclusion that Ford had dropped BB entirely from their cars in favour of Google: [https://www.obj.ca/article/techopia/ford-drops-blackberry-qnx-infotainment-platform-inks-deal-google](https://www.obj.ca/article/techopia/ford-drops-blackberry-qnx-infotainment-platform-inks-deal-google)

Well, the Google and Qualcomm news pretty much puts that assumption to bed. Not only will BB still be in Ford cars, any car that is built using both Android's infotainment and Qualcomm's chips, will need BB tech.

We have Google, Amazon, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Baidu, etc. etc. on our side. We have a patent sale that could be worth 1 billion+ coming no longer than 2 months from now. And we have Blackberry IVY slated to release this month.

Please stop throwing current revenue numbers at me when this thing is going to pump revenue out like crazy in the future. Stop focusing so much on their past. Stop focusing on how paperhands rule this stock. I don't see a company out there that has this many positive things going for it with a 5 billion dollar market cap.

If the stock market is forward thinking, why not BB?

**What is FASTLY?**

Fastly is a CDN (Content Delivery Network), kind of like Amazon, Google, and Facebook who sells connections to the internet to websites like Shopify, Reddit, Discord etc.

&#x200B;

**WHY FASTLY ISN'T SO POOPY**

June 8th Outage -  Fastly had a bug and the internet was shut off for a while. During this outage some customers of Fastly were revealed.

Known client list as of June 8th 2021 -  Reddit, Spotify, Twitch, Stack Overflow, GitHub, gov.uk, Hulu, HBO Max, Quora, PayPal, Vimeo, Shopify, Stripe, and news outlets CNN, The Guardian, The New York Times, BBC and Financial Times.

I don't know about you, but I use Reddit, Spotify, Twitch, Paypal. Seems like pretty big clients, so I think Fastly and the internet will be staying around for a while. This company cannot go tits up.

&#x200B;

**Cybersecurity and the Internet BIZ**

As of 2021 the Cybersecurity market is $180bn industry. Forecasts say these numbers will only go up over time as the web becomes more connected and security protocols, speed, delivery continues to improve.

BUG - Cyber security ETF, I'm surprised that FSLY is not part of this ETF (yet)

I believe sales will continue to grow. The internet is like the universe 2.0 and continues to expand over time, URLs might not be norm but apps and app connectivity are. Fastly is a CDN for apps too, for the popular app like TikTok.

&#x200B;

**FASTLY TEAM**

One word - DEDICATED.

You see people bounce from netflix to facebook to twitter to amazon to google to IBM very often. I see this on linkedin all the time, and the time they spend in the company 2-3 years to get a salary bump and a company under their belt to boast about.

At Fastly, look up the employees, they are dedicated, 6+years and counting. These employees who connect the internet can move to Amazon, Facebook, and Google, but they choose to stay at Fastly...

This only means one thing, the employees believe in the company, they like where they are, and they like what they do. Sounds like a recipe for success to me. (7% insider ownership) The founder is no longer the CEO but the CA and they continue to invest and develop ext-gen WAF and RASP to protect web applications, APIs and microservices.

&#x200B;

**SHORTS?! EXPOSED**

2021 is almost over, but the norm for this year was squeeze every short.

Fastly has a 16% short interest on a 100m float. Meaning 16m shares shorted.

The average vol of FSLY is 3.5m and the last time there was a short squeeze that was 10/16/2020 where the volume traded the float.

I went through the options chain to see who owns these short positions that were monthly's at one point that expire THIS WEEK 10/15.

&#x200B;

[15 OCT 21 PUTS](https://preview.redd.it/hv5os40kz9t71.png?width=747&format=png&auto=webp&s=c04042b6ce1df306f31d544c54dee96efc9f09d2)

The 3300 put options I believe belong to  **Walleye Trading LLC,** based off their 13f filing from Aug 16th.

300 Puts owned by  **Centiva Capital, LP**  based off their 13f filing

600 Puts owned by  **Zweig-DiMenna Associates LLC**  based off their 13f filing

&#x200B;

(**How can I check this?** SEC search their 13-f and open the info tables.)

&#x200B;

It's obvious that these institutions will want their puts to not expire worthless but what can they do? It's a bull market and FSLY just took off. Sounds like they will be covering the 43, 44, and 45's if the squeeze goes past the big $45 before expiration.

Are hedgefunds friends? Nope, they cannibalize off each other too, that's probably why some whale moved the price this week in hopes to start this ramp.

&#x200B;

The $43's already got pushed out and the $44 are close. If the $45 are pushed out it's ogre and gamma ramping.

&#x200B;

Where can a squeeze go? I'm not sure but I know it can trade the float or up to three times the float if there is naked short selling.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

FSLY If you are reading this you are using them. SHARES FOR LONG HULL, the internet universe expansion is imminent.

FSLY Price movement, shorts found, squeeze or no squeeze? 10/15/2021 remind you later?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Positions:

400 FSLY Shares @ $43.3

100 contracts 50C1022 @ .13 (to back my squeeze thesis.)"

Given all the recent PLTR FUD and corresponding whipsawing with the stock price, I thought I would write an inaugural DD to reaffirm my long-term conviction and share my bull-case perspective and meandering thoughts on $PLTR.

**Disclaimer:** This is my first attempt at writing a DD, so constructive feedback and stimulating debate is most welcome! This does not constitute financial advice and simply reflects my opinions as a retail investor.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/3wwbmqarqis71.gif

# Positions

* 3,000 shares, $23.94 cost basis
* First bought in November 2020 (tragically missed the DPO price)
* Consistent and multiple DCA (“dollar cost averaging”) – I had several buys in the $30 range (ouch) but continually averaged down

# The Bull Case

**""Digital Gold"" in the 21st century**

Analogous to how oil was hailed as ""black gold"", data will become the ""digital gold"" that permeates every industry in the future; the COVID-19 catastrophe has only reinforced this epochal transformation. The ability to strategically leverage and emancipate siloed and large datasets for competitive insights has, in my opinion, nearly limitless potential and use-cases:

* Consider the industries already deploying Foundry in an array of use cases: from optimizing supply chains, informing military operations in high-stakes environments where minimizing risk/error is paramount, or achieving medical breakthroughs by unlocking data insights from previously opaque datasets, and more. Companies that refuse to adapt will be left behind.

[Here](https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/) are some figures to demonstrate the rapid, exponential increase with data trends from 2010 to 2025, representing a macro tailwind for data analytics providers like Palantir. 2025 projections for global data generation are estimated to reach **180 zettabytes** (64.2 zettabytes were generated in 2020, representing a nearly 3x increase). Simply put, the world will only become more complex with data generation and Palantir is uniquely positioned to handle challenges of the digital era.

&#x200B;

**PLTR's Moat**

To this day, I still haven't encountered a coherent articulation of a direct competitor with software that matches Palantir's Gotham and Foundry capabilities (please correct me if I am wrong!). It seems one would need to combine multiple software platforms from different companies to be remotely comparable, as seen in the C3 AI and Snowflake [partnership](https://c3.ai/c3-ai-and-snowflake-partner-to-deliver-next-generation-enterprise-ai-applications-at-scale/). To that end, I argue that Palantir’s software assumes the position of technological supremacy (more on this will be covered in the “Cathie Wood” effect section).

Moreover, the argument that enterprise customers could simply build ""in-house"" solutions falls flat – these endeavors are typically blackholes for cost and time, with sub-optimal results ([source](https://blog.palantir.com/how-palantir-foundry-helps-customers-build-and-deploy-ai-powered-decision-making-applications-dbfb5161279b)):

>*“In fact, Gartner still predicts that* ***85% of traditional AI and ML projects developed within organizations will deliver erroneous outcomes***\*. Even after a model is successfully developed, it often remains an experiment rather than an operational tool that generates consistent, long-term business value” (emphasis added).\*

Contemplate the case of Airbus and the creation of Skywise:

1. In this [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgTkOKEUyKU) with Alex Karp, Pierre Smolinksy (Former Airbus Executive) and former Digital Transformation Officer of Airbus, Marc Fontaine, Marc revisits how Airbus was initially skeptical of Palantir's software, sharing how most SMEs (""subject matter experts"") thought integration of such vastly siloed data was impossible. In fact, they spent *decades* attempting to solve that problem with hundreds of data centers.

When prompted by Karp about the partnership [results](https://youtu.be/qgTkOKEUyKU?t=503), Marc recounts improvements of double digits in industrial processes, stating that once conditions were ready, TATs (""turnaround times"") were shaved down to a single week from 16 months (**6852.39%** efficiency gains as there are 69.5239 weeks in 16 months). I literally rewatched that segment multiple times because Marc mentions that ridiculous paradigm shift so casually before moving on.

&#x200B;

**Q2 2021 Earnings**

The ER (“earnings report”) numbers were resoundingly fantastic and I have included a few highlights below.

1. Total revenue grew **+49% YoY to $376M**
2. Government revenue grew **+66% YoY to $232M**
3. Commercial revenue accelerated **+90% YoY to $144M**
4. Remaining deal value grew **+63% YoY to $3.4B**
5. Adjusted FCF guidance FY21 widened to **+$300M**, up from in excess of **$150M**.
6. PLTR is debt-free!

Annual revenue growth is guided at 30% *or greater* for '21 through '25, which I believe is intentionally sandbagged by Leadership to under-promise and over-deliver. When accounting for the newly announced Army [contract](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2021/10/07/palantir-stock-gains-10-on-us-army-contract-but-theres-still-more-upside/?sh=6399826e3876) (**$823M**) and Veteran Affairs [contract](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-07/palantir-wins-90-million-contract-with-u-s-veterans-affairs) (**$90M**), those two deals alone are worth nearly **$900M over a couple of years**.

&#x200B;

**Growth Investments and Capital Deployment**

PLTR is actively deploying its capital and strategically seeking out early-stage companies to invest in (very helpful [breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r3fEl6_e_c), courtesy of Ticket Symbol: YOU). I consider this advantageous for several reasons:

1. This is a strategic and public demonstration of PLTR's software in multiple industries and verticals, effectively making the argument that the software is industry-agnostic: if your industry needs to analyze vast amounts of siloed data, then PLTR offers a ready-made solution.
2. By embedding PLTR's technology early on and showing its value and compatibility, these companies will be inclined to continually use its software (as we know, PLTR partnerships are very sticky). This is also relevant with the **Foundry for Builders** initiative, almost a direct counterargument to bears who contend that PLTR is unscalable and only attractive to large enterprise clients.
3. As Palantir scales its offerings and as other enterprises understand the profound capabilities of Palantir's software, I believe that commercial adoption will continue to grow at an increasing pace.
4. **UPDATE:** Palantir recently announced its second [cohort](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211006005995/en/Palantir-Introduces-Second-Cohort-of-Foundry-for-Builders-Start-Ups) of Foundry for Builders on October 6, 2021, again reinforcing how versatile the deployment of its SaaS platform can be.

&#x200B;

**Privacy as a Foundational Pillar**

I think most investors under-appreciate or overlook Palantir's ironclad approach to privacy with its software.

PLTR was ""... was founded on the conviction that it's essential to preserve fundamental principles of privacy and civil liberties while using data"" ([source](https://www.palantir.com/pcl/)). They delineate the privacy [principles](https://www.palantir.com/pcl/principles/) and privacy-by-design [tech](https://www.palantir.com/pcl/technologies/) that underpins their software, which concretely affirms their focus on the protection of civil liberties (I highly encourage you all to spend time reading their approach to privacy).

It is within that lens where I believe the recent privacy concerns are either demonstrably false or misunderstood (e.g., the U.K. [campaign](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/04/campaign-launched-to-get-palantir-out-of-nhs.html) against usage of Palantir products by the U.K. government), particularly in mainstream media:

The NYPost [article](https://nypost.com/2021/08/25/fbi-palantir-glitch-allowed-unauthorized-access-to-private-data/) about a ""glitch"" that allowed unauthorized FBI access to private data was immediately and emphatically shut down by PLTR:

>*“There was no glitch in the software. Our platform has robust access and security controls. The customer also has rigorous protocols established to protect search warrant returns, which, in this case, the end user did not follow,” the spokesperson said.*

Additionally, Ted Mabrey, Head of Global Commercial for Palantir, recently affirmed Palantir’s privacy stance with Bloomberg ([source](https://youtu.be/3vQlPMznGdc?t=140), courtesy of Palantir Vision):

>***Bloomberg:*** *“Palantir has been a fairly controversial company because of privacy concerns. Set the record straight for us – are you taking the data and analyzing \[it\] from governments and companies yourselves? Or, are you giving \[them\] the software for them to analyze their own data?” (edited for conciseness)*  
>  
>***Ted:*** *“\[Palantir\] 100% only \[provides\] the software to our partners, for them to be able to utilize the software, to analyze the data that they have legal access to and control over …* ***We, as Palantir, as an institution control no data, we have no access to that data, we cannot utilize any data across institutions.*** *We are only providing software to our customers.” (emphasis added, edited for conciseness)*

&#x200B;

**Innovative Company Culture and Hiring**

In the Q2 21 ER call, Shyam Sankar (COO of Palantir) [praised](https://youtu.be/kyZTiF5mkV8?t=1005) their open culture of innovation, characterizing it as:

>""... *one that puts the very best people next to the problems that matter, the problems that define our time, and empowers each and every one of them to tell the man who, yes, is often me ... to F off.*""  
>  
>**Takeaway:** This, to me, signifies the company's endorsement of employees speaking truth to power, as well as PLTR's relentless focus on hiring the best of the best (as Alex Karp underscores in the ongoing Interview Series; [source](https://youtu.be/hjjHdys2Ph4?t=703)). While is more of an intangible variable, I still view it worthy of notating in this DD.

&#x200B;

**The ""Cathie Wood"" Effect**

We are all well-aware of how popular PLTR is with ARK Invest and Cathie Wood – you can view the combined PLTR holdings across ARK funds [here](https://cathiesark.com/ark-combined-holdings-of-pltr), and notably, PLTR is represented in *all* ARK funds with Cathie consistently buying up shares. Concerns with ARK selling PLTR must be analyzed in the context of how ETF portfolio re-balancing  – additionally, while contextualizing fractional sales relative to the **overall** holdings maintained by ARK Invest.

Cathie recently voiced her convictions on a Bloomberg Businessweek segment ([source](https://youtu.be/f8jTbxsrx4U?t=80), courtesy of Palantir Vision):

>*“... Palantir has the opportunity to usurp a lot of AWS, Azure, Google Compute over time. It is pushing artificial intelligence out to the edge... Palantir is using technologies that we will find about 5 years from now... They are so far ahead because of their expertise in intelligence, that it is going to accrue to the company's benefit in the commercial space... I don't think people understand how advanced Palantir is technologically, and how its platform technologies are pushing AI out to the edge – \[they\] are going to take share over time from the more centralized services... in the Cloud” (heavily edited for emphasis), Cathie Wood*  
>  
>**Takeaway:** This hearkens back to my argument earlier about Palantir's moat – namely, the company's technology is so forward-thinking and advanced that, by extrapolating a little from Cathie's words, Palantir is addressing problems that most individuals and by extension, enterprise customers, haven't even contemplated with its unparalleled software functionality. That sounds like **technological supremacy** to me.

&#x200B;

**New Palantir Products (?)**

In a recent [interview](https://youtu.be/1zpL55VQnZ0?t=1950) (courtesy of Felix & Friends), Alex Karp let slip (or perhaps it was a mistranslation) that there are three un-launched products! Until we receive more information and updates, it is hard to assess the implications but again, it speaks to Palantir's constant drive to innovate and disrupt. In any case, I will be following these updates closely as they are announced...

# TL;DR

>PLTR represents one of the most compelling long-term holdings of our generation and is my highest conviction stock – their technology is leaps ahead of competitors and the moat is growing. Below are the numerous catalysts covered in this DD:

1. PLTR is uniquely and competitively situated for the ""digital gold"" epoch;
2. PLTR's moat is incredibly compelling with technological supremacy;
3. PLTR crushed Q2 ER and is very likely sand-bagging guidance;
4. PLTR is actively deploying its capital and investing for long-term growth (i.e., not compulsively obsessing over short-term profitability – something endemic to Wall Street neuroticism);
5. PLTR treats privacy with paramount importance, both in principle and by design;
6. PLTR leads with its innovative company culture and only hires the best;
7. The ""Cathie Wood"" effect and conviction on PLTR's ability to disrupt;
8. New (!) PLTR products on the horizon;

# Callouts/Risks

I have not taken the time to comprehensively address the numerous bear counterarguments against PLTR, such as its current valuation, insider selling (Alex Karp), SBC (""stock-based compensation"") and shareholder dilution, the opportunity cost, and more. Perhaps I will do so in a future DD post, but here are some preliminary thoughts:

1. **Valuation:** I am by no means a financial analyst or technical trader, nor am I currently capable of building my own valuation models (maybe one day...). A number of individuals are far better equipped and financially-savvy who created their own DCF models (e.g., [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gjp-aaoa3c), courtesy of Felix & Friends). The bear argument that PLTR remains unprofitable despite being founded in 2004 ignores the context of the company pivoting to the commercial space post-DPO, and Foundry is a relatively new product compared to Gotham. I think commercial growth is just beginning to heat up and will skyrocket once more enterprise clients understand how powerful the software is.
2. **Insider Selling:** The insider selling question has already been addressed at length in this subreddit and elsewhere. Karp must exercise his options to avoid massive tax bills and these sales have been pre-scheduled; furthermore, they constitute a very minor portion of his overall PLTR holdings – there is no reason to believe Karp has lost faith in the company's future. The fervor with which he praises PLTR and its transformational software is, well, telling about his values and focus. Relatedly, this recent FUD [article](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/09/23092145/notable-palantir-technologies-insider-trades-7-92-million-in-company-stock) on Andrew Stephen Cohen selling his Palantir shares omitted key context about the differentiation between Class A and Class B shares  ([source](https://youtu.be/pVHmt3kG778?t=256), courtesy of Tom Nash), as well as the tax implications from options.
3. **SBC and Shareholder Dilution:** With respect to SBC (""stock-based compensation"") and shareholder dilution, I agree that being diluted as a shareholder seems undesirable at first glance, but growth companies (and mature companies) utilize SBC as an effective tool to attract *and* retain top talent. Employees are financially driven to ensure PLTR products remain top-class and state-of-the-art because their compensation is directly linked to the long-term success of the company itself. I expect SBC to taper down incrementally as PLTR matures, but to be sure, there are near- to mid-term risks if SBC explodes.
4. **Opportunity Cost:** I believe the counterargument to wishing that PLTR will moon is basically: ""You are losing out on potential returns if you had allocated your assets elsewhere; therefore, HODL’ing PLTR is a losing strategy."" While this is a valid point, I think it goes back to your strategy for the stock – for me, PLTR is a long-term hold and I recognize that the stock price may trade sideways, be volatile and mercilessly toy with our emotions (seeing us breach $29 just to fly down to $23 was, well, stressful). However, when we expand our time perspective to the matter of not days or months, but years (5-10), and recognize the potential of the company, then my conviction remains steadfast – firm enough to accept the potential near-term opportunity cost for the long-term profit and ROI. Back in March 2021, Alex Karp declared that investors myopically focused on the short-term should avoid the stock, that Palantir is “in \[this\] for the long-haul” ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-B6Pbf1XrI)).

If you've made it this far, then I am very impressed – thanks for taking the time to read through the long-winded DD and GL to all!

Sup everyone. You know how we all love Jpow? Because he just prints infinite amounts of $$$, even though common sense would tell ~~most~~ a few of us that money is logically a finite thing. But since this is not the group to be told what to do by some nerd called ""common sense"", I thought it would be wise to introduce to you: Amyris (AMRS). Pay attention.

**What is Amyris?**

hey- super glad you asked. let's start with a concept called ***'Synthetic Biology'.***

Synthetic Biology is basically this: creating things in a lab that are already found in nature, that make things work. Something made to imitate a natural product. You can also redesign those things in order to give them new superpowers, to be useful in medicine, agriculture, etc..

Enter Amyris.

Formed in 2003, Amyris was given a grant by the Bill and Lafawnda Gates Foundation to create a molecule to treat Malaria. I've had malaria, and my only memory of it is crawling around the little hut I was staying in, looking for a gun to shoot myself in delirium while having uncontrollable diarrhea and puking at the same time, until I finally passed out from not being able to stop puking long enough to breath. I passed out in a pool of my own poo and puke, and about drowned as a result. Anyway, nasty little parasite.

By engineering the genetics of yeast strains and fermenting hem in sugarcane syrup, they pioneered the ability to convert basic plant sugars into new, useful molecules. To date they have created and have protection over 13 molecules that function for a wide span of uses.

**So why should I care about some nerdy superfarmed molecules??**

I seriously don't even know why I am going through the effort of creating this DD for a bunch of degenerates that are just going to pile what should be child-support money into 0dte FD's for Game-theater anyway.

Ok- so these molecules can actually solve a ton of problems.

* Microorganisms can be harnessed for bioremediation to clean pollutants from water, soil, and air
* Rice can be modified to produce bet-carotene, which prevents vitamin A deficiency (Vit. A deficiency make millions of kids go blind and die every year)
* Yeast can be engineered to produce rose-oil for perfumes (more sustainable substitute for real roses)

As I previously mentioned, AMRS has commercialized 13 molecules to date, that benefit a large span of products, making what is scarce, very much not scarce.

One for example is SQUALENE, (also SQUALANE).

Squalane is an ingredient that is derived from squalene- a natural substance that is found in people, animals, and some plants. Squalane is then used as an ingredient for skin care products like anti-aging cream, lip gloss, sunscreen, etc.. but the primary source of extracting it is by killing sharks. Millions and millions of sharks. Amyris leverages its synthetic biology platform to engineer and ferment yeast with sugarcane to create sugarcane-derived squalane sustainably to replace the shark-derived ingredient, saving more than 2 million sharks per year. Oh, and squalene is also used in something else that is very important and applicable right now.... COVID VACCINES. AMRS saves about 3 million sharks per year.

&#x200B;

[sad shark do do do do do ](https://preview.redd.it/s3e22wma94s71.jpg?width=217&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9a89e9f2308d6bb93fce67687e2817c8c2b33130)

Another cool thing they produce is Cannabigerol (CBG), a cannabinoid that is the precursor of CBD and THC. Like CBD, CBG does not produce a high, but has therapeutic benefits, and is also used in skin-care and cosmetic products. They make this through yeast fermentation, with is less costly than extracting the compound from plants. Sales of this will begin this year, and I know so many of you are excited for some beer-weed.

AMRS provides these various molecules to thousands of different companies around the world, including L'oreal, Natura, Sumitomo, Estee Lauder, etc... It's ingredients are already in products in more than 3000 global brands, reaching millions and millions of people.

AMRS also has its own brands, some of the main ones are:

1. Purecane-*zero cal sweetener made from sugarcane*
2. Biossance- *Skin care products sold direct-to-consumer through Sephora and other retailers. Reese Freaking Witherspoon is mixed in with this somehow as well.*

&#x200B;

[Don't confuse her for being bearish](https://preview.redd.it/gt9motnk94s71.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c424feb81f363c7024ab3a6181f3339bafb5f4ee)

3. Pipette- *Baby skin-care products*

4. Ecofabulous- *another beauty company with sustainable eco-friendly packaging*

**Good hell, this is the most boring DD I have ever read, why should I buy the stupid stock??**

I seriously hate you.

Alright, I'm going to start making this more to the point. No one is going to read this anyway. Here are some fun bullet points.

* John Doerr is the mega-investor and controlling shareholder in this. He also back Google and Amazon in their infancy. He has been acquiring more and more lately. Good sign.
* Sales have been increasing biggly YOY. Revenue was just over $343 million for the last 12 months before their last earning call, but the CEO expect 2 billion in sales, and $600 million in profits by 2025
* CEO (John Melo) announced "" we expect our consumer business to keep doubling every year for the foreseeable future.
* They have another 18 molecules in the pipeline, each expecting to generate $100 million in revenue per year
* Also growing through a ton of acquisitions of beauty product companies.
* big bull pennant

[A chart about something](https://preview.redd.it/draaad5q94s71.png?width=178&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bc38f8c621f01b8e5e274d61b79f9c0f050a56b)

**Ok, things that I don't like**

* Cash flow is negative- I never like this. But, it has been making enormous gains YOY
* They keep issuing shares. I don't like this, but it seems to be a turn-on for AMC apes
* It has taken a lot of years for all of their products to come to fruition.
* Their main competitor Ginkgo has been getting a lot of attention lately, and Aunt Cathie is super giddy about them. I'm actually not too worried about this. Ginkgo has a crazy valuation right now, but is going to come back down to earth the same way that AMRS did a long time ago.

AMRS is much more stable now, and is finally in a position to capitalize on their creations. 2022 should be an enormous year for them with these products and partners finally pulling in revenue after many years of lab work. Kinkgo is basically where AMRS was 10 years ago, but with less stuff.

Positions: Just short of 1000 shares @ $12.35. Wanting to do some more research before I add more.

**TLDR:** AMRS synthetic molecules are seeping into all of beauty-care products, vaccines, and are finally positioned to explode in revenue growth, with analyst predicting a potential 4-bagger within the next 18 months."

The demographic has also changed. What used to be predominantly consumed by teenage boys and males in their twenties has now expanded to a much broader, all-inclusive demographic. Studies show that although males still dominate this space, it is gaining rapid popularity among females and also those aged 40+.

&#x200B;

**Activision Blizzard (ActiBlizz) - About the company**

Where does Activision Blizzard (ATVI) fit into all of this? ActiBlizz is one of the world’s most renowned triple A game developers. The company is divided into 3 separate publishers that consist of various studios and intellectual property: Activision, Blizzard, and King. Here’s where each of their IP fall under by publisher.

https://preview.redd.it/4o7omgg5har71.png?width=638&format=png&auto=webp&s=200fec65a1bd9bc848dbfe83f1d8032e0a91bce6

&#x200B;

ActiBlizz’s largest-grossing franchise is by far the Call of Duty IP, also known as CoD, that releases a new addition to the sequel every year in the fall. Coming in second is the King publisher with Candy Crush, and very close behind is the Blizzard segment that consists of games like World of Warcraft, Diablo, Hearthsone, Starcraft, etc. Here’s a chart that displays the percentage of revenue from each publisher. Activision is by far the largest source of revenue producing nearly 50%.

https://preview.redd.it/q28pqar5har71.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=c371422b634c2edfe05b91564d0f402675458603

&#x200B;

**Gaming Market - CAGR and TAM**

Let’s look at the potential growth of the video game industry. A report by Cision, suggests that the video game market, which includes PC, console, and mobile gaming, will have an expected CAGR of 11% between 2021-2026. The total addressable market (TAM) of the gaming market, currently estimated at $175 billion, is forecasted to reach approximately 300 billion by 2027. Roughly half of this is attributed to mobile gaming, leaving the other half for PC and console.

&#x200B;

It’s not easy to put an exact number on ATVI’s current market share in this industry. Based on their TTM revenues of roughly \~8.3 billion and a current market size of $175 billion we can make a broad assumption that ATVI currently holds a 5% market share of the entire gaming industry. If all things remain equal a 5% share of the estimated 300 billion in 2027 would equate to 15 billion in revenue for ATVI, almost double what they are currently bringing in.

&#x200B;

**ActiBlizz - The Strategy & Pipeline**

The industry-wide data emphasizes mobile gaming market is out-pacing growth relative to PC and console. ATVI already owns the the most grossing mobile game of all time, Candy Crush, but they are also re-positioning themselves to take the lead into the advanced mobile gaming market. By advanced gaming market I am referring to games that aren’t the type for playing five minutes here and there. These games are the grab-and-go versions of popular console/PC IP, such as CoD mobile and the up-and-coming Diablo: Immortal, a hack-and-slash for smartphones.

&#x200B;

Activision hit it out of the park with CoD mobile and, as per their most recent earnings call, is on track to exceed $1 billion in consumer spending for the year. Remember this is a MOBILE game. On their recent earnings calls management commented on the strong growth in bookings:

>“Call of Duty Mobile net bookings grew double digits year over year and sequentially, driven by strong execution in seasonal content in the West and the recent launch of the game in China”

&#x200B;

ActiBlizz has successfully ported a CoD title to mobile and it is well-known that a Diablo title will be coming to mobile in early 2022. Management also recently hinted at a World of Warcraft (WoW) mobile title in the works.

>“Two Warcraft mobile experiences are in various stages of internal testing, with the team looking forward to sharing more about these titles soon”

&#x200B;

PC and console games will always remain a strong presence in the gaming industry, but as smartphones and tablets become increasingly powerful the door is wide open to take advantage of this growing market. ActiBlizz is well-positioned to dominate mobile gaming by introducing monetization tactics to capture freemium users (free to play, pay to buy premium in-game content) and transition them later on to their existing premium models on different consoles -creating a positive feedback loop. To do this, the company has been hiring talent and so far has added hundreds of developers to the roster even though they have lost a few of their top game designers (I will get into this later on).

>“We have added hundreds of developers to the franchise over the last three years, and we continue to grow our teams as we prepare to launch three unique and complementary experiences across platform”

&#x200B;

**Diablo II: Remastered - The Nostalgic Cash-Machine**

ATVI already has steady cash-flow from their on-going IP. Whether the latest CoD release has an average review of 9/10 or 6/10 it’s safe to say they will sell millions of copies regardless. The same can be said for updates to the Hearthstone and WoW franchises, this is already known and priced in. I want to forecast revenues from the expansion of the Diablo segment by looking at recently released Diablo 2: Remastered (D2R) game for PC and console.

&#x200B;

A quick history of the Diablo franchise. Back in the year 2000 Diablo II became one of the greatest games ever for that time period selling over 4 million copies as a PC-only game. Fourteen years later ActiBlizz released Diablo 3 for PC and console which ended up selling over 30 million (!) copies and becoming top 3 game in history, closely behind Minecraft in the number two spot, and PlayerUnknown Battleground as number one.

&#x200B;

Circling back to D2R which was released last weekend (Sept 23, 2021). Let’s look at a few trends for how anticipated this game was among the gaming community.

&#x200B;

First, I want to look at the estimated site traffic of the most well-known Diablo community for in-game trading, d2jsp

https://preview.redd.it/h5u9glx6har71.png?width=1322&format=png&auto=webp&s=73fb68d1fc195c8e3eea03d864d5b443bd9eecd0

&#x200B;

Next, I’ll look at Reddit’s very own sub-reddit stats and look at the increase in subscribers and sub-reddit activity (comments) for the two most popular Diablo communities, r/Diablo and r/Diablo2.

https://preview.redd.it/dg9d1je7har71.png?width=1726&format=png&auto=webp&s=448f83ae9b513d5c51733d31c05335a7b30bdf74

https://preview.redd.it/4w2sit18har71.png?width=1710&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e6db7843e3e14da4dff95ca233fc0b31d5c963

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Lastly, although somewhat less relevant, let’s compare Google trends for Diablo vs CoD: Warzone vs Fortnite -all very popular games.

https://preview.redd.it/zu3qczi8har71.png?width=2262&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f26b1e6b29cb4ae8dbc73b671f8cc5979b8b73a

&#x200B;

Of course, just by the nature of a new Diablo release there will be increase chatter, searches, and trends around the internet. Although expected, it is very nice to see strong growth on all sides. It will be somewhat important to keep an eye on these trends a few months from now.

&#x200B;

Guessing the exact numbers for Diablo 2: Remastered pre-orders and sales on opening weekend is not an easy feat. However, given that D3 sold over 30 million copies in 7 years I think we can expect strong numbers from D2R.

&#x200B;

Looking into the 2022 release of Diablo mobile and the 2023 release of Diablo 4, Diablo 2 could not have been released at a more strategic time to get users back into the Diablo franchise. In my opinion this was a move to setup Diablo 4, coming out in 2023, for an absolute record-breaking release.

&#x200B;

At $40 USD per copy of D2R sold here is some napkin math of estimating revenues based on units sold.

Let’s make a conservative forecast that in it’s lifetime D2R sells 10 million copies with 60% of the units being sold in the first year. 6 million copies sold this year would equate to 240 million in revenue for the Blizzard segment in the next twelve months which has done 1.906 billion in TTM revenues, a 12.6% increase in revenues for this segment. Considering the fact that D2R is mainly a re-skin of the popular game we might also see a slight expansion in margins.

&#x200B;

**The Bear Case(s)**

ActiBlizz has been receiving a lot of bad press and questionable news headlines due to a few ongoing concerns with the company. The first is their recent 18 million dollar deal to settle sexual harassment lawsuits. From bad company reviews on various job boards to losing a lot of senior game designers, the work-place culture has been receiving an extremely bad rap. As much as I hate to see a company making headlines for these reasons, I would have to side on the fact that the financial impact these headlines will have on the company is going to be relatively muted.

&#x200B;

Tied to what was mentioned above and the ongoing concerns of the company’s culture was another headline making the rounds. ActiBlizz’s CEO, Bobby Kotick, has recently cashed in on a 155 million compensation package. His compensation was mainly tied to the performance of ATVI’s share price, which saw a huge organic boost caused by Covid.

&#x200B;

Lastly, China’s recent crackdown on young gamers limits youth to gaming only 3 hours per week. Exactly how this will be enforced by the nation and the impact it will have on the Chinese video gaming market is still unknown.

&#x200B;

**Analyst Targets**

I always take analyst targets with a grain of salt, but looking at all coverage and upgrades in 2021 almost every single analyst covering ATVI has a price target above $110. These upgrades came in earlier in the year when the stock was over $90 per share. Most of the current price targets propose 50% upside to be seen.

https://preview.redd.it/2xxp8ee9har71.png?width=1808&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5217fb8322a3636bcd82d3dc8ad57e6319af956

&#x200B;

**Financials**

&#x200B;

*Income Statement*

If you need further confirmation from the tailwinds ATVI has experienced from the start of covid here’s a breakdown revenues over the last several years.

https://preview.redd.it/myeuj7r9har71.png?width=1496&format=png&auto=webp&s=05f87d69ecf8f5cd732c8780eb9bea3b9c2c4a75

&#x200B;

*Balance Sheet*

The company also has a very strong balance sheet sitting on 8.6 billion in cash, and cash equivalents. This provides huge amounts of leverage for potential acquisitions of smaller IP to even further expand their empire or develop new IP with comprehensive story-lines, media, and  digital assets.

https://preview.redd.it/di22oseahar71.png?width=1294&format=png&auto=webp&s=daa00861644b2521fdfa672a8db6812847c6f01d

&#x200B;

**Final Thoughts**

When we compare ATVI to one of their biggest competitors, Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), they are pound-for-pound trading at similar valuations with similar metrics (although ATVI does nearly 3x the sales). ATVI’s addressable market will continue to expand with tailwinds effecting the entire gaming industry and they have positioned themselves well to continue dominating the industry. Over the last three months ATVI’s share price has seen a 20% decline from $95 to now $79 per share. Trading at a P/E of 23 it is my opinion that given the strength of their pipeline ATVI is under-valued here with downside being limited."

ADBE - Let your creativity loose. Just pay us a subscription price to do so.

AMZN - We’re not satisfied with world domination. Space is next.

BRK.B - Because you’re too poor to afford BRK.A.

GOOG - We know even more of your secrets than FB.

INTC - We used to be the kings of our class. Then we took an arrow from AMD.

Reasons NNDM is a good investment.
1. Partnerships with big names in the military (hendsolt) scientific community (NASA) and just recently announced to be working with Google.
2. Smart acquisitions (nanofabrica to allow them to produce small parts e.g. micro syringes for medical use and deep cube an AI company that can allow their 3d printing machines to problem solve and produce needed parts themselves once integrated) with more acquisitions to come.
3. Institutions are quietly loading up, the most prominent being Cathy Woods ARK who own over 18 million shares and counting, othrr institutions are also following their example.
4. Low market cap it is currently trading at around cash value ~1.4 billion, this of course leaves us with a very high sealing for growth.
5. Hedge funds bought $500 million worth of NNDM at their last offering at ~$12. If institutions believed in them at that price why wouldn't we at current prices now the company is in a better position?
6. 3d printing is the future of manufacturing and NNDM will be one of the leaders."

They operate an open API platform that allows company's to develop custom physical and digital credit cards to solve unique problems. For example Door Dash uses it to only allow its couriers to use the card at the right restaurant at the right time to cut down on fraud.

Another use case is they recently created another platform that allows companies such as Coinbase to allow customers to spend digital currencies at any place that accepts VISA. (by instantly transferring digital currencies to fiat and vice versa).

Business Model: Marqeta makes money on interchange. This means they take a small percentage (0.45%) on every transaction they process. In 2020 Marqeta processed roughly $60 Billion which accounts for less than 1% of the global payments markets.

Institutional View:

Yet, we go out of our ways to select certain brands over others - most of the time at a higher price \[1\]. Everyone knows the importance of reputation for a company. Highly reputable brands have multiple things going for them:

* Their customers are extremely loyal and drive recurring purchases
* The public is vocal about recommending their brand and products
* Easier to expand to other markets as their reputation precedes them

Basically, you can consider having a great reputation to be a positive feedback loop on steroids! In an economy where 70-80% of the market value of a company comes from intangible assets like brand equity, intellectual capital, and goodwill \[2\], reputations can make or break a company’s performance.

In one of my previous analyses, we had discovered and proved that the [best companies to work for routinely beat the market in stock returns](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ok4l9c/i_analyzed_the_performance_of_companies_in_the/). So this week, let’s see how the most reputed brands have performed over the last decade!

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/e1y8b3xtp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=050451ab56c0dd05014ff5207231fc40766dadcf)

**Data**

While there are multiple companies that measure reputation, I chose the [RepTrack](https://www.reptrak.com/) list for my analysis as they seem to be the most established ones and have been creating their top 100 list for the last 2 decades.

They base their study on more than 240K responders over 15+ countries and the rating tells us how the companies are regarded by the general public. They have multiple factors that go into the final ranking, but for this analysis, I am only considering the final rank of the company.

I am considering the companies that were present in the Top 10 list at least once in the last decade \[2012 - 2021\]

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/w05hhrxtp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=5827fd247cb15d12bd50ac6746134c6bb6dac330)

**Analysis**

RepTrack publishes their result in March, every year. Since I could not find any fixed date of publication, for the purpose of the stock price calculation, I am using April 1st of every year as my investment date.

Even though the company produces a Top 100 list, I have limited my analysis to the Top 10 companies \[3\]. We then calculate the stock returns generated by these companies \[4\] over various time periods (1-year, 3-years, 5-years & till date) and then compare it to our benchmark. \[5\]

https://preview.redd.it/serqaextp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=18f15aea04e8a6decc25ff972c0bb01110d65bb5

 **Results** 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/hdjeau7zp8q71.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=a50598f9162d4b211dce3f202ff26e87296c52d8)

Companies in the most reputable list have consistently beaten SPY over different time periods. There is a significant improvement in overall return when holding the investment for a longer-term.

My hypothesis here is that, even though the short-term returns can be affected by market cycles, over the long run, companies having a great reputation end up outperforming their peers, and this is reflected in their stock price.

https://preview.redd.it/shv1yw10q8q71.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b85dbf0596b22f9d93bfa3f1cd954f012e9e796

 Another interesting insight we can derive from the data is the performance of the top-10 companies in each year’s list. As we can see, the most reputable brands beat SPY by a considerable margin in 7/10 years \[6\]. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/m10k3451q8q71.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=af6fb32d2245b0a5bc5d157d0931a91872716761)

But, before you YOLO your next paycheck into this strategy, do note that most of the returns were contributed by tech companies \[5\]. This is expected given the tech rally we had over the past decade. What is more interesting is how difficult it is to lose money investing in the top brands. Only 4 companies that were in the top 10 list over the past decade had a negative return. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/gz1th2ytp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab684cf2e2d4a3584b1c3590965c804bba19c284)

**Limitations to the Analysis**

There are some limitations to the above analysis that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy.

* Ideally, the backtest should be done over 30-40 year’s worth of data as we would know how the changing trends would impact the analysis. The last decade or so was predominantly biased towards tech.
* One should also benchmark this against the companies having an average or poor reputation to see if reputation is indeed a distinguishing factor that is driving the returns. \[7\]
* Finally, reputation is just one factor related to the company. There are companies whose reputations are in the gutter but have produced extraordinary returns for their shareholders (Facebook gave 175% return & Volkswagen gave 117% return in the last 5 years even after all the scandals they have been through).

**Conclusion**

Whether you like it or not, brands seem to have a significant impact on our daily lives. Just think about the number of times you/your friend have sworn by a brand and recommended it to everyone \[8\]. Almost all the brands in the top 10 list (eg. Rolex, Ferrari, Adidas, Harley-Davidson) have users that are extremely loyal, willing to pay a premium, and acts as unofficial spokespersons for the company.

Our analysis, in turn, proves that all these positive factors cause the company to outperform the market! So now you know what to do next time when your friend is swearing by a brand.

Until next week…

**Footnotes and Existing Research**

\[1\] [This great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eIDBV4Mpek&ab_channel=BigThink) by Big Think showcases how Apple and Nike have spent billions of dollars for creating a positive brand image in our brains and most of us, in the end, are not rational customers.

\[2\] [Reputation and Its Risks](https://hbr.org/2007/02/reputation-and-its-risks) \- Harvard Business Review

\[3\] The main reason for stopping with the Top 10 is the manual data pull process. They do not give a stock ticker associated with the stock nor is the list easily parsable. Given we are pulling data for 10 years, I limited myself to the top 10 companies.

\[4\] A stock is only considered if it’s directly investable from the US market and is an independent company (Examples of companies ignored - Rolex, LEGO Group, and Bosch)

\[5\] Before you come at me with Pitchforks for using S&P 500 instead of Nasdaq Composite, please take a look at the list of companies. It’s from a wide variety of industries. Adding to this, even though tech provided the majority of returns, starting in 2012, you would not have any idea about the tech run we would be having over the next decade.

\[6\] I don’t think 2020 and 2021 should be counted here due to two reasons. First, it’s not enough time as we can see from the first graph (there is very little difference in performance over 1 year period), and secondly, 2020 was one of the largest bull runs in the history of SPY.

\[7\] [This report](https://www.rankingthebrands.com/PDF/Global%20RepTrak%20100%20Report%202016,%20Reputation%20Institute.pdf) by RepTrack shows the impact the Emission Scandal had on Volkswagen

\[8\] Micheal Platt, Professor of Neuroscience at Yale [did a study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eIDBV4Mpek&ab_channel=BigThink) that showcased that Apple users show brain empathy response to the Apple brand exactly the same way they would to a family member. Strangely, Samsung users did not have any positive or negative responses when good or bad news was released about the brand"

Hello boys n girls... So what's going on? Well... Lucid is having a PR event at their AZ factory this week. Word in the swamps? They are getting ready to announcing the first set of deliveries for the Lucid Air and confirming delivery dates! It's been speculated for awhile that the first deliveries was going to be sometime between Q3-Q4. There has been uncertainty with the chip shortage... but with this news, short$ will shit themselves.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR;**

# LCID hitting production runs hard, will announce first deliveries schedule this week. Official EPA rating of 520 range. Plus with PIPE lockup expired 9/1, most of short term investors are done dumping shares. With that, and a week long PR event, very good chance they will set a date, and send the stock to URANUS!

*<begin\_plagiarism>*

Lucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone\*.

In 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.

In 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site\*. Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase\*, with early construction already having begun\*. Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to > 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes\*.

Lucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a ""two horse race.""\* In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21\*, bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as ""post-luxury,"" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence\*.

▶ **TECHNOLOGY:**

***Motor***\*: Lucid utilizes a *permanent-magnet synchronous motor* which is much more efficient than a traditional induction motor (eg, those used by Tesla until the Model 3). Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire → more resistance → more heat → decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***

Lucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds\*. Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o1stpusvzyp71.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb7eff1951a48874c28474791856d75dea6120ba

***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (""dumb range""). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I2R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)\*:

Higher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW\*. The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW\*.

For battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier\*. While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)\*. Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.

It should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells\*. This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week.

Some have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips—it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*—the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.

***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform\*. It allows compatibility with—and the maximizing of—charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).

***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their ""Full Self-Driving"" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities\*. Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available on Lucid's website\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**

**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:

\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now\*

**Gravity SUV**: ""Project Gravity"" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market\*. Prototypes have already been built\* using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.

Project Gravity SUV

**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **CHARGING:**

Charging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships\*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \~20kW and DC charging up to \~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo\*.

Tesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.

Modern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

**▶ PEOPLE:**

Lucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resumés from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.

**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO/CTO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979\*. Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)\*. At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production\*. Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer (CTO) before being promoted to CEO in 2019\*. Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter\*; however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted\*.

**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021\*. Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)\*. She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.

**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy\*. Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally\*. Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.

**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors\*. At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.

Besides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com\*. There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly\*, expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**

**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020\*. This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.

**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.

**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of >500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.

**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid’s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:

* 2021 - 577 vehicles
* 2022 – 20,000 vehicles
* 2023 – 49,000 vehicles
* 2024 – 90,000 vehicles
* 2025 – 135,000 vehicles
* 2026 – 251,000 vehicles

*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021*\*. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year\*\*\*\*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.\*

**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026\*. Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**\*.

&#x200B;

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **FUTURE DIRECTION:**

Peter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California\*. They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they’re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life\*. Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/buq3dei60zp71.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3a2698ee2c34a0a37850630aa50d9bf43d0beb3

As a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.

Lucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022\* and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018\*. If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**

**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:

*CompanyValuation (8/22/2021)Total debtPrice-to-sales (P/S) ratio*Tesla (TSLA)$673.5 billion$11.1 billion (6/2021)\*18.33\*Toyota (TM)$226.8 billion$24.5 trillion (6/2021)\*0.81\*Volkswagen (VWAGY)$144.6 billion$219.2 billion (6/2021)\*0.51\*General Motors (GM)$70.8 billion$111.1 billion (6/2021)\*0.51\*Nio (NIO)$57.9 billion$2.7 billion (6/2021)\*12.7\*Honda (HMC)$50.7 billion$7.7 trillion (6/2021)\*0.37\*Ford (F)$50.2 billion$148.2 billion (6/2021)\*0.37\*Lucid (LCID)$35.1 billion$179 million\*N/A \*(see below)\*Xpeng$30.8 billion$2.7 billion (3/2021)\*N/ALi$27.1 billion$3.9 billion (3/2021)\*N/AFisker (FSR)$3.9 billion$20.2 million (6/2021)\*N/A

This is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026\*. *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion\*. *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).

For comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.

With this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52\* so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO\*.

pwma91,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pwma91/increased_buying_activity_from_insiders_at_oscar/,Increased buying activity from insiders at Oscar Health ($OSCR),19,15,2021-09-28 01:41:46,"Oscar Health ($OSCR) — a tech company who wants to rethink health insurance — has been bouncing back from its all-time low registered mid-August. **Insiders have been accumulating shares ever since**. It started mostly with Joshua Kusher, general partner at Thrive Capital, one of the VCs that funded $OSCR — him being also a co-founder of the company and current vice-chairman. Two weeks ago, Mario Schlosser (CEO) also bought for **$1M in shares at open market** (with a $17.53 cost basis); a move worth noticing, given executives at tech companies rarely buy shares in this fashion, but rather exercise options attributed through their compensation package.

In total, **insiders have bought $68M worth of shares in Q3 2021**, and only pocketed $464k in sales over the same period ([source](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/OSCR/insider-trades/)).

I lack the time to do a proper walkthrough of all the fundamentals, but while the stock hasn't get much coverage either here or elsewhere on the web, I have seen some fairly good posts (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pglzfj/oscr_seriously_undervalued_growth_stock_with_some/)) and articles ([this one](https://newsfilter.io/articles/oscar-health-a-misunderstood-and-undervalued-stock-0b0d2c55c2ee659bcbdaf36ee950268e), for instance) tackling them more in depth. Feel free to take a look.

IMO, their numbers game is starting to show some promising results. **Membership has increased 34.9% YoY and premiums earned have surged 364.3% YoY**. Their costs have been rising too, but I am pretty confident in their ability to scale the business as they have yet to penetrate many states, which will hopefully help in spreading out operating expenses.

The company has been backed by **world-class investors that include Google Ventures or Founders Fund** (i.e. Peter Thiel's VC). As a last note, they also beat last earnings estimates by 25%. Management has a solid track record and am overall bullish on their long-term prospects. **It received a “buy“ rating from most analysts with an average target price at $22.83** ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/oscr/analystestimates?mod=mw_quote_tab)).

$OSCR is still down \~50% from IPO levels, but **momentum has been going strong** this past month and a half and I expect things to keep moving upwards if we have a quick look to technicals. See below for total price action since IPO:

&#x200B;

[Will $OSCR break the ceiling \(around \~$20\)?](https://preview.redd.it/aq11s2mb13q71.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4116deb2204fccd2f0d52352a98f2a4df7f88bf)

As always, you are entitled to your own research and due diligence. I believe $OSCR's innovative approach makes it well-positioned to scale a succeeding business on the ridiculously huge healthcare industry — with a **TAM of $4T (yes, trillions!)** in the U.S. alone.

I would like to share my ongoing DD on high short interest stocks, methodology, and conservative but high ROI plays moving into October. It's exhausting now as everything now is considered a ""short squeeze"" but I would like shed some light on relatively safe plays and reasoning behind it. This methodology will always change based on data presented. The #1 rule in this is that you don't want to chase on plays that are being run. What I do for myself is to get in plays based on data/method that are not running (pre-squeeze), scale into the stock, wait for the catalysts, and then scale out of the stock once it starts running. See below:

Methodology/Criteria:

1. I am looking at high short interest stocks on MarketWatch and HighShortInterestStocks continuously for the top 10 tickers (you can find these sites via Google and make sure to look at it continuously!). S3 has good information but I don't pay for the data.
2. Market cap over $1.5B per WSB rules but you can use this methodology to find other smaller cap plays yourself outside of WSB. ($ROOT, $NKLA, $GOEV, and $SDC are the only stocks in the Top 10 lists that have >$1.5B market cap).
3. I look for the following requirements (STRICT) and they must all be present at any given time.

a. The first requirement is the stock must be close to a 52 week low or close/below the 200 MA- you can also follow the YTD Change %. You want to make sure you are buying value and not stocks that are down because they are truly terrible companies.

b. The second requirement is the stock must have catalysts in the short term horizon- this allows for anticipation of upside and call option flow. The most % of money I ever made was purchasing stocks/calls in their pre-squeeze stage before they actually squeezed. This way you don't get IV crushed while chasing but as the IV builds, you gain massively on calls. If you are purchasing calls when the IV is at or less than 90% and a catalyst hits that takes the IV >130%, these are massive gains.

c. The third requirement is that the stock float must be shorted >30%. Low float stocks aren't a requirement although they help in certain situations.

d. The 4th requirement are technicals. The one set up I always play is a falling wedge as long as it meets the requirements above. I also love playing cup and handles and bull flags as they are the most consistent. I do not play symmetrical triangles or wedges- I feel as though these are more unpredictable.

e. The other dataset that I look at are call/put ratio and open interest on call options. This can tell you how bullish or bearish generally the market is for the future. A large amount of OI on calls means people are anticipating something significant.

4) Scale In with stock/call purchases based on risk/reward ratio. Make sure to SCALE IN. This doesn't mean purchasing all at one time. I usually purchase not in time increments but in % decrease increments (on average -5%) to be safe and purchase 90% stock / 10% calls (>3 months out) to scale in below based on my own risk management. If I want to go riskier/higher reward, I will increase the amount of calls or shorten the call expiration date. But I strongly advise purchasing calls >3 month out exp.

i.e. Day 1: 90% stock / 10% calls (20% of capital) and then repeat when the stock price drops 5%. If the stock price jumps, I don't scale up as many might do. I just move onto another play. Holding CASH is always a position.

5) Once the catalyst hits or there is upside to the stock, I scale out of my positions/gains (not all at one time). Make sure you follow volume - if the volume is strong, you can hold onto your positions much longer to get maximum ROI.

6) Rinse, repeat, and share with others on your plays.

The stock that I am most interested in right now is $ROOT and I've evaluated the others- please feel free to drop in comments what you would like for me to evaluate. Right now it is the #4 most shorted stock on MarketWatch and HighShortInterestStocks. I will let you know my thoughts on the others in the comments thread and why $ROOT is better vs. others like $SDC. I do look at basic fundamentals to help my game and I do see that $ROOT has $1B in cash while trading at a market cap of $1.5B. They do have a catalyst on the horizon which is their Carvana partnership launch date, other insurance programs such as home insurace, etc. (haven't gotten hit by negative news except earnings), and for a reach, partnerships with electrical vehicle companies like $TSLA. The fact is that only telematics can truly determine how electric vehicle drivers drive instead of their credit scores, etc. and it's very difficult in getting insurance state by state. Short Interest is at 35%. Technically, they are in a falling wedge with it getting tighter- this is when I like to go riskier on calls as you could see a significant breakout. Let me know your thoughts and I will answer questions that you may have!

\*Edit 1: Hypothetically taking a position at $5.67/share price and March $7.5 2022 calls at $1.30 as of 9/27/21. Let's see how this does based on methodology. Not sure if there will be a 5% decrease but we'll watch.

With FDA clearance out of the way for their reader and a clear path to integrating with telemedicine as the app logs all test results it is a great integration partner (this means you can get telemedicine diagnostic treatment at home).

The test are dead simple to use for covid and the reader is designed to enable tests using swabs, blood (future), and saliva (future) so the number and types of tests they can expand into is large.

Their existing partnerships are also key to gaining an install base with their readers. The over the counter nature is great but they also have the Department of Defense, Google, Netflix  , and a few other big companies as customers. Not to mention customers that are health providers.

Users will be insulated from any pricing as the tests for Covid will be picked up by the people who are requiring them (schools/employers/venues/etc). Regardless where you stand, at least some states/schools/clubs/venues/employers will want to have assurances of negative Covid tests. Cue has already launched a “for schools” and the NBA bubble story will be a key part of their marketing.

The fast tracking of FDA clearance due to covid, along with the federal money they took last year,  means they have great relationships with the FDA. For upcoming pregnancy, fertility, RSV, and flu tests that means their path to regulation is way smoother than competitors.

The pregnancy/fertility angle also is a great first step as it means young parents will become accustomed to using over the counter tests by them- and be a useful install base when those kids enter school and daycare. Those parents will wind up needing the peace of mind they don’t have flu or RSV. And this isn’t one test and down- for Covid at least it’s possible to run through 5-10 tests in a family within a few days.

With a total market cap at pricing of around $2.9B this seems like an underpricing. The unit economics is of a razor/razor blade business mode are already good plus add in that their razor blades are purchasable within an FSA, HSA, or via insurance provider and it’s even more appealing.

Based on last years deal they are scaling production already to 100k tests/day. Assume the readers sell for nothing, and they do production 250 days a year- At $20/test (totally reasonable revenue even with a reseller) they are looking at $750M revenue annually. And this fund raise is to SCALE UP production. Even back of the napkin math works well for them just in the next 2 years of Covid tests alone.

Company has customers like Google, government and even did tests for the NBA. 

Also have products for men’s/women’s health.

Here are the results!,473,62,2021-09-23 19:47:23,"There is an old saying on Wall Street.

>There are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy.

If you think about it, you can sell stocks for any number of reasons - downpayment for a house, a medical emergency, or just plain profit booking. But when you are using your hard-earned money to purchase a stock, there is only one reason. You expect the stock price to go up!

It’s not a hard stretch to imagine that company insiders who are in high-ranking positions (CXO’s, VP’s, Presidents, etc.) would have a better understanding of the company and its expected future performance than any financial analysts out there who are just working with publically available data. So if these well-informed insiders are making significant stock purchases, does that mean they expect the stock price to shoot up soon?

In this week’s analysis let’s put this to the test. **Can you beat the market if you follow the stock purchases made by company insiders?**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/m9sysws7q8p71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bf5ce5f116d2868df8f6ab27f6ed95c9acdc020)

**Data**

The data for this analysis was taken from **openinsider.com**

it’s a free-to-use website that tracks all the trades reported on SEC Form 4 \[1\]. While there are a lot of transactions that are reported daily to the SEC, I kept the following conditions to reduce noise in the data.

* Only transactions done by CXO’s, VP’s and Presidents (people who have a significant view of the company strategy and operations) are considered.
* A minimum transaction value of 100K
* The transaction should be purchase (Not a grant, gift, or purchase due to options expiration)

The financial data used in the analysis is obtained from Yahoo Finance.

&#x200B;

**Analysis**

For all the transactions, I calculated the stock price change across different time periods (One Week, 1-Month, 3-Months, 6 Months & 1 Year) and then benchmarked the returns against S&P500 over the same time period.

My hypothesis for choosing different time periods was to understand at what point would you generate the maximum alpha (if we realize any) over the benchmark. All the results are checked for outliers so that one or two stocks are not biasing the whole result.

https://preview.redd.it/kerfnbx7q8p71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d3d333f091a87092524cc5ea60d0aa6c4e629c2

 **Results** 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/x7q1vl4bq8p71.png?width=909&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2843326924fa28ae8f23dad9a146070876d793e)

Surprisingly, if you had followed the insider purchases, you would have beaten SPY across all 5 different timeframes. The alpha generated would also have increased with increasing timeframe with the insider purchase trades beating the S&P500 by a whopping 17.6% over the period of one year.

I have kept 1-year timeframe as my limit mainly due to two reasons. First, I started the analysis for identifying short-term plays, and secondly, given our entire dataset is over the last 4 years, anything more than 1 year would not have data for a significant chunk of our population which can affect the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/er4hb7zcq8p71.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee9739b8d6aabee08ed096b600e72ea64fa37d45

But the number of trades that made positive returns shows a different story. When compared to trading SPY, a lesser number of trades would have generated profits in the case of following insider purchases. The key here is that while the chances of your trading making a profit is lower, if it does end up making a profit, you would generally have had a better return than the market.

**Limitations to the Analysis**

There are some limitations to the above analysis that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the trades.

* The data I collected has a lot of small-cap companies which are inherently more risky than a large-cap index like S&P500. Given our returns are not risk-adjusted, the alpha we are seeing here might just be due to the higher risk you are taking on the trades \[2\]
* The analysis is limited to the last 4 years of data during which the markets were predominantly in a bull run (except the Covid-19 crash)
* Finally, this assumes that you will buy an equal amount of stock whenever a company insider does a trade which might not be practical given our inherent biases and apprehensions\[3\]

**Conclusion**

Usually, insider purchases are used to gauge the overall market sentiment. A very high proportion of sells over buys signify that insiders are losing confidence in the stock/industry and it’s time to get out of that market.

This analysis shows that the individual trades can be used for identifying stocks that are worth buying by analyzing the insider purchase patterns. This should be just considered as a primer into the topic as SEC Form 4 has a treasure trove of information \[4\].

You may or may not implement this strategy based on your investment style. But at the very least, you should check for the insider transaction pattern before investing in a particular security!

**Footnotes and Existing Research**

\[1\] SEC Form 4 is what an insider file when he/she makes a transaction. It’s expected to be filed within 2 days, but I observed more delay than that in many cases. For the purpose of this analysis, I have considered transactions that were reported no later than 10 days.

\[2\] [Estimating the Returns to Insider Trading: A Performance-Evaluation Perspective](https://econpapers.repec.org/article/tprrestat/v_3a85_3ay_3a2003_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a453-471.htm) : The study published by Leslie A. Jeng and Richard Zeckhauser of Harvard found that insider purchases beat the market by 11.2% per year. Even after adjusting for the risk using the CAPM model, the returns beat the market by 8.5%

\[3\] Very few people have the ability to keep their emotions away from the trades when a significant chunk of their money is at stake.

\[4\] You can filter for the role of the insider (for eg, if you want to track only the CEO purchase/sales), industry, percentage ownership change, the current value of stock owned, etc. There are thousands of permutations in which you can do this analysis to find some alpha.

\[5\] Multiple research papers over the last 3-4 decades \[[eg.1](https://jbepnet.com/journals/Vol_4_No_3_September_2017/5.pdf), [eg.2](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/the-insider-trading-anomaly-recent-academic-studies-591/)\] have shown that insider purchases significantly outperformed the market

pt79cw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pt79cw/i_think_i_worked_out_what_has_had_burry_and/,"I think I worked out what has had Burry and others worked up about Evergrande. Is this GFC 2.0, featuring our new friend the Orphan SPV?",305,129,2021-09-22 21:12:40,"Ok, so I have done a little research on this topic, and what the fallout from Evergrande could look like. I was bouncing around on twitter and I saw Michael Burry was getting all worked up about Evergrande. Now, I have no background in finance other than a personal interest in learning, but from my limited understanding I could not see anything at first in the information he linked and from other sources to that would point to a widespread collapse like he was claiming. I mean, Evergrande is big, but they hold $300+ billion in assets. Even if they are forced to restructure the losses could not be that bad globally right?  They only have about $18 Billion in foreign bonds outstanding on the international market, how could that lead to a global crash? Sure, the slowdown in China overall as a result will cause pain to some countries, like Australia, but not a global crash right?  
  
So I did a little more digging, and one of the things the data Burry linked to very specifically in his tweet said to look at the dates, in relation to the bonds starting to devalue in May this year. Well, thanks to the power of google, I learn that in May China started to crack down on 'shadow lending' or 'off the books lending' right when their public bonds started to turn to dog poo.  
  
And here we go, the rabbit hole. What the hell is shadow lending?   
  
Well, it all starts with this little policy China introduced in August last year to slow down the growth of their insane property markets. It is called the three line policy. I won't bore you with the details, google exists, go use it if you want. The TL;DR is if developers in China cross these lines in how much debt they have compared to assets, the amount of new debt they can take on is restricted. You cross all three, you turn red and can no longer grow the amount of debt you have. At least not on the books anyway... Evergrande crossed that line last year, it has not been allowed to 'legally' grow the amount of debt it has since then.   
  
Bring in the shadow banking system! The orphan special purpose vehicle. From my understanding, this system works much like this. Evergrande spins up what is called an orphan special purpose vehicle, this SPV, if it is based offshore, does not need to follow the laws in place in regards to the three red lines. Evergrande can then use the funds in that SPV like they would a loan, but without having to declare it on their books at all, they don't technically own the debt, some other fake business in say, the Caymans does in return for interest that Evergrande just happens to pay (or not).  
  
So, what does this mean?! Well... this is what I think Burry and others have been attempting to warn us about. What we know about the extent of Foreign debt in China is only the tip of the iceberg. Evergrande and other developers in China may hold much higher international liabilities than anyone is aware of, these SPV's are off the books, unrelated to Evergrande in any way other than being a source of liquidity for them to use. Who paid in to these SPV's? What is the total value of debt outstanding? If they get restructured will they repay these SPV's? No one knows... Well, some people do, but they are not talking. Ever since they have been restricted from issuing new bonds, or taking out loans, they have had to have been getting cash from somewhere and their asset sales are simply not enough to cover their costs to continue to grow, especially at the discounted prices recently.    
  
I know this is a wall of text but I think this might be very important and could be why some of the largest international investment funds have been in talks with Evergrande and the CCP. This problem could be much larger than anyone knows. Many international entities may have much more exposure to Evergrande and other aspects of the Chinese real estate market than anyone understands and when they get restructured those SPV investors will certainly be left holding the bag. Is this literally GFC 2.0, did those hedge funds and investment firms get greedy again and try to take a larger slice of the massive $50 Trillion dollar Chinese real estate market with SPVs? Is that what has Burry and others all worked up? Am I being incredibly 'Smooth brain' and missing something key here? Please let me know because I am more than a little concerned now."

So we will see if the mods even allow this.I thought to myself the other day about “apex” companies. These are the companies that are far and away the leading companies in their space.   


For example:  
Social Media:   
Facebook  
Online Shopping (and cloud..): Amazon  
Search: Google  
Smartphones: Apple  
EV cars: Tesla

You get the idea. But what I was moderately surprised at was the **lack of social media** **marketing** company. When a company is scheduling things to advertise on Instagram, responding to your whining on Twitter, or answering customer queries via Whatsapp, what are they using? **If you’re a top company, they’re using Sprinklr.**

Go look for yourself. What’s Amazon’s Twitter using? What’s Google’s Twitter using? What’s ESPN (Disney) using?  


Other examples of companies that use Sprinklr (as of Q2):  
Netflix  
Microsoft  
Twitter  
Amazon

Google  
The Marines (yep, it’s been government-certified)  
TSA  
Accenture

Deloitte  
McDonalds (tendies)

If you work at a big company, you’ll recognize there are a lot of disparate tools being used in a similar function. Social Media management is no different. At its simplest, Sprinklr allows companies to organize content across platforms, easily respond to customers through different channels, and analyze the outcomes. This is exceedingly valuable to companies in order to manage their social media (helping with marketing efficiency, customer service outcomes, social listening, etc.)

There are also much deeper integrations here as well, but we will start with that. Now, how much do you think a company would be worth, given that the majority of the Fortune 100 uses their services? What if I told you they had 74+ customers generating over $1M each on a yearly basis? What if I said they had about 1000 other customers, with average subscription revenue (yearly) of $350K each?

Well, whatever you had in your head - the current market cap of Sprinklr is roughly $4.3BN. By EoY, they’re expecting (their prediction from Q2 earnings) to generate \~$415M in revenue (22% growth YoY).

However, I believe it’s generally undervalued for a variety of reasons.

1. They are recognizing revenue from subscriptions (90% of their revenue) as it happens, not when the deals are signed. I believe their estimates to be really low. Consider that there are 74 customers with at least $1M in yearly subscription revenue, and they themselves have stated they have 1000 customers with an average yearly value of $350K (as of June 23).Well, if you just took the average value X 1000 customers, + $74M, you’re already at $424M revenue. And no doubt, there are more customers signed since June, and no doubt some of the 74 “big” customers are spending much more than $1M annually. They also have the opportunity to upsell their current customers. **TL;DR** they’re clearly going to be way ahead of their projected earnings and will continually revise earnings skyward.
2. This is a really sticky industry. The companies that put the amount of work to migrate to use Sprinklr aren’t going to change to a different provider easily (and frankly, a single competitor doesn’t really exist). Retention is likely to be extremely high.
3. Sprinklr is **really early**. The fact that they have the majority of the biggest companies on the planet signed bodes well for their future. They have now stated they’re targeting the next biggest 30000 companies, and their sales pipeline/staff has started to ramp up (paused all of last year). I would expect many more companies to be signed here; additionally, I expect additional products to be released that can be upsold to existing customers (live chat analysis, liter-research platforms - they just announced something like this called Modern Research Lite - etc.)

Anyway, I could say a lot more, but by this point I either have your interest or not. A few things to conclude with -

1. Look at companies in an adjacent space to them. Qualtrics (survey + experience management company) - $23BN. Zendesk (mainly customer support/comms) - $14.5BN. Liveperson (a stock that literally just does chat on a website) - $4.7BN. Take any comp you want - probably undervalued.
2. Sprinklr does have a competitor called **Sprout Social**. Sprout is awesome too, and much more targeted at small companies. I’m invested in Sprout as well; they’ve been on a rocketship recently ($7.3BN cap with $132M in yearly rev). However, I like Sprinklr over Sprout for a variety of reasons.. But the main one? **Trust what the top companies on Earth are using**. And I will take their judgment on this one. There’s probably room for both to succeed, but Sprout is much more narrow in my mind.
3. All wall street analyst PTs are above current price, with the lowest at $21 and the highest at $29.
4. There is basically **zero** ETF ownership of this, which is absurd as Sprout has **60** ETFS that contain it. I would be shocked if ETFs didn’t start picking this up, which will likely lead to a quick upswing in price because the amount of outstanding shares is quite low (high amount of institutional shares held, but can’t be sold).
   1. This has led to volatility recently (5-7% up and down days), but it doesn’t seem to be reflected in options pricing as IV is \~60-70%. Options not a bad idea.

TL;DR Sprinklr is undervalued. Massive opportunity. I think it could be the “Salesforce of Social Media Management”. Position = 2600 shares and 38 Feb 20 calls.

Matterport ($MTTR) boasts a suite of 3D cameras and mobile apps which work in conjunction with their 3D virtual tour software (think Google street view in HD). They currently dominate the virtual tour space in the hottest real estate markets around the world. In recent years, Matterport has enabled purchasers to view properties remotely with a fully comprehensive experience beyond traditional photography. To date, they are literally the only viable virtual tour service providers in the real estate industry, and their book of subscribers are growing fast.

But the use case scenarios don’t end here. Matterport has been heavily growing and quickly adopted as a standard in insurance and property restoration.

They’ve also recently made strategic partnerships in the luxury yacht space which has helped boost their stock 32% in the first week of September.

The use cases and benefits of Matterport are quite literally limitless (from Airbnb’s to construction management, to retail augmented reality) and they have first movers advantage into the space.

$MTTR has seen explosive subscriber growth. 

>“\[Their\]software has already been used to scan millions of buildings in over 150 countries. Its number of customers rose from 14,000 in 2018 to 40,000 in 2019, then soared to over 250,000 last year -- including more than 13% of the Fortune 1000.”

**Financial Outlook**

>“Its number of managed spaces rose from 1.4 million in 2018 to 2.3 million in 2019 before jumping to 4.4 million in 2020. Matterport claims there are about four billion buildings with 20 billion spaces worldwide, and they represent a total addressable market of more than $240 billion.  
>  
>At an average monthly rate of $1 per space per month, Matterport could generate billions of dollars in annual revenue by capturing just a sliver of the market.  Based on that opportunity, the company believes its market cap could surpass $100 billion long term.”

Matterport projects $747M of annual revenue by 2025 with margins expanding from 48-73% and backs their claim with an incredibly high customer retention rate.

They’ve reported consecutive revenue beats and their latest earnings report was no exception.

>“Matterport reports record revenue of $30 million, 10% sequential increase Subscription revenue jumps 53% to $15 million from year-ago period Total subscribers increased 158% to 404,000 from year-ago period.”

Profit remains negative, but they are in hyper growth right now so that’s to be expected.

This is a **fundamentally sound company** **priced WELL below its addressable market** and they are **FLUSH with cash** to take them to the stratosphere and beyond.

ps5dnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ps5dnm/lets_talk_bulls_and_bears_invited/,Let’s talk. Bulls and Bears invited!,37,93,2021-09-21 06:27:04,"I was asked by my pops when the correction was going to end, and it made me think that it was a good topic to have a discussion on with my favorite retards.

Here is my response

“Well, seeing as how everyone is over leveraged including hedge funds, it could pull back 10%. Right now it's at 5, and everyone swore it wouldn't get to 5 lol. 

The 50 EMA, which is the uptrending channel it's been on for the past year and a half, convincingly broke the past two trading sessions. It is now focused on the 100EMA, if it breaks that, youre looking at a fall to about 390/395 for the SPY, and 3800 for the SPX. (Spitballing here for you gay technical gurus)

To be honest though, I'm not buying that it will be a crash or a major correction past 7%. I believe it falls tomorrow and Wednesday, which allows me to make profit lol, and then soars Friday. There is no way the federal reserve 1) stops buying bonds at the rate they are doing, or 2) hike interest rates while delta variant is growing in the US.

Although the economy is showing good growth, and inflation is running rampid (not transitory like  they try to say), the fed will continue to print infinite money therefore ruining the economy and setting up another great financial crisis event. The crash will severely destruct the country. 

1. The debt ceiling raise is being opposed by the republicans , without that raise, America essentially defaults on debt, which makes the evergrande (you need to google that, that's important) situation look like a walk in the park. They are probably doing this to delay the infrastructure bill (which will ""help"" the economy by pumping even more money into it, therefore causing a crash)......excuse my language but basically either way we are in a shit ton of trouble . 

2. In terms of the bill, it's coinciding with a tax rate for every class, let's start from the bottom up, there is a 11 million dollars getting pumped into the stock market every day by retail investors, this is largely from shutdowns, stimulus checks, and no incentive to put money in savings (see: interest rates) this slows down when the public opens up unrestricted, and when taxes are hiked to pay for the bill. Now, here is the trick that is lost on a lot of people. The administration doesn't want to hike taxes for anyone under 400000, but what they are missing is taxes are being put on popular items that people under the 400000 limit typically spend their money on (see: tobacco), moving on from that, those with incomes ranging 400000 to 5 million will be taxed at 28%, this is the somewhat important money, not as much as corporations but has the ability to drive prices unlike retailers. A lot of loopholes like the mega roth back door and criptoe (see: mods 🙄)  being treated as a property rather than a security would be reversed. That has big implications into the next part. Corporations. The administration hopes to raise the tax rate on capital gains to 39%. The one thing the rich know how to do, is get around the system that was built for them to succeed. What this will do is force a further sell off by the big money in order to escape the new tax rate, and buy at a cheaper price in order to capitalize/make up for the tax rate during the economic recovery. The corporations will make off with more money than they had before, in a resurgent economy that is powered by the money of the only losing party who started the year and half rally in the first place, the retailers. 

3. I don't know if you remember, but I spoke to you all in the group chat about the federal reserve and their bond buying program, I was betting on that it stopped, but it didn't and reversed to its last ATH. The fed stated that the economy was not ready to go in its own and decided that tapering was off the table, the stock market rallied from its 2.5% low to an ATH in 3 hours. 10 days. 10 days later it created its last ATH (all time high) and has fallen for the past 3 weeks. Which is a clear sign that it is over valued. & furthermore, several fed board members have sold exactly at that ATH (which is illegal), Congress and pelosi has as well (which is illegal) and the only people who think the stock market will reverse back to ATH are, the retailers. The fed has two options, continue printing infinite amounts of money to stabilize a already stable economy further losing up the bubble to Great Depression proportions (which would not serve their best interest since they all have capitalized and SOLD already 😬) or taper the economy and have the equivalent of the great financial crisis sell off for the next month . Technicals or news doesn't move the markets, people do. 


I'm hoping for a 10% correction, which is healthy for the economy and also for my bank account, I've already made my profit thus far, but if it doesn't continue correction and reverses to all time highs, we are going to enter a year long recession. There just isn't anymore money to throw at the economy without it coming back. 

And technically, the S&P/Nasdaq are tech heavy and controlled by FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, google), if there is a sector rotation there isn't one single sector that can hold a candle to them. The economy will falter.”

I’m not the smartest in the world on any of these subjects. I suspect neither of you guys are either. Jokes are welcomed. And I’m also willing to learn on shit I was probably wrong on in here. CAN YOUUUU DIGGGG ITTTTT?! 

LET THE GAMES BEGIN!

TL;DR - What do you think about the correction, recovery, and future of the stock market?"

I’m a former bull who transitioned into a permabear. Until last week, I believed the downside to SPY and the wider economy were greater than the upside. 

***
     
So what changed?

***

# Background 

***

I caught wind of Evergrande before the wider public began losing its mind. I also did research on the Chinese Shadow Banking system (google it) in 2016-2017. Basically, China’s economy is one giant dumpster fire propped up by government intervention (kind of sounds like the US now huh?). 

***

Every dataset out of China is steaming garbage. The numbers are all made up to meet made up regulatory thresholds. The government hides default risk through constant intervention. Companies that seem strong are always propped up by stimulus behind the scenes. So Evergrande is really not much of a surprise. 

***

# Capital Controls

***

China has insane capital controls. As a result, there is little true US investment in China. Goldman Sachs and other big banks circumvent this somewhat by creating Chinese subsidiaries that are partially state-owned. Basically, the government ends up owning whatever US-based investment firm/enterprise you build in China. These capital controls essentially limited risk that US firms take on. Unless banks did some truly retarded shit (which is possible), then the contagion should be limited to their holdings (which appear to be limited). 


***

# Real Estate

***

As everyone knows, Chinese nationals love real estate. Evergrande blowing up with clearly force some wider sell offs as institutions try to deleverage. That’s expected. 

***

# REVERSE REPO

***

Now here’s the beauty of what JPOW did. The reverse repo facility acts as a sponge. I won’t go into details, but basically, it sucks up excess liquidity. The facility hit 1.2 TRILLION recently, meaning that instituions have so few asset buying opportunities that they rather park the cash at the Fed. This sponge will release liquidity when needed. If Evergrande truly isn’t bailed out, and there are liquidity ramifications in the US, it is my belief that this excess liquidity can more than cover any sort of shortfalls. 

***

Furthermore, I was a permabear because I saw tapering on the horizon. This will just prolong our money printing. 

***

TLDR: Evergrande might blow up, but we have enough liquidity to cover the partial fallout. BUY THE DIP!!!

​​4 ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:

* Transition from wet to dry etching
* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production
* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process
* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams

**Technical Analysis**

https://preview.redd.it/9brk0w620oo71.png?width=2668&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e9e48b60a203a512e916039a142c8f77362a176

Looking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.

**Conclusion**

The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out high dividends (\~1.56% annually) but does re-invest that money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.

Technicals Included.,101,96,2021-09-20 05:38:37,"So, there's a lot of confusion to $IRNT and I want to provide my perspective. I'm not a professional trader or anything like that.

$IRNT rose based on a few important things. The company itself, Super 8-K Redemption, Option Chain activity, CTB%, and Short Interest, as well as the traction it attracted.

**The company**: They're a Cyber Security Solutions enterprise. Their investment partners are Kleiner Perkins, CS Capital, and ForgePoint Capital. ([here](https://www.ironnet.com/company/about)) Their partners are Microsoft, AWS, CROWDSTRIKE, DomainTools, NUTANIX, Cortex XSoar, Paloalto, IBM Radar, Splunk, Splunk Soar, and SWIMLANE. ([Here](https://www.ironnet.com/company/partners/technology-partners)).

**Quick Summary for this quarter**:

* Solutions provider for cyber attacks, IronNet Cybersecurity (NYSE:IRNT)FQ2 revenue jumped 23% to $6.1M, subscription revenue grew to $5.8M vs. $5.3M last year.
* Annual Recurring Revenue (or ARR): $24.1M vs. $19.5M prior.
* Customer Count: 51 compared to 22 last year.
* Operating loss of $17M compared to $14.2M.
* Net loss: $17.2M compared to $14.3M.
* Cash and cash equivalents: $14.1M.
* **Outlook**: “Our cloud-based subscription revenue -- which grew to 60% of product revenue in the first half of the year, a 65% year-over-year growth rate -- is a strong proof point for the business and underscores the fully recurring aspect of our financial model. Our cloud focus coupled with the large deal formation that we are seeing reflects IronNet’s ease of deployment and increasing market recognition, which keeps us on pace to double ARR in the third quarter and meet our growth objectives for the full year.” said James Gerber, CFO.
* **FY Guidance**: Revenue of $43M-45M; ARR of $75M as of end of the fiscal year.
* The stock has a market cap of $1.64B and has seen a jump in price of \~19% over the last five trading days.
* Recent bullish rating on the stock by contributor who writes, 'IronNet Is Extremely Undervalued At $20'
* Previously (Sept. 14): IronNet misses on revenue
* Shares jump \~14% during pre-market hours.

**The Public Float**:

Regarding the [Super 8-K](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-263381/), this has reduced the float to anywhere between 1.3M to 6M. Additional, [8-K](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-272930/) before Super 8-K filing for those who like to read these.

It's looking like the float is realistically between 2.7M - 3.5M. Extremely low and the reason why it moves so easily. Looks like on Friday the shorts and MM won that battle. SI% actually increased on Friday and every Call Above $30.00 was OTM and was definitely mostly written by MM's.

Here's the **Option Chain** for October 15th:

[Option Activity for Oct. 15th](https://preview.redd.it/7vo75izu3jo71.png?width=884&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bcdbf55d6840ea2e839d1a5412046c0e83fa15f)

**Short Interest & CTB%**:

Short Interest was at 58% of the float before Friday, and the shorts have actually increased on Friday. Also, I can't access Ortex but I saw a video today of someone looking it up and saw the increase. Anyone with access to confirm on Monday would be great. Don't forget to use the shares amount shorted and divide by the current float.

The CTB% is above 500% this is from iborrowdesk. I know some will debate data etc, but even if you cut that in half thats still outrageous.

[IBorrowDesk](https://preview.redd.it/nl2z9cjx3jo71.png?width=518&format=png&auto=webp&s=c482c55c65282bd5a7d19c17e4b481c2a535e5e8)

When the weeks start and more data is published this will need to be monitored.

**Technicals**:

First off, the Fibonacci Retracement (5 day, 5 Min):

[Fibonacci Retracement \(5 Day, 5 Min\)](https://preview.redd.it/lohhsia40ko71.jpg?width=1834&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f530524a5595f76e317f2269c4389aa437a7d6d)

You can also see my entry position with the green arrow. If this picture is too blurry, the support/resistances are $19.24, $27.11, $33.29, $37.63, $41.97, $47.34, and $56.06.

Started the line with the lowest point before September 14th. These are levels to check throughout the week and especially Monday and Tuesday. We're looking to support at $33.39. If we can maintain support above $27.11 and support strong resistance that'll be positive, if we break $27.11, the next resistance line is $19.24. This is were things can get weary as this can be a sign of a negative trend. Good thing is this company seems rock solid, and is being evaluated at <$20.00. But keep this in mind.

Looking to see if a Cup and Handle will form:

[Cup and Handle Example](https://preview.redd.it/gbv44fw24jo71.png?width=834&format=png&auto=webp&s=823caf5853fd090c12099c1893b43b063a39ff2c)

MACD:

RSI:

This is also a stock that is trending heavily, so, technicals can't be completely relied on. Only next week will determine that.

**Google Trends**:

&#x200B;

[7 Day Trend, Friday is still highly trending, the flat line is beacause of the weekend.](https://preview.redd.it/ad2upoca4jo71.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfa2a677644ee0e7d378f8a4af5bcc01aad9cb79)

[30 Day Trend](https://preview.redd.it/dcjxb0cc4jo71.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=d00ba95bfb1c9aa6e79a0eb1c3c33bea0a41a9d0)

With this stock closing at $30, if we test support we can very much expect bullish sentiments. If over the next few days support isn't being tested, then supports become resistance.

This stock is highly shorted, has a very large ITM Option Activity, very small float, and a high CTB%.

I think there's a lot that can come out of this stock, but also if the interest isn't there then probably not. Thing about this stock though is retail owns and can own the float until any PIPE lock ups expire.

That's something else that will be important to follow are the SEC filings for the lock ups.

Overall, this seems to be a solid company with a lot of growth up ahead.

""Its annual recurring revenue also noted a year-over-year growth in the recent quarter to **$24.1 million**. For the full financial year, IronNet now forecasts $75 million of ARR on up to $45 million in revenue."" As of 3 days ago.

I'm not a professional trader what's so ever, I ordered Wendy's for supper. I have no idea where this could go, it really depends on a variety of factors but it's worth watching going into next week and October.

At the time it was $14.00 and 9/17 $20 calls were something like $0.30 each. Remember my post on WSB? No, you don't. It got deleted. That didn't stop IRNT from hitting $40 in AH and opening the following day at like $26.

How about a stock called TMC? Remember when [I posted about its similar set-up](https://www.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/pnjll5/tmc_high_gamma_high_short_interest_but_high_iv/) Monday? You don't remember that? Oh, right, I didn't post it to WSB because I didn't want to get banned again. Well, it seems to be doing fine.

Last night, rather than sleep, I decided to spent hours filling out a spreadsheet with every deSPAC I could find (if you're deep in the deSPAC craze, you know the list); complete with the new floats, IV, gamma values, percent of float deltahedged, estimated SI, Utilization, and CTB -- you know... the only things that really matter to us. (It's not like ""fundamentals"" could fit in a spreadsheet column, anyway.)

Now I'm letting off some steam by once again partaking in the lost ancient art form of writing a DD for WSB. This time it's about what I think is best deSPAC play that is currently available for WSB to blindly dump its collective IRNT winnings into: VLTA.

tldr:

* **MARKET CAP IS $2B NO BAN PLS**
* Low IV (currently) -- Make money from the MMs, not from each other.
* High gamma -- Even after Sep options expire.
* Some short interest (\~10% of float) -- but more importantly 0 shares to borrow to keep this dog down. CTB getting ""up there"" at 47%.
* The company does stuff.. not sure what, but I'm sure it's great world-changing stuff. Their name is Volta, so they must have *potential*... get it?
* **The set-up looks suspiciously good, so I might be missing something. Perhaps wait for some wrinkle brain to shit on my thesis here.**

# 0. The Market Cap

I'm not actually salty about being banned; the mods have a tough job sorting through all the bullshit. I mean, just look at the titles of DDs these days... people just put in zero effort. At the time I posted about IRNT, the reported market cap on it varied from source to source due to the fucked up situation with outstanding shares and float. I assume the mods thought I was trying to sneak one by 'em. No hard feelings. I don't blame the mods for erring on the side of caution.

Anyway, this time around **I'm certain VLTA meets the market cap requirements.**

Just ask TDA:

Alright. $2.0B > $1.5B. Let's move on.

# 1. The Process

How did I find VLTA? It's simple. I don't have a life and I spent all night making a spreadsheet, running calculations on gamma, and throwing in SI data from Ortex for tickers that look interesting.

Here's a screenshot:

&#x200B;

[Lots of pretty colors. Must be legit.](https://preview.redd.it/8f39xl4xo2o71.png?width=1223&format=png&auto=webp&s=3094fd899041cbe76974ba16a5215aae82349781)

I blurred a lot of the tickers, per market cap rules. (If you're a true deSPAC degen, you'll know where the tickers and float numbers came from.)

What I looked for were tickers with a lot of bright green squares. Most importantly, I want that low IV -- which to me indicates MMs asking to get reamed. Just like momma always says -- Low IV is how 10+ baggers are made.

I was surprised to see that VLTA had the 5th highest current gamma value, behind TMC, OPAD, REDACTED, and IRNT. All of these have seen significant price action lately. Yet, the IV on VLTA was incredibly low... only bested by tickers with higher market caps and non-existent gamma. Wake up, MMs. (Or, again I'm missing some piece of the puzzle here.)

Oh, before you ask about IV -- I'm using 30d ATM IV as my baseline. I compute it myself by interpolating IV between strikes and expirations. In reality, each ticker will have it's own IV skew so don't yell at me when you see the OTM FDs aren't 80% IV.

As for the SI column: some tickers (the gray ones) had bonkers Estimated Short Interest. For these tickers, I used 60% of the On Loan value to estimate the estimated short interest. If you want hopium, upper bound for SI is about 1.6x the gray values.

# 2. The Set-up

To summarize VLTA:

* It's a deSPAC
* With high OI relative to it's new float
* With some short interest (not much)
* But no shares available to borrow
* With sustained bullish order flow
* **And it's IV is priced as though all of the above is not true.**

## deSPAC

It's a deSPAC.

If you don't know what that means, well, you're shit out of luck. I'm not going to explain how SPACs have huge floats and are allowed to have options traded on them, but then when they go through with a merger a lot of that float vanishes due to redemptions (but the options don't), so there ends up being a ton of options and not a lot of float, and MMs might not be aware of the change in the float and might think it's easy to buy shares to deltahedge but in reality there isn't a lot of float at all and when they deltahedge they push the price up making things worse for themselves. Same goes for shorts trying to cover.

No, I'm just not going to explain deSPACs to you at all.

In case you're wondering, VLTA completed August 26th with a 70% redemption rate. That's a lot lower than 90%+ we see with the IRNT, OPAD, TMC wonderkids.  So beware, a lower redemption rate means shareholders were more confident in Volta -- it might actually not be a completely shitty company.

## OI relative to float

A lot of people are going to shit on VLTA because it has a ""high float"" of 10,277,713 shares relative to the grab bag of deSPACs out there. Yes, compared to IRNT (\~1.3m), TMC (\~2.7m), OPAD (\~3.4m), 10m is a bigger number. But there's also **a significant amount of OI** to make up for.

What really matters for gamma is the *ratio* of OI to float.

So let's take a looksee at the 'ole deltaflux table:

## DeltaFlux / Gamma

Once again, I'll throw out this disclaimer about deltaflux tables: **They are an approximation, and they make incorrect assumptions**.

Some assumptions the table makes that make it inaccurate:

* It assumes MMs deltahedge via black scholes model
* Continuously and completely
* Based on the options' IVs
* For every single option in the chain

Pretty much all of those assumptions are false. Just because the table says the net delta is X% of float *does not* mean ""MMs must buy this many shares or else they fuk!!"". **The table is meant to present values that are useful to compare** ***across time*** **and** ***across tickers*****.**

Ok. Let's continue:

I like to represent gamma by ""how many shares need to be deltahedged (as a percentage of float) per a 1% movement in price"". A reminder that I consider values over 0.30% to be abnormally high. 1.00%+ is insane. We're at around 0.85%, which is fairly juicy, and things look good all the way through to $20.

I cannot recall ever seeing gamma values this high with IVs this low. If I saw this ramp and had to guess at what the 30d ATM IV would be, I'd guess at least 140%. We're sitting at 90%. **This makes me think I am missing something -- so if there's a piece to this puzzle I'm missing, let me know.**

**For comparison, here the table for PTRA -- it has similar IV to VLTA:**

Higher IV, lower gamma.

**Two last bits of info for everyone:**

1. High gamma does not guarantee a gamma squeeze. A squeeze implies a runaway effect. What we want here is *momentum*. Think of a puck gliding on ice. High gamma = less friction.
2. High gamma makes it easy to go up, but it also makes it easy to go down. Just like the puck gliding on ice. Easy to slide one way, easy to slide the other.

## Short Interest and Utilization

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k32ay110p2o71.png?width=1723&format=png&auto=webp&s=39cd6c0b8c0f67242e10eb88e805486577a91255

Ortex doesn't estimate SI for this one, but they do have the amount On Loan. It's 1,664,307, or 16.19 % float. That's the upper bound -- the real SI is generally lower than the amount that Ortex reports On Loan. If I had to guess, about 60% of it, so around 1m shares shorted, which is about 10% of float. Not a big story here.

Also of note is the *rising* value of the On Loan average age. It's going up -- which means that most shares borrowed were done so in the past. Think of it this way: if older loans were closed and new ones opened, the average age would go down.

The average age is 18 days, which is around Aug 30, when share price was $10.00. So to the extent that there are shorts, they're underwater just a bit.

SI isn't super compelling. What's more encouraging, to me, is the Utilization pegged near 100%, and CTB in high double digits. This means there are no shares to short, and when there are, they are expensive. This is generally good news when you want the stock to go up.

## Order Flow

The past several days have seen an influx of buyers, and I don't know where exactly they are coming from. I don't find very many mentions of this ticker on Reddit. Well, I did find [one post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pp0fu2/vlta_look_at_me_over_here_fomo_just_want_to_be/). As of now, I'm the only upvote. I just left a comment.

Here's the orderflow, per MarketChameleon:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/exkzkyl0p2o71.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=38a8b3c93fc7e1f8346312e45da286d543f14199

Bullish enough for me.

## The Implied Vol

**Here's the part I don't understand.**  Given all of the above, how is it that MMs did not ramp up IV on this deSPAC like they did on all others?

VLTA 10/15 ATM calls are sitting at around \~100% IV right now. That seems pretty low to me. Even further OTM, $17.50's are sitting at \~126%.

According to MarketChameleon, which does some weighted averaging type of stuff across strikes and expirations, the 30d IV to be 91%.

For comparison, here are the *pre-jump* 30d IVs of some famous deSPACs:

* IRNT (Sep 1): 127%
* IPOD (Sep 10): 134%
* TMC (Sep 14): 178%
* VLTA (now): 91%

I'm not sure why this is, but I'll take a bargain when I see one.

## Other

VLTA is currently on the threshold securities list. I don't really think carries a lot of weight, but it's worth noting.

# 3. The Play

Alright, I assume you saw a really long DD with pretty pictures and tables and just want to throw money into something.

## Risks/Rewards

Let me first tell you the risks:

* There is no real gamma. Perhaps all the OI is spreads. Or covered calls.
* MMs are anticipating for this (despite the low IV signifying otherwise). Instead of milking them, we're circle jerking one another while playing hot-potato-options until everyone gets bored.
* **I could be completely off about the float or some other mechanic, like PIPE shares unlocking or something.** To the best of my knowledge, this thing has just been sitting quietly under the radar since redemption... aside from the run-up.

And here are the rewards:

* MMs, for some reason, overestimated the float. The buy-in is relentless, and they decide it best to do one or both: a) buy back expensive calls, or b) bite the bullet and accumulate shares, pushing prices up.
* IV going from X% to 300%.
* That hole in yourself you feel for not buying/holding IRNT, OPAD, TMC, etc -- this can provide closure. (Or it can be salt.)

## What to buy

* October calls.
* Shares

## When to sell

Look, I have no idea what happens here, and when it happens. I see a good set-up, and I see a deSPAC frenzy all around me, so I think this is a good bet.

**What I will recommend, however, is to keep a very close eye on the IV.** Regardless of price, IV roughly tells you how much ""acceleration"" is priced in. If you're holding an option and the IV jumps up, you need to ask yourself:  will interest in this stock and/or share price accelerate or decelerate? Will inflows continue or reverse? As IV goes up, the margin of error in your judgement decreases -- small errors will cost you bigly, as IV is *generally* correlated to actual volatility.

At which IV and/or price to sell at is a judgement you need to make for yourself based on whatever it is you do, and the risk you can tolerate. It can be TA, gauging sentiment, momentum, technicals (float, gamma, etc), or you just feel it in your plums.

For me, personally, I'm a little bitch and will probably be out at around 300% IV, just like I was with all the other deSPACs. I have faith gamma pushes this upwards, but at some point, the MMs are milked and it becomes a game of hot-potato. Not for me.

let me start by saying this thread is merely SPECULATION. nothing  is concrete. 
 #1
- this all starts with the CFO resignation which really caught us ALL by surprise. why would the CFO accept a position elsewhere if WISH truly has so much potential?

#2- thats where this begins. now, if said company happened to be bought out.. some positions would be redundant. 
          - you do not need 2 CFOs.

#3

lets go through the list. 

we've seen 2 quite massive candles this week after hearing ""HUGE $7.5 CALL VOLUME"" etc. makes you think. 

 #4 .. zero PR since its Q2 ER disaster. average cost on WISH is currently $7.65 .. retail presence GREATLY decreased.  

while you have seen retail panic, multiple resignations, private equity has been soaking up these dips. 
""Hedge Funds now hold over 25% of the common""

to finish up on this first topic, lets keep in mind the resigned CFO still holds 836,992 shares.

now who do i think will acquire wish..
Google. yeah. Google.

Google recently partnered with $SHOP .. ""this one shows little sign of working"" .. so what is Google's next move?

lets keep it going. Google aims to help people shop for the products from ""direct-to-consumer or the mom and pop shop down the street"" this is where Wish Local comes into play. ""Wish is free to download and use; they offer low prices because of a direct-to-consumer model""

call me delusional, but in my eyes.. the recent action screams buyout. from void CFO position, SILENT management, tute buying, call volume, along with Google's recent push to present itself as ""a cheaper and less restrictive"" $AMZN. let me know your thoughts.

oh, and lets not forget those recent GOOGLE hires."

Low rates equals high equities. period.

The fed, (sir powell) has literally kept the money printer rolling. But what happens when the Treasury General Account runs out of out money?

The breadth of the market bull run has literally become the smallest all year long.

You now have people like Macrovoices Eric Townsend bringing on guests to discuss long volatility. they did this in Q1 of 2020. Which i actually played and did very well.

That said I've seen all the arguments for why the market is going to crash.  Yet it seems we need some sort of trigger to get out of an algo range and actually cause a pull back. Could it be:

1. debt ceiling not raised by US gov?
2. geopolitical wars
3. hedge funds just ganging up on the apes?
4. Gridlock in Washington?
5. Election proven to have had fraud?
6. Biden elections new fed chair focused on equality and turns the printer off instantly.

We know the members of the fed played volatility right before the market crash too.

What if the austrian crack up boom actually comes to an end this year? as many analysts are now calling for a pull back by year end. Statistically it happens second half of september.

Would any of the triggers above actually cause a crash? It sure feels like 2000.

Why would WSB apes fight this? With volatility gone, epic runs and short squeezes have faded, at least in brevity.

Recently, i've been searching google trends for ""market crash,"" ""stock market crash,"" but today when i was randomly googling something else... an autocorrect came up for ""economic collapse.""

For anyone such as myself who likes Palantir, Snowflake and other data/AI companies, C3.ai is in a great position to be bought right now.

The company is [led by Thomas Siebel](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quickerbettertech/2020/11/19/on-crm-tom-siebel-is-back-and-hes-working-with-microsoft/?sh=5859683d341f), and while he is kind of older and approaching retirement age, you cannot overlook him. He is the man who invented CRM’s, which are the software such as Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics that drive most major corporations.

What he is doing with this company is creating usable AI for companies, which he likes to repeatedly call “turnkey solutions”. Essentially this means AI programs that simpleton operators in big companies can use without any serious coding or programming.

Basically, C3.ai is doing what Palantir does, but their focus is making plug and play programs, instead of relying heavily on forward deployed engineers.

Of course, what really matters here is are these empty promises and big dreams, or does the software actually work?

Well the contracts and partnerships they have developed would certainly suggest that their software friggen works.

They aren’t doing this work alone, they are partnered with many serious players:

# 

# CRM’s:

To make AI tools that are usable with CRM’s such as Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics, they have officially partnered with **Microsoft and Adobe**. Microsoft went a step further and purchased some shares during the IPO last summer.

Note, through their partnership with Microsoft, they are not competing with Salesforce, they are working with Salesforce.

And this software is not in development, it just became available.

# 

# Energy:

To make AI tools that are usable in oil and gas, they partnered with **Baker Hughes**, and that software has been adopted by other oil and gas companies such as **Shell** and MEG. And obviously it works, because after their initial trial, Shell went ahead and renewed their commitment with them for 5 years.

*5 year renewal source:* [*https://ir.c3.ai/news/news-details/2021/C3-AI-and-Shell-Extend-Strategic-Collaboration-to-Reshape-Global-Energy-and-Resource-Industries-with-Enterprise-AI/default.aspx*](https://ir.c3.ai/news/news-details/2021/C3-AI-and-Shell-Extend-Strategic-Collaboration-to-Reshape-Global-Energy-and-Resource-Industries-with-Enterprise-AI/default.aspx)

# 

# National Defense:

To make national defense tools, they are working with both the **US Air Force**, and the **Missile Defense Agency**, to create AI tools used for diagnostics on aircraft, and ballistics for a missile defense system.

Note, the Missile Defense Agency has the ambitious goal of creating an advanced system that would protect USA from airborne missile attacks. Basically, they are trying to create an iron dome comparable to what Israel is using to defend itself from Palestinian terrorists.

&#x200B;

# Autonomous Packaging:

Now today, they just announced that they have expanded into technology that will obviously be useful in ALL retail. They just signed a deal to help develop autonomous packaging with one of the largest aluminum packaging companies in the world, **Ball Corporation, who does $12B** in annual revenue at 60 international locations.

&#x200B;

# Cloud Computing:

C3.ai’s products are now being carried by both **Google Cloud and Snowflake**. Both of those companies are offering C3.ai’s products to their customers to work with their platforms, and both of those companies have an incentive to help sell the product. Google Cloud’s CEO has done a TV interview with C3, stating that they intend to use Google Clouds 2000 person sales team to get people using C3 on google servers.

So the question is this if these companies and organizations see value in C3’s software, why the hell is it valued so much lower than Palantir and Snowflake:

* Microsoft
* Google
* Adobe
* Shell
* Baker Hughes
* US Air Force
* Missile Defense Agency

&#x200B;

**Some key fundamental facts:**

* The stock is down 75% from it’s meme mania highs, and looks like it has technically bottomed out.
* They have $1B of cash on hand, with like a $37M burn rate. They have LOTS of runway.
* They are actually “structurally profitable” meaning they have a large margin on their cost of goods sold, but their loss is directly attributable to the money being spent on marketing and sales, which the CEO rightly defends as a smart investment.
* YOY revenue is up 29% in the last quarter.
* They operate in the large customer space like Palantir, and their enterprise AI customers grew 85% to 98 in the last quarter. With the recent announcements, they are likely over 100 now.

Cloudflare is going to be the next FAANG company. We might as well just kick out Netflix because they stopped making good shows and put Cloudflare in.

Yes the stock is expensive, it's like 50x sales or some shit. But it's also growing faster and faster and is literally becoming the backbone of the internet. They also give their shit away for free and every tech and networking guy is becoming addicted to their suite of services, so when they start charging full price, guess who's going to complain until they get $100k/month allocated to Cloudflare services?

Revenue growth was like ...55%? last year, and it's INCREASING Y/Y. I'm too lazy to Google the actual numbers but that's pretty close, you can look it up yourself. It's gonna be 60%, and then 70%, etc, for the foreseeable future.

I've been in this Cloudflare game since $35, and it WILL be the next $500B software company (well maybe Salesforce is going to beat them to it but whatever, it's almost there anyway). That's gonna put the share price north of $1k in a few years. Thank me later.

If you don't know what Cloudflare does... go ask that networking or tech guy you know. They probably won't shut up for a few hours.

pottj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pottj2/dd_atlas_air_aaww_is_laughably_undervalued_and/,DD: Atlas Air (AAWW) is laughably undervalued and has near term catalysts for a rapid revaluation,295,108,2021-09-16 00:42:12,"*As always, do your own due diligence and invest responsibly. Author claims no responsibility for the accuracy of the facts and statements in this report. The investment (""YOLO"") below is a large but recoverable percent of my portfolio, in-line with my personal risk tolerance. Not intended as investment advice. I may modify (add, reduce, or even close out) my position at any time.*

**TL/DR:** AAWW is critically undervalued. COVID has all but annihilated international air travel volumes, driving up the price of air freight. Short term shipping disruptions have caused prices to soar, spilling over in to the air freight market. Analysts are expecting this disruption to resolve quickly, but are missing the shifts that airlines are making to narrow body jets and the impact on air freight. AAWW will have high earnings for years, and its current P/E of 4 is a joke. 13.6% of the float is shorted, and Atlas Air is free to reinitiate buybacks at the end of this month. AAWW's market cap could double and it still would trade at the rock bottom P/E of 8. Bullish AF.

\------

**Thesis**

Atlas Air Worldwide (AAWW) is critically undervalued at an absurdly low valuation given its great near- and long-term prospects; there several upcoming catalysts for a rapid revaluation.

**Background**

Atlas Air is an outsourced air services company that provides charter and other air services (""Airline Operations"") as well as leasing out their owned aircraft. Critically, the Airline Operations account for the vast majority of revenues (>95%), and AAWW has a very, very heavy focus and exposure to air freight.

You may know that commercial flights also typically carry cargo. When COVID decimated international air travel, it left a few limited carriers to ship air freight internationally. Atlas Air filled that void and is making big money doing it.

**Short Term Prospects**

Beyond the COVID situation mentioned above, oceanliners have been backed up dramatically causing a squeeze in ocean freight prices. Normally, air freight costs very roughly 4-5x that of an oceanliner. But with surging rates from oceanliners, [air freight has now become competitive for many companies](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/a-perfect-storm-for-container-shipping/21804500) and it is spilling over in to a squeeze on air freight. [Here's another article joking about car tires flying first class.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/air-cargo-boom-has-car-tires-flying-first-class-11630242001) So we know that Atlas Air is going to have a pretty stellar third quarter. One for their corporate history books, to be sure. But how do they fare long-term?

**Long Term Prospects**

As a side note, I believe this is where the shorts are getting it very, very wrong. *I think* they are confident that while AAWW will have a great quarter, the freight rates will come back down again and AAWW will operate with only 'modest' profits like it did pre-COVID. What they are missing is a huge transformation in the airline industry from wide-body to narrow-body jets. Narrow-body jets carry far less cargo. Greenlight Capital did a fantastic job laying this out in it's July 26, 2021 investor letter (page 4, ""Air Freight""):

>While there has been some recovery in passenger aviation, airlines are emphasizing narrow-body planes, which carry less freight than wide-body planes. Compared to 2019, current air freight demand is about 10% higher and capacity is about 10% lower. The result is that cargo rates have exploded.  
Supply will be slow to come on-line. Some passenger planes are being converted to freighters, but conversion capacity for wide-bodies is limited and the aggregate impact of this will be modest. Meanwhile, air freight companies trade at tiny multiples of what investors assume to be peak profits. The implied cost of equity is quite high, which makes it difficult to justify adding assets. As a result, air freight companies are in no rush to order new planes, and in any case, new orders would take several years to build. The result is rates and profits are likely to be higher than expected for quite some time.

(Sorry, I tried to link the letter but the spam bot didn't like the URL.)

**Short Interest**

For some reason I will never understand, at a P/E of 4 with incredible foreseeable cashflows, some people have decided to short 13.6% of the outstanding shares. To be clear, this is not GameStop. But it is a high short interest in a stock with earnings prospects surging by the day as freight rates increase. It certainly doesn't hurt. But the story gets even better...

**Upcoming Catalysts**

Okay, so perhaps you believe me that AAWW is critically undervalued, that they're going to make some amazing Q3/Q4 profits, and that their long term prospects are pretty fantastic too. What will drive this rapid revaluation in the coming months? The answer was subtly slipped in to the last earnings call (google ""AAWW Transcripts Q2 2021 Earnings Call""). Spencer Schwartz, the EVP and CFO answered a question and stated:

>As far as the CARES Act restrictions, so the restrictions with regard to not being able to pay dividends or repurchasing shares, those expire at the end of September.

I simply cannot imagine that in this time of record earnings, AAWW will not return that value to shareholders. If they were to announce a share buyback once the CARES Act restrictions lap, we could see AAWW finally get to a reasonable share price. I truly believe this could double in the short-term.

Shedding lights on Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas “Tale of the two companies”,218,83,2021-09-15 18:57:02,"In August 2018, Elon Musk announced that Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) had agreed to take Tesla private at $420 (a 20% premium to the then stock price of $350). The “funding secured” tweet that put Elon Musk in feud with SEC implied that Saudi’s PIF was ready to pay as much as $60B for the largest BUYOUT transaction in history that put Tesla’s valuation close to $80B. Elon Musk wrote a letter to investors and explained his motivations and the benefits of going private, the reasons were sheltering from short sellers and attacks that the company was receiving as well as shifting his focus and energy to production instead of dealing with analysts and short term quarterly earning pressure. He wrote,

&#x200B;

*“First, a final decision has not yet been made, but the reason for doing this is all about creating the environment for Tesla to operate best. As a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders. Being public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long-term. Finally, as the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market, being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company.”*

&#x200B;

Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) wanted to spend close to $60B and take Tesla private to shield it from massive short selling attacks and to move forward their “Strategic Vision 2030” which would lead the country to diversify away from fossil fuels and oil and to fortify their footsteps on clean / sustainable energy track.

&#x200B;

The deal ultimately fell apart and Saudi PIF sold their billions of dollars of Tesla stake and instead invested $3B in Lucid Motors in several rounds between 2018 – 2021. The latest round that they invested in Lucid was in February 2021, when they invested $200M in parallel with PIPE investors. I will get back to the PIPE deal and Sep 1 sell off at the end of this article.

&#x200B;

In Feb 2021, Saudi Arabia’s PIF took Lucid Motors public via SPAC but ironically, since early March and as soon as the hype deflated, the company and its largest backer have both fallen prey to what Saudis wanted to shield Tesla from. The stock has been a sweet target for short sellers and option writers since the DA. Short interest since April (until Aug 31) has been in the range of 35M – 65M. Since their merger on July 26th until Aug 31 the average short interest has been close to 50M on the float of 207M (Churchill public shareholders). The short borrowing rate even hit the high of 160% late August in anticipation of PIPE sell-off on Sep 1.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Lucid management’s underpromising tactic, their dovish public relations, the Radio Silence tuned in at their IR dept and their ambiguous production timeline for 2021 have not helped to fend off short sellers but have rather encouraged and rewarded those who have been betting against Lucid in the past several months. The company has been under short sellers' attack for several months. Any announcement made by Mr. Rawlinson has been followed by a significant dip in the stock. The insightful mic-drop MotorTrend review on August 25 was followed by a 13% drop before the Sep 1 PIPE lockup expiration and surprisingly, most of the PIPE investors sold off and left during the first week of September, which triggered a 20% intraday drop on Sep 1. The company’s surprising decision to announce cashless warrant redemption on Sep 8 (with half of initial dilution effect, while giving up +$900M that could be received on cash redemption) didn’t also bring the expected result. The stock went down 5% on Sep 8 \[instead of 2.2%\], leaving the investors wondering what warrant redemption scenario had been priced in the stock? Furthermore, when the best-case scenario decision was followed by the worst-case scenario stock price movement, it raised eyebrows.

&#x200B;

I don’t have answer to many of the questions retail investors ask. I don’t know why Lucid decided to do cashless warrant redemption. I can just guess that the management is confident that at some point the shares they didn’t issue for warrant redemption will cover the $4.5B capital they need to raise by Q4’ 2022, to bridge the company to its positive-cashflow era. I also don’t know why Saudi PIF purchased a large stake in McLaren in July ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudis-pif-talks-buy-stake-mclaren-group-sky-news-2021-07-16/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudis-pif-talks-buy-stake-mclaren-group-sky-news-2021-07-16/)) or they bought a 30% stake in Pagani in August ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-19/saudi-wealth-fund-buys-a-stake-in-italian-supercar-maker-pagani](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-19/saudi-wealth-fund-buys-a-stake-in-italian-supercar-maker-pagani)). I also don’t know why Koenigsegg ended their “electrification technology” joint venture and strategic partnership with NEVS early September (Google the story). I can just guess a few hints based on “Mosaic Theory”. Similarly, I don’t know why Lucid Motors is under short sellers attack, but I know the implication; Continued short attack will increase the cost of capital for Lucid and will prevent Lucid from ramping production and it gives time to their competitors to catch up technologically. This is probably the only thing worth pointing to in Adam Jonas’ equity research paper published yesterday. He clearly confessed that Lucid is technologically ahead of all other car companies and this is what Lucid needs to preserve. In my opinion, the high cost of capital caused by short attacks might inevitably erode Lucid Motor’s power to ramp up production and will make it harder for the company to invest in R&D to keep their edge.

&#x200B;

The remaining parts of Morgan Stanley Lucid equity research published yesterday are “A Tale of the Two Companies”. I don’t want to dig up the history and go as early as 2019 and refer to Adam Jonas’ $10 bear case price target for Tesla, but I want to have a quick review of his 2020-2021 journey and the climax of his equity research with “The Chosen One” paper published on January 5, and end with his most recent publication on Lucid. Comparing his assumptions on Tesla with those of Lucid will shed light on the tale of the two worlds he is depicting for his readers. Had he chosen the title “The Cursed One” for his Lucid Motors equity research published yesterday, he would have caught even more attention.

&#x200B;

Any equity research and forecast are as good as the underlying assumptions. A journey through Adam Jonas price targets for Tesla during the past 15 months gets interesting when his assumptions are defluffed. Adam Jonas had an underweight rating on Tesla until September 2020. His price targets have been trailing Tesla’s stock price and he only priced in 2 segments (revenue streams) for Tesla until Sep 2020: Core Tesla Auto Sales (+95% of the revenue) and Mobility business (less than 5% of the revenue).

&#x200B;

[Adam Jonas Tesla Price Targets May 2020 - present](https://preview.redd.it/kcvwdycrdnn71.jpg?width=1410&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87ca12d227844b07d9bbb4b9e883ae9d14f4b796)

**Mobility Service / Transportation as a Service (TaaS)**

What is Mobility business he and few other analysts are referring to? It is a purely imaginary Transportation-as-a-service (TaaS) business model that doesn’t exist and as of today it doesn’t even have a remote chance of becoming a reality, but this imaginary business segments that has been born out of Elon Musk’s jokes and teases has gradually taken bigger and bigger part of Adam Jonas Tesla price target. Until October 15, 2020 Adam had less than 5% of his price target assigned to this remote imagination, but on oct 15, 2020 he suddenly increased the value of Tesla TaaS from $7 per share to $41 per share. This implies Adam Jonas valued the imaginary business at valuation 5 times bigger than Lyft at the time (Lyft was close to $8B mid-October). Fast forward to today, he still values this non-existent business segment at $75 per share ($75 x 1.119B fully diluted shares = $84B), which is slightly less than Lyft and Uber Combined (Lyft + Uber market cap on Sep 14, 2021 = $17B + $73B = $90B)

In October 2020, he wrote,

*“We forecast a launch of 1,000 cars (from the existing fleet) in Tesla Mobility by 2021, rising to 500k cars by 2030, which would account for 2.7% of our Tesla global fleet estimate (18.6mm units) by that year. Our previous assumption for the Tesla Mobility fleet was 240k units by 2030. We assume $45,000 per cost car (vs. $60k previously) and a 7-year useful life, and other savings, driving our exit OP margin of Tesla mobility to 14.7% (10.4% previously). We use a 10% WACC (11% previously) and a 4% terminal growth rate (2% previously) implying an exit PE multiple of 17.3x (11.3x previously). Taken together, our valuation of Tesla Mobility rises to $42bn ($41/share) vs. $7.3bn ($7/share) previously.”*

2021 is coming to end and neither Tesla has launched TaaS, nor they have any plans of launching it this year or next year. I can understand that it is easy for Adam Jonas to imagine Tesla will double its TaaS fleet to 500K (from his previously assumed 240K), but how could he suddenly improve the OP margin assumption by 40%?

&#x200B;

**Tesla as a 3rd Party powertrain Provider**

After the 5-to-1 stock split in summer of 2020 and the cosmetic change that sent the stock price soaring, Adam Jonas changed his rating on Tesla to Equal Weight on Sep 22, 2020, right after the battery day. He increased PT to $272 but suddenly assumed a new revenue stream to Tesla and put a lofty valuation on it. He assigned $62 of his price target which valued this segment at $65B and constituted 22.7% of his price target. He valued it based on the sales of 2.5M units by 2030 with 20% EBITDA margin and 17x terminal EBITDA, using 9% WACC. Fast forward to today, Adam values this segment at $88 per share. This implies another non-existent segment is valued more than Daimler (Mercedes Benz). How many powertrain & batteries has Tesla sold to other companies since mid-2020? ZERO! How many do they plan to sell in 2022? ZERO! For Adam Jonas, however, zero means a hundred billion dollars at one company and zero at another company. Companies are equal when it comes to imaginations, but some companies are more equal.

In his research paper on Lucid, Adam Jonas writes,

*“Lucid has identified future opportunities in which it could act as a powertrain supplier to other OEMs, or could venture further into Energy Storage Systems. At this point, we give the company no credit in our financial model for these future initiatives, given how early stage it is.”*

How is it possible that Adam Jonas estimates that Tesla will sell 5.6M EVs in 2030 and 2.5M powertrain in the same year (3rd party parts equal 45% of the volume), but for Lucid, a company that has had over a decade history of providing parts to Formula-E, that number is Zero? If Adam Jonas treated the two imaginations the same, even the lowballed 2030 MS estimated volume of 310K would value Lucid’s 3rd party powertrain business segment close to $5B.

&#x200B;

**Insurance business**

In summer 2020, Elon Musk announced they are selling insurance for Tesla cars. Adam Jonas, in November 2020 valued Tesla insurance business at $15 per share and fast forward to today he has valued it at $30 per share, which implies it is 20% below Allstate valuation! Seriously? Tesla has zero insurance underwriting operations, they are just brokering auto policies only in CA with the help of Markel’s subsidiary. How is this small segment going to be a business as big as Allstate and become successful with 50% penetration and 18% underwriting margin (even higher than progressive)? How can it compete with other insurance companies across all US states in such a highly regulated industry? This is what Adam Jonas need to answer, but if the imaginary business segments that don’t even exist can be valued as big as Daimler or Uber and Lyft combined, then why not the insurance? It can even be bigger than Progressive one day. On Nov 18, he wrote

*“By 2030, we assume a 69% loss ratio and 17% expense ratio. Based on our discussions with Morgan Stanley’s Insurance team, we understand the industry average loss ratio is typically around 75% with a 25% expense ratio. Progressive leads the industry with a 70% loss ratio (more accurate pricing) and a 21% expense ratio, and a high single digit underwriting margin (combined ratio). We forecast Tesla to achieve a better than Progressive 10% underwriting margin by 2026, rising to 14% by 2030 and improving to 17% in the very long term”*

Compared to November 2020, he has doubled the assigned value to the insurance business, and assumes Tesla achieves 50% penetration of its fleet by 2030 (rising to nearly 100% by 2040) with an 18% underwriting margin by 2030.

After AI day last month, I was expecting Adam Jonas to price in Tesla's Bots and electric UFOs segment (non-existent today but does it really matter?) and assign a valuation to it. I am sure many of his fans are waiting for it too.

&#x200B;

**Tesla Energy:**

Adam Jonas has valued Tesla’s energy business at $85B, however as mentioned earlier, he doesn’t give any credit to Lucid for their energy business. Lucid is currently using their energy storage system in their Casa Grande, AZ AMP-1 to save energy. I wish Adam Jonas at least priced in a lower SG&A for their lower utility bills in his projected income statement. They deserved this much credit, didn't they?

&#x200B;

**Tesla software:**

Adam Jonas values Tesla Network service (Software, FSD, IoT, charging, etc) at $253 per share, which is $283B based on 1.119B fully diluted shares. He assumes $100 ARPU on 14.4M connected fleet. The FSD has been controversial in the past several months and it is not known whether it can be a successful product without Lidar, however the success of FSD and L5 ADAS (in very long term) have been implied in Adam Jonas pricing of the Network Service for Tesla. When it comes to Lucid, however, Adam Jonas writes,

*“While we are more cautious on the adoption of fully autonomous Level 5 driving until beyond 2040 due to technological, moral and legal challenges, we forecast the US to have >80% of its miles from Level 4 or Level 5 autonomous technology by 2050. This will lead to significant changes to the urban mobility transportation networks. We also believe that the autonomous race will be controlled by the largest, most well capitalized mega-tech players such as Google owned Waymo, as well as from the likes of Tesla, GM Cruise, amongst others (Aurora/ATG, Ford's Argo, Motional/Aptiv/Hyundai). We see the players that hold a key advantage today as being the ones that have: 1) access to capital, 2) can bring in the best software and AI engineering talent, 3) get access to real-world driving mileage data and 4) can train the neural net over a large fleet size. While L2/L3 ADAS tech is the first step to fully driverless technology and most OEMs can partner with suppliers such as Aptiv for ADAS offerings, we see long-term risks for those OEMs who do not have tech developed in-house and will be forced to license and pay for the technology. In saying this, Lucid can still partner with players and/or build out their own autonomous capabilities over the long-term but at this early stage we see potential obsolescence risk to their current autonomous tech unless they are able to invest at the same rates as leading players.”*

&#x200B;

I completely agree that Lucid will need access to cheap capital to retain talent and build their own autonomous capabilities (and/or partner with big tech players), here I get back to my previous conclusion that short selling attacks and the heavy pressure on stock price \[if not stopped\] will inevitably increase Lucid’s cost of capital, will decrease their capability to hire and retain talent and will erode their ability to spend on R&D in near term. The negative impact of short selling attacks not only hamper Lucid’s competency in AD field, but makes it difficult for them to ramp production and manufacture at scale; It also further delays positive cashflow generation which consequently slows R&D spending fueled by internally generated cash. Furthermore, if Lucid can’t keep investing on their technology (which is ahead of Tesla and way ahead of other OEMs at the moment), their technology will become obsolete and other competitors will catch up and Lucid will lose its tech edge. Adam Jonas shares this view,

&#x200B;

*“We believe that Lucid's leading technology in battery packs and motors and design will provide a compelling product for consumers to select from. However, we question the sustainability of the technological edge that Lucid currently possess and we debate its durability over the long term.”*

&#x200B;

Back to Adam Jonas Lucid’s equity research, the biggest objection to his price target is that he has lowballed the \[already\] watered-down company’s projections. Lucid initially had 6000 production estimate for 2021 and the delivery start of late June. After DA, Lucid pushed its delivery timeline to 2H’2021 and slashed its 2021 production volume to just 577. Adam Jonas has even slashed the watered down 577 production volume in 2021 to 400 units sold (-30%). 2021 is not a material year anyway, but Morgan Stanley has slashed their 2022 units sold even more aggressively (7000 units vs company’s 20000 projections, or 65% cut! For 2025, the company has projected 135,000 units but MS estimate is 95000 units (-30%). MS also projects 25000 units for 2023 (vs Lucid’s 36000 units). While it is more probable that Lucid will beat their “low-bar” 2022 projection and produce 25000 in 2022, not in 2023. If Adam Jonas only sticked to the Company’s projected $14B 2025 Revenue, and applied the same 4.8x EV/Sales multiple he uses for Tesla, Lucid’s base case PT would be north of $40 (Let’s not forget Tesla is trading at 5.5x Morgan Stanley estimated 2025 sales of $151B). Even using the same valuation Morgan Stanley uses for Tesla, assuming 14x 2030 exit EBITDA with 8% WACC BUT **lower** exit EBITDA margin of 15%, while assuming company’s watered-down financial projections, Lucid's Fair Value will be $23 per share (DCF).

&#x200B;

Adam Jonas doubts Lucid luxurious EVs would have the demand that the company projects (due to their price point), thus he slashes the company’s projected volume by 30% - 60% during the next 9 years to construct his model, yet he concludes the 2030 ATP is $50K due to more mass market EVs. The contradiction is that, if Lucid goes down the luxury ladder and build lower price EVs (to fetch ATP of $50K similar to Tesla in 2030), the volume should inevitably go even higher than the company’s projection, and I wonder why Adam Jonas didn’t give them the credit for the higher volume but slashed the revenue forecast by lowering the ATP per unit?!

Adam Jonas believes -$5 to the current $20 is ascribed due to the slower top line growth, however if Lucid can beat their low-bar projected 2021 Sales and update their sales forecast for 2022, Adam Jonas will get better aligned with the public market opinion and Lucid management’s projections.

&#x200B;

I am wrapping up this note with a reference to my writing on July 27th . One day after Lucid mergers, I wrote on WSB ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oss4my/why\_pipes\_wont\_sell\_off\_all\_their\_lcid\_shares/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oss4my/why_pipes_wont_sell_off_all_their_lcid_shares/)) and tried to bring my reasons why PIPE investors won’t sell off and leave upon lockup expiration. Even though the stock price was drifting lower from $23 to $20 between Aug 25 and Aug 31, the option market was signaling the bullish bets (increasing Sep 3 call options premium and volume, decreasing Sep 3 put option premium and volume). The Sep 1 sell off was surprising in scope and proved that I was wrong (66M shares were sold pre-market only). PIPE investors sold off en masse, evidently by the 150M daily volume on Sep 1. PIPE investors (excluding PIF) owned 152.67M shares and the average daily volume has been 11M between April 1 – August 31. Since April, the stock never had a 5-day average volume above 20M, however the 5 day average volume between Sep 1 - Sep 7 hit the high of 50M. This implies that the majority of PIPE investors have sold and left, however those shares were bought aggressively by the buyers who have been eyeing PIPE price since February. It is still unknown which of the PIPE investors sold and what institutions bought those shares, but we will figure out in Q4.

&#x200B;

I believe Lucid management should know better why institutions sold off as soon as they found a chance. I know they tried to persuade those investors to stay, they spent lots of time in NYC in June and July. There were some \[leaked?\] rumors that Lucid even produced 198 cars for the big investors. The reason why PIPE investors sold as soon as possible is the subject that can be discussed for weeks and months, however the obvious implication is that, these capital partners were not great fit for Lucid. Lucid apparently didn’t vet their partners well either and they were not selective enough. Rivian CEO has emphasized several times that his company remains **“very selective”** regarding any potential financing partners ([Rivian raises $2.5 billion in aggressive plan to beat Tesla and Nikola with the first all-electric pickup (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/10/rivian-ceo-scaringes-aggressive-plan-to-beat-tesla-and-nikola-with-the-first-all-electric-pickup-and-suv.html)). PIF, with their massive resource on hand, could easily invest the whole $2.5B as a PIPE investor and didn’t need capital partners. The motivation for seeking so many (+50) large and small PIPE investors is still a mystery. They didn’t help the company in any other specific way (apart from providing capital) and they sold and left as soon as they could.

&#x200B;

Rivian is also a very interesting case and is related to this post. Late August Rivian filed for IPO and it was announced they are seeking $80B valuation. Rivian has raised $10.5B so far (while Lucid has raised $7.5B so far) and according to Bloomberg, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are underwriters for the IPO ([Rivian Auto Files for IPO, EV Startup Seeks $80 Billion Valuation - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-27/rivian-is-said-to-file-for-ipo-seek-about-80-billion-valuation)). Rivian aims to IPO around Thanksgiving, so these days it should be on a roadshow with potential institutional investors. Even though the final valuation is not confirmed yet, the banks and the company are marketing the IPO to potential investors at $70B - $80B valuation. Please note that the underwriters will likely form a syndicate together and agree to assume the risk of buying the entire public offering and sell the shares to public at the IPO price. If the $80B valuation is too thorny, the underwriters risk losing billions on the offering and not finding the buyers at that valuation. However, at this stage, it appears the underwriters and the company feel confident about the IPO valuation (or they wouldn’t prematurely announce it to the public just to cut it back later). When finding similar companies for \[public market\] valuation, the best precedent for Rivian is Lucid Motors, which is trading less than half of Rivian's valuation. Rivian has 10,000 order by Amazon for 2022 (100,000 order for the next 10 years) and Lucid has over 11,000 orders right now. From sales volume and production capacity perspective, the two companies are at a very similar stage. From technology perspective, Lucid is ahead of Rivian. Now, the interesting point is, Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley believes Lucid Motors fair value is $12 per share ($20B) while at the same time the bank agrees to risk and underwrite and sell Rivian at $80B valuation. Of course Adam Jonas is in the equity research dept and the Rivian IPO is handled at the investment banking department, but such a huge valuation gap between two similar companies is astonishing. How on earth is it possible that Morgan Stanley feels confident and markets Rivian at $80B while marketing Lucid at $20B? Isn’t it because Morgan Stanley knows that Lucid is under short sellers’ attack and has become a **“toxic stock”** and if it wasn’t for the short selling, its value would be much higher than this? After all, Morgan Stanley doesn’t risk anything if their equity research dept downplays Lucid Motors as a $20B company but Lucid's stock later increases in value even more than their bull case scenario, but they certainly risk huge amount of capital if their investment bank dept values Rivian at $80B and later buyers don’t pay that much for it on the IPO day. Hence, I conclude that Morgan Stanley should be more careful and confident about its judgment of Rivian’s valuation. As soon as I know more about Rivian’s projections and the IPO valuation, I will be happy to compare it with Lucid and Tesla on WSB. Perhaps we find out it is not a tale of two companies but the tale of three companies.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**P.S.**

A few days ago an InvestorPlace contributor named Will Ashworth wrote about Lucid Motors and referred to my WSB article about PIPE sell off ([LCID Stock: Lucid Group’s Future Trajectory Is in Saudi Arabia’s Hands | InvestorPlace](https://investorplace.com/2021/09/lucid-motors-and-lcid-stock-future-trajectory-is-in-saudi-arabias-hands/)). It appears Will Ashworth is teasing me a little bit for being wrong on my expectation of PIPE sell off. I would applaud him way more if he forecasted before Sep 1 that the PIPE investors will sell off. However, just because the PIPE sell off caught most investors off guard, it is really unreasonable to jump the gun and conclude that the PIF will sell off too. Will is trying to persuade his readers that Saudis are unpredictable and will sell off and run away too. This is such a remote tail-risk that is not even worth thinking about. Saudis were so farsighted that they were chasing Tesla 3 years ago and were ready to spend $60B to make it private in 2018, it was way before any analyst or investor even consider Tesla investable. With their Strategic Vision 2030 roadmap, assuming that they will dump and leave the company they built from scratch is insane. The future of Lucid and future of Saudi Arabia’s ambitions to go green and diversify away from fossil fuels go hand in hand. The way Will Ashworth connects the investment world to something purely political (Saudi journalist) is also very repellent. I still believe investment decisions are way more agnostic and rational/economical than political. Not that politics don’t play a role, there might be some people out there hating, shorting or attacking Lucid because they don’t like Saudis, however I don’t believe that’s the mainstream.

&#x200B;

Adam Jonas also wrote about the remote possibility of PIF sell off,

*“Lucid has disclosed in their S1 that Ayar Third Investment Company, an affiliate of the PIF from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, is the majority stockholder and holds approximately 62.7% of Lucid's common stock. We point this out as a potential risk to the stock in the event that the majority shareholder decides to liquidate part of their stake as this could add material selling pressure to the stock.”*

&#x200B;

PIF will more likely increase its stake in Lucid Motors and decrease the float in the weeks and months ahead, rather than liquidating their stake."

I'm a turbomachinery engineer by trade, and I damn near went to work for SpaceX pretty recently actually, so I do have a sense of the engineering prowess the company has. But, we all know what a company is actually doing doesn't necessarily mean the stock price is going to respond similarly...it's mainly psychological not real; i.e., Gamestop and AMC. It's all a big meme. So hypothetically, say Musk's alien master race handlers come back and take him home, and we still have Tesla, what happens then?

TSLA does have a massive head start in the EV world, and I myself own a ton of TSLA. I support Musk's goals and overall plan, and I do think he's a brilliant person, but he's also not as self-made as the fanboys say nor is he a super ethical person based on accounts of friends of mine and him. But is the image he's cultivated driving the company stock price, or are the numbers? That's the million dollar question.

Also, I'm just gonna say it, Stephen Mark Ryan the Solving the Money Problem guy acts like a complete shitbag who survives off of calling himself a genius and smelling his own farts. I don't think the man is stupid, nor is he wrong about many of things he says about Tesla, but GOD he's insufferable and so arrogant. His damn Youtube channel keeps getting pushed to me by the algorithm gods at Google and everytime I think ""...maybe this time it'll be different"", I watch a little, hear him gloat about all his money, call some people retarded, and I want to puke. I hope he gets a taste of his own eventually."

**EDIT:** Many of you are saying that the trade is over. Welp, earnings came in today and were not that great... the stock is currently up above $25....

This post is going to be about why IRNT presents one of the greatest squeeze opportunities that WSB and retail investors have ever seen. Because the company has only been trading for 2 weeks, it's hard to analyze technicals other than volume. Thankfully, the short interest and float are the main reasons why this stock presents such a great opportunity, so those will be analyzed below.

**\*Please note that none of this is financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. Investing is risky and high short interest plays are even riskier. You should talk to a financial professional before making any investment decisions and should do your own research\***

**Short Interest Stats and Analysis**

To put it simply, the short interest on IRNT is absolutely insane. Combine that with the fact that it's a newly trading company (and susceptible to more volatility) and has a VERY low float, and you have a recipe for an absolute slam dunk.

First, let's take a look at Fintel and iBorrow desk. iBorrowdesk has consistently shown the borrow fee to be over 500% and the available shares to be far below 10,000. Similarly, fintel has consistently showed less than 1,000 shares available to borrow. Though some people don't trust these sites, the similarities in the data help to add credibility

I'd also like to turn your attention to [this post by another WSB user](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pnff3b/irnt_gamma_squeeze_with_213_of_float_claimed_by/). This post analyzes how the extremely low float of this stock due to it being a new stock and the insane option OI presents the opportunity for a legitimate gamma squeeze - not some fake hype run up - a legitimate gamma squeeze similar to GME's first run up.

If you look at websites like Baron's they'll tell you that the SI as a % of the float is only 1.79% (about 700,000 shares). This is correct but doesn't tell the whole story. Because of redemptions and lockups, the actual float is 1.3m shares, which makes the real short interest on tradable shares about 56%. Interestingly, [Ihor's tweet](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1437512870351282177?s=19) shows that the borrow fee is asininely high, which again shows the difficulty of borrowing of this stock and thus the easy possibility of a short squeeze. 56% short interest is an amazing number in and of itself, but that's not the whole story. The thing about this stock that really gets me going is the options activity. The OI on options of this stock is absolutely bananas right now. Remember when I said that there are about 1.3M tradable shares due to it being a new stock post-merger? Well, at a $20 price, almost double that amount is held in ITM calls alone. THAT is why the stock has serious gamma squeeze potential. Remember, both the GME and VW squeezes happened because ITM options OI outnumbered the float of companies that were already heavily shorted - this is the power of a gamma squeeze. Most meme stocks that have been ""squeezing"" recently have been small short squeezes due to retail traders and HFs taking advantage of social sentiment. The reason that we haven't seen a violent squeeze recently is because there hasn't been a stock with options activity like this - until IRNT.

Additionally, you probably saw that the stock went up to almost $40 last week out of nowhere. Again, this is the power of a low float stock with high ITM call OI. If this stock starts picking up, the low float and call OI could propel it to meme stock legend status.

Furthermore, data from ortex has also consistently shown a SI of over 300% and a cost to borrow over 500%, which is consistent with the sources listed above. Yes, the SI is definitely a plus, but again, the real power here is the gamma squeeze potential.

(The above four paragraph's were heavily borrowed from the originally linked user, so please check out his post).

Many people will probably not believe some of these shorting numbers and will consider them unreliable because of how new the stock is. That's understandable. However, if you're in that camp, let me present to you this: the NYSE's regulationSHO FTD list. Per SEC regulations, stocks that reach over a certain amount of FTDs are placed on regulation SHO's threshold list. This is a very small list and identifies stocks that are grossly over-shorted (FTDs being the evidence of that). GME was on this list for a very long time before it squeezed. So if you don't believe the websites's SI numbers, then you at least have to believe the NYSE's numbers about FTDs. When a stock has too many FTDs, it means that it is extremely hard to locate shares and repay borrowers, which is a sign of over-shorting. Here is the NYSE list:

https://preview.redd.it/z5q0vbtmxjn71.png?width=2710&format=png&auto=webp&s=e76c960abd9f88936b898b3dbebbf5d82519a9cb

Notice the second to last one? DING DING DING. Though being on the threshold list signifies overshorting, there is yet another thing that we can take from this - forced covering. IRNT has been on that list since 9/2. Per regulationSHO, after 6 TRADING days on the list (9/10), stricter location requirements for shorting are put in place. Take a look at the giant green uptick that we saw on 9/10. 13 TRADING days on the list and forced coverings start taking place where a market-maker is subject to fines and loses his or her market making abilities if this regulation is violated. 13 TRADING days after 9/2 is 9/21. Remember all of those call options I talked about above, well they will be exercised on Friday 9/17. So, let's review what we have: an extremely high reported short interest (you can believe it's 600%, 300%, 56%, whatever), an extremely low an restricted float, ITM options expiring on Friday that outnumber the total float, the stock being on the threshold list indicating over-shorting, forced coverings taking place right around when those options would have to be delivered. Again, this is exactly what we saw with GME. It's important to note however, that this is also an issue of timing - the stock is likely to have a gamma squeeze sometime late this week and through next week. After that, there's a good chance that covering could lead to the stock being taken off of the threshold list.

**Fundamentals**

Think that IRNT is just a squeezable meme stock with no long term potential as an investment? Wrong. The stock is not like most meme stocks - it actually is a good underlying business. According to an article by a website not allowed on here (just copy and past the quote in google to find it), ""With the company’s international expansion, M&A initiatives, and cloud acceleration, under my most optimistic case scenario, the company is worth $55 per share. If IronNet continues to sign agreements with nation states and companies like CrowdStrike did, I believe that the upside potential is significant."" The article discusses how the company's AI initiatives, cyber security focus, and cloud acceleration, all of which are some of the most important and up and coming technology sectors, poise it to go up in value significantly. Additionally, the company also just reported earnings. Though the earnings were lower than expected, take a look at the after hours activity - the shorts have no juice left.

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

So there you have it. in my opinion, IRNT is an EXTREMELY good stock fundamentally so I will be holding it long term. HOWEVER, the stock also presents a rare gamma squeeze - short squeeze opportunity that retail hasn't seen since GME. The stock has an extremely high reported short interest, an extremely small float, open interest on ITM call options that outnumbers the current float, is on the regulationSHO threshold list indicating that it has extremely high short interest and possible naked shorting, has been on that list for a significant amount of time, and the ITM options that outnumber the float are expiring right around when shorts would be forced to cover their FTDs. In other words, an absolute grand slam.

I've fixed it an am posting this again \*

I'm seeing a lot of posts talking about a possible market correction, but very few people are talking about what to do if we see a correction.

I'm posting this because I want those of you who are trying not to blow up your accounts to be aware of a few ways you can prevent yourselves from being completely hosed. Don't be a Timmy with a floppy taco.

**(1) Inverse ETFs.** 

An inverse ETF will move in the **opposite direction** of an underlying index. I don't want to go into too much detail here because there is a lot of ground to cover, but in general the US has three main indexes: S&P, DOW, and Nasdaq. You can buy inverse ETFs for each of these indexes if you think they may correct down.

Personally I like the 3x leveraged inverse ETFs: [you can find them on this link because of I post them this post will be auto-banned.](https://etfdb.com/themes/leveraged-3x-inverse-short-etfs/) The ones I use are #1, #4 and #5 on that link. What makes these leveraged ETFs cool is that **you can get a lot of downside protection without a lot of cash**. Additionally, these inverse ETFs do not expire like put options. However, because they are inverse, they generally depreciate rapidly in value over time because the markets generally go up and are used mainly by day traders or swing traders.

**Side note:** it's a **really bad idea to over leverage** an account with these things... You want to use the leverage so you can use less cash to protect more of your portfolio, not use 100% of your cash to try and maximize a downward move in the market. If you do that you risk blowing up your account because the 3x leverage will destroy you if the markets do start to go up

**(2) selling covered calls:**

Helpful Links:

[What is an option (detailed 1-hr video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD7sw0bf1ms&t=518s&ab_channel=InTheMoney)

[What is a Covered Call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnTsQBJHMSk&ab_channel=InTheMoney)

If you have 100 shares of a stock and want to limit your downside risk then you can sell calls with your shares (if you can). Essentially you can write a call option and sell it to someone in exchange for a premium. Your broker will **hold the shares as collateral** for the call you sold. This, if you don't want to sell your shares but you don't want to be a bag holder, you can sell covered calls for the stocks in your portfolio.

The idea is that you sell options contracts at a strike above what you paid for the stock. This way if the stock does go up and you get exercised, you're selling at a profit and collecting a premium. If the stock goes down, then you just collect the premium

**The downside to this is if your shares take a big hit** then future contracts you sell will have to be issued at a lower strike price **in order for you to get a decent premium**. This creates a **really vulnerable position** because you can possibly sell a call at a strike well under your entry, then some random good news comes out about your stock, it jumps above your strike over night, and then you get exercised and have to sell at a loss. 

Example **(please read)**: if you bought [STMP](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/STMP?p=STMP&.tsrc=fin-srch) at 210 in April, then it went down to 160. You could sell 170 calls thinking you're giving yourself enough time to adjust your position if the stock price goes up--however, in early July it was announced that STMP would be purchased by another company over night. So if you were selling a CC for under $210 at that time, you literally would not have any time to adjust your position because the stock went up over 50% literally over night. It's black swans like this that can completely destroy you if you're selling CCs under your entry price.

**Covered calls are not free money**. They are simple to learn but hard to master. **Do not rely on this post to understand them.** Go on YouTube and learn about them. I'm just posting this so you have an introduction to the topic.

**(3) Having cash.** 

For some reason people feel like they have to have all their money in the market all the time, but doing so means you never have any cash on hand to buy a dip. If you think there may be volatility in the future, just make deposits in your account and don't spend the money on anything. I know that's hard to do when you see stocks go up, but if you have some money on the side while stocks are going down then you can always average down your position.

**(4) Buying puts a few months out.**

I think everyone knows you can buy a put if you think the markets will go down, but a lot of you probably are going to not buy the right one.

In general, a downward move in the market is ""fast."" **This means it's going to take place over a few weeks or months unless there is government intervention.** If you're buying weekly puts, your time horizon is too short and if you're buying leap puts, your time horizon is too long (and you're tying up a lot of money). The sweet spot is a few months, maybe 4-6. Why? Because that's enough time to see a big move in a put contract and it's cheap enough for most of you to buy.

Typically you should also be buying ITM or ATM puts. Don't be a goon and get puts where the stock needs to go down 25% before you break even. I know those are cheaper and when they hit, they hit big... **But they also are the most likely to lose money and if the market starts to recover they can lose a tremendous amount of value over night.**

**Final thoughts:** 

This **is NOT meant to be a guide** on how to play market corrections. To be honest, a lot of the topics I talk about are rudimentary and you can lose a ton of money doing any of this incorrectly. However, if you don't even know about these topics then you're likely to think you don't have any options, you'll panic sell, and you'll make mistakes.

Also, I do think it is helpful for you to take some time and learn a little bit about technical analysis. I think that TA and patterns and all that chart stuff is honestly a lot of BS. However, it is helpful to know what a simple moving average is, what the MACD is, what the RSI is. It's just helpful. I've made some really dope swing trades over the years by getting into a position when a stock is oversold or getting out when it looks like it's over bought.

For charts you can use either Webull or Trading View. Just google those and you'll find them. I know Trading View lets you use their stuff for free, and webull as well--but I think you might have to deposit some cash with webull before you get the charting software with live data. I'm not 100% sure.

**Positions:**

I did open inverse positions yesterday because I saw we had candle closes below short term moving averages and that is a sign of a reversal. If we end up recovering then I will just sell my inverse positions at a loss and keep my longs in tact. 

Try it out. Keep your👖 High and tight."

With partnerships already in place, I wouldn’t be surprised if they announce it with Affirm or Goldman Sachs.  Their credit card is with a partnership with Goldman Sachs and some early reports were that Apple was going to partner with Goldman for the BNPL service. However, Apple went with Affirm for Apple Canada.

There are several articles so Just google it since if I post a link I’ll probably do it wrong.  

The open interest for GS for this Friday at 410 and 415 is huge.  If the stock runs a little on the news, it will potentially run a lot.  Affirm has a fairly low float so it runs by leaps and bounds like we have all seen in the last month.  I think it’s going to be GS.  They want into the fin tech space and Cramer who is a GS insider made an interesting statement this morning.  He said that he thinks Apple is going to announce BNPL at the event today.  With his connections, I wouldn’t be surprised if he knew something…

I have 1 415 C for Friday (17th).   I don’t have crazy Ape money to risk…just wanted to share my idea and see what you all think.  

Edit:  I went ahead and bought shares at 405.  With a PE of 7.5 this seems like a low risk or the bottom falling out of it.  Financial stocks might do pretty well in the near term anyway."

So, what do the top investors say lately? Here's my interpretation:

Burry: We're in the biggest speculative bubble of all time in all things.   
Assets under management (AUM): $635 million

Dalio: US Bonds are crap, US equities are frothy, tech is bubble-ish. Get into emerging markets. China isn't so bad.   
AUM: $140 billion

Buffet: I'll reduce my positions and wait for a better entry.  
AUM: $632 billion

Wood: Innovation will lead to enormous GDP and productivity growth over the next 5-10 years.   
AUM: $53 billion

=============================================

If you've been following financial news this year you probably know that Burry started shorting TSLA back in Dec 2020 and has been crying wolf that we're in a bubble since this spring. Ever since then the market has gone up a lot. Doesn't that make him wrong this time? Not necessarily, no. In fact, that means we might be in an even bigger bubble than we were earlier this year. Luckily for him, seems like he learned from last time to hedge his shorts too, and bought FB and GOOG calls in case the market continues to rocket, which have printed hard. 

 Speculation is at an all-time high. Look at this chart of subscriber count for WSB:

[I'm guessing most of these new subscribers aren't YOLOing on OTM SPY puts every week.](https://preview.redd.it/50kiiie6zbn71.png?width=3010&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c4c7817c548515eae1823cc2f0e986565522ea9)

Take a look at this chart of TSLA

https://preview.redd.it/jhh5i2tfzbn71.png?width=2492&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c354ae8100a048cf81176d619ddaaa5f51b4dda

And compare it to the standard asset bubble chart here:

https://preview.redd.it/hngourvbycn71.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9175668887dbb1f5639fd54ce395c38865b0a879

Now with fundamentals way off, TA lining up, and lots of possible macroeconomic issues in the near future, this looks to me like a great setup for a short. Now of course, nothing is certain in the markets. BUT, if the bubble is about to pop, this could be the trading opportunity of a lifetime. That's why I'm going short. 

""Burry is a value-shill permabear""

Burry was long on a bunch of equities at the bottom of the pandemic last year, he bought GME at $5. [https://www.yahoo.com/now/michael-burry-doubles-money-3-174031896.html](https://www.yahoo.com/now/michael-burry-doubles-money-3-174031896.html). He has consistently beaten the market in bad years and good years too. 

""Burry is smart but he is wrong about TSLA""

If you won't follow Burry, then how about following Wood?[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/09/09/cathie-woods-ark-invest-sells-110-million-in-tesla-stock-as-insiders-also-dump-shares/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/09/09/cathie-woods-ark-invest-sells-110-million-in-tesla-stock-as-insiders-also-dump-shares/)

""Cathie Wood gives TSLA a $3k price target""

Wood, Dalio, and Buffet have such high AUM that their positions can be highly illiquid. That is, even if they knew they positions were overvalued, they aren't always able to get out of before causing panic in the underlying. For this reason, you always have to take what they say with a grain of salt. Wood, who is a brilliant investor, would obviously not say that TSLA is overvalued, same that Dalio will not say that BABA is a risky stock to hold. It's a perfect case of ""do as I say, not as I do."" So instead of listening to what they say, which is always going to be biased, try looking at what they do. 

And lately, Wood has been selling TSLA. When the **bulls start selling**, it might be a good time to get out.

There will be corrections in some valuations, yes. I'm not saying that all valuations are reasonable right now. But why would the whole fucking thing crash? Literally everyone wants to buy the dip. PRICED IN.

You think the market will crash because 14k Reddit geniuses upvoted a post about the market crashing? PRICED IN.

You're telling me you wouldn't go all in on FAANG/FAAMG/FAGMAN if they dipped 20% tomorrow? (For the CLOVtards in the audience, 20% is the minimum dip required for a market correction). I would fucking jizz all up in my brand new Lululemon ABC Slim-Fit Joggers if I could buy Google at $2200 or Apple at $120.

Nobody is smarter than the market. Especially you.

Pull your head out of your ass. Fucking embarrassing.

The $DUDE here with my periodic ""Dude Diligence"" reports on $CLOV - Clover Health Investments Corp and thoughts on potential price action for the upcoming week.  Be prepared to read a little bit (and I realize what I have here is probably more reading than most of you crayon-eaters have done collectively since the first grade)  ...but it will be worth your time if you're seriously considering trading CLOV

I want to start off with a quick intro- I'm a long-time lurker here on WSB but rarely post.  I joined a little over a year and a half ago right before COVID hit as the subreddit was on the verge of breaking 1M Degenerates.  I spend a bit more of my time on Twitter and am active there if you care to follow me aka, The $DUDE  ([https://twitter.com/nikiped1a](https://twitter.com/nikiped1a)).

Anyway, I don't want to make this too long but I've been trading for about 16 years which started with a single $2000 deposit as a college student in my early 20s which was a good chunk of my net worth at the time.  That $2K has grown significantly over the years through working, trading and has been diversified into real estate as well.  I work in tech for a publicly traded software company and now have few healthy trading accounts (primary trading, IRA and Roth IRAs) where I mainly swing/momentum trade some YOLOs and occasionally invest longer term if I feel there's a disruptive technology/company w/ high upside potential.

Originally I came to WSB for the memes and then quickly realized it was a really helpful community w/ useful crowd-sourced info, strategies and data in addition to the solid meme game.  That was before it exploded 10X in size over about a 6 month period time leading up to the GME and AMC squeeze craziness earlier this year.

While I will say most of the info here is still good for the most part, you do have to dig a bit deeper now, verify a little more often and pushback on a lot more misinformation than in the ""early days"".  And that brings me to the point I'd like to speak about today.  Misinformation and how it has run rampant especially when it comes to Clover Health Investments Corp aka $CLOV.

I've been trading this stock since late Feb and seen the many ups, then downs, then big ups again and then downs.  But more than anything, I've seen and still see the disruptive potential of A.I. in a dinosaur of an industry like Healthcare.

Here's my fresh take since I know there are a lot of new traders/investors in CLOV and there's been a definite uptick of late in interest to potentially invest moving forward... (Disclaimer:  I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice, it is solely made up of my own personal opinions.  I do currently hold a position in CLOV for obvious reasons once you read through this)

&#x200B;

**STORY TIME**

I'm going to start this all off with a little story...

Once upon a time, there was this new fangled company called Tesla and it was forward thinking and it was technology obsessed and it was innovation first and they wanted to build cars.

Well, the collective good ol boys (GoB) club that makes up the automotive industry saw this quirky autist-lead company and laughed at them and pointed fingers at their silly electric motors with ""auto pilot"" and weird frunks and batteries- WTF??.

The GoB don't like disruption.  Instead, the GoB loooove the status quo- because they're on top and in control, so why wouldn't they?

This TSLA company didn't care that they were getting the cold shoulder and started to build their cars that were ""never going to succeed"" anyway and they were actually pretty f\*cking bad ass.

""...There's no way this TSLA is a viable long-term company- they don't have the recharging infrastructure, there will never be adoption by the masses and ultimately they'll run out of money, "" sneered all the GoB execs along with the know-it-all stock analysts, big banks as well as Jim Cramer and all his Wall St. buddies.

And then something weird happened ...people started buying these electric cars ...and buying them even more and buying them even faster.   We all know how this story ends.  The GoB are now scrambling to catch up and acquire similar technologies to compete w/ the O.G. disruptor.

This is what happens with disruptive companies- they see problems and their leaders are visionary problem-solvers and refuse to follow inefficiency and the status quo.  And it's weird because when these disruptive companies pop up, you'd think they would be praised and their industries would welcome their new ways of thinking.  But that's not real life- instead they're mocked and told they'll never make it and to give up because deep down the GoB know the legacy way of thinking is in danger of drastically changing and all of the sudden the go from leader to playing catch up.   So the collusion begins and they do all they can to ensure there's a failure to launch w/ negative publicity, or just ignored altogether, shorted to hell or option D:  all of the above.  Whatever it takes to kill off the ""perceived threat"".

Well, there's another company similar to TSLA that's looking to disrupt another Dinosaur industry- Healthcare- and healthcare may be the oldest most dinosaur of the dinosaurs...  This company is $CLOV and why a lot of people in the rapidly growing community refer to it as #TeslaHealth.

And before many of you in here sneer and mock- hear me out over the next few paragraphs.  I will support my DD w/ data, Press Releases, Quarterly Financials, etc, not opinions...

&#x200B;

**CLOVER HEALTH IS A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY FIRST**

First and foremost $CLOV needs to actually be seen and recognized for what it is at it's core- NOT a meme stock.  **Clover Health, at its foundation is a Technology/Software company (Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning) that just so happens to focus on the Healthcare/Insurance space.**   It's only a meme stock because it's heavily talked about here on WSB, but this is actually a long-term growth stock with rapidly improving fundamentals, massive growth... and down the list, the potential of a squeeze, but that is secondary in my mind.  I'm long on CLOV.

&#x200B;

**CLOVER HEALTH's MISSION STATEMENT**

*Clover is a healthcare technology company helping members live their healthiest lives with its Medicare Advantage plans. On a mission to improve every life, Clover uses its proprietary technology platform to collect, structure, and analyze health and behavioral data to improve medical outcomes and lower costs for patients. As a company whose business goals fully align with its members' health needs, Clover works with members and their doctors to become a valued partner. Clover has offices in Nashville, San Francisco, Jersey City, and Hong Kong.*

CLOV is a next-generation healthcare/insurance disruptor in that it has developed proprietary AI technology called the Clover Assistant (CA).

**Clover Assistant Explanation Video:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX4S8oDou4k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX4S8oDou4k)

What's great about this is that it integrates with all FHIR EHR's (Electronic Health Record systems) ...hospital systems, doctor's offices, pharmacies, etc. use EHR to store and manage patient info (similar to a CRM used by all businesses) and these can now all integrate easily with CA.

This allows for real-time data visualization & reporting at doctor's fingertips so they can not only make the best possible decisions for the health of their patients based on all available info across all EHR systems, but also concurrently make the most cost-effective decision from a business standpoint (improved margins compared to competitors w/o a similar type technology.)

In short, as doctors are empowered to make the best possible decisions, patients health is significantly improved having fewer issues long term, which leads to fewer hospital/doctor  visits and a dramatic reduction in overall costs.  Clover Assistant has the ability to keep people healthier, longer.  How is this alone not something we should all get behind for the general good of our population??

**Aug 10, 2021 PR Link:**  Now integrates with all FHIR-enabled EHR's

[https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-assistant-now-supports-all-fhir-enabled-ehrs](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-assistant-now-supports-all-fhir-enabled-ehrs)

**Sept 8, 2021 PR Link:**  Clover Health partners with largest EHR company AthenaHealth for seamless integration of Clover Assistant

[https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-integrates-clover-assistant-athenahealths-market](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-integrates-clover-assistant-athenahealths-market)

You want to know what's also pretty f\*cking awesome that doesn't get enough talk time?  They could also potentially license the Clover Assistant software to other healthcare orgs at some point, i.e. Software-as-a-Service or SaaS.  I work in this space and have been selling SaaS contracts to large corporations for the better part of 2 decades.

My previous company had a stock price of $15 when they were selling ""perpetual licenses"" aka, dinosaur software sales model.  ...when they switched over to a SaaS model, their stock price climbed to over $500 during the next 10 years.  Did I play my ESPP during this time?  Uh, you know I did!

In summary... just this software licensing component alone could have a massive effect on longer term company revenue, if played correctly.  Of note, I don't think productizing CA for resale is currently in the works from what I've seen, so none of this potential is priced in yet.  If/when that happens, you will wish you put every single penny you have into CLOV.

&#x200B;

**TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET**

CLOV plays heavily in the Medicare Advantage space and potentially at some point Original Medicare as well.  Currently citizens in the US are eligible for Medicare at 65 years old and about 60M people total or 18% of the US population are on it as of 2019:

Total Medicare Growth (Original Medicare + Medicare Advantage)

[Total Medicare growth in US from 1990-2019](https://preview.redd.it/xkm6dlk8o5n71.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=48ef0dd7523641c089b72e8da7d0f9f468cb889d)

Medicare Advantage Growth (26M Medicare Advantage vs. approx. 36M Original Medicare enrollees)

[Medicare Advantage Enrollment 2000-2021](https://preview.redd.it/dt9mpi6b65o71.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d2aba04aafdb94478983e2c0be05f0a95bb1f24)

Medicare Advantage is gaining market share vs. Original Medicare

[Medicare Advantage Penetration 2000-2021](https://preview.redd.it/ty5snobk65o71.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=68e57e18123c0369310dba08c5c0b99a997c2ed2)

Look at the Baby-Boomer jump beginning around 2006 and its resulting sharp increase.  It's expected to continue this rapid rise during the next decade and if the eligible age of Medicare is dropped from 65 to 60, that could add another 24+ Million (a potential 40% bump) to its total lives managed within the program.

A unique component that CLOV has when it comes to lives managed is that it has a direct contracting entity (DCE) program.  This is unique Medicare program by the CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) has only offered this to Clover Health and 52 other organizations at this time.

This has been a boon for CLOV as they have nearly doubled their lives on Medicare in just over 6 months (take a look at revenue a little further below in this DD to see what just a single  quarter offering this program has done for revenue.)

**Info on DCE Program:** [https://www.cloverhealthpartners.com/en/](https://www.cloverhealthpartners.com/en/)

**Quick Video on Program:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlTnq7cIoKM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlTnq7cIoKM)

(...and someone correct me if I state this inaccurately) but my understanding of DCE (and it's by far the most exciting growth component that I've seen so far related Clover's massive upward revenue trajectory from Q1 to Q1 ) ...under direct contracting entity, Doctors are able to sign patients up individually, outside of the normal Oct 15 - Dec 7th Medicare Open Enrollment period.

&#x200B;

**EXPLOSION IN REVENUE GROWTH YEAR OVER YEAR**

Here are Data from CLOV's most recent Q2 10Q filing on Aug 11, 2021:

**Total Q2 2021 Revenue was $412.5M, which was a 139.7 increase YoY** compared to $172.1M in Q2 of 2020.  $216.4M of that was just from Direct Contracting- are you seeing why I'm pretty stoked on this hyper-growth company?

Total **revenues for the full 2021 year are now expected to increase from $810-$130M which was reported following Q1 earnings to $1.4- $1.5B** following Q2 earnings (and only a $2B valuation at an $8 stock price- very low for a healthcare/technology company!)

Total Lives (customers) under Clover Health management at the end of Q2 was approx. 129,000, **an increase of 126.3% YoY GROWTH!!!**  This has mainly come from the DCE program since it has only been available to Clover since they were included in it along with 52 other companies earlier this year.

**Lives under Clover Assistant management grew by 229% YoY.**

**Clover expects a significant increase in total aligned beneficiaries on Jan 1, 2022**, when claims aligned beneficiaries for 2022 become active - Uh, you probably want to climb on the bandwagon sooner than later given this projection.

If this alone isn't enough to get you to jump on board blindly w/ no questions asked, I don't know what to tell you.  If you can tell, when Q3 earnings are announced on Nov 8, 2021, CLOV could rocket if Q3 report is anything like Q2, especially with a potential update or guidance on newly enrolled lives under mgmt as a couple of weeks of Medicare Open Enrollment will have been completed prior this next ER (OE period goes from Oct 15- Dec 7).

**CLOVER HEALTH's EXEC TEAM:**

Take a look, you have a mix of former Google, Uber, (remember how I said it's a technology company)  United Health Group, McKesson execs... Their board

Exec. Summary:  [https://www.cloverhealth.com/en/about-us/our-story](https://www.cloverhealth.com/en/about-us/our-story)

Demetrios Kouzoukas also just joined Clover Health's board in April.  He is a former Director at the Centers for Medicare- he obviously knows how the program works.  Here is a brief snippet from the PR:

***“...Demetrios is a significant addition to the Board. Having led the legal and regulatory affairs department of the Medicare division at UnitedHealth, he understands the opportunity and challenge of operating at scale. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of Medicare rules and regulations, combined with an incredibly astute business and strategy acumen. We are grateful that Demetrios is joining us on this very important journey....”***

&#x200B;

**CLOVER RAPID EXPANSION IN COUNTIES WHERE THEIR SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE**

CLOV just expanded its market from 108 counties in 10 states to 209 counties now in 9 (11?) states (101 county increase) as of June 24, 2021 press release, meaning essentially all of the earnings data I listed above were from the smaller market, so growth will only continue to accelerate rapidly.

PR Link: [https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-plans-expansion-101-new-markets](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-plans-expansion-101-new-markets)

If that wasn't exciting enough, shortly after announcing these new counties above, Clover Health then announced on Aug 3, 2021 they will be entering yet another new state- their 12th- with a new partnership w/ ValueH.  This new state just happens to be the great state of Florida- the third most populous in the US and a huge Medicare growth potential state for obvious reasons.

&#x200B;

**HEADWINDS, MISCONCEPTIONS & OUTRIGHT MISINFORMATION (LIES) CONTINUALLY PERPETUATED**

Market manipulation w/ the price is probably the biggest headwind.  CLOV, along with GME and AMC have got to be the most manipulated stonk tickers in the history of the stock market.  Market makers, HF and shorts have had an uncanny ability to nearly always pin the price on Fridays just below the options Max Pain price collecting premium and allowing them to do it cycle after cycle so they're making up their borrowing fees while making significant profit on top as well.  The more of the free float investors buy up and hold, the less ability they have to short & manipulate.

The second biggest headwind in my opinion is probably the collusion between analysts, Hedgies and who know's who else (it may be tin hat conspiracy theory, but I feel the big insurance players like United Healthcare Group, Humana etc. are all somehow involved behind the scenes) is involved in colluding with these corrupt analysts to provide totally false price targets, driving price down, while holding short positions.  Help me if I'm mistaken, but aren't PT generally upgraded and downgraded following big news like earnings, PR of new developments, etc?  With CLOV, it doesn't seem to happen that way, they're just downgraded haphazardly for no apparent reason other than those holding short positions are either in trouble, or have some quick money to be made.

Loot at these situations below as examples:

There are at least two instances the community has heavily documented where Bank of America (Kevin Fischbeck) initiated a large 700K short position and within days downgraded their PT from $15 to $10.  Obviously manipulating the stock price in their favor.  What's funny, it was just a month and a half earlier he issued a buy and the earlier $15 target... just doesn't make sense.

The second was a small relatively unknown analyst from Cowen Research that just so happened to downgrade CLOV right as it was building a lot of momentum during the past few weeks.  No negative news- actually if anything, CLOV has had a ton of really positive news and it follows a blowout Q2 earnings.  I really believe it was a greasy attempt to help save a lot of Hedgies from getting stuck w/ a lot of options expiring ITM this past week when it surged 22% the day after Labor Day only to be hit w/ hard attacks.

Cowen just so happened to **also initiate a significant short position right before their BS downgrade.**  Cowen has a pretty greasy track record of shady dealings and has been fined  heavily and had to address many lawsuits over the years.  Why would anyone even trust them with this terrible track record??

I've also heard people talk negatively about losses.  Well, when you're in healthcare, and we're in the midst of the worst worldwide pandemic in over a century, your Medical Care Ratios (MCR) will get out of wack temporarily and that is the case over the past couple of quarters.  MCR was at 111% during Q2, however, Q1 of 2020 (before much of the COVID expense hit) it was 89.4% according to their earnings report.

Free Cash Flow (FCF) has also been talked about and has been affected as this company is in growth mode, however, it has improved tremendously: +31% increase from Q1 to Q2 of 2021.  It will be interesting to see where it goes for Q3.  Definitely moving in the right direction toward getting into the black.

Also much of the expense costs for Q2 were one-time line items related to stock compensation and the cost of warrants to the company (warrants along added -$134.5M in debt)

As of the end of Q2, CLOV had $630M cash and cash equivalents in the bank, so they can sustain losses for awhile (years, possibly longer depending on how quickly covid-related expenses normalize) without issue or dilution.

**HOW TO TRADE CLOV**

OK, this is getting kind of long, so I may type up another DD with more supplementary info, but I want to get into some of the anomalies specific to CLOV if you choose to trade/invest in this stock.

Short Attacks:  Watch out for what looks like a mass selloff right at market open almost every day, shorts always short millions of shares each morning to kill off momentum and scare paper hands and inexperienced traders.  It generally comes back after about 10:30-11am ET when the shorts return their shares because they're just looking to scalp 10-40 cents or so each day and then return them for some profit.  If we're buying up all the float, and not allowing them be be shorted, HF and short's wont be able to do this and we start to gain ground.

Which brings me to this- IF there's anything I hope you learn from reading my DD today, it's this:  **DO NOT BUY SHORT-TERM CALL OPTIONS ON THIS STOCK.  If you do, they will most likely end worthless on Friday's and you will lose your money.**

I know options are normally an attractive opportunity to get into a stock inexpensively because if it moon's at some point, you make a grip on a small investment, but I've been trading this for months, and seen it happen many times over- you will lose your money.

Instead, BUY ACTUAL SHARES!   Help buy up the float and HODL!!  This is going to be a volatile potentially few months as we start making progress vs. the shorts to jack them with an impending squeeze, options have not been working, nor will they, it appears, in the short term.  There may be some opportunity to buy and profit from options once momentum is in bulls favor, but that time is not now.

I hope this was helpful, I know it's long, but if you made it to the end here, really consider getting into this stock, it has a lot of things going for it and it's only $8 right now.  Even without the squeeze potential that exists, this could easily be $20-30 with it's extremely rapid growth of their Direct Contracting.  If you're holding it long, then when the squeeze does happen, it's just gravy.

I may have missed a few things, but if so, I'll just follow this up with another post here in the next day or two.  Would love to hear all of your feedback and/or differing opinions on this.  Happy investing fellow autists!!!"

# (Important Part and TLDR)

 In this DD, I'm going to answer the questions of the skeptics in my previous DD. Since this is a speculative play, skepticism is healthy especially when the stock is in it's very early stages. We definitely don't want this to become the next $NKLA... In addition, There's a risk that it goes to 0$ if shit hits the fan. On the other hand, if things go according to plan, this can easily go 200$+.

***Q1-"" 5G can only go 1500 feet tops. So, any claims to be anything more than 4G is fake physics sentimentalization..."" by*** *u/*[*WilliamNyeTho*](https://www.reddit.com/user/WilliamNyeTho)

>**TLDR; The 1500 Feet figure was brought up by Google searchs smart answer and was pulled up from a Verizon post. Long story short, this doesn't apply to LEO satellite technology used by AST Spacemobile.**

A:   First, **5G is a standard that incorporates many different bands of spectrum, including cellular (600mhz - 3.5ghz), which has great distance and propagation characteristics,** and much higher millimeter band spectrum which has issues traveling far distances and penetrating objects.  **ASTS is planning to use its partner’s CELLULAR spectrum,** which can travel much further than millimeter band spectrum that is referred to by bears.

Second, Traditional communication satellites are geostationary and have been in orbit for more than 50 years. GEO satellites weigh more than 1000kg and operate 36,000 kilometers above the earth. These satellites remain in a fixed position relative to any position. Despite Earth’s orbit, this allows ground-based antennas the ability to point directly at the  satellite, in a fixed position. 

In contrast, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites(which ASTS is going to use) orbits between 200 and 2000 kilometers above Earth’s surface. ASTS is planning to have their satellites at 720Km using cellular spectrum primarily located between 600mhz - 2.2ghz weighing around 2000kg.

Unlike Geostationary Orbits (GEO), LEO satellites move rapidly(at an altitude of 500km, it can move at a speed of 7.6 km/s)  with respect to the Earth’s surface and have a small ground coverage. In particular, the ground coverage of a LEO satellite deployed **at 600 km** above the Earth’s surface and with a typical elevation angle of 30 degrees **is around 0.45% of the Earth’s surface.** Moreover, **due to the low altitude of deployment,** LEO satellites can communicate **with diverse types of ground terminals, such as dedicated ground stations (GSs), 5G gNBs**, ships and other vehicles, or Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This creates the need for a relatively dense constellation **to ensure that any ground terminal is always covered by at least one satellite.** Therefore, global commercial deployments such as ASTS usually consists of more than a hundred satellites to be able to have a full global coverage.

Now AST satellites each will have up to 2800 user beams and two or three gateway beams. Each user beam will be electrically steered through a large phased array antenna and will be capable of being pointed anywhere within the Field of View (“FoV”) of 20 degrees elevation angle. Each satellite in the AST constellation will provide service up to 58 degrees away from boresight.

Each satellite may transmit all of its active user beams on the same frequency or different frequencies. Each active user beam will track a fixed cell on the ground within its FoV without steering the boresight of the planar phased array antenna. All of the active beams can be distributed flexibly  within the FoV.

The same cell on the ground can be illuminated by a single beam, by multiple beams from same satellite, or by multiple beams from different satellites with in the view of the cell to enhance the user experience. The beam-to-beam handover and the gateway handover are based on schedules and  use a “break -then- make ” approach.

# How Apples rumor plays into this? (VERY BULLISH)

IPhone 13 is rumored to contain a chip with increased satellite connectivity capabilities, Qualcomm Snapdragon x60. In addition, There is a 3GPP release 16 chip that has been available to OEM(original equipment manufacturer) phone makers since the beginning of this year and it will be in phones starting early 2022. This chip is designed by Qualcomm and it is called x65. Moreover, it is manufactured by AST SpaceMobile's partner Samsung. This chip is the worlds first chip to fully implement 3GPP release 16.

Why is it important?

It will feature enhanced beamhandling capabilities, 4x4 MIMO, and an increased satellite connectivity.

**That is very bullish because it shows that Cell phone makers are already getting ready to connect even better to AST SpaceMobile constellation.**

***Q2- ""No fuckin way they pull that off with a 10m2 sat with any sizeable number of users..."" by***  *u/*[*WilliamNyeTho*](https://www.reddit.com/user/WilliamNyeTho)

>**TLDR; AST SpaceMobile is planning to have enormous satellites with a cross section of 450m2.**

The large LEO concepts are mainly planning to use Ka band for Backhaul. These frequencies **enable higher data rates,** smaller antennas, narrower beams, and greater security. Moreover, improved spectral efficiency and spectrum-reuse rates can also **increase the amount of data a system delivers.**

In addition to better use of spectrum, advances in active antennas and processing have **raised throughput per individual satellite, increasing constellation capacity.** Consider a few changes:

* A satellite can now deploy more spot beams, and greater power can be delivered through each beam.
* Intersatellite links (ISLs) improve connectivity and confer particular benefits to large constellations, including improved throughput and management.
* Improved data-compression methods reduce bandwidth requirements without reducing the quality of communications.

So, a 10 Ka-band steerable antenna can provide up to 1.6 Gbps of symmetrical data connectivity. In addition, two high-performance antennas, can provide up to 5.2 Gbps of symmetrical data connectivity. This is only for the backhaul between the satellites and terrestrial stations. ASTS btw is planning to use V bands for backhaul, which have less traffic on them vs. Ka.

Now for the Fronthaul ASTS will use cellular spectrum (600mhz - 2.2ghz). These frequencies are used today by cellular phones. These frequencies are the best at covering long distances and can propagate through rain, walls, trees, etc .

Now the numbers for ASTS aren't out, but we can talk about Starlinks numbers since it uses LEO satellites too which is essentially the same technology. Starlink will be able to support 485,000 simultaneous users at 100Mbit/s across the entire US, according to new estimates. Additionally, Elon Musk tweeted on 26 of June ""Starlink simultaneously active users just exceeded the strategically important threshold of 69,420 last night!"". The technology works and the numbers are impressive.

***Q3- ""What kind of lag is there to get this data from low earth orbit? Streaming is one thing, gaming is another. I'm curious what the latency would be."" by u/***[*mbr4life1*](https://www.reddit.com/user/mbr4life1/)

>**TLDR; LEO satellites have a low latency 25-35ms.**

This question of latency is key. Some geostationary satellites at 35,786 km already provide broadband services but their transmissions take about 500-700 milliseconds (ms) to travel up and another 500-700 milliseconds to travel down. This time-lag is why users suffer the infuriating time delay during a conversation between the broadcast studio and an outside broadcast unit. If the OB (Outside broadcasting) is more than one satellite ‘hop’ away, then the delay is multiplied.

Now on the other hand, A low Earth-orbiting satellite(What ASTS is using), between 200 and 2000 km, would manage these links in **about 25-35 ms**, a true fraction of existing satellite links and quite comparable to existing cables or fibre networks!

***Q4- ""Starlink will be a direct competitor by 2025"" by u/***[***MaximumRecording1170***](https://www.reddit.com/user/MaximumRecording1170/)

>**TLDR; Short answer is no.**

*Great answer by*  u/[CatSE---ApeX---](https://www.reddit.com/user/CatSE---ApeX---/) :

Yes, AST will be a fierce competitor  to Starlink as AST can do fixed cellular broadband at much lower customer acquisition cost. So they’ll be the prefered choice in  developing world and for low traffic applications in developed world.

But, no, Starlink will not compete with AST in AST core market. Which is  connecting directly to unmodified cellular phones.  This is because Starlink uses high band spectrum that has poor distance and propagation characteristics, which requires users to 1) buy a large dish antenna that is fixed in position and 2) have a clear line of sight to the satellite.

\*\*\*Q5- ""\*\*\****How can phone signals reach the satellite given the strength of a regular handset?, How much is it affected by the weather?"" by u/***[XinjDK](https://www.reddit.com/user/XinjDK/)

*Great answer by*  u/[CatSE---ApeX---](https://www.reddit.com/user/CatSE---ApeX---/) :

* Gainforming. It is a bit like beamforming but it optimizes the gain of the electronically steered antenna.
* the cellular bands used for fronthaul (phone-satellite) are not affected by weather. The v-band used for backhaul (satellite to terrestrial ground  station / switch hooked up with terrestrial cellular network) is susceptible to rain attenuation. This is solved by having powerful antennas in both ends to overcome that attenuation. (If need be, several  alternative terrestrial sites within the FoV of satellite could be  used. To circumvent very heavy rainfalls. No such tweak has been  communicated by company though.)

***Q6- A very frequent question, Why is this ticker allowed on WSB? Doesn't have a small market cap? u/***[Oxianas](https://www.reddit.com/user/Oxianas/) u/[Momoselfie](https://www.reddit.com/user/Momoselfie/)

WSB doesn't tolerate BS aka SPACS, Crypt0, and Market caps <1.5 Billion. At the time of my first post, the market cap of ASTS was 1.7 Billion.

Some brokers, such as TD Ameritrade, brings up only Class A share Data. That's why some people get confused with the market cap.

The A,B, and C class shares were worth 1.7 Billion at the time of my first post.

***Q7- Is there a partnership between SpaceX and AST Spacemobile? by u/***[***carsonthecarsinogen***](https://www.reddit.com/user/carsonthecarsinogen/)

BlueWalker 3(ASTS Satellite) is expected to launch aboard a SpaceX mission from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in March 2022. The spacecraft has an aperture of 693  square feet and is designed to communicate directly with cell phones via 3GPP standard frequencies.

***Q8- How could anyone possibly know that? 6G is still in development. by u/*** [The\_Super\_Capitalist](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Super_Capitalist/)

AST SpaceMobile Leo Satellites don't do onboard processing. They’re bent pipe architecture so they’re forward compatible with any protocols being carried on cellular spectrum.  As long as future protocols incorporate cellular spectrum, any future 6G, 7G, etc can be supported.

***Q9- Get ready to get diluted to hell when VC gets called back in after the stock gets pumped. by u/***[The\_Super\_Capitalist](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Super_Capitalist/)

*answer by*  u/[CatSE---ApeX---](https://www.reddit.com/user/CatSE---ApeX---/) with edits :

The owner/partners (Cisneros, American Tower, Vodafone, Samsung, and Rakuten) will provide non-dillutive funding options once equatorial satellites are deployed (and that  one is fully funded).

The risk of  public offerings/dilllution risk should not be exaggerated. If equatorial constellation succeeds it will open up huge positive cashflows. And to aquire non-dillutive bridging financing from owners and/or banks to expand the constellation quicker will most likely be no problem at that point.

Finally, the company can cash settle its warrants once the stock price trades above $18 for 20/30 trading days.  This would bring in $11.50 x 17.6M public/private warrants = $202 million in capital.

***Q10- ""Pump  & dump warning on this company guys. They just hyping a technology  that doesn't exist yet, no heavy institutions supporting them and mostly  owned by private stakeholders. If you really want to YOLO just short it  before it drops."" by***  [Same-Seaworthiness20](https://www.reddit.com/user/Same-Seaworthiness20/)

15 days later, and it didn't dump. For me, this shows that the holders are true believers and not just pumpers.

No institutional support? Now this is straight up BS! Rakuten(Big japanese telecom), ATT, Vodafone, and American Towers all have a position in it. Go to Fintel to see all the institutional investors. According to Fintel, 29% is held by institutional investors. In addition, These investors are well versed in the 5G market and I don’t think that they would’ve invested if they didn’t see a proof of concept.

Website for reference [https://www.microvision.com/](https://www.microvision.com/)

MVIS has many uses for it's technology but the two main verticals are Automotive Lidar & AR/VR.

**Automotive Lidar -** Microvision just completed what they claim (with good reason) is their ""Best in Class"" Long Range Lidar unit. It is an actual product that they are track testing and showing off at the IAA Mobility Conference in Germany. Look at the live demo they have up vs. our competitors:

* Luminars Lidar Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/c8v23x](https://streamable.com/c8v23x)

* Microvision Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/paywxe](https://streamable.com/paywxe)

As you can see by the point cloud and refresh rate MVIS sure looks best in class. MVIS is currently on the path of scaling for production and looking for partners.

Market Size - The global lidar market size is projected to reach **$6.77 Billion by 2026** and virtually every car company is investing/looking to utilize Lidar in the future for assisted and automated driving. It could be in every new vehicle. Luminar (LAZR) the inferior product as you can easily see by the videos above IPO'd last year with a market cap of $8.1 Billion.

**AR/VR** \- Microvision produces the MEMS Laser Beam Scanning display engine found in the Microsoft Hololens 2. It was confirmed through a tear down before and just officially via MVIS's last ASM. Also, since Microsoft produces the IVAS (rugged Hololens 2 for military use) it is highly speculated that MVIS is the engine inside that also.

Market Size - According to a comprehensive research report by Market Research Future (MRFR), “Global AR and VR Market information By Technology, By Component, By Device Type and Vertical - Forecast till 2027” the market to reach **USD 766 billion by 2025.** Also, Microsoft just won an army contract this year **worth up to $21.9 Billion.**

Google the Hololens 2 or IVAS units to see all the cool futuristic shit they can do. I'm not gonna spoon feed you everything.

**Stock Info**

Current Market Cap = $2.24 Billion

52 Week High = $28

52 Week Low = $1.38

Estimated Short Interest = 29.75m or 18.29% of FF

Q2 2021 shares held by institutions: **42,174,027 (25.7%)**

**Summary**

Since Sumit Sharma took over as CEO he continues to deliver on his promise to increase shareholder value. The company is open for a buyout, strategic alternative, or going it alone with it's amazing technology. Whatever will be the best route to **INCREASE SHAREHOLDER VALUE**. At it's current share price we are way **UNDERVALUED.** There is more DD out there on the technologies, different verticals, and how we are at an inflection point for these things to pop. Go look at the MVIS subreddit and the meta thread there of DD I can't link.

pkckpv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pkckpv/uranium_has_explosive_potential_and_this_time_in/,Uranium has explosive potential - and this time in both cases literally,269,92,2021-09-08 23:19:02,"**Repost to fit subreddit criteria - sorry to keep in SPROTT, but their move affects the main players so it's hard to explain anything without including them. The others were mentioned alongside CCJ, but now it's only CCJ left.**

I'm sure it's not the first time you've come along Uranium, it appeared months ago and went with its success back to where it came from.

Everyone involved in GME, AMC and anything else on here knows there are 3 things you need:

1. A goal to act upon
2. A support from media
3. Big players outside of the general playingfield

GME and AMC have received all 3 heavily. Due to the shorting beyond any reasonable means they were prime targets. This alone was enough for a decent price movement, but media enabled a global coverage of the topic which made so many more people aware of whats going on and flocking in. And lastly, many big names joined in, let it be for testing the waters or to join the fight. I'm sure you have a full list in your mind right now.

**So what's with Uranium?**

Uranium is in a similar position and currently has the most aggressive movements in a company called **CCJ**. CCJ made it on the top 20 list of most bought options (in recent times) multiple times together with names of Tesla, Amazon etc.

I'll explain the reason refered to as point 1, but I'll keep it short as it's the least impact of all. Without 2) and 3) not a lot would happen.

So in short, Uranium mines pretty much tuned down mining over the years due to demand but also because they are in a bad position. Most uranium buyers will only purchase short to mid term what they need instead of making contracts. Since these buyers exist in smaller amounts but with huge impact they can control what happens with the price, pretty much. So production went along with this and decreased to a minimum that can barely cover the needs and even slight interruptions that go on for a while would cause major issues.

Now fast forward to the current date.

This is already 3) named Sprott.

If you don't know Sprott: ""Sprott is a global investment manager specializing in precious metals and real assets investing.""

What did they do? Well, don't take my word for it, let Bloomberg tell you what's going on:

>Sprott has amassed **over 24 million pounds** of uranium, sometimes buying more than 500,000 pounds in a single day, according to its website and social media account. For comparison, total spot volume for 2020 was 92.2 million pounds, according to uranium investor Yellow Cake Plc.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-08/uranium-surges-to-six-year-high-as-fund-buys-up-physical-supply#:\~:text=Sprott%20has%20amassed%20over%2024,uranium%20investor%20Yellow%20Cake%20Plc](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-08/uranium-surges-to-six-year-high-as-fund-buys-up-physical-supply#:~:text=Sprott%20has%20amassed%20over%2024,uranium%20investor%20Yellow%20Cake%20Plc).

The expectation here is not a short squeeze as of now. The main expectation is an insane surge in price due to the tight demand-supply that was floating around Uranium and is now majorly interrupted. With how tight it is Sprott can pretty much control the price to an extend and that's why it's going crazy.

**So what's with media support?**

[**https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-09-07/Sprott-s-investment-in-uranium-is-paying-off-and-it-s-just-the-start.html**](https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-09-07/Sprott-s-investment-in-uranium-is-paying-off-and-it-s-just-the-start.html)

Well, you are free to look for yourself, but it started and is as expected. The move of them is hyped up like crazy and this has by far not over at all. The initial price surge came from the news of them buying and announcing it, for a reference:

[SPROTT announces their purchase program of Uranium](https://preview.redd.it/hwy29fg1ram71.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=85af49792f5012cb2166d0e63e736e452c0d2bff)

The media coverage is there and it's just starting off. If you search for Uranium and go 1 month, 1 wekk and 1 day back on the Google search you'll see an exponential increase in articles despite the way less time a single day has compared to an entire week.

**But what's the future of Uranium?**

I can't tell you what happens, if that was the case I'd be rich, sitting on a bought island and slurping cocktails 24/7. But this move caused by a company, not by a random action or idea - so it's their own interest to make the most out of it and considering what they just caused they are most certainly no idiots. The first impact is the announcement and what people understand will follow: A lack of supply. So why shouldn't mines just produce more? They sold a ton to SPROTT and could now satisfy the lack of product, right? Well, not really. If they do this, SPROTT will most likely decline or stop buying more, meaning their bumped up production is completely wasted for a one time pay off that might not even be good for them. But wait, it gets worse - for the Uranium buyers. A ton of nuclear power stations are opening. Nuclear Power is pretty much green energy with a bad side effect of radioactivity, but that's why it was pushed more and more. It's by far better for the environment than coal, which countries move away from - at least if they care about the environment.

So combined: Miners will most likely not increase production because they would shoot into their own foot (their ultimate goal is longterm well paying contracts), demand for Uranium will surge up in the next months and years and SPROTT doesn't stop buying current production. No matter what happens the price will keep surging since SPROTT can pretty much set the price they want, but in a likely case this might spiral to levels that we had back in 2011 with 70-80$ or heck even 140$ in 2007. Mind you a big move away from Nuclear Power Plants happened a while ago and with the new found hype for Uranium and the given issues this could become bigger than ever before.

**So what do I do if I want to join?**

As mentioned you can either buy CCJ. All 3 are well performing among this surge. Don't get me wrong, all Uranium stocks have surged like crazy recently, but most options trading happens in CCJ while.

No financial advise of course, just sharing what my dummy brain was able to gather."

So here's a better more honest analysis of SBC and a look into the companies current prospects.



Firstly regarding Palantir. Their leadership is incredible. 90% commercial growth YoY. 50% overall YoY growth and a guidance of 30% growth through 2025 that is totally sandbagged and going to get beaten easily next earnings. 

They have 0$ in debt.  Zero fucking dollars in debt. 

Roughly 2.5 billion in cash including 50 million in gold because they're so diversified 

Hundreds of millions in start up investments

3.5 billion in remaining money coming in from contracts (meaning they could stop doing business and still pull in 3.5 billion first) 

Stock based compensation has gone down significantly in last two quarters. 

Stock based compensation is completely comparable to other companies in similar fields or in tech. 

It's not just for their executives it's a fantastic way to incentivize all employees existing and future to stay with the company for the long run by granting shares. 

Stock based compensation doesn't equal them selling shares. It means granting shares. You're equating it with mostly Alex Karp and a few other leaders doing PRE SCHEDULED tax sales of shares because he's as part of going public (he has almost 10% ownership) the government is taxing him as if going public means he owes taxes on billions of dollars that he ONLY has in shares. In order to cover this he and others sell shares on a pre determined schedule so they don't go to jail with the IRS.


It has nothing to do with their commitment to the company or their leadership or their faith in the future. If you had any idea what you were talking about you'd realize none of them have really changed their overall stake in the company which is basically what your post alleges is that they're just printing money and getting out dishonestly which couldn't be further from the truth

There is a really good seeking alpha article on this that goes into comparing them to other companies, I tried to link to it but apparently it's a reddit rule that you aren't allowed to so if you want an HONEST analysis not hype bear fud. Google it you'll find it instantly it's titled 

Palantir: The Truth About Its Stock-Based Comp
Written by : Business Quant


Nothing is uniquely negative about PLTRs stock based compensation and it's a very good long term tool for growing a company that has only been public for about a year so what can you really expect at such a stage. It's total dilution amounted to about 10% . Retail traders own 75% of this stock and have sold off well over 10% many times over the FUD from this shitty narrative.

Here's some general insight into the company 


The company is NOT a 20 year company that has never been profitable. What they were doing 20 years ago for the government is barely comparable to the company today. Foundry (their flagship product for both commercial and even government partners) has basically only existed for about 2 years and has even undergone significant improvements even in the last years that will guarantee great margins and efficient delivery. They continually built the company under a growth model taking in revenue, hiring the BEST engineers ask anyone who studied coding and software in any large schools around the country between 2005-now these guys have always had a legendary reputation with engineers students would wear palantir t shirts and shit constantly because they were the place that was actually doing cutting edge software work. They always reinvested over and over growing the government side while working on perfecting their current new products for over a decade making Foundry and the apollo AI framework that now allows them to actually deploy Foundry cheaply. 



Lets even take a look at recent earnings. Quarter prior international growth was 17% So at most recent quarter 28% international growth they posted a pretty excellent QoQ increase. It suggests growth is picking up everywhere. Also I think the fact that they've done immense hiring in the short term plays into both why SBC is being kept high and why some margins were less than Q1. Most of the hiring they've done started in Q2 and only really picked up steam into the middle of the year. Let's also realize that the hiring has been almost entirely focused on distribution employees so they're very clearly moving into much greater expectations and focus of sales than they ever have in the history of their company. Peter Thiel actually has incredibly long explanations of how he thinks the optimal way to build a software companywide is to give as little focus on distribution as possible for as long as possible. This year's hiring is a dramatic indication that they're moving to a new stage as a company. 

Also the fact that their product keeps improving even quarter to quarter. They're constantly saying that they themselves are continually finding new ways and more importantly new industries that Foundry and Appllo can enter and be extremely useful. The perfect example of this was the exciting and very recent development of their meta constellation satellite work that they're now doing. 

I think the reason the stock jumped 10% on earnings and now a lot more since was a direct reaction to the evidence that there is no industry they aren't relevant in for software and they're definitely only at the beginning of entering many industries. 

Recent announcements like Foundry for builders or startups more accurately is another reason for the stocks rise because it was argued for a very long time that they would never be viable at offering their product to anything other than extremely large companies. Most importantly was that at the end of Q1 they announced that they were going to be offering Foundry for free as a way to get it into the hands of more companies it seemed very clear as investors to expect this as a short term damper on margins. The idea is that it would get their product into so many more hands that it would be worth it in the long term with a very obvious temporary effect on margins. The fact that client growth both US AND internationally is accelerating not decelerating points to the idea that their distribution network is at its beginning but it is working and I assert extremely high odds that client growth continues to accelerate for consecutive quarters for a long time. 

They will easily do more than 400 million revenue at next quarters report easily beat guidance and the one benefit to where SBC has been is that it is very likely it decreases potentially even dramatically decreases. Their trajectory is very predictable currently and they are a company that eventually will be a necessity to use if businesses don't want to get out competed. One of their main benefits to their customer companies is increasing margins of customers by finding many inefficiencies so they're one of the few products that can increase your bottom line without making you do anything as a company. This means that even during economic downturn they will be strongly potentially even more in demand because companies will need ways to look better and show cash flow even when consumption declines for periods of time.



If you want to understand the history of the company or what they do they're basically a SaaS company (yes SaaS their margins are good enough and they're only going to improve as they focus more and more outside of government Gotham products) 

Their software allows you to run your company through their platform and it keeps your data completely private. Meaning palantir doesn't see your data and mine information and neither does anyone else. You get better illustrations and representations of your companies affairs and it makes significant insights and determines ways to create better efficiency, heads up preemptive solutions before problems occur, and in many cases can bring so many data sets into play that you can learn things you didnt even know were possible. 

If you want resources for this there are a number of testimonials from customers describing what Foundry does for them on Palantirs youtube

You can go search Tom Nashs video on SkyWise (which is Foundry for airbus). He has a couple of them really incredible deep dive

You can watch their most recent video about meta satellite constellations

They have partners within every industry. Research, academics, science, cancer, genomics, aerospace, literally every military branch, health care both insurance providers and health care providers like the NHS, also NIH, big oil companies like BP, big manufacturers like 3m, faurecia, Rio Tinto mining, John deere, big retailers like bass pro and others even larger, news media companies, robotics, AI, autonomous driving like wejo partnered with gm on that, electronic vehicle startups and even electronic flying vehicle start ups, now satellite companies and US Government satellite ownership even. Do you see where this is going? There's nothing they can't break into and they are what is going to be necessary to have a competitive edge which is why everyone is going to have to use them. 


Which brings me to another point. Palantir doesn't have direct competition. They've explained this many times and anyone who says they are a snowflake competitor doesn't understand them as a company at all. Their competition is potential clients who choose to attempt to make an in house software to glean insights into their own data and structure it uniquely for their own needs. This is Palantirs biggest ""competition"" and they will crush it. That kind of work often takes years and is extremely expensive. Just the time that Palantir can save companies and the headaches of making all the mistakes that come with originally building a software like that makes Palantir worth it. 

They have incredible partnerships with Amazon and IBM for new and important distribution channels for getting their products out and quickly and have stated many times that they can deploy their software completely remotely cutting out the old concern that they will never scale because they need forward deployed engineers to set up software. They still use those but I think it's heavily around massive clients and particularly US gov gotham products not Foundry as we now know it. 

Sick of this ridiculous SBC destroying value garbage narrative. We'll see how much value is destroyed in a year when their stock explodes and you'll be wishing you didn't listen to the geniuses who thought they caught Palantir swindling everyone. Also all the people who didn't get swindled by the bear narratives this year are fucking happy as hell because most of them have at least doubled their positions over the last 6 months as the stock constantly traded in a holding pattern. 

Last point is its holding key resistance right now could easily break out in the short term towards 30$ or beyond. Don't say I didn't warn you. If it holds this 26$ mark and doesn't break down below it this month you'll never see PLTR under 24 dollars again and after next earnings I guarantee you'll never see it under 30$ again."

Before I explain how, check out my previous DD posts for some context.[MTTR Bringing 3D Photogrammetry Experiences](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ou2ap9/mttr_bringing_3d_photogrammetry_experiences_to/) [MTTR Explosive Potential](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3469k/mttr_update_explosive_avenues_of_potential/)

Now, you’re probably wondering “What is the metaverse u/cru3211?”

Let me tell you.

# The Metaverse

The **metaverse** is a paradigm shift in the way we organize ourselves as a society. It’s an evolutionary embodiment of technology & the internet. It’s commonly envisioned as a “second layer” to our world. Sort of like… a virtual clone of it… that’s digitized. See where this is going?

This is the **spatial web**. It represents an emerging three-dimensional web experience. It’ll blow the old internet out of the water.

research: metaverse, web 3.0, and spatial web for more insights.

MSG me and I’ll ramble more about the metaverse. For now, just understand that it’s an inevitable innovation that will see widespread growth within the next decade. Matterport is likely (but not guaranteed) to be a part of this evolution.

# Government Contract

Matterport has entered the public sector to digitize the valuable assets of the US government.

&#x200B;

>“Through the use of Matterport’s technology, federal agencies will beable to *digitize and index* government facilities, infrastructure andother assets such ***as airplanes, ships and submarines.”***  
>  
>“For example, in the event of an emergency, digital twins of **buildings, roads, bridges, tunnels, water supplies or electrical grids** can be instantly viewed and analyzed by authorized users torespond more efficiently”  
>  
>“Access to 3D digital twins and the spatial data behind them can fuela multitude of use cases such as **emergency response, military training and historical preservation**.” - George Hoyem at In-Q-Tel

How could you not be bullish? They’re creating a private searchable 3D database. This is immensely powerful. Imagine being able to visualize the entire underground infrastructure of NYC without having to dig everything up?

# Collaboration Tool

You know how on Google docs you can live collaborate with other users on a doc? I use it all the time. Matterport just added that for digital twins. That leads me to my next point.

# Prediction:

I’ve come to believe that Google will want Matterport. I have no evidence of this, it’s just a feeling. This is because the two companies align in a variety of ways. (I guess Google could just develop their own tech, but I just feel like they might take the easy route and acquire.)

* Google Earth has exteriors of 3D buildings, but not interiors. Imagine how Matterport’s 3D dataset could be utilized for that tool?
* Matterport and Google are both platform companies with a focus on big data and indexing that data.
* Google Real-estate searching was removed about a decade ago, but what if this was the catalyst for them to bring it back. I predict that Google will bring back real estate searching but integrate it with 3D interactive experiences.
* Google’s AI research could be fueled by Matterport’s datasets.
* Matterport could be integrated with Google’s suite of apps.

**My positions**: 100 shares at $14. Some calls expiring from Sept – December ranging from $17.5 - $25.

**Intro**

Ok so you put up a couple of shitty graphs, attached a few coloured lines and flags, and then in your squeaky voice say “ooh look, correlated”. If you are happy with that and being extra-retarted then entertain yourself with this: 🚀 🚀 🍆 💦 🚀 🚀 🍆 💦 🚀 🚀

But if you would rather take time out from watching your wife’s BF churn butter, and not be stiffed by an illiterate mouth breather, then here is a quick 101 on correlations for you.

**What a correlation is NOT**

It is NOT two 💩 💩 graphs where you eyeball them – no matter how many crayons you ate while drawing pretty lines or hard you squint your eyes or tilt your head. Piss off with that. There is no control over the scales or time spans used and it is possible the graphs have been manipulated to present the desired conclusion. At times I think the “eye-balling” was done by a cross-eyed ass-clown jacked to the moobs on crack while spanking the monkey to re-runs of Laverne & Shirley. The sort of guy who beats the bishop in his own Dutch oven. Yeah you just took advice from a guy with an IQ lower than that of a gooseberry.

In case you are curious the IQ is 2.81 according to jet punk {grrr no link allowed}

**What is a correlation?**

Correlation {look it up on wiki, I'm guessing no links to wiki stoopid bots?} measures the degree to which two things move relative to each other.

It is a **statistical function** that measures a linear relationship; it is not eye-balled by some crack-taking, Jim Cramer-loving, 1970s sitcom-whacking, glass bottom-wearing savant who failed to get the McMascot job in Buttplug, Idaho.

A correlation value (aka correlation coefficient or R value) is between -1 and +1 inclusive, but is sometimes expressed as a percentage (i.e. -100% <= R <= +100%).

**So what?**

A correlation of +1 means the two things are in lock step, i.e. perfectly correlated. As one moves up, so does the other and vice versa. Think of it like this: between the ages of 1 and 15, as you get older your shoe size also increases, unless your name is Tom Cruise who stopped growing at age 4\*. This has a correlation of +1. This is like ITM call options: as the price of the underlying stock goes up, then the value of the call option also goes up….just like the number of tendies. 🚀 🚀

\*{check out Tiny Tom Cruise on YT, but yeah that moment has passed friggin killjoy post bot, Imma get behind your Mom}

A correlation of -1 means two things move in opposite directions. As one goes up, the other goes down and vice versa. An example: as the stock price increases, the value of the put option decreases. Less tendies.  A perfect negative correlation.

A correlation of 0 means there is no relationship between two independent things.  Think of it like this: if I looked at the ape population for 2021, there would no relationship between daily crayon consumption and the girth of your wife’s boyfriend’s love truncheon. No correlation = random tendies today.

This is what the correlations look like on a graph {no links to Imgur......grrrr}

&#x200B;

[..do not read this caption..](https://preview.redd.it/b43qcpypq2l71.jpg?width=682&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb7aeb139f35fdb0948a1c66a02812f7bc56a0f7)

**Random Heading Placeholder**

But you won’t often see perfect positive or negative correlations. You will see values like -0.420 (a relatively weak negative correlation) or +0.69 (a moderately strong positive correlation). The +0.69 value when multiplied by itself gives an R squared value of 0.476 or 47.6%. In this case one variable accounts for about half the movement in the other.

**Limitations of correlation**

* Correlations are based on historical data (such as closing prices or VWAP) and are not predictions of movements in the future.
* A correlation measures the relative direction of movements, not the size of the movements.
* Correlation does not imply causation.
* Whilst it appears there might be a mathematical relationship you might have a ""spurious correlation"" (Google it, mofo bot won't allow that link either - like the BF walking in when you are about to mount your wife).  For example: from 2000 to 2009 in the USA there is a +0.947 correlation between annual per capita cheese consumption and the number of people who died by getting tangled in their bedsheets. No shit.....but there may have been some on the tangled bedsheets. (Imma let myself out....)
* No tool should be used in isolation, other statistical tools are available but I can only focus on one thing at once.  Today it is correlations.

**Rough guideline to R values**

* Anything above +0.9 or below -0.9 is very strong,
* between -0.9 and -0.7 and between +0.7 and +0.9 are strong,
* other values above 0.5 are moderately strong,
* anything below 0.5 is weak,
* close to 0 (e.g. under 0.1) = no relationship.

**How to calculate R**

Open Excel, paste in the daily data or whatever and then use the CORREL function to calculate the correlation.  If you aren’t sure RTFM.

**Can it be used as a predictor?**

Yes it can.

When calculating a correlation you typically line up the data day by day (let’s called this “matched data”). For example, if one data set sits in the range A2:A200 and the other data set sits in range B2:B200 then the formula would be =CORREL(A2:A200,B2:B200).

But if you want to see if one variable leads the other, then change the ranges in the CORREL function so that one data set leads the other by one period or more. Try different lead times. For example, to see if the dataset in column A leads the dataset in column B by 1 day, the formula would be =CORREL(A2:A199,B3:B200).

If this returns a higher correlation value than the matched data correlation then the relationship is getting stronger. Finding leading indicators with strong correlations is hard but don't let that stop you trying.  If you find the secret sauce money glitch, let me know before you post.....

**Are you still reading these?**

Ok - go forth and multiply your efforts with CORREL and DO NOT make posts with two shitty graphs saying ""Correlated"".  You have been warned.  No R = no tendies.

**TLDR** in case dipshits missed the one at the top of the page: use CORREL and show us the R value.

**Outtro**

**Sept 2nd Update**: Spot is $37.20. That's another 4% up in a single day, and brings spot up more than 17% since 8/19.

SPUT purchased 800k lbs today. The largest daily purchase they have ever made, and **after** that purchase they still have a 9.4% premium to NAV. They have enough cash on hand to purchase another 600k+ lbs tomorrow, plus any new issuance. We could see a 1m+ purchase tomorrow. For reference, a 800k lb purchase is \~4x the annual fuel usage of a 1000MWe power plant.

....

**Sept 15th Update**: A real knock your socks off day today! Spot at $48.55 ($50 ask) with just 100k lbs of buying from SPUT. I thought we would get to 50 by the end of the month, but it looks like it will be end of the week. Unbelievable.

**Sept 16th Update:** Pullback today! Ended with the broader U market down 3%, but SPUT up 4.26%. SPUT purchased a new record of 1.45M pounds of U! Spot price rose to $49.75/$51.00.

With SPUT, U stockpile, and spot rising it is hard to take a sell-off too seriously. A bit of nibbling above closing prices on several U stocks in after hours. Tomorrow is Quad Witch though, so we'll see what shenanigans that brings.

**Sept 17th Update:** Late again! Big sell-off today across the entire sector (and the broader market). I assume there was lots of profit taking and de-risking as China still hasn't admitted Evergrande is too big to fail.

Spot price rose yet again on Friday to $51.50 ask. I'm going to continue to add to longs on days like Friday, and sell small bits on big up movement so I always have some dry powder.

**Sept 20th Update**: Big red candle. AH mostly green for U, and rather green for index futures. It looks like we should have a better day tomorrow (not hard to do). SPUT finished strong today, spot at $50.25. I bought a few tickers too small to mention today and a lot of SPUT.

**Sept 21st Update**: Spot down to $49.75 today, majority of U stocks modestly green today. Cautiously, it looks the sell-off is over. It would help to have FOMC over tomorrow, and China also comes off of holiday tomorrow so perhaps there would also be positive news there for general sentiment. All in all though, electricity needs to be made, and uranium is how we do it. Miners did get a bit ahead of themselves. SPUT bought 100k lbs.

**Sept 24th Update**: Well, still 40 minutes to close but a doozy of a day. Volume is low-ish, so I assume selling has finished (for now). Spot all the back down to $45, but if it holds there this can start all over with another way of SPUT buying. Hope you all had some protective calls sold.

**Oct 18th Update**: Having a second kid is about 500% more work than one kid. I thought it would only be 300% more. Updates will continue to be very sparse, but I think we all know what direction U is going.

KAP (world's largest miner in Kazakistan) is creating its own physical uranium investment vehicle. They now be free to mine with their right hand and sell to their left without tanking market prices like they have historically done in the past. There is now a country that needs the money that is backing increases to U spot and mining proceeds. We have an actual unofficial cartel forming now. Welcome to UPEC!

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Uranium.

Sure, there are no flashing LEDs like CRSR adds to all of their products, but that’s because we don’t need it. Uranium already glows in the dark! (see footnote).

Maybe Uranium isn't as sexy as some over-hyped under-developed treadmill with an iPad glued to it that kills babies, and it is lacking in buzzwords like ""cloud data analytics,"" but uranium is dense, clean energy. There is quite literally no other way to support the load required by electrifying the entire transport grid, which makes this the only realistic energy candidate for the immediate future. There are already big incumbents in energy that need to get shouldered aside, so this will be a slower play than the up 50% in a week flavors of the month (which then falls 90%), but this is the real deal. With calls you can still get that 50%, or 500%, but shares will take some time. That said, NXE is up 18.8% in 5 trading sessions, and URA 12.08%. Just barely OTM calls versus last week are up 360% and 500% for NXE ($5 and $4 front month). That's not exactly [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/).

Uranium has a serious bull case of ahead of it. A new fund is in town (Sprott) who is buying up all the physical uranium. Get ready to gap up. Yes you have heard some of this before, and I peddled Uranium a full on year ago, but this fund is a market mover and it changes everything.

TLDR, 1) since 2019 supply has been below demand for uranium as the market continues to deal with a supply overhang and over-investment by miners from the previous market cycle. COVID then reduced supply by a further 30% through mine closures that have continued for 2021 and the supply overhang is finally gone. 2) More nuclear reactors are being built worldwide than decommissioned, developing nations have hopped on board the nuclear train, and 3) if any country is serious about getting to carbon neutral then the only realistic avenue is via massive expansion of the nuclear fleet. Lastly, 4) there is a new physical trust, SPUT (Sprott Physical Uranium Trust) busy buying up all of the uranium and driving up the spot price. It’s working.

Uranium spot is $34.60 right now, 2007 was $137. That’s a lot of upside baby. Oh, and did I mention that the Uranium market is small? Tiny. Super tiny. WSB could blow this thing up. There isn’t an entire industry of traders, hedgers, and dilettantes (that’s a nice way of saying degenerates) trading U like there are for oil or other commodities.

&#x200B;

edit: it begins! Massive gap up today (Uranium spot updates daily, not constantly like oil) from $34.60->$35.65.

**1. The Setup**: Uranium is already on a 5 year trend line of tendies

Uranium has been in a bear market since 2007. It started to finally sell through the over supply and over investment of the last market cycle and has been climbing from its 2016 low of $18.50. This was already a 4 year trend line, and then COVID came along.

COVID changed the uranium market in two main ways. First, it dramatically reduced global supply by about 30% in 2020 and 2021 due to mine closures by many of the majors and juniors. These closures have allowed the sticky overhang from the last decade to finally get put on the spot market as well as mines buying from spot to meet contracts. Second, there appears to be an OPEC+ of uranium forming. Miners, no doubt still traumatized from last time they aggressively expanded productions, are not opening new mines even as spot prices surge. Instead, they continue to provide quarterly guidance that they are operating below capacity for the rest of the year, and are selling old supply. They aren’t formally a cartel like OPEC is, but there seems to be some game theory going on here. It is in the miners' best interest to try to exactly match the demand of U on a global scale and then be able to dictate the price. Since fuel costs are just 2% of the operating costs of a nuclear reactor, utilities can also stomach significant increases in spot prices without effecting their generation rates of \~ $.02/KwH (as cheap as coal, far below all renewables in pricing).

U is $34.60 as of August 31st close which is 75.24% below its peak in 2007. In a market with all-time highs all over the place, U has a long way to run. What will miner profits be if U hits $100+ again? Massive.

**2. New Demand**: Global demand has outpaced supply

Planned Reactor Starts in Gross MWe of new capacity (from world-nuclear.org)

* 2021: 5,711
* 2022: 13,559
* 2023: 13,276
* 2024: 7,569
* 2025: 5,112
* 2026: 6,997
* 2027: 4,100

Credit Suisse offers their own global view of supply & demand here. Get your sunglasses on as this assumes the US fleet is shrinking into 2030. That likely won’t be the case. See comments #1 below, automod doesn't like my links.

First, if you are from the US then you are likely biased against nuclear. Get over it. The US has a very old fleet and has been periodically retiring plants rather than performing maintenance. I’ll get back to the US later, but the global view is very, very positive. Globally, many developing nations are starting a nuclear fleet. It’s cheap and it doesn’t pollute. India, Slovakia, Belarus, and Pakistan all have new plants started or starting in the next year. France continues to expand and sell energy, while China seems serious about cutting CO2 emissions and is massively expanding their existing fleet, as well as breaking ground on the world’s first SMR earlier this year.

So back to the USA—the US mostly acts as a drag. A reactor in New York just closed, and others throughout the country are always wavering on the edge of retirement. This is set to change, but it depends upon politics, so we’ll see (and the right likes nuclear too, it’s not just about the left's CO2). The Secretary of Energy is committed to keeping every single US plant operating as it prepares to transition to a fleet of fast breeding, small modular reactors (SMR’s) in the “late 2020s, early 2030s.” (this just means highly fuel efficient with far, far less waste, and reactors the size of a 3-4 story apartment building instead of a city block. Each will power 500,000+ homes, so they can be “close” to cities they power and also reduce infrastructure costs.) She is working with legislatures to allow all currently operating plants to essentially receive carbon credits as an incentive for utilities to keep the plants running and well maintained until the SMR roll-out.

Yes, this is a long horizon for the US, but the US is only one part of the uranium market and a very minor part of this bull case. Globally, supply/demand are already tight, and the world fleet is slated to expand. Utilities can see the writing on the wall and will want to start placing orders now for future delivery (spot market for Uranium is quite different from other commodities—purchasing, delivery, enrichment, and feeding take years). You can bet these utilities are looking at supply/demand graphs and already panicking. Spot is going to start gapping up instead of ticking.

**3. Green Energy**: The Elephant in the Room

Nuclear power is the greenest scalable energy on the planet. Hydro destroys entire riparian ecosystems, wind and solar are both CO2 heavy in terms of manufacturing and are slow ROI on the carbon expenditure as well as having short functional commercial lifespans, while geothermal is quite literally tied to very specific locations (OK, I don’t know anything about tidal, but other than reading about some plans being nixed by NIMBY Boomers I’m not seeing it either). Most of these renewables are also intermittent, making them very difficult to design a grid around.

These renewable forms of power generation have another cost: land. Aside from geothermal, these are not power dense generators. You can't put 12,000 acres of wind turbines next to NYC. Here is an article working through the cost in land to electrify just British Colombia’s transport grid. The takeaway is that nuclear wins by a landslide: 2.4 m2/kWh versus solar’s 36.9m2, hydro’s 54 m2, and wind’s 72.1 m2. If you want to electrify the US transport grid then you can either build some nuclear plants, or convert all of Nevada to a single, massive solar farm. I mean, what is Nevada good for anyway?

Numbers on energy density coming from here: damn you automods, see comments for link #2.

The latest generation of nuclear plants, SMRs, are small and safe. They can be built alongside cities to save CO2 and money that would otherwise go into infrastructure. How many more fires are we going to see every fire season as PG&E and other utilities run millions of miles of hot lines all over the country? This too is a cost of the current way of locating and distributing energy. This all changes with SMRs, and all for the better.

Biden has made some surprisingly strong claims about aiming the US at net zero, and the US is hardly a climate activist country. If this happens in other countries, and perhaps the US, then it means we are looking at hundreds upon hundreds of new plants in the next two decades, not just the few dozen currently in the planning stages over the coming 2020s. This will be the renaissance of nuclear, and it is coming.

Think about it. If there is any chance in hell of reducing carbon emissions, then nuclear is the path forward. Everything else is a half measure.

**4. Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (SPUT)**: The T-Rex in the Room

This is a new fund from an old hand in physical trusts. Sprott’s Physical Uranium Trust (U.U – Canadian listed, NYSE coming in \~4m) purchases uranium on the spot market and then warehouses it. That’s it, that’s the whole plan. This is meteoric.

As shares of U.U are issued Sprott takes that money and buys uranium, which increases their NAV. So long as they have a premium to NAV they keep buying. They’ve only been buying physical uranium for two weeks now, but **they’ve already purchased 13.3% of the estimated global uranium production for all of 2021**. Read that sentence again. 20.59m lbs of the projected world supply of 154m lbs. Jesus Christ are these guys a market force to be reckoned with. How is this not illegal? They've only been buying for TWO FUCKING WEEKS.

Look at spot price versus their holdings. They march up and up in tandem. Spot has gone up 7.1% in the last month, with all of those gains coming within days of when Sprott started buying.

See comment link for google spreadsheet of Sprott and spot rate. #3 in my comment.

**5. There are short sellers here**

Some entities sell naked uranium deliveries. In a market as slow moving and opaque as uranium is this probably seemed like a good idea at the time. How much of a factor would this be? I don't honestly know. Uranium is not like other commodities with all their nifty reporting and data. We'll find out?

**Positions or Ban:** OK, we know you all just skipped to the end anyway

Go long anything uranium.

Miners/Exploration:

* CCJ
* NXE
* Use google. Many are too small by marketcap for me to list here, but they are mostly small for a reason (no actual production, waiting on samples, etc)
* URNM - Miner ETF, but not great spreads for options. Shares only would be my recommendation unless WSB can improve the options liquidity
* U.U (This is Sprott Physical Uranium Trust. Buy this, but only if Canadian. Imagine what will happen when this gets NYSE listed in 2022!)
* SRUUF is the US-based OTC ticker for U.U if your brokerage allows you to buy it (Schwab and TDA do, probably others)
* URA: ETF of major and minor miners, equipment production, all things uranium. Decent option spread.

*Options*:

As we all know, there are only a few times when dealers work with your play instead of hedging against it, and one of those is when you buy far OTM calls. When you buy a far OTM call the dealer will also purchase or adjust their position matching your direction.

So, if you are buying calls (I would recommend calls *and* shares) then far OTM calls skew delta in our favor.

That out of the way, the Uranium market is slow, but Sprotts has started to speed things up.

URA 10/21 $25c is about as high as I would go without going longer dated.

After that, March '22 is decently priced, June 2022 $30+ now looking a bit expensive. No doubt you will all ignore this and buy something idiotic like front month $30. Really, don’t do that.

NXE 2/22 or 12/22 $5 or $7. I did a few call debit spreads of buying 12/22 $5, selling $7. Probably should be greedier, but it seems so safe. What could go wrong?

*Shares*:  NXE, URA, and URNM.

My positions:

* URA & NXE shares (some other too small of marketcap to list)
* URA 10/21 $25c
* URA 3/22 $28c
* URA 6/22 $28c & 30c
* NXE 9/21 $5c
* NXE 12/22 $5c
* NXE 12/22 $7c

footnote: No, uranium does't glow in the dark you ape. You have to mix trace radioactive material with a fluor to do that."

TLDR: ""On offer is the right for a suitor to use the ESPN name for branding purposes and potentially rename its sportsbook after the leading sports TV network in the U.S., the people said. A deal could come with an exclusive marketing commitment that would require the sports-betting firm to spend a certain amount of money advertising on ESPN’s platforms, one of the people said.""

I'll preface by saying I'm seriously disturbed by where the evidence is pointing, and the complete denial of any plausibility of these allegations by many SAVA investors. This entire company and the science behind it may be a fraud. Checkout Stocktwits or Yahoo Finance conversations to see how unaware of this possibility retail investors are.

Take the CEO of Cassava Sciences, Remi Barbier. His last moment in the spotlight came as the CEO of a company called Pain Therapeutics. This company's product was a drug called Remoxy, a supposedly abuse-resistant form of oxycodone. Remoxy was rejected by the FDA four times in a row for a lack of proper evidence suggesting it was actually abuse-resistant. Pain Therapeutics was then sued for misleading investors and causing damages and paid out in a settlement. Pain Therapeutics was later renamed to Cassava Sciences, which pivoted to Alzheimer's disease treatment with a drug they developed called Simufilam.

Does this information prove that SAVA is fraudulent? Absolutely not. Does it suggest that Remi could potentially fit the profile of Biotech CEO con artist based on his history? Maybe.

What about a motive? If Simufilam isn't as effective as claimed, if some or all of the data backing it is fabricated, and/or it eventually fails clinical trials, what is there to gain?

Okay, so if the stock gets pumped to sky-high valuations, Remi and others get massive paydays regardless of how the drug fairs in clinical trials.

Well, what about the ""wildly successful"" 9 month cognitive data and 6 month biomarkers? What did a group of Alzheimer's scientists think about the open label (rather than double blind) study with no placebo control group?

""Alzheimer’s scientists critique Cassava Sciences’ study results — overblown, inappropriate, uninterpretable""

[https://www.statnews.com/2021/07/30/alzheimers-scientists-critique-cassava-sciences-study-results-overblown-inappropriate-uninterpretable/](https://www.statnews.com/2021/07/30/alzheimers-scientists-critique-cassava-sciences-study-results-overblown-inappropriate-uninterpretable/)

Ever had that gut feeling something was too good to be true? How plausible is it that a tiny company of merely dozens of people, after abandoning a failed pain medication and settling lawsuits, jumps to an Alzheimer's disease drug, the unfound and impossibly difficult holy grail of modern medicine, and delivers total disease modifying success the likes of which the world and all of its collective scientific effort has never remotely seen?

Then comes the bombshell.

On August 18th, Jordan A. Thomas files his petition on behalf of a client/whistleblower to the FDA to halt trials and to perform a full audit of all scientific publications related to Simufilam. This is due to overwhelming evidence of scientific misconduct.

Who is Jordan A. Thomas, is he credible or a blood sucking lawyer?

""While at the SEC, Thomas played a role in the development of the SEC Whistleblower Program, established under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Thomas also developed and served as the first National Coordinator of the SEC's Cooperation Program, designed to encourage individuals and companies to self-report violations of the federal securities laws and to participate in the SEC's investigations and enforcement actions.""

""After leaving the SEC, Thomas joined Labaton Sucharow LLP as a partner.""

""In private practice, he has risen to national prominence. The Wall Street Journal has described him as “one of the most prominent attorneys representing whistleblowers before the government.” Likewise, NPR has referred to him as “one of the top whistleblower lawyers in the country.” And the New York Times has described his team as “one of the top legal practices in the country representing corporate whistle-blowers.” Over the years, he represented the first officer of a public company to win an SEC whistleblower award, the first SEC whistleblower to receive criminal immunity and the first SEC whistleblower to receive an award because his company retaliated against him. **In 2018, his clients won the then-largest SEC Whistleblower award in history for a single case, $83 million.**""

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan\_A.\_Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_A._Thomas)

Does it get any more legitimate than that? Why are so many other high profile law firms opening investigations?

What was in Thomas's petition?

Google ""Requests that the FDA halt the current clinical studies of Simufilam PTI-125 sponsored by Cassava Sciences"".

Read all 39 pages of attachment 2.

Here's a teaser:

Falsified Western Blot on page 9.

""The western blot in Figure 1a (below right) of Dr. Wang’s 2010 paper in Biological Psychiatry 67:522 contains four bands that closely resemble an image published in Figure 12a (left) of the Wang and Burns 2005 Neuroscience 135: 247 paper mentioned in C.2.1. These eight boxed bands come from different experimental conditions that were allegedly conducted many years apart, using different samples. The authors appear to have vertically compressed the bands in the 2010 paper, but expanding them here shows they are strikingly similar to those in the 2005 paper. As the sample passes through the gel, it creates a small amount of streaking which causes a distinctive irregular shape in the upper portion of each band; the pattern of this streaking is identical in the two images. **This degree of congruence could not have occurred by chance or error; it suggests a complex cross-publication dimension to Cassava Science’s band duplication behavior and, in this case, it is hard to imagine that the duplication was not intentional.** It is recommended that the original full-length images with appropriate molecular weight markers are obtained to validate band migration from both the 2005 and 2010 papers for independent review. Because of the seriousness of this duplication, if the original materials are not available, both of these papers must be retracted.""

Yes, that's right. Two publications based on supposedly different experiments 5 years apart have pixel perfect copies of the same data. This would be enough evidence to expel a student from university. What about when billions of dollars are at stake?

And

""It is worth repeating, the preclinical and clinical foundations linking Filamin A to Alzheimer’s disease derive only from the publications of Drs. Wang and Burns. As shown above, ALL of these papers have evidence of apparent intentional scientific misrepresentation. Cassava Sciences’ Alzheimer’s disease clinical biomarker data with PTI-125/simufilam showed no evidence of efficacy when tested by an outside lab, and only showed apparent efficacy when re-analyzed in an academic lab—likely Dr. Wang’s lab as he is listed as the first author on the poster (26 July 2021) describing the re-analyzed data. Now, Cassava Science’s 26 July 2021 analysis of clinical biomarker results with PTI-125/simufilam also shows evidence of data manipulation.""

Guess who Dr. Lindsay Burns Sr. VP of Neuroscience at Cassava is married to? Cassava Sciences CEO Remi Barbier.

Oh, and Dr. Hoau-Yan Wang? He's on Cassava's scientific advisory board.

The evidence in the petition is endless.

Below is a fairly in-depth due diligence on Lucid Motors, also known as Lucid Group, Inc and now trading on the NYSE as $LCID. I've been disappointed by most of the low-effort DDs posted so far and feel we need something more complete. I've made an attempt to be as neutral as possible but as a disclaimer I am long-term bullish (position discussion at the end). I've tried to be as neutral as possible with corresponding resources easily available so you can make your own decision. The boring stuff like company history and technology are detailed at the beginning, but for those of you just interested in share price you can fast forward to **MARKET OPPORTUNITY**, **VALUATION ESTIMATE** and **TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS** toward the end.

I'm posting this now because I feel the current share price makes for a potential great entry near the 200-day moving average, on top of other technical and fundamental factors outlined below. Upcoming volatility will also be useful to those of us playing theta strategies. LFG.

*Edit: Yes, the title is in juxtaposition to yesterday's bearish ""DD."" I had to trim down a lot of content to not exceed the 40k character maximum.* ***I've removed all links*** *to appease the WSB automoderator which doesn't seem to want to let anything through.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **BACKGROUND:**

Lucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone\*.

In 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.

In 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site\*. Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase\*, with early construction already having begun\*. Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to > 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes\*.

Lucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a ""two horse race.""\* In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21\*, bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as ""post-luxury,"" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence\*.

▶ **TECHNOLOGY:**

***Motor***\*: Lucid utilizes a *permanent-magnet synchronous motor* which is much more efficient than a traditional induction motor (eg, those used by Tesla until the Model 3). Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire → more resistance → more heat → decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***

Lucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds\*. Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.

https://preview.redd.it/58e0bwpkkcj71.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c430e6b2db149da642c7e62784b7990523dbbb2d

https://preview.redd.it/m25tqedmkcj71.png?width=2155&format=png&auto=webp&s=a50a1d0566d8ff6872f588de307ce5a41a33870f

***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (""dumb range""). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I2R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)\*:

https://preview.redd.it/rlbjwa1okcj71.png?width=2191&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca1292576948128353dacebbbb24686bb98cb6c2

Higher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW\*. The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW\*.

For battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier\*. While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)\*. Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.

It should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells\*. This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week.

Some have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips—it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*—the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.

***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform\*. It allows compatibility with—and the maximizing of—charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).

***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their ""Full Self-Driving"" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities\*. Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available on Lucid's website\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**

**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:

[\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now\*](https://preview.redd.it/fsgu9uhpkcj71.png?width=2452&format=png&auto=webp&s=18cabbf7c21f7a9aeb8790fb65b7d5e5d53b664d)

**Gravity SUV**: ""Project Gravity"" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market\*. Prototypes have already been built\* using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.

[Project Gravity SUV](https://preview.redd.it/i728mi0rkcj71.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9bcf294372eb8ca630905dabc87ce31d1e3d181)

**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **CHARGING:**

Charging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships\*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \~20kW and DC charging up to \~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo\*.

Tesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.

Modern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

**▶ PEOPLE:**

Lucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resumés from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.

**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO/CTO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979\*. Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)\*. At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production\*. Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer (CTO) before being promoted to CEO in 2019\*. Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter\*; however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted\*.

**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021\*. Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)\*. She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.

**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy\*. Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally\*. Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.

**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors\*. At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.

Besides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com\*. There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly\*, expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**

**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020\*. This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.

**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.

**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of >500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.

**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid’s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:

* 2021 - 577 vehicles
* 2022 – 20,000 vehicles
* 2023 – 49,000 vehicles
* 2024 – 90,000 vehicles
* 2025 – 135,000 vehicles
* 2026 – 251,000 vehicles

*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021*\*. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year\*\*\*\*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.\*

**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026\*. Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**\*.

▶ **FUTURE DIRECTION:**

Peter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California\*. They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they’re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life\*. Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.

As a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.

Lucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022\* and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018\*. If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**

**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:

|*Company*|*Valuation (8/22/2021)*|*Total debt*|*Price-to-sales (P/S) ratio*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tesla (TSLA)|$673.5 billion|$11.1 billion (6/2021)\*|18.33\*|
|Toyota (TM)|$226.8 billion|$24.5 trillion (6/2021)\*|0.81\*|
|Volkswagen (VWAGY)|$144.6 billion|$219.2 billion (6/2021)\*|0.51\*|
|General Motors (GM)|$70.8 billion|$111.1 billion (6/2021)\*|0.51\*|
|Nio (NIO)|$57.9 billion|$2.7 billion (6/2021)\*|12.7\*|
|Honda (HMC)|$50.7 billion|$7.7 trillion (6/2021)\*|0.37\*|
|Ford (F)|$50.2 billion|$148.2 billion (6/2021)\*|0.37\*|
|Lucid (LCID)|$35.1 billion|$179 million\*|N/A *(see below)*|
|Xpeng|$30.8 billion|$2.7 billion (3/2021)\*|N/A|
|Li|$27.1 billion|$3.9 billion (3/2021)\*|N/A|
|Fisker (FSR)|$3.9 billion|$20.2 million (6/2021)\*|N/A|

This is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026\*. *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion\*. *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).

For comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.

With this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52\* so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

**▶ TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS:**

I personally don't put a lot of weight into TA--certainly not in the short term. That said, LCID saw a peak of $64 during the early SPAC rumors in February 2021, then crashed hard after DA was officially announced. Like a lot of the market (especially EVs and tech) it continued a downtrend through spring and summer until reaching a nadir of $17.25 on 5/13/2021. This had been followed by an upward channel through 8/16/2021 but has since broken the lower support and moved below both the 50-hour and 200-hour moving averages. On the daily chart we're also below the 50-day and just scraping the top of the 200-day. RSI is currently near the oversold side and MACD looks to be making a reversal. Historically there are several points of support around $21.30 and we're currently just above this lower bound. Personally I think this makes a decent entry point if you're looking to go long.

[Nothing fancy, just bottom trend-line, 1-hour SMA, RSI and MACD](https://preview.redd.it/nbfewd7xkcj71.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6a91f908af657fb38ec9813ab35713781fa067f)

Fundamentals are outlined above. PIPE lockup expires on 9/1/2021 and will likely create a good amount of volatility; however, since EPA/crash test results, press coverage and delivery announcements are expected in the very near future there look to be several factors either maintaining or potentially pulling the price upward. Motor Trend magazine will be publishing an article tomorrow (8/25/2021) regarding the first public test drive, with senior editor Jonny Lieberman testing out the 500+ mile range by driving between SF and LA this past weekend (tweet). If you're into high-end watches there's something there for you too\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **COMMON QUESTIONS:**

**Q:** ***When does PIPE lockup expire / will this drive down price?***

**A:** As per the most recent S-1 PIPE lockup should expire on 9/1/2021 (page 169). Here's a prior post thoroughly discussing PIPE lockup expiration and the effects it may have on share price. In brief, about 55% of PIPE investors might be considered long-term and 45% short-term. There are about 150 million PIPE shares, or 9.3% of all outstanding shares. If 45% of PIPE sells that's still only 4.2% of outstanding shares trading hands.

**Q:** ***When are deliveries?***

**A:** Lucid has only officially announced deliveries as second half of 2021. Motor Trend magazine's senior features editor Jonny Lieberman recently drove an Air Dream edition in tandem with Peter Rawlinson and was reportedly told Q3 2021, however he speculated it may be October (Q4).

**Q**: ***When is crash testing and EPA verification?***

**A:** No specifics at this time other than both are underway and ""near completion""\*.

**Q:** ***What about the chip shortage?***

**A:** Peter Rawlinson reports they have bought ahead, securing enough semiconductors for all production vehicles through 2021. They have additional mitigation plans for alternative sourcing and PCB redesigns if required. They have a relatively modest volume ramp for 2021, so they are less affected in the near-term than other manufacturers. You can watch Peter discuss the issue here (start at 4:00).

**Q:** ***What's the four-finger gesture Peter Rawlinson has been making in photos over the past few weeks? (examples*** 1, 2, 3, 4)

**A:** Jonny Lieberman claims to know and will publish the answer in tomorrow's Motor Trend article (8/25/2021). Best guesses are (A) confirmation of 1111 max horsepower, (B) big news on 9/4/2021as this is the ending date of the mandatory 40-day quiet period after listing on the NYSE, or (C) he's the last surviving member of Chicago's Four Corner Hustlers\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **PERSONAL POSITION:**

I won't divulge my exact position other than to say LCID represents 55% of my total portfolio with a DCA of $23.90. I also have multiple calls/LEAPS, mostly Jan 2023 including $15, $20, $25 and $30 strikes, with a few Oct and Nov 2021 calls sprinkled in as lottery tickets. I wheel a smaller stack on the side to collect premium during the slower months and I'm currently trading on the CSP side. I buy a small number of shares almost every day and intend to make this a 5-10 year investment. If mods would like ""proof or ban"" I will happily provide screen shots privately.

### Executive degen 🚀🚀 TLDR summary:

- New IPO (Dec 2020).
- Seeking to disrupt a huge market ($4.2 trillion).
- They have the best tech in the space, with a 9 year lead in lending AI/ML (very good moat).
- Exceptional leadership, with founders being high level Google execs who left to start the company.
- Incredible financial results reported in their Q2'2021, growing +10x as much as the likes of TSLA.
- No fear of regulation as they have a ""No Action"" letter from US government body.
- Still at the very tip of their growth journey, having only 4% market share of the unsecured personal loan space = massive growth runway.


### For visual learners:

I've also made a video about this review, if like me you're more of a visual learner, and can get over my monotonous voice feel free to watch my video on [Why You Should Own Upstart](http://youtube.com/watch?v=rartz8VcWjw).

# Intro

I've been heavily reading up on [Upstart](https://www.upstart.com/) for the last few months, and I believe we're looking at a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here (despite being up [362.37%](https://www.google.com/search?q=upst&rlz=1C5CHFA_enGB885GB885&oq=upst) since IPO already). From everything I've read about the technology, leadership and market and competition, I think we're looking at a future tech behemoth currently hiding in plain sight. 

I've compiled my notes in the report below, if you need the *executive degen TLDR*, or prefer visual notes you can head straight to the bottom.

# Company History

Borrowing & lending is a practice as old as time. Our economies are based on borrowing be it at government level, institutional level, or even at the individual level. Whats mind-blowing is that borrowing and lending remained largely the same for the last [5000 years](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9780230554511_1). The problem Upstart set out to solve is the question of how to quantify the borrower's risk of defaulting. In simple terms, there are a lot of ""[good borrowers""](https://www.upstart.com/about#credit-limits-2) out there, but lenders generally have a hard time identifying them using current systems which are [old and dated](https://www.fico.com/25years/). So just like shopping (AMZN, SHOP..etc), EV (TSLA) and consumer tech (AAPL),  consumer lending, a [$4.2 trillion market](https://www.notion.so/361e12bb766a4ad0bd38ffbd2ce37169), was due a massive tech disruption (UPST).

Key dates:

- Founded in 2012
- [Pivoted](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2014/05/23/why-upstart-abandoned-education-crowdfunding-to.html) from its initial niche (crowdfunding loans) to the larger [$84b](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomtaulli/2021/08/13/upstart-can-ai-kill-the-fico-score/) market of personal loans in 2014.
- Entered the auto-lending market in [2020](https://www.upstart.com/blog/introducing-ai-enabled-auto-loans?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_LfWzrC0S2PevMQ6xYcT2HwpIxXCbBEE0HeX9COT3a78-1629740458-0-gqNtZGzNAyWjcnBszQ-R)
- [IPOed](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/upstart-prices-ipo-at-20-for-market-cap-of-1-45-billion-11608092379) late 2020

# Leadership

The story of Upstart is quite unusual. The company was founded by three people with diverse backgrounds expertises, and even generations. Dave Girouard was the [former head of Google Enterprise](https://venturebeat.com/2012/03/16/googles-president-of-enterprise-dave-girouard-is-leaving-to-launch-his-own-startup/), and before that he was an executive at Apple. His co-founders are Anna Counselman, the former [manager of Online Sales & Operations](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2013/12/06/silicon-valley-40-under-40-anna.html) at Google and Paul Gu, a university student who dropped out of the computer science program at Yale to start the company (also a [Thiel Fellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiel_Fellowship)). For a founding story, its unusual for three people to come together and decide to build a company on the spot. But 9 years later, they are still at the helm of a profitable and disruptive company. 

# Upstart's Business

Upstart's business caters to two distinct segments: [Individuals](https://www.upstart.com/personal-loans) and [banks](https://www.upstart.com/for-banks).

Their offerings to individuals consist of a variety of personal loan products, examples of these include:

- Credit card and Debt consolidation loans
- Home improvement loans
- Medical loans
- Wedding loans
- and Moving loans

For banks, Upstart offers its AI technology as a way for banks to improve their archaic lending processes. This is kind of genius because instead of competing with banks, Upstart [partners with them and complements their services](https://vimeo.com/489878274). Studies completed with several  US banks suggested that Upstart’s model [could approve almost three times](https://www.upstart.com/about?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_52250deb9dc2f9889c94cd45e31c286d7522a9f8-1629210053-0-gqNtZGzNAuKjcnBszQvO#results-to-date)  the number of borrows at the same loss rate as traditional models, as well as make a reduction of 75% in defaults at the same approval rate, this is unprecedented in the lending business.

## The Problem

At the moment, [90% of the top lenders in the United States use FICO scoring](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-fico-score/) to assess credit-worthiness, this is a scoring system first developed in 1989 which is comprised of five components:

- Payment history
- Amount owed
- Length of credit history
- How many times someone has applied for new credit
- The variety of credit products you currently have

## The Solution

This old scoring system prevents many people from getting loans at a reasonable rate. By comparison, Upstart leverages [1600 different data points](https://vimeo.com/492637158) [fast forward to 05:35]  that have been trained on more than 10 million repayment events to reach decision within seconds. This machine learning model continues to get more effective as it processes more repayment data [!!]

And this is Upstart's competitive edge. Their AI and machine learning models facilitate *better* borrower selection and provides both *higher* approval rates as well as *lower* interest rates for customers. The numbers here are staggering: tested Upstart models were found to approve [26% more borrowers than traditional models whilst yielding 10% lower average APRs for approved loans](https://www.upstart.com/about?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_cDRNu2tNRiO1uogDDmRKdDE3YeeO2hfOn4Xr6m5gmrU-1629741551-0-gqNtZGzNAuWjcnBszQzR#results-to-date). This expands access to prime credit, which is great for customers (but its also great for banks as they would approve almost **twice** as many borrowers with fewer defaults). This is a [win win](https://leadersinlending.sounder.fm/episode/hybridized-banking-system-jeff-keltner?page=2) [start at 03:00] situation for both lenders and customers seeking credit, absolutely mind-blowing!

Upstart's AI also increases automation throughout the lending process for banks and institutional buyers. To illustrate this point they recently reported that [71% of their loans were instantly approved and fully automated](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) -[page. 4] - with no need for document uploads, calls or waiting! 

Upstart is using state-of-the-art AI technology to disrupt:

- [$84B unsecured personal loan market](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) [p.6] (already working product, ~4% of the market).
- $635B auto-loans market [also p.6] (just acquired Prodigy, a leader in this space).
- $4.2T US consumer credit market [also p.6]

## How Upstart makes money

From page 101 of Upstart's [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1647639/000119312520313385/d867925ds1a.htm):

> Upstart’s revenues are primarily earned in the form of three separate usage-based fees, which can be either dollar or percentage based depending on the contractual arrangement. We charge our bank partners a referral fee of 3% to 4% of the loan principal amount each time we refer a borrower who obtains a loan. Separately, we charge bank partners a platform fee of approximately 2% of loan value each time they originate a loan using our platform. These fees are contracted for and charged separately, although they are generally combined for accounting purposes as they usually represent a single performance obligation. We do not charge the borrowers on our platform any referral, platform or other similar fees for our loan matching services.

> We also charge the holder of the loan (either a bank or institutional investor) an ongoing 0.5% to 1% annualized servicing fee based on the outstanding principal over the lifetime of the loan for ongoing servicing of the loan. Taken together, these fees represented 98% of our revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. In addition, we earn a small portion of our revenue from interest income and our securitization activities.

## The Competition

Another point that makes the case for Upstart's future growth is just how far ahead they are from the competition. As an example the scoring methodology used by Goldman Sachs, the underwriting partner of Apple responsible for Apple Card, has been the subject of much public scrutiny and criticism in a number of recent high profile cases. One example being the case of David Hansson the creator of Ruby on Rails who in late 2019 received [20x the credit limit of his wife despite sharing the same financial ability](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/14/how-the-law-got-it-wrong-with-apple-card/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE57fF0YBl-DFkXQ2li8zbbzDR75qwiW-PyKPzfrssfgJSecSj9o_GV8iZ5SNYQlRythx0XAAqN5CTuqpV6sAoDun3fsn4ohmiBUHrqN6ooT-_fgbOIcVN4wr9C4fQrbE26BqXrhl6ttnT1xTpUKj2GUkFzf4dKoCaNFGjiOSL1t). Another more recent example is when the CEO of Cloudflare, Mathew Prince [applied for an Apple card and received credit limit of only $4500](https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1426552810896871435?s=20) at a rate of 21.99% APR, [despite being worth $4.2 billion](https://www.forbes.com/profile/matthew-prince/#:~:text=REAL%20TIME%20NET%20WORTH&text=Matthew%20Prince%2C%20CEO%20of%20Cloudflare,Microsoft%2C%20Baidu%20and%20Qualcomm%20Ventures.)!

These examples may appear trivial, and they are.. after all we are discussing billionaires being denied credit, but they are high-profile examples of the competition's inferior AI offerings. Besides, the questions and concerns around lending and borrowing in the age of artificial intelligence are very much real, and touch upon very important questions about access and fairness, an aspect of Upstart's offering that is quite compelling. [Listen to Jeff Keltner](https://leadersinlending.sounder.fm/episode/digital-lending-sam-sidhu?page=3) [47:20], Upstart's head of Business development touching on Upstart's effectiveness as a fair lender:

# Financials

To better understand how the business of Upstart is doing, lets take a look at their [most recent earnings report of the second quarter of 2021 published just about a week ago on August 10](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347), I will preface this by saying that its one of the best earning reports I've ever read! 

- **Revenue:** In the 2nd quarter of 2021 Upstart reported revenue of **$194 million**, this is an increase of - get this-  **1,018%** from the second quarter of 2020 [!!!]. I can not stress how impressive this is, even by growth stocks standards, you simply dont see numbers like this everyday!

    To illustrate just how out of this world Upstart's revenue growth is, lets look at revenue growth reported by other more popular degen-type growth stocks for the same quarter: 

    - **[Tesla reported revenue](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/ZBOUYO_TSLA_Q2_2021_Update_DJCVNJ.pdf?xseo=&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22q2_2021.pdf%22) of** $11.69 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of **98%**.
    - **[SoFi reported revenue](https://s27.q4cdn.com/749715820/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/SoFi-Earnings-report_FINAL_081221_4.pdf) of** $231.3 million, representing a year-over-year increase of **101%**
    - **[Shopify's reported revenue](https://s27.q4cdn.com/572064924/files/doc_presentations/2021/07/Shopify-Investor-Deck-Q2-2021.pdf) of** $1.12 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 57%
    - **[Palantir reported revenue](https://investors.palantir.com/files/Palantir%20Q2%202021%20Business%20Update.pdf) of** $376 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 49%
    - **[Fiverr reported revenue](https://s23.q4cdn.com/749308338/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2_2021-Fiverr-Shareholder-Letter_FINAL.pdf) of** $75.3 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 60%
    - **[Etsy reported revenue](https://s22.q4cdn.com/941741262/files/doc_presentations/2021/08/[FINAL-NAP]-Etsy-2Q-2021-Earnings-Presentation-V2.pdf) of** $529 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 23%

    ...etc etc, I can go on. 

    Even if you account for this improvement being partly due to COVID, looking at the results sequentially you still see an improvement of 60% from $121 million in the first quarter of 2021 to $194 million in the second quarter. No matter how you look at it this is an incredible result.

- Transaction Volume Growth was up **69%**

    Upstart's bank partners originated 286,864 loans, totaling $2.80 billion, this is up 1,605% from the same quarter of the prior year. Conversion on rate requests was 24% in the second quarter of 2021, up from 9% in the same quarter of the prior year.

- **Income from Operations:** Income from operations was $36.3 million, up from ($11.4) million the prior year.
- **Contribution Profit:** Contribution profit was $96.7 million, up **2,171**% from in the second quarter of 2020, with a contribution margin of 52% compared to a 32% contribution margin in the second quarter of 2020.
- **Adjusted EBITDA**. Adjusted EBITDA was $59.5 million, up from ($3.1) million in the same quarter prior year.

In terms of financial outlook for 2021, Upstart expects:

- **Revenue of approximately $750 million (they have essentially raised guidance by $150 million since their previous report guided for $600 million)**
- **Contribution Margin of approximately 45% (vs prior guidance of 42%)**
- **Adjusted EBITDA Margin of approximately 17% (vs prior guidance of 10%)**

***Sirs, do you get it?***

I cant overstate how incredible these results are. As I was listening to the earnings conference call, I caught an amusing moment when the Director of Equity Research for Bank of America could not help but address the fact that he has never seen a four-digit growth figure reported in his career.. [have a listen yourself](https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/gn5dbj7b) [35:40]. 

What the bank of America analyst correctly pointed out was that Upstart managed to achieve such incredible levels of growth at a time when the personal loan market across the United States was actually down.

# Risks:

- In terms of risks to investing in Upstart, one of the main issues facing the company is business concentration. Cross River Bank is Upstart’s most significant partner, [with fees received from the bank accounting for 60% of revenue](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1edgjPy-jXuIhvLSFLkuvTMXxMDt_Kq0R/view) [p.9]. Having a single customer generating such a big portion of your revenue is a serious risk for any business. The good news is that Cross River’s concentration of Upstart’s business has come down meaningfully over the last year from 79% to the current 60%. The hope is that, increased Upstart partnership with other banks will diversify its funding base and thus reduce concentration risk.
- Another risk is increased [regulations](https://gfycat.com/coldcanineeyas-nate-dogg-regulator-warren-g) or legal scrutiny that can stop or restrict Upstart's AI models. This is obviously a real risk, particularly given how new AI lending is. The good news is that Upstart received a [no-action letter](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-issues-no-action-letter-facilitate-use-artificial-intelligence-pricing-and-underwriting-loans/) from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that essentially guarantees no supervisory or enforcement action against Upstart for the next few years.

## Future

- In terms of Upstart's future plans for expansion, the company plans to target the $635 billion Auto lending market. [They've already expanded to 47 states](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) (up from 33 states last quarter), thus having access to more than 95% of the US population. They've also increased their dealership footprint by 24% sequentially this quarter.

    But their biggest move in the auto lending space has to be the [acquisition of Prodigy Software](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2021-03-17/upstart-to-acquire-prodigy-software-a-leading-automotive-retail-software-provider) which is a leader in the automotive retail software space. Paul Gu, the co-founder of Upstart describes **Prodigy as the"" Shopify for car dealerships""** .

    Through acquisition of Prodigy Upstart was able to generate vehicle sales of over $1 billion this quarter, another very impressive result. They also already have five bank partners signed up for auto lending on their platform.

- Recently, Upstart filled a newly created [General Manager of Mortgage position](https://twitter.com/saxena_puru/status/1426859770833637380). This signals early stages of offering a mortgage product which would mean entry to a massive $2.5 trillion dollar category.

To conclude this section on the future of Upstart, I will leave you with [a short clip](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1697077/8693359-investing-in-ai-episode-10-dave-girouard-from-upstart?client_source=twitter_card&player_type=full_screen) of Upstart's CEO discussing how the company is setting out to be the biggest player in AI lending in the world. My main takeaway from this interview was just how early we are to the Upstart story [23:45].

# Putting my money where my mouth is

In short, [YES](https://streamable.com/73pefs). I am a mere mortal so no over the top yolos. I mainly invest in growth stocks and have recently been adding to my Upstart position like crazy, taking it from 11% to around 30% of my portfolio. 

# Conclusion

Upstart reminds me so much of Shopify at the beginning of its growth-spurt, in the sense that it is a future giant hiding in plain sight. Do your own due diligence on the company before making any investments, but after many many hours of consuming every bit of data I can get on the company, I believe it will a massive success over the next 5 years, and we will all look back and wonder why we didnt invest enough.

This is a once-in-a-life-time opportunity imho.

If you've read all of that I salute you friend!"

**Pros:**  
\- $12b market cap, profitable, positive cash flow, stable financial position, doing share repurchases  
\- Lots of innovation. New apps like the ability to accept payments directly via their platform. New partnerships with Facebook and Google to allow their users to advertise and sell on those platforms more seamlessly. Expanding in India  
\- Currently sits at 52-week low (\~$70) b/c of the recent earnings miss (dropped \~15% from before the announcement). But this appears to be a short-term overreaction   
\- Traded consistently in-range (\~$65-85) over the last 3 years, this looks to be the bottom of another such cycle before jumping back up.  
\- Super cheap options / leaps with an implied volatility of just \~30%

**Cons:**  
\- No immediate catalyst. The play is reversion to the mean  
\- Pandemic was a good thing for the company as many people tried creating online businesses from home. In the current environment, it is unclear what the trend is, reopening vs the variant. They missed their earnings target for Q2, and they provided a softer than expected Q3 sales forecast ($945m vs $948.6m, duh), but in-line full-year.  But their strategy seems to target both online and offline businesses, as well as not only attracting new customers, but also making existing ones more profitable. 

**Positions:**

For the rest of you who are actually decend people, I have the sweetest of DD. It's broken down in two parts:

1. The single most compelling argument to load up on $SONY: PSN
2. The rest of the business

**PSN and Netflix: what the fuck is going on here?**

Let's assume Sony sold nothing but PSN subscriptions. This company would not be too dissimilar to Netflix as:

1. Their stream of revenue comes from subscriptions (avg monthly price on Netflix: $10, PSN $8\*).
2. Their main cost is keeping the servers up and running.
3. Netflix would also have to pay for production and licensing, so I expect Sony to have a better margin. Beacause of this, I assume their net monthly income from a single user to be the same.
4. Future subscribers growth will be flat for both companies.

Currently, Netflix has 209 million subscribers and a market cap of $242B.

PSN has 109 million subscribers. If we agree on the 4 points I mentioned above, the **market cap of PSN alone** would be $126B, based on Netflix's standards.

The current market cap of Sony is (drum roll...) $122B. According to SONY's latest earning release, gaming (TOTAL Playstation universe, etc., not just PSN subscriptions!) will represent 33% of total 2021 income.

Make as many counterarguments as you want (Netflix will grow more, the value of a PSN subscriber is worth less, etc...), but even if we slash my assumed PSN market cap in half, we are **so far away** from a fair valuation of $SONY.

&#x200B;

**The business**

Let's have a look at a couple of other numbers to understand if $SONY's low valuation is justified by a terrible business.

Operating income (year ended March): 2018 JPY 730B. 2019 JPY 826B. 2020 JPY 832B. 2021 JPY 968B. TTM JPY 1,022B. -> they are growing income

Cash Flow: I'm too lazy to type in all numbers but they went from (JPY B) 1,2T in 2018 to 1,4T TTM. So no big growth, but stable.

P/E: 11

Profit margin: 13%

~~Price/book: 0.02 ( 😮 )~~ Edit: it seems that this ratio is miscalculated due to JPY/USD exchange. Looks like the real value is more likely around 2

Enterprise Value/EBITDA: 1.20

Intangible assets as % of total assets: 6,8% (and they have the PlayStation brand among all others... Just for a comparison, Netflix's ratio is 64%).

Also, they beat 9/10 of latest earnings:

https://preview.redd.it/imqj6jdpf2j71.png?width=1673&format=png&auto=webp&s=2db98000e0a918a2dcbe2fc17bddabd14d03dac0

I personally don't like the numbers here. There is no thrill in investing in something that is not a loss-making, overvalued, declining business  😴 . This is a beautiful money making machine that I am paying 2% of BOOK VALUE for. Too easy.

Positions:

Sold 11 cash covered puts at various strikes, up to $105.

IV is low, so I'm planning to add some leaps.

\*These are my assumptions based on the current pricing plan in EU and US and assuming that part of the PSN users don't buy annually but quarterly or monthly (assumption taken because their quartery user count is volatile). Please feel free to link better data in the comments."

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/3710tif9pwi71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ca77e000d7399100f36845fa880ef48e4b8d3ae)

After the initial uproar and wave of memes, there was a lot of discussion around why a company whose main income stream is from adult content decided to kill its golden goose.

**Was it because they are idiots, or because of any new regulations, or is there something much larger at play here?**

For this week’s analysis, I would be focusing on the company’s history and my take on why they did what they did and future implications for them. So, strap in while I take one for the team with my search history and ad recommendations going into questionable territory for the considerable future.

**The Company**

OnlyFans was launched by Timothy Stokely in 2016. His pitch was simple but effective.

>Why not create a platform that allows these entertainers to conveniently and securely monetize their content? OnlyFans would be like a social media platform with a feed, similar to that of Instagram and Twitter, except that fans are required to pay a monthly subscription to view the content of these entertainers. And if they are willing to pay more, they could unlock paywalls for even more valuable services.

The company was extremely successful and now hosts more than 2 million content creators. It has a user base of **130 million**. Even though the service is pitched as a website for content creators such as physical fitness experts, musicians, etc., it’s predominantly known for its adult entertainment category.

The company had explosive growth during the pandemic with its revenue rising by 540% to reach $400MM. As per a [leaked pitch deck obtained by Axios](https://www.axios.com/onlyfans-investors-struggle-9cc92523-6607-40ad-9893-4175e7966b52.html) (ironically, the company never mentions p\*rn in its pitch deck), it’s expected to create a whopping $2.5B in revenue by 2022.

**The Problem**

So, if the growth is great and the user base is becoming more and more engaged, why did the company decide to shoot itself in the foot?

As with most issues in a company, the problem lies with money! They are facing serious challenges in both the revenue stream as well as investor capital.

**Investor Capital**

[ Leaked video of OnlyFans CEO preparing for his investor pitch! ](https://reddit.com/link/p9c0zc/video/kmquh3vbpwi71/player)

Even with the explosive growth, it’s not like investors are lining up for the fundraising. It would be a walk in the park to raise funding for any other company with its growth trajectory and profitability. But there are multiple challenges in the case of OnlyFans:

* Some VC funds are prohibited from investing in adult content as part of their partnership agreements.
* Even though OnlyFans has a verification process, the risk of minors creating subscription accounts is real and will do irreversible reputation damage for both the company and its investors.

Even if the investors could look past all of this as the company looks to raise [new funding at unicorn valuation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-16/onlyfans-is-said-to-seek-funding-at-valuation-above-1-billion), OnlyFans has a reputation problem. Even if the brand could move on to a “safe for work” platform, the history associated with the brand is synonymous with adult content.

Given its history, it would be extremely difficult to attract brand partners and big names into the platform. The presence of big names is a must for a platform trying to become a more mainstream media site!

**Payment Processing**

While brand imaging and raising capital might be a longer-term problem for the company, the more pressing issue is a [BBC investigation into how the company handles illegal content](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-58255865) and its ramifications. If you thought Google had monopolistic power, let me introduce you to

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/b280g33epwi71.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e86b71b9a32ddc23438a7eb30a65cf8300acad8)

Visa and Mastercard combinedly process [more than 90% of transactions and 75% of transaction volume](https://fortunly.com/articles/credit-card-market-share/#gref) of all Credit card purchases in the US. In Dec 2020, after a NY Times article about how P\*rnHub monetizes illegal content, both Visa and Mastercard cut off payments to the site within 6 days! \[1\]. This caused them to remove 70% of all content (unverified) on their website (aka The Purge) to try and get the payment platforms on board. Visa and Mastercard still won’t work with the company even after all the drastic actions taken by P\*rnHub.

Given that the OnlyFans platform doesn’t show any ads, they would be dead in the water if their direct payment takes a hit. In April, Mastercard had announced a change to their policy \[2\] that requires this:

>The banks that connect merchants to our network... to certify that the seller of adult content has effective controls in place to monitor, block and, where necessary, take down all illegal content.

The policy will come into effect on October 15th and OnlyFans is trying to be compliant by the time the policy is enforced \[3\] and it seems like they are going by the logic that desperate times require desperate measures \[4\]!  

**What now?**

The Billion dollar question is whether OnlyFans would go the way Tumblr went (Tumblr was [once valued at $1.1B and was sold later for $3M](https://www.dignited.com/51316/tumblr-sold-3m-wordpress/)) after they banned all adult content on their website.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/39wrvfpfpwi71.png?width=1149&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a7f50652d4abf9af39d776c25e0f85faa3e3ece)

It seems that OnlyFan’s aspirations of becoming a mainstream media company and increasing regulations by payment partners are forcing the company to abandon the adult segment. While we currently don’t have an insight into their revenue split, it’s safe to say that a majority of it would be coming from the adult segment which would make the pivot even harder to pull off successfully.

I don’t know a single company that has survived after throwing their most loyal userbase and revenue generators under the bus for greener pastures! Maybe they are just concerned about their short-term survival and were forced to make this decision. But dropping the same folks who made you popular in the first place is definitely going to leave a bad aftertaste.

After all, what do *we* know? Running a billion-dollar company is a [very serious business!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROaj3bCpZEM&ab_channel=InternetHistorian)

Until next week!

**Footnotes**

\[1\] This would cause all normal credit card transactions to fail and then the only way for them to charge would be to directly get paid to their bank accounts or via crypt\*, both of which would be extremely difficult to process and scale.

\[2\] While there is a lot of chatter around how certain groups lobbied Mastercard to change their policy, I am not getting into that as it would inevitably take a political turn.

\[3\] To put this into perspective, if 4 companies (Visa, Mastercard, AmEx, and Discover) cut off your payment pipeline, you would effectively have no way to charge your customer!

\[4\] There is a lot of conversation around how this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for crypt\* to shine with the decentralized payment system.

\[5\] Granted, they were already seeing reduced engagement prior to the ban, but the adult content ban was the final nail in the coffin! [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtUuab1Aqg0&t=162s&ab_channel=CollegeHumor) is a hilarious parody video of Tumblr CEO explaining the ban!

\[6\]Apologies for filtering out all the adult words as I didn’t want to get tagged in spam filters.

*As always, please note that I am not a financial advisor.* Hope you enjoyed this week’s analysis."

- Neuroeconomics
  - A monetary loss or gain causes a biological change that has profound physical effects on the body
  - Neural activity of someone making money in investments are indistinguishable from someone high on cocaine
  - After 2 repetitions of a stimulus, the human brain automatically, unconsciously, and uncontrollably expects a 3 repetition
  - Once people conclude that an investment return is predictable, their brains respond with alarm if the pattern is broken
  - Financial loss is processed in the same areas where we respond to mortal danger
  - Anticipating a gain and actually receiving it are expressed in different areas. Helps explain why money does not buy happiness
  - Expecting both good and bad events is often more intense than experiencing them
- Greed
  - There is only one sure thing on Wall Street. And this is there are NO sure things
  - Lightning seldom strikes twice
  - Lock up your &quot;Mad Money&quot; and throw away the key. If you can&#39;t stop yourself from gambling in the market, then limit the amount
  - Control your cues. Turn off CNBC
  - Think twice before making any decisions. Calm yourself down
- Prediction
  - Our incorrigible search for patterns leads us to assume that order exists where there is non
  - Whenever you are confronted with anything random, you WILL search for patterns in it
  - People hate randomness
  - If a reward is big enough, it will carry a long-lasting memory that is difficult to break. This is why chart analysts get into trouble because they think they &quot;got it&quot;
  - Investors have a recency bias – what has happened they think will continue to happen, even if it is unpredictable. This causes investors to think that a bull market will continue and a bear market will also. This also causes them to buy the hottest mutual funds
  - Control what you can in the market – don&#39;t look for the next Google
    - Expectations – set realistic goals
    - Risk – ask not how much you can gain, but also how much you can lose
    - Readiness – think twice
    - Expenses – keep them low
    - Commissions – keep them low too
    - Taxes – don&#39;t day trade, you get hit with short term taxes
    - Yourself – don&#39;t try to predict
  - Don&#39;t try to predict the market – DCA is a good strategy to prevent this
  - Most mutual fund managers fail to beat the market. Answer to this is to DCA into index mutual funds
  - Correlation is not causation
  - Take a break – if you take a break, it resets your &quot;gamblers fallacy&quot; IE – a coin is flipped 7 times and comes up heads 7 times in a row, the next flip is &quot;due&quot; for a tail.
  - Don&#39;t obsess – if owning stocks is a long-term project for you, then following changes constantly is a very, very bad idea.
- Confidence
  - Create a &quot;too hard&quot; pile. Know what you don&#39;t know.
  - Measure 2x cut 1x. Have an overconfidence discount of 25% so if a stock according to your valuation is worth between $40-60. Make it $30-45.
  - Don&#39;t get stuck on your own companies&#39; stock
  - Diversification is the best defense
- Risk
  - Take a time out. Do not buy or sell an investment on the spur of the moment
  - When the price drops, so does risk.
  - Try to prove yourself wrong. Listen to another person&#39;s opinion
  - Know yourself and your risk tolerance
- Surprise
  - If everyone knows something. It is already embedded in the price of the stock
  - High hopes can cause big trouble
- Regret
  - Expecting regret often hurts worse than experiencing it
  - The more you can automate your investing, the better
  - Face your loss.
  - If you have a truly diversified portfolio, then you will guarantee yourself, by definition, that some of your assets will do well while some will do badly. You have to look at the whole portfolio
  - Don&#39;t chase hot sectors or stocks. The cure for chasing is to rebalance. Decide on a number and stick with it
  - Rebalancing over the long-term increases returns and lowers risks. It is buying low and selling high
- Happiness
  - If you earn enough cash to live on. Then more money won&#39;t make you happier
  - Know that money is a means, not an end in itself
- Summary
  - Take a global view. Look at total net worth, not changes in each holding
  - Hope for the best but expect the worst. Diversifying can keep you from panicking during bad times which will occur
  - Investigate before you invest. A stock isn&#39;t just a price. It is a company
  - Never say always. Never put more than 10% of your investments into a single stock
  - Know what you don&#39;t know.
  - The past is not the prologue. What goes up must come down and what goes way up usually comes down with a crunch. Never buy an investment because it is going up. Smart investors buy low and sell high
  - If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Anyone who offers a high return at low risk is probably a fraud
  - Costs are killers. Trading costs eat up your profits
  - Don&#39;t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread out between US, foreign, bonds, and cash. It is not a good idea to invest heavily in industries that your job is tied too. If you lose your job, your stock would be likely to fall also.

- After fiat money was introduced in Rome during the 3rd century A.D, currency crises became common
- Journalist Mike Royko described the market as manic-depressive. All you have to do is listen to the daily broadcasts and you think you are hearing the latest medical report on someone who ought to be in therapy or tied to a bed.
- Bull phase – market is frenetic and expectations become unrealistic
- Bear phase – market is depressed, activity is slow and universal pessimism replaces universal optimism
- Ben Graham – In the short term, the market is a voting machine, in the long term, a weighing machine
  - **Dutch Tulip Crisis**
- During Tulipomania there was little attempt to justify the prices paid for tulips, most speculators entered into contracts with the intention of quickly selling at a higher price
- The Tulip market crashed on February 3, 1637. There was no clear reason for the panic
- In the aftermath of the tulip crisis, tulipomania gave way to tulip phobia – a revulsion analogous to the public distaste for common stocks after the crash of 1929 and Japan after 1989
- The course of the tulip mania was similar to many later crashes. Initially started with a rise in prices for the precious Semper Augustus bulbs which attracted new entrants into the market, so stock market booms are commonly triggered by a sharp climb in the share prices of a particular sector.
- As a bull market mania progresses, the quality of the stocks (or tulips) that attract speculation declines – a rising tide floats all ships, even those unseaworthy. Rumors fuel the boom, rapid growth of leverage through the use of futures and credit, sharply rising prices followed by sudden panic without cause and initial government passivity followed by intervention
- Austrian economist J.A Schumpeter observed that speculative manias commonly occur at the inception of a new industry or technology when people overestimate the potential gains and too much capital is attracted to new ventures
- John Stewart Mill said the seeds of each boom are sown during the preceding crisis, when the liquidation of credit causes asset prices to decline so severely that they become genuine bargains. Their subsequent sharp rise from a low-level lead to a revival of speculation. Unable to remember the past, investors are doomed to repeat it
  - **Stockjobbing in Change Alley London**
- Charles Kindleberger suggests that speculative manias typically commence with a displacement which excites speculative interest. The displacement may come either from an entirely new object of investment or from the increased profitability of established investments. It is followed by a positive feedback loop as rising share prices induce inexperienced investors to enter the market, and results in euphoria. Speculation becomes more diffuse and spreads to different classes of assets. New companies are floated, investors leverage their gains, credit becomes overextended, swindling and fraud are common, then the economy enters a period of financial distress which is the prelude to the onset of a crisis
- The success of legitimate Captain Philips diving expedition and the East India Company caused promotors to cash in on investor euphoria to float new ventures which were fraudulent
- The mania played out as a series of mini-bubbles. Shares were driven above their intrinsic values by speculators using financial derivatives (futures, options, credit). The boom lost momentum after expectations were disappointing and business failed.
- An impatience to be rich, a contempt for those slow but sure gains which are proper reward of industry, patience and thrift, spread though society
  - **South Sea Scheme**
- Sir Isaac Newton – &quot;I can calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the madness of men.&quot;
- There was a company stock floated (IPO) during the bubble which said &quot;For carrying on an undertaking of great advantage but no one to know what it is.&quot;
- Only 4 of 190 bubble companies founded in 1720 survived
- Speculators did not buy bubble companies shares as long-term investments, they bought them with the intention of selling them on to greater fools
- Many buyers of the stock knew they were purchasing at absurd prices and that the long-term prospects of the company were hopeless; however, they all believed or hoped that they would be able to sell before the price plummeted
- Joseph Schumpeter – &quot;The mania of 1720 was exactly as were later manias of this kind, induced by a preceding period of innovation which transformed the economic structure and upset the preexisting state of things.&quot;
- The South Sea Company bribed both the Court and Parliament.
  - **Fool&#39;s Gold**
- The most common practice of projectors seeking to promote their companies was to employ members of Parliament and their peers as directors
- Emerging market speculation tends to appear at a juncture in the economic cycle when declining yields on domestic bonds combine with an excess of capital to make foreign investments particularly attractive.
- The boom of 1822-1825 can be understood as the product of easy credit conditions
- During the boom, the unrestricted growth of credit caused asset prices to rise, stimulating further credit creation. The situation reached a turning point in the spring of 1825, after which declining asset prices undermined confidence, caused a contraction of credit, and eventually brought on a crisis.
- When owners of savings are not finding their usual kind of investments, they rush into anything that promises speciously, and when they find that these specious investments can be disposed of at a high profit, the rush into them more and more.
- During the upturn in the cycle, people become convinced the prosperity will last forever.
- After 1825, there was a succession of booms and crises at roughly 10-year intervals
  - **England Railway Mania**
- Joseph Schumpeter, Speculators are in the vanguard of capitalist process. Once an innovation has been established and produces steady returns, speculation gives way to investment, which is more concerned with safety of principal and regularity of income than with capital gains. &quot;Unlike the speculator, the investor is primarily interested in the current state of affairs; insofar as he anticipates the future at all, he hopes that it will be a seamless continuation of the present.&quot;
- Innovations and novelties have always excited speculators.
- The railway journals were enthusiastic and uncritical supporters of railway schemes. They &quot;puffed&quot; new offerings and in return got hundreds of thousands of pounds spent on weekly advertisements
- There was an abundant of oversupply in terms of proposals for the very same rail-lines; each of these stock companies would all trade a premium even though it was known that only one of them would succeed and actually be allowed to build
- Economist article &quot;There is not a single dabbler in scrip who does not steadfastly believe-first, that a crash sooner or later, in inevitable; and, secondly, that he himself will escape it. When the luck turns, and the crack play devil take the hindmost, no one fancies that the last mail train from PANIC station will leave him behind. In this &#39;Men deem all men mortal but themselves.&#39;&quot;
- There was an &quot;extraordinary diversion of capital from traditional purposes to the construction of railways.&quot; It took nearly 2 years for the full impact of the reckless railway speculation to be felt in the economy at large.
  - **The Gilded Age**
- The aim of the corner was to acquire a sufficient number of shares to force up the price and catch out the bears who had sold short
  - He who sells what isn&#39;t his&#39;n, must buy it back or go to pris&#39;n
- Corners were normally undertaken by informal speculative partnerships and accompanied by market manipulation. It is a tense game that often fails.
- &quot;Call&quot; or &quot;Margin&quot; loans became common and increased volatility in the market
- During a market crisis, call rates rose sharply and loans were withdrawn, but because liquidity in the stock market dried up and borrowers were unable to sell securities, banks often experienced difficulty in retrieving their loans. This makes banks vulnerable to panics
- Congress passed a law outlawing trading in gold futures, but this only caused panic and gold shot up by 33%
- Some speculators, known as &quot;panic birds&quot; came to the market only once prices had crashed and money was scarce; the bought carefully, locked up their investments, and kept away from Wall Street until the next calamity stuck.
- But most speculators got caught up in the carnival atmosphere and remained until they lost everything
- Although the market is better regulated today, the speculators propensity for manipulation has not diminished with time
  - **The Crash of 1929**
- &quot;Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau.&quot; Yale economist Irving Fisher a few weeks before the crash
  - He believed that America had entered a &quot;new era&quot; of limitless prosperity
- People tend to &quot;fancy the prosperity they see will always last, that it is only the beginning of a greater prosperity.&quot;
- People believe we are living in a &quot;new era&quot; and that old rules and principles and precedents of finance were obsolete. That things could safely be done today which had been dangerous and impossible in the past
- Some time passes and people forget the past lessons and the same arguments come back and the same lessons must be relearned
- The rich became richer during the 1920&#39;s, but the workers were unable to enjoy the benefits of their improved productivity.
  - Unable to maintain their share of the economic surplus, workers experienced a decline in real wages during the decade as corporate profits rose
  - Capitalism, however, requires consumers as much as savers. But the demand was maintained by a massive expansion of consumer credit
  - Consumers, in their appetite for immediate gratification, were devouring their future. And when that future finally arrived, the cupboard was bare.
- Margin loans were being used to invest in the stock market, further pushing up asset prices. This created a vicious circle
- The federal reserve ignited a bubble by lowering interest rates to help the bank of England stop the flow of Gold
  - Once the fed realized they created a bubble, they increased rates from an all-time low of 3.5% back to 6%. But this interest was too low to reduce speculation while also being too high for the economy as a whole
- Lots of new brokerage houses opened at the peak. Usually, to sell to retail investors who were not as financially literate
- Charles Mitchell became the most prominent cheerleader of the bull market and &quot;new era&quot; investing. He stated stocks were as safe as bonds. He went bankrupt after the crash
- The most striking thing about the stock market boom of the 1920&#39;s was how speculation became central to the culture
- A dominate feature of the 1920&#39;s stock market was the use of debt to pyramid investments and enhance gains.
- Groucho Marx &quot;No need to employ a financial advisor to select your stocks. You can close your eyes, stick your finger any place on the big board and the stock you bought would start rising.&quot;
- Leverage was not confined to individuals&#39; speculators margin holdings; it became built into the financial structure of corporate America
- History, which has a painful way of repeating itself, has taught mankind that speculative overexpansion invariably ends in over contraction and distress…. If orgies of speculation are permitted to spread too far, however, the ultimate collapse is certain not only to affect the speculators themselves, but also to bring about a general depression involving the entire country.
- Shares were trading at 30 P/E&#39;s
- Crowds and bull markets are inherently unstable; it has no stasis, no point of equilibrium, and is driven by the dynamic either to grow or shrink. At the moment of its dispersal, a crowd frequently succumbs to panic, often at the most minor things.
- The intellectual inferiority of the crowd is a sign that people are filtering and manipulating information to make it agree with their existing beliefs. This is known as &quot;Cognitive Dissonance&quot; and dissonant information, which contradicts the collective fantasy, is uncomfortable and people seek to avoid it.
  - A group will maintain a state of cognitive dissonance until the pain exceeds the rewards. Or in stock market terms, the fear of loss outweighs the greed for gains
- Roger Babson forecast an imminent stock market crash and was met with a savage response from the new era speculators
- The panic before the 1929 stock market crash had no palpable cause. It was not proceeded by tightness in the money market. No banking brokerage, or industrial failure served to trigger
- The glamour stocks (High P/E) of the bull market suffered the worst damage
- 1920&#39;s similar to 1990&#39;s
- The rise in speculation was initially stimulated by low interest rates
- The belief that the stock market would invariably produce the greatest returns led investors to purchase shares regardless of price even though P/E&#39;s were at historic highs
- Investors saw each market decline as an opportunity to &quot;buy into the dip&quot; and as a result, every downturn was quickly reversed
- The rising stock market inflated investors expectations to irrational levels
- In the short run, the rising stock market serves to cover up weakness in the economy. Consumers spend their stock market gains and ignore rising debts, companies issue new shares or bonds, and governments enjoy rising tax receipts
  - **Cowboy Capitalism**
- When governments find their formal currency arrangements disintegrating, the speculator becomes a convenient scapegoat
- Nixon suspended the convertibility of the dollar to gold on August 15, 1971
- Whenever speculation got out of hand and a financial crisis appeared, everyone seeks refuge in the precious metal Gold. Gold represents the antithesis of speculative values
- Warren Buffett &quot;Observing correctly that the market was _frequently_ efficient, they (the EMH people) went on to conclude incorrectly that it was _always_ efficient.&quot; As a result, people were encouraged to bid up prices to unsustainable levels
- The &quot;nifty-fifty&quot; boom of 1972, during which it was stated that no price is too high to pay for America&#39;s leading companies, was followed by a steep market decline
- The best hedge against the chronic inflation of the period could be found in commodities and precious metals
- Mike Milken of Drexel Burnham Lambert pushed junk bonds as the new asset class investors had to be involved in; he claimed that the companies behind these bonds were not nearly as speculative and risky as credit rating agencies claimed they were
  - Once the figures could be examined, it became clear that junk bonds considerably underperformed investment grade bonds
- Popular lessons from the Great Depression began to be discarded and views towards business and debt shifted to being positive once more
  - **Japan Capitalism**
- Japanese share prices increased 3x faster than corporate earnings. 100x-400x P/E were not uncommon on Japanese stocks. There were all sorts of reasons for justifying this valuation (Japanese accounting understated real earnings, japan was becoming the world economic growth engine, a boom in consumer demand was around the corner, interest rates were low and there were no other alternatives, etc.).
- This speculation created a feedback loop: speculation manufactured profits, causing share prices to rise, which further increased speculation profits and ability of companies to raise money abroad to speculate more
- At the end of the bubble, the P/E of the Japanese market topped 80. Dividend yields were under 0.5% and stocks were selling for 6x book value. Margin was extensively used to buy stocks.
- Governor Mieno mission was to prick the bubble, he subsequently raised interest rates which pricked the bubble. The Japanese stock market did not collapse with a sudden jolt. Instead, it gently went down
- Even thought the Ministry of Finance had manipulated the market on the way up (through various means), the attempts to control its decent was less successful. In total it went down by more than 60%
  - Japanese authorities refused to allow prices of stock and property to sink low enough to find their clearing level (the price at which buyers = sellers)
    - Instead of alleviating the problems, the authority&#39;s mismanagement succeeded only in drawing out the painful aftermath of the bubble
- Consumer spending, the other great prop of the bubble economy, declined as the &quot;wealth effect&quot; reversed direction
- The government announced a series of fiscal boosts to stimulate the economy and revive the stock market. Foreign banks even offered negative yields on Yen deposits (Japanese depositors paid the privilege of lending their money to overseas banks, which they considered safer than Japanese banks)
- By 1998, the post-bubble revulsion against stocks was so severe that over 60% of Japanese personal assets were committed to cash earning less than 0.5%
- Economies in the process of liberalization appear to be especially susceptible to outbreaks of speculation
- The bubble economy illustrates the danger that arises when investors believe that market risk is shouldered by the government rather than themselves (moral hazard). Throughout the 1980&#39;s, the sceptics were told that the Japanese government would not allow share prices to fall and the Japanese banks and brokerages were &quot;too big to fail&quot;
  - **Hedge Funds or Rogue Economists**
- Even George Soros did not invest in derivative products because he could not understand them
- The flaw in LTCM (Long-Term Capital Management) trading strategies was to assume that the historical relationship between various asset could be depended upon for future speculation.

# **William Bernstein The Delusions of Crowds: Why People Go Mad in Groups**

4 Signs of a bubble

1. Everyone around you is talking about it. And you should start worrying when people talking about getting rich in certain areas of the market don&#39;t have a background in finance
2. When people begin to quit their jobs to speculate in the markets
3. When someone exhibits skepticism about the prospects and people don&#39;t just disagree with them, but they do so vehemently. They usually say &quot;You just don&#39;t get it.&quot; &quot;New Era&quot; &quot;It is different this time&quot;
4. When you start to see extreme predictions.

- Human beings intuitively seek out outcomes with very high but very rare payoffs, such as lottery tickets, that on average lose money but tantalize their buyers with the chimera of unimaginable wealth
- Researchers have found that our brains fire not only with reward, but even more intensely with its anticipation.
  - There is nothing so disturbing to one&#39;s well-being and judgement as to see a friend get rich
- When presented with facts and data that contradict our deeply held beliefs, we generally do not reconsider and alter those beliefs appropriately. More often, we avoid contrary facts and data, and when we cannot avoid them, our erroneous assessments will even harden and make us more likely to proselytize them.
- People respond more to narratives than to facts and data. And the more compelling the story, the more it erodes our critical thinking skills
- We have 2 different types of thought process
  - System 1 or &quot;reptilian brain&quot; that is fast moving emotional response
  - System 2 or &quot;evolutionary brain&quot; that is much slower conscious reasoning
    - Our faster emotional machinery leads, and our slower &quot;reason&quot; follows
    - In a state of nature, the advantages of system 1 are obvious (IE - hissing snake at your feet). But in a relatively safe post-industrial world where dangers have a longer time horizon, system 1 dominance often occurs at great costs
- Bank supplied leverage is the fuel that powers modern financial manias and it has brought with it a roller coaster of bubbles and busts
  - Over the last 4 centuries, financial innovation has yielded a dizzying variety of investment vehicles: each, in its turn, was often simply leverage in a slightly different disguise and would prove the tinder that would set alight successive waves of speculative excess
- Bubbles typically end with a seemingly small disturbance, followed by a swift collapse
- Throughout history, property prices have ranged between five and twenty times annual rental values.
- When investors are unhappy with ultra-low interest rates offered on safe assets, they bid up the prices of risk assets with rosier potential income.
  - The allure of the hypnotic new technology (early 1800&#39;s railroads) was amplified, as is almost always the case with bubbles, by falling interest rates, which makes investment capital more plentiful
- Every bubble carry within it the seeds of its own destruction
- When compelling narrative and objective fact collide, the former often survives.
- Human beings suffer from confirmation bias, in which once they have settled on a hypothesis or belief system, pay attention only to data that supports their beliefs and avoid data that contradicts it.
- Hyman Minsky thought bubbles needed 2 conditions
  - Easy credit via low interest rates
  - Advent of new technology
- Investors excited about new technologies, or financial products, etc. begin to pour money into them. Since these assets can also be used as collateral for loans, rising prices mean that speculators can borrow even more to pour into these assets. A self-reinforcing cycle develops. But only on the way up
- Minsky developed the &quot;instability hypothesis&quot; which states that in a safe and stable financial environment, money inevitably migrates away from safe borrowers and toward risky ones. Eventually, things get out of hand, resulting in a blowup, which makes lenders and investors more prudent, and the cycle begins anew. Usually about once per decade
  - Amnesia is implicit in the instability hypothesis. After a crisis, investors shy away from risk. As markets recover and the unpleasant memories fade, participants become more open to risk and the instability cycle begins anew.
  - We all like a good story; in the grip of a bubble, when faced with the unpleasant or difficult calculation, a compelling narrative provides easy escape from the effort of rigorous analysis.
- Abandonment of hardheaded financial calculations in favor of compelling narratives is another factor that precipitates financial manias
  - Rather than attempt the nearly impossible estimation of the value of a stock with high projected future earnings (South Sea in 1720, RCA in 1928, Pets.com in 1999, or Tesla today) investors default back to the simple heuristic: &quot;X is a great company and it is going to change the world, and its worth paying almost any price for it.&quot;
- Humans have a recency bias: If stock prices have been rising for the past several years, they will come to believe that equity levels will continue to do so forever; as prices climb, shares become more attractive, which drives up prices even more. The reverse also happens during bear markets
- John Templeton &quot;The four most expensive words in the English language are &#39;This time it&#39;s different.&#39;&quot;
- Max Winkler observed after the 1920 crash and discovery of the Dividend Discount Model that the market discounted not only the future, but the hereafter as well
- Debt can grow faster than the rest of the economy for so long before they implode
  - This is particularly true of private debt
- During bubbles, people become intoxicated by the pursuit of effortless wealth
- Even if we can&#39;t model bubbles, we know what they look like
- Minsky&#39;s amnesia requirement usually reveals a generational divide during bubbles; only participants old enough to recall the last boom and bust are likely to be skeptical. Their younger and more enthusiastic colleagues will deride them as old fogies
  - Bubbles are the province of young people with short memories
- Market Bubbles require 4 necessary conditions
  - Technological and financial displacement
  - Credit loosening
  - Amnesia of the past
  - Abandonment of time-honored valuation principles
- Under most circumstances, the Federal Reserve cares about 2 things
  - Overall state of the economy (as measured by GDP growth and unemployment)
  - Keeping inflation under control
    - Stock prices are of lesser concern and often wind up a bystander of the other 2 policies
- The Fed primary operates via the federal funds rate (interest rate at which member banks lend to each other overnight)
  - When interest rates on these are high, they attract investors. Which pulls investment from risk assets (stocks) and lowers their prices. The opposite is true
- We are apes who tell stories. When our remote ancestors needed to communicate with each other to survive, they did not do so with syllogisms, numerical data, or mathematics. The primary mode of that communication was and still is narration.
- Humans are narrative animals, no matter how misleading the narrative, if it is compelling enough it will nearly always trump the facts, at least until those facts cause great pain.
  - The more compelling the narrative, the more it erodes are analytical thinking
  - We also mold the facts to fit our preexisting opinion
    - We cling to facts that fit our narrative and ignore those that disconfirm them
    - We intentionally avoid exposing ourselves to contrary data
  - A compelling narrative can spread through a population just like a virus would and can even acquire critical mass
    - As more and more people share the same delusion, the more likely we are to believe in it, and so the more likely those around us will do so as well, a vicious cycle ensues, gaining more and more momentum until they finally smash into the brick wall of reality.

# **Fred Schwed Where are the Customers Yachts?**

- Once in the dear dead days beyond recall, an out-of-town visitor was being shown the wonders of the New York financial district. When the party arrived at the battery, one of his guides indicated some handsome ships riding at anchor. He said, &quot;Look, those are the bankers and brokers yachts.&quot; &quot;Where are the customers yachts?&quot; asked the naïve visitor.
- One can&#39;t say figures lie. But figures, as used in financial arguments, seem to have the bad habit of expressing a small part of the truth forcibly, and neglecting the other part, as do some people we know
- Customers have the unfortunate habit of asking about the financial future. Now if you do someone the signal honor of asking him a difficult question, you may be assured that you will get a detailed answer. Rarely will it be the most difficult of all answers---&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;
- Those classes of investment considered &quot;best&quot; change from period to period. The pathetic fallacy is that what are thought to be the best are in truth only the most popular – the most active, the most talked of, the most boosted, and consequently, the highest in price at the time.
- You can&#39;t ask an experienced Wall Street man to buy stocks when they have just hit a new low and unemployment is at a peak. Unfortunately for everyone concerned, these are the only time when stocks are down. When &quot;conditions are good, the forward-looking investor buys. But when &quot;conditions&quot; are good, stocks are high. Then without anyone having the courtesy to ring a warning bell, &quot;conditions&quot; get bad.
- Some people believe in charts implicitly, and many more take a peculiar half and half position. Major Angas in describing several chart systems, concludes &quot;All of these theories are true part of the time, none of them all the time. They are, therefore, dangerous, though sometimes useful.&quot; The same could be said of the practice of flipping a coin to determine weather one should buy or sell.
- When a student peers, however closely, at a graph of the Dow-Jones averages, for instance, all he sees for certain is a history of past performance clearly and conveniently depicted. That one can, by examining a line already drawn, make a useful guess at the line not yet drawn, must be predicated on the hypothesis that &quot;history repeats itself.&quot; History does in a vague way repeat itself, but it does it slowly and ponderously, and with an infinite number of surprising variations.
- There have always been a considerable number of pathetic people who busy themselves examining the last 1000 numbers which have appeared on the roulette wheel in search of some repeating pattern. Sadly enough, they have usually found it.
- The full flavor of losing money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey to an inexperienced girl what it is truly like to be a wife and mother. There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin either by words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it feels like to lose a real chunk of money that you used to own.
- Speculation is an effort, probably unsuccessful, to turn a little money into a lot.
- Investment is an effort, which should be successful, to prevent a lot of money from becoming a little.
- The burnt customer certainly prefers to believe that he has been robbed rather than that he been a fool on the advice of fools"

If so, $NVDA, $AMZN, $GOOG and the like would soar to infinity beyond every earnings report but often go down after record breaking earnings. Why? Because of buying the rumor and selling the news and forward projections.

These companies are established and have to work hard to establish how they are going to continue growing at that pace, but for newer companies earnings miss are not only expected but a shakeout of weak paper hands. Remember $TSLA anyone?

So let's talk about $RBLX, who just post earnings announcement.

Here is the TLDR;

Q2 was less growth than Q1 compared to last year 🤦- well duh!?!?

Last Q2 was Apr 2020 - June 2020 which encompassed a rapid growth period for Roblox during the lockdowns.

Here's the incredibly bullish thing though - **there was growth** 🚀🚀🚀.  The bears against this suggest that it was just a pandemic play and that it faced strong headwinds because of that. Yet, despite the economy vast re-opening and $DIS exploding it's park attendance with blowout earnings, $RBLX still experienced vast growth YoY in the headwind environment. I think this will only continue to curve upwards as pandemic surge data moves out of focus. For the short-term and my tendies, the earnings call tomorrow will make a big impact whether this will print or not. The Delta variant is growing lockdown concerns again too. Either way, more lockdowns or not, $RBLX is a strong play with lots of insider buying too. There has to be something that Nancy and Cathie know. $85+ let's go 🚀🚀🚀! 

&#x200B;

The details are below for those wanting to see the comparison between Q2 report and Q1 report:

* Revenue **increased** **127%** over Q2 2020 to $454.1 million \[Compared to last Q1: 147% growth from Q1 YoY\]

For those who know nothing about this company its basically the Chinese version of Uber

**IPO:**

Didi was one of the most overhyped IPOs advertised as ""the biggest IPO of the year"" on 30th June the day of the IPO when market opened Didi was at $14.14 it then sky rocketed to as high as $18 on the 1st of July but has been declining ever since and also took a hit with the rest of the Chinese stocks that crashed.

**Share Statistics:**

Current float: 224.66 million shares

Shares Sold Short: 59.54million

% held by institutions: **3.92%**

**Comparison to Uber:**

Ubers IPO was also a car crash trading around the $40 region on day of IPO it then dropped by 40% 10 months after IPO date and then rebounded from there after consecutive quarterly earnings reports beating expectations.  The main difference however, is that Ubers float is 1.65billion shares and ubers price is currently 5x the value of Didi globals. Didi also doesn't have a load of law suits they have to constantly fight because Chinese people dont have rights. So didis float is 7x smaller and price is 5x cheaper and Didi actually makes money. 

Whenever Uber smashed quarterly EPS we saw a surge in price, Didi has 7x less float and is 5x cheaper meaning the sentiment could surpass Ubers sentiment causing magnified effects of these price surges after earnings. Didis price is also supressed by the short shellers where as ubers is a lot more inflated.

**Will Chinese Stocks rebound?**

short answer is yes I believe they will as the market always corrects after a crash we saw this at the start of the pandemic when the entire market crashed. **Many Chinese stocks are currently undervalued** following the recent crash and its only a matter of time until they rebound just ask the retards who yolod into alibaba. 

&#x200B;

**tldr**: Stonks only go up especially IPOs something about an IPO bubble. Buying after market crash = good. Current price is around $8 only $0.80  more than the all time low meaning it literally cant go tits up. Small float cheap price and a load of bag holders"

SelectQuote is the pioneer of the direct-to-consumer model for various types of policies in the insurance space. The company has three primary business segments: SelectQuote Senior, SelectQuote Life and SelectQuote Auto & Home.

Before we start, a few key facts:

* By 2030, all baby boomers will be 65 or older (source: the goddamn US Census)
   * 73 million boomers out in the wild…10K a day.
* Consumer buying will continue to shift away from the traditional face-to-face format as the population continues to have ever increasing access to technology (source: common sense).
   * HOW MANY FACEBOOK POSTS HAVE YOUR BOOMER PARENTS OR GRANDPARENTS POSTED IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS? That’s proof.

[Cool colors with dates. Basically, more boomers.](https://preview.redd.it/rhlwxupkmmh71.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=c375402cfe6f22a29de4940750f6b82908b5fbc4)

Why now:

The first thing you probably did was Google who the hell SelectQuote is as you slowly rolled your eyes… all while mouthing the words “boomer” and “value investing” to yourself. Not so fast… Well, the stock is DOWN and DOWN BAD the past week. One of SelectQuotes biggest competitor’s (GoHealth: GOCO) had a less than stellar earnings report, which (in my opinion) falsely tanked the entire market segment, which has presented a great buying opportunity. I actually bought some of them too, but that's not important. That said, when a company loses 50-60% overnight, it kinda makes me want to buy it.

Anyway...

Financial points about SLQT and their previous earnings (source: few various websites that a quick google search of the below will show!)

* Q3 results: +80% revenue growth (SOLID)
   * Senior aspects up 101% YoY (SOLID)
   * $266.9M against expected $262.5M (SOLID)
   * EBITDA up 63% YoY (SOLID)

The ONLY aspect of SLQT’s business that I see as being “BAD” is their auto insurance segment, which dropped 33%. Good, because Boomers shouldn’t drive anyway. Safety first.

Well, what happened? Completely unrelated to last week’s decrease, when the previous totals were announced for the company’s Q3 growth, the company tanked before as well. This company spends money to make money. They also rely almost entirely on the boomers. All other areas of the business are nice, but it’s just noise. Medicare makes the world go round.

To me, the company was a “buy” even back it initially dipped. Now, my interest is absolutely peaked. 

Once the GoHealth debacle went down last week, this company (SLQT) announced earnings will be released on August 25th for Q4 and the cumulative FY.

Note: SelectQuote is trading at just 2.8x EV to Sales and 11.5x FY 2022 adjusted EBITDA. (source: Google). 

I SEE OPPORTUNITY.

Positions: 400 $22.50 calls ; also around 450 shares or something like that across a few different areas. Not important... Not really a high dollar position by me (can see my other failures that I have posted), but I think it could be a good (relatively) low risk play.

I think this goes up off earnings and retraces previous support ranges. From there, you make your own decisions.

On August 12th, something very strange happened. The url amazon.com/affirm no longer led to an error message. In fact, it redirects to a link that says ""Pay over time with Affirm"" in the tab title, and, if you're on the app it says ""Search in Pay over time with Affirm"" in the search bar. ipad view: https://imgur.com/rGLmrwy

If you do a ""view page source"" you can ctrl+F and see the ""08-12"" that verifies that this url was set up on 8/12.

Now let's explore the url it redirects to. It has a specific ""node ID"" in it. https://www.amazon.com/b?node=23376591011

Upon reviewing what this means, a node ID is set up for a specific category of product. For instance, this is what the url for their Kindle overview page looks like: https://www.amazon.com/b?node=17717476011 An identical URL with a different node ID.

It seems very unlikely they set up a specific node ID url if something wasn't brewing.

Now lets look at other evidence. A few months ago, someone noticed during checkout the word ""option"" that had not been there before, yet there was only one pay over time option. See the third line down: https://imgur.com/g0jqN4c

Someone also noticed that when you used to search for ""Amazon Affirm"" on google it used to come up with a robo-generated search result mentioning Affirm. They do this with basically anything you search to generate clicks. But, a couple months ago, this robo-generated search result removed as if they were trying to hide something. Here is what used to come up: https://imgur.com/3uE52wt

So what could all this mean? It could be something as simple as Amazon will promote Affirm's upcoming debit card on their website, but why would they promote a competing card? At the moment Amazon only offers their own cards. Or.. it could be a full-blown partnership or buyout. We don't know, but something is going on.

Also, don't question why I was routinely visiting error message URLs. I have no life and was hoping one day I'd find something and I did."

Or… should I option for the 1st time? Here is my attempt at DD.,36,81,2021-08-16 03:56:52,"I have never had the stones to buy options, but maybe now is the time? 

Other than the ridiculous spike at the beginning of 2021, Baidu has traded down over 5 years. The 1 year is skewed, but if we look back at day for day, it was about $120 against current day $150. So if I had bought and held through the spike I would have still been up a very decent 25% in 1yr.

Now, Baidu has a P/E of about 7. Compare to Baba at about 23, Tencent about 21.5, JD is at 14. Stateside, mega giants Google is at 30 and Amazon is running a 57 P/E. 

Financials: assets have climbed steadily every year. They’re cash positive with money in the bank. Net Income in 2020 was about 22.5B. 

Almost every analyst I’ve read says this stock is undervalued. $200 seems assured, and long term… who knows? 33% ROI is great, but 100% if it gets anywhere near ATH would be fantastic. 

The big audacious goal he is their AI. They are the leader in China here, and I believe this will allow them some explosive growth in the future as autonomous driving becomes a reality, online search becomes increasingly driven by AI, and cloud business. This should allow it to rise above the competition from Bytedance, Tencent, Alibaba, and others for search revenue. 

The obvious elephant in the room is the Chinese government crackdown on… everything. Short term, makes this very volatile. Long term, I think things stabilize and Baidu will be well positioned when it does. 

If I did try and jump into options, I’m not sure how I would approach it. Would love to hear your thoughts (obviously not financial advice). 

Position: 30 shares at $192.

TL:DR - Baidu is undervalued with a P/E half or better than competitors. China be crazy but I believe their net cash, growing revenue, and AI research will position them for 100% growth in 12-24 months. Conservative fair value is $200-$210."

I know GME AMC and CLOV are not the same and I am not here to bash either GME or AMC just pointing out some similarities between the three. I support GME both AMC and GME. Full disclosure I am not the first to point out these similarities but I have looked into them myself using the charts I pulled off of the SEC Website. AL Trades is where I first heard the information about a week ago in a youtube video and I just went and did some of my own digging to confirm the information he provided. 

Looking at the Charts you see peaks in FTDs in Both GME and AMC before the price run up. **FOR GME HAPPENED 3 TIMES and THE FTD PATTERN HAS AN ERIE CORRELATION THE SHARE PRICE IMO.** 

The Peak FTDs for GME were just over 3m and GMEs Float is 56m according to Google

3m FTDs / 56m Shares = just over 5% of the float 

The Peak FTDs for AMC were just over 27M and the float according to google is 511m

27m FTDs / 511m Shares = Just over 5% of the Float 

The Peak FTDs for CLOV were just over 19m and the Float according to Google is 133M

19m FTD’s / 133m Shares = **Just over 14%**!

Another thing I want to point out is that AMC before it big run up had a mini squeeze similar to what we saw from CLOV in June. 

AMC went from around $2 to $20 then back down to $6 

CLOV went from $6 to $28 and is now in the $8 range which it has been for a couple of weeks now. Is the Bottom in for CLOV? I don’t really know but I hope so. 

**Full disclosure I am a CLOV shareholder and very bullish on CLOV from all of My research I have done and that others have done.** 

**I am not a financial adviser and this is not financial advice. Just pointing out some things I see from the Charts.** 

**I hope that everybody does they’re own due diligence before investing and hope that everybody makes some money investing.** 

**If you don’t like this post, please provide some constructive feedback and specific reasons why.** 

**Last but not least LFG GME AMC AND CLOV.**"

# History of Nokia

If you've seen any of the recent Nokia posts over the last few months, a common comment you will see is: ""Nokia?!? That stock has been trading sideways for years!""

While yes that is true, it is important to understand why. Let's take a look.

**2000-2013**

Nokia dominated the mobile phone market during this time due to a quality handset. NOK traded in the $50s during the Dotcom bubble and in $30s before the housing crash. However, they never recovered after 2008 due to struggling to keep up in software as the mobile phone market started to shift to smart phones.

**2013-2019**

When Nokia realized that trying to stay in the phone space was a losing battle they sold their phone division to Microsoft in 2013. For the next 3 years, Nokia was a large company in disarray.

This did not get much better in 2016 when they acquired Alcatel-Lucent and decided to focus on networks. The merger did not go as smoothly as planned and over the next 5 years Nokia started ""trading sideways"" due to a bearish sentiment.

Some investors stuck around through all of this due to a dividend being paid out, but that was suspended in 2019 so Nokia could focus on developing its 5G mobile networks. This dropped the share price down to $3.50.

**2020-Present**

In March 2020, sentiment started to change somewhat bullish as they announced Pekka Lundmark would be taking over as CEO. Pekka worked for Nokia for a decade in the 90s and most notably served as Fortum's, a Finnish state-owned energy company, CEO from 2015 to 2020.

The bullish sentiment was shorted lived due to the pandemic crash dropping the share price to $2.42. It started to pick back up over the summer when it was announced that Pekka would take over a month earlier than planned.

This was followed by rumors that there was a chance Nokia could win Verizon's $6 billion 5G deal. Hype around this brought Nokia's price above $5 for the first time since they suspended their dividend in October 2019. But in September, it was announced that Samsung won the Verizon deal and NOK fell down to $3.78. It fell even further to $3.37 in October when the rest of the market saw a down swing.

Then it climbed back up to the low $4s, had a crazy January hitting $9.79 for about 10 seconds during to the meme stock frenzy, and has since returned to the high $3s low $4s after the Q4 earnings call.

**Pekka's Tenure**

Pekka has been in charge for 11 months during a global pandemic, but he has been able to make some progress it appears. Much of this information can be found in the Nokia 2020 Annual Report.

* He trimmed their employee size by 11,000.
* He improved their free cash flow to $2.6 billion.
* Even with the decrease in revenue he nearly doubled their operating profit (page 82).
* He drastically reduced their net deferred tax balance (page 175).
* He created four distinct business groups with plans for these groups to be shared in more detail during during Capital Markets Day on 3/18.
* He replaced Nokia's CFO, CTO, and CMO (CFO happened before he took over)
* It appears he issued new shares to leadership.
* Pekka has a stake in the company (page 67 of annual report) with a long term goal to ""Focus on increase in share price and restoration of the dividend"".
   * "" In addition, Mr. Lundmark received an award of EUR 1.3 million of restricted shares on joining to buy out the awards he forfeited on leaving his previous employer. Mr. Lundmark was invited to join the co-investment based long-term incentive arrangement (eLTI) targeted to engage senior leaders with the long-term nature of our business and share price, and purchased EUR 2.6 million of Nokia shares against which he was given a matching award of EUR 5.2 million of Nokia 2020 performance shares. This investment by Mr. Lundmark aligns him with shareholders from the start and is a sign of his commitment and engagement with the company. Delivery of actual Nokia shares would take place in 2023 subject to performance conditions""

# Bullish

Here is a list of 28 deals and partnerships Nokia has established since December 2020. Some of these deals are not massive, but they span across 6 continents.

**Largescale Network**

* 5 year Multi Billion Dollar T Mobile Deal
* 7 year Belgium deal
* Deutsche Telekom in Germany
* France's Mainland 5G Network
* 5G Network in Austria
* Telecom Italia
* Cibicom ISP in Denmark
* Polkomtel Phone Provider in Poland
* Telenor Group in Thailand
* Ooredoo in Algeria
* 5G Network in Philippines
* Tele2 in Sweden, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia
* Ecuador
* Vodafone in Australia
* Saudi Arabia
* Singapore

**Private 5G Deals**

* San Diego Gas &amp;amp; Electric Private Network
* Port of Seattle
* Japanese Companies Conexio, Hitachi Kokusai, Nippon Steel, Omron and Sharp
* WEG Motor Manufacturer in Brazil
* Elisa in Finland
* Optus Stadium in Australia

**Partnerships**

* Google Cloud
* EU's Hexa-X 6G Project
* Brazil's Telecommunications R&amp;amp;D Center
* AT&amp;amp;T tests to deploy virtualized and open RAN
* Patents deal with Samsung
* LG Uplus trial in South Korea
*Bell Labs

**5G is the Future**

The confusing nature of 5G could be holding back the market's valuation of Nokia. 

* Nokia is currently trading at a market cap of $22-23 billion even with a 2020 revenue of $24 billion.
* A letter that Pekka recently published gives a decent explanation of what 5G is.
   * In it, he admits ""\[5G\] is exciting, but it can seem a bit abstract."" But then goes on to describe some real world examples that really helps explain it.
   * ""Our partners saw unanticipated breakdowns and production line defects drop by 30% after installing smart video sensors in our manufacturing deployments. In the logistics sector, deploying augmented reality devices cut machine monitoring costs by half. In ports, remote-controlled cranes doubled productivity and eliminated staff injuries: an incredible 100% drop.""
* This seems to suggest that there may be more uses for 5G worldwide than cellular networks.
* Nokia released a study stating that 5G could have an $8 trillion impact on global GDP by 2030.
* Nokia and Ericcson may have a duopoly on 5G with Huawei and ZTE being banned in many countries. This trend may continue.
* Some analysts have predicted massive (&amp;gt;1,000%) growth in the 5G market over the next 5 years.

**Upcoming Events/Rumors**

* **Capital Markets Day (3/18/21)**
   * This is when we will get some true guidance on the future of the company. Not only will they lay out the strategic business plans for their 4 business segments as I mentioned above, but it should be when they make announcements toward potential a Dividend Reinstatement, Share Buyback, and future R&amp;amp;D decisions.
* **Annual General Meeting (4/8/21)**
   * Not sure what they plan to cover during this, but I would assume it will act as a follow up to Capital Markets Day
* **Dividend Reinstatement**
   * Most signs point to Nokia investing in R&amp;amp;D for a while, but based on Pekka's compensation package it should be back by 2023 at the latest.
* **Share Buyback**
   * Nokia did buy back 1.25 billion shares in 2015-16 and 1 billion shares in 2016-17. So the rumors they plan to do this again could be true. They can purchase up to a total of 550 million shares both this year and next year. 550 million because it correlates to 10% of the companies total outstanding shares.

# Bearish (Risks/Cons)

* The meme stock frenzy has a long-lasting impact on the opinion of this stock.
* The dividend is not reinstated for another 3+ years.
* Pekka does not have what it takes. Nokia is a sinking ship and cannot be turned around.
* FCF is used solely for R&amp;amp;D and no shares are bought back over the next three years. The float does turn out to be too big to move significantly.
* Nokia may not be undervalued and their revenue streams may continue to decline due to network share loses and pricing erosion.
* Pekka has been very serious over the last two earning calls and things are going to get much worse/challenging before they get better.
* With a new US administration in place, the trend of banning Huawei and ZTE that they started is lifted. These two competitors then undercut Nokia pricing.
* 5G is no where near as big of an industry as the experts predict. Covid continues to slow the rollout of 5G well past 2030.
* 5G is too confusing and never gets the buy in from today's investors.

Cowan Upgrades

Cowen Upgrades $NOK Citing Execution From New Ceo

Cowen adds its praise for quarterly results, upgrading the stock to Outperform.

From here, the demand environment looks to be ""very favorable,"" the firm says.

""What has changed is NOK's improving execution; we think upward trajectory is now clear and we expect meaningful incremental improvement from here, which while helping drive incremental revenue growth should especially help margin structure, and thereby EPS and cash flow,"" analyst Paul Silverstein says.

Meanwhile, Silverstein says CEO Pekka Lundmark is following the playbook of Borje Ekholm's dramatic turn-around of Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC); he's only one year in at Nokia and ""we think it is a safe assessment that further meaningful progress and attending upside lies ahead.""

Cowen has raised its target on Nokia to $8 from $5, now implying 31.6% upside.

Calls are also DIRT cheap, I think there is incredible growth over the long run AND the short term.

I have 25 sept. 3 calls, 50 sept. 10 calls, 400 shares."

As someone who practices SEO and is very familiar with the space and their competition, I can definitely say SEM Rush is best in class and offers a robust suite of products that are incredibly beneficial for optimizing SEO & SEM. What's amazing about their product is that it's significantly cheaper than competitor offerings. Their average deal size is around $2,100/year which is ridiculous given how much value they provide their users. They have increased their pricing earlier this year and in the Q2 earnings call, they noted that churn was stable so far (still TBD of course).

Also, SEM Rush benefits from being a leader in the search space that continues to grow exponentially per Google and Microsoft's earnings calls. Their social media marketing solutions will also be helpful given the growth of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, etc.

**Product Leadership vs. Competition**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/khes87bhr5h71.png?width=1851&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e504cfe54d5887b9d4df2d69cc3276784e9bd2c

Per their Q2 earnings slide, this is where they see themselves vs. their competition. Of course, they are biased, but the awards they've earned, plus the recognition they've received confirms at least some of this promotional content. In addition, as someone who has used a number of the products listed in the above screenshot, SEM Rush is definitely a leader for sure in the space relative to its competition.

Other notable competitors in the space are:

\-BrightEdge  
\-Conductor  
\-Botify  
\-DeepCrawl

The reason I bring them up is that the above solutions are considered ""Enterprise SEO"" or ""Enterprise marketing"" solutions and thus have a starting package of $1,000+/month (i.e. 5-figure contracts), given SEM Rush's core offering, I think SEM Rush can continue to position themselves as a cost-efficient leader in the space and to investors, given where competition's pricing is at, SEM Rush will have some pricing power. I would say their closest competitor that offers similar product offerings at a reasonable price is Ahrefs and from what I'm reading, they are growing quickly too.

**Financials**

As you can see this is a high-growth company that COVID has definitely helped accelerate too. They've accelerated revenue sequentially and their YoY revenue growth accelerated from 35% in 2020 to 45%+ in 2021. Moreover, their sequential guidance, assuming if they can beat and raise like they did last year, means that revenue could very well grow 50%+ this year and if they can continue to grow 8%+ sequentially, we should see a 35%+ growth year in FY 2022 on some already impressive growth figures.

**Gross Margin**

Gross Margins for the business have increased steadily from 2018 to present:

2018: 72.2  
2019: 75.5  
2020: 76.0  
Q2 '2021: 77.3

So this company has the potential to be very profitable with its continued margin expansion. Per their long-term targets, they hope to get GM to around 80%, so that's another 2%+. That's pretty impressive, even in the SaaS space.

**Operating Margins**

Their non-GAAP operating margins has continued to improve, where they started Q1'20 at -6% and the FY 2020 at -3.7%. In Q1 '21, they improved operating margins to 5.3% and in Q2 '21, they had operating margins of 1.2%. So they are definitely improving in this area esp. vs. last year which demonstrates their operating leverage and ability to achieve profitability. Moreover, their long-term operating margin target is 20%+.

**Net Revenue Retention**

As with any software company, net revenue retention is incredibly important since it helps fuel top-line revenue growth since existing customers are buying more (""land and expand"") and you continue to generate new business.

Their NRR in 2019 was 120%, in 2020 it was 114% largely due to COVID's impact in Q2 when everything was shut down and companies were getting lean. In Q1 '21 it was 116% and in Q2 '21 it was 121%. It seems that per the earnings call, management will continue to grow that figure with additional product offerings and add-ons.

Here's a graph from their S-1 about their existing cohorts:

**Customers**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r94iuwikr5h71.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5113b4f93f5490975b3f5979a88e16db42a40dee

They continue to grow their customer base at a decent clip, with Q2 '21 customers totaling over 76k customers this was a 29% increase YoY and 5.6% sequentially. This is definitely impressive growth and as long as they continue to ""land and expand"" it should continue to contribute to their revenue growth. In the earnings call, management noted that 10k+ ARR customers grew 50%, so they are definitely seeing some up-market momentum.

**Valuation**

As of yesterday's close, SEM Rush had a EV/S multiple of 16.06 this compares to other martech solutions such as Hubspot ($HUBS) with an EV/S of 28.3 and Sprout Social ($SPT) with an EV/S of 34.7. It appears SEM Rush is growing faster than both of these companies and thus is ripe for some multiple expansion if they can continue to grow their revenue at the rates we've seen recently. I personally think the market is still in a ""wait and see"" mode since this is a new IPO and has only had 2 earnings releases so far. If they beat and raise next quarter, I would expect some material multiple expansion, similar to what we saw with Asana ($ASAN) where it took them 3 earnings reports to grow from an EV/S of mid-20s to 50+ (I don't expect SEM Rush to attain a 50+ multiple, just saying that there is definitely an opportunity for multiple expansion as long as they demonstrate their ability to impress the market).

**Final Remarks**

I think SEM Rush is an attractive small-cap ($2.9 B market cap) with a large and expanding TAM ($20 B per their S-1) thanks to the likes of tech behemoths Google/Microsoft/Facebook. They continue to innovate with strong product offerings that provide tremendous value to marketers all around the world at a fair price.

Genworth   Financial is an american company specialising in life insurance,   private mortgage insurance (PMI) and mortgage origination.

Yawnsville right. What they do is boring, but also insanely profitable. They have a P/E of 1.7 (current price $3.66).

Now,   that is a low number, so surely they are some sort of new company or  in  serious trouble but it's been around since 1871. So why TF are they   valued so low? In short an analyst vacuum, and the GFC. June '07 it was   priced $35 by Dec '08 it was $0.90 being in the mortgage business then   was uhhh...... a bad time. They owe a large amount of money to AXA and   have some fairly large outstanding debts however these seem acheivable   to pay off (see The Catalyst). THey also have been subject to a four   year long merger aagreement with China Ocenawide, effectively cappign   the shareprice at $5, this has since been cancelled by GNW as CO   couldn't find funding.

In terms of   other major fundamentals they have a book value of $29.89, no you read   it right a PB of 0.12. To give you an idea of how this compare to  other  stocks in the same sector, the average PE is 10.3 and PB is 1.1.

# The Catalyst

GNW   are spinning off thier most successful business unit thier mortgage   company ENACT with an IPO valuation of $3.6B or $24 a share. GNW will   still own \~80% of the company.

Each   GNW share will own 1/4 of an ENACT share or $6, effectively this means   mr market values GNW at less than nothing and even then that'd give  you a  63% upside, to say nothing of the other insane fundamentals.

The IPO filing was a couple of days ago, so this will happen quite soon, however this has already been postponed once in May.

# 2 Stage FCF

FCF   analysis gives a bear case (-5% earnings growth out to 2030) of $10.14   and a bull case (10% growth) of $24.48. Book value as mentioned before   is $29.89 a share. This is not a professional FCF this is what I came  up with as there is very little in the way of analysis on the stock.

# Disclosure

I hold a positon of 553 shares in this stock.

p395ty,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p395ty/fisker_inc_fsr_what_happened_this_week_and_what/,"Fisker Inc, (FSR) What happened this week and what happens next? Short Squeeze Potential?",40,35,2021-08-13 05:19:57," Hey guys,

For those that don't know me, I wrote the original FSR dd (pinned comment has it - thanks automod)   
 In this post I will be going over what happened this week to the FSR share price and what I see happening in the future. I will be sure to keep it short

So first of all the Morgan Stanley PT was released:

"" Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley resumed coverage of Fisker’s stock at the equivalent of a buy rating, setting a 12-month price target of $40, or 122% upside over Tuesday’s share price. He set out a bullish case scenario Price target of $90"". After this, FSR rose 20% in a day. Pretty obvious, right? People see a PT higher than current price and want in.

But then Henrik goes and kills sentiment by announcing a $600 mil convertible notes offering (link in comments) "" $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Green Convertible Senior Notes due 2026""

Now, people straight away see ""offering"" and have flashbacks to every other goddamn company that diluted like shit and messed up all hopes of their share prices rising. But this is actually bullish, contrary to popular belief.

In the words of **Dan Gonzales**, the **Investor Relations officer** for FSR:

"" Hi all. I am seeing some confusion on the board here and I wanted to try to address a couple things: 1) We've been very consistent that the $1 billion FSR raised in the SPAC funded the Ocean program to start of production. That is still the case and we don't want to touch those funds for other projects; 2) As the press release says, purpose of this fund-raising is to fund the PEAR development, and other potential exciting projects; 3) We have great balance sheet now but the time to raise add'l capital is when you can, not when you have to (like Tesla always did); 4) Converts are very standard product and generally include conversion premium. Meaning dilution doesn't happen at current price but something higher. Capped call raises that even more typically; look at other convert annc'ts for example. Just wanted to add some facts and clarification. ""

These are also ""capped call transactions"" What that means is that dilution is reduced either way, worst case scenario is still less than 20%. Also, not being due until 2026 puts faith in FSR's ability to actually produce the PEAR vehicle, which reduces the main bear thesis that FSR will never actually produce a vehicle.

So now that we have the details out of the way, (check the links if you want more info), here is my theory and how I am playing this:

&#x200B;

[Finviz short data as of this morning](https://preview.redd.it/b9qc3349uzg71.png?width=178&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1eda8b35bd9d1dcc3440d2a458744ccc2a15820)

&#x200B;

[Marketbeat quotes 22&#37; short interest as of July 15. Consistent with Finviz 20&#37; yesterday, meaning shorts must be deep](https://preview.redd.it/wngu0iy9uzg71.png?width=516&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d93bff5c54e513964473a99799a7528a8b2177e)

&#x200B;

[15 min chart showing the previous weeks action. Note the massive gap up after PT announcement and the massive red candle before close today. 600 mil offering was the gap down](https://preview.redd.it/81fb7sjbuzg71.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=f174a1ddbf80e5af9a1548be525e80f3d0aab43e)

&#x200B;

Also interesting to note is the following, from Quant Data. If my math is correct, this is roughly 400k dollars in long term bets against Fisker.

&#x200B;

[From just before close. Same time as the massive red candle](https://preview.redd.it/vef4u62fuzg71.png?width=417&format=png&auto=webp&s=957d0db452fac644be574884ac2f6af3ae95b8a5)

It should be obvious what the play is here. SHORT SQUEEZE!!!!! I am not a fan of ""squeeze"" plays as 90% of them are not true squeeze potential. ""Apes"" and ""stick it to the hedgies"" types are what ruined this sub. But this, I believe is potential to make money and thats what I like.

Read my original dd to see my PT of $100 for end of year 2022, or $35 for end of 2021. At a current price that is almost 600% profit on share alone by next year. Adam Jonas seen what I see in this company, announced his PT and then the price pumped. Everyone who was short panicked, Henrik done them a favour by announcing (bullish) news that got misinterpreted as dilution, which stupid traders, theres a lot of them nowadays, decided to sell the news without researching. Shorts seen the opportunity to double down and are now 40% of the float SHORT!

If I had to make a wild guess, I would say they have an average short price of around $17.50, just assuming they were short first time at 19.40 (strong resistance according to crayons and what is resistance anyway, but a place where most sell positions were placed - aka a price heavily shorted at) and short second time at 16.50 down to 15 (the entire fucking red candle before close today)

Assuming anything above 17.50 causes pain for short positions, then it should be interesting to note the open interest on all the calls expiring tomorrow, mainly 18 and 20:

&#x200B;

[Calls on the left and puts on the right. Open interest is the far right number, check out 18 and 20 calls. over 3,000 and 7,000 OI respectively.](https://preview.redd.it/r3ein8iguzg71.png?width=1278&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f1e70839c1e21c613318f7ea950f4863d7655b2)

This research paper titled "" *A Market-Induced Mechanism for Stock Pinning*"" (found on google scholar) essentially states that unusually large OI generally results in pinning to that price by expiry. By that theory, either 18 or 20 should act as a magnet for price all day tomorrow. From the paper: ""**We argue that if the open interest on a particular contract is unusually large, Delta-hedging in aggregate by floor market-makers can impact the stock price and drive it to the strike price of the option**"".

Positions: 500 FSR shares at 15.50 at 5:1 leverage (been in since May, and accumulating since, dollar cost averaging). Price target is $100 by next year, and I will likely keep dipping in and out until then, mainly holding a core position of shares

Tl;dr is the same as always: Read the whole fucking thing you half-assed dimwit, your fucking wife ain't gonna be proud to be married to a bum too lazy to do some actual reading. Like good god, Im handing it to you as it is."

Shorts and Hedgies have been playing around this stock for a long time and Every Retail
Investor was irritated by that, Good results - price down, new deals - price down, positive announcements - price down, how long this could go on… even last night many were skeptical with the expected Good Earnings report by saying - PLTR GOOD EARNINGS = Price Down… such was the mentality of frustrated investors for so long…

Finally, PLTR turned the tables, and the stock price started climbing up. Funny part is : just after the Good Earnings report - shorts were scared and started their bombardment of negative PLTR sentiments on Stockwits by trying to scare the bullish investors. Even when Palantir was at 24$ today - Bears tried to convince all to take the profit and run away 😂 but This time their trick didn’t work…

Couple of months back, $PLTR had touched 40$ line, but then got pulled back, but now with another great earning report and easily achievable guidance value - Palantir is going to Shine on top of all and if retail
Investors realize it’s worth and stay bullish behind it then it can easily cross 40$ again and may be even 50$+ 
Remember, $PLTR is not a meme stock (in a way it can be though, lol) - but a REAL COMPANY WITH AWESOME TRACK RCORD, Good Earnings, Incremental Focussed growth, great management team, Top of the Shelf software company which enables Private as well as Govt / Defense agencies, and it’s a Pioneer in its domain. It’s even considered as one of the top 12 AI companies in the world. So all I can see is Uphill for PLTR

So this is my personal view, and I know many here have similar opinion on it 😇 I’m not against Shorts, but I’m against their practice of scaremongering the retail investors for their own be if it’s Even when the Company is doing Real Good, that’s against the ethics of stocks investment. If a company is doing good then we want to invest there- and not to doom That company by shorting. That practice needs to stop. so I hope tomorrow PLTR  shoots up and teaches the lesson to shorties and it’s price crosses moon, May be even Mars and Beyond 😇🚀🚀🚀

Palantir Metropolis is used by hedge funds, banks, and financial services firms

Palantir Foundry clients include Merck KGaA, Airbus and Ferrari.

Palantir partner Information Warfare Monitor used Palantir software to uncover both the Ghostnet and the Shadow Networks

U.S. civil entities
Palantir's software is used by the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board to detect and investigate fraud and abuse in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Specifically, the Recovery Operations Center (ROC) used Palantir to integrate transactional data with open-source and private data sets that describe the entities receiving stimulus funds. Other clients as of 2019 included Polaris Project, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children,the National Institutes of Health,Team Rubicon,and the United Nations World Food Programme.

In October 2020, Palantir began helping the federal government set up a system that will track the manufacture, distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines across the country.

U.S. military, intelligence, and police	
Palantir Gotham is used by counter-terrorism analysts at offices in the United States Intelligence Community and United States Department of Defense, fraud investigators at the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, and cyber analysts at Information Warfare Monitor (responsible for the GhostNet and the Shadow Network investigation).

Other clients as of 2013 included DHS, NSA, FBI, CDC, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, Special Operations Command, West Point, the Joint IED Defeat Organization and Allies. However, at the time the United States Army continued to use its own data analysis tool.Also, according to TechCrunch, ""The U.S. spy agencies also employed Palantir to connect databases across departments. Before this, most of the databases used by the CIA and FBI were siloed, forcing users to search each database individually. Now everything is linked together using Palantir.""

U.S. military intelligence used the Palantir product to improve their ability to predict locations of improvised explosive devices in its war in Afghanistan. A small number of practitioners reported it to be more useful than the United States Army's program of record, the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS-A). California Congressman Duncan D. Hunter complained of United States Department of Defense obstacles to its wider use in 2012.

Palantir has also been reported to be working with various U.S. police departments, for example accepting a contract in 2013 to help the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center build a controversial license plates database for California. In 2012 New Orleans Police Department partnered with Palantir to create a predictive policing program.

In 2014, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) awarded Palantir a $41 million contract to build and maintain a new intelligence system called Investigative Case Management (ICM) to track personal and criminal records of legal and illegal immigrants. This application has originally been conceived by ICE's office of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), allowing its users access to intelligence platforms maintained by other federal and private law enforcement entities. The system reached its ""final operation capacity"" under the Trump administration in September 2017.[71]

Palantir took over the Pentagon's Project Maven contract in 2019 after Google decided not to continue developing AI unmanned drones used for bombings and intelligence.

International Atomic Energy Agency
Palantir was used by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to verify if Iran was in compliance with the 2015 agreement

Europe	
The firm has contracts relating to patient data from the British National Health Service. It was awarded an emergency, no-competition contract to mine COVID-19 patient data in 2019. In 2020 this was valued at more than £23.5 million and was extended for two more years. The firm was encouraged by Liam Fox “to expand their software business” in Britain.


Partnerships and Contracts::::

International Business Machines	Edit
On February 8, 2021, Palantir and IBM announced a new partnership that would use IBM's hybrid cloud data platform alongside Palantir's operations platform for building applications. The product, Palantir for IBM Cloud Pak for Data, is expected to simplify the process of building and deploying AI-integrated applications with IBM Watson. It will help businesses/users interpret and use large datasets without needing a strong technical background. Palantir for IBM Cloud Pak for Data will be available for general use in March of 2021

Amazon (AWS)	Edit
On March 5, 2021, Palantir announced its partnership with Amazon AWS. Palantir's ERP Suite is now optimized to run on Amazon Web Services. One of the first notable successes of the ERP suite was with BP, which was able to save about $50 million in working capital within two weeks of onboarding the system.

Babylon Health
Palantir took a stake in Babylon Health in June 2021. Ali Parsa told the Financial Times that “nobody” has brought some of the tech that Palantir owns “into the realm of biology and health care.

Palantir Technologies is a public American software company that specializes in big data analytics. Headquartered in Denver, Colorado, it was founded by Peter Thiel, Nathan Gettings, Joe Lonsdale, Stephen Cohen, and Alex Karp in 2003. The company's name is derived from The Lord of the Rings where the magical palantíri were ""seeing-stones,"" described as indestructible balls of crystal used for communication and to see events in other parts of the world.

The company is known for three projects in particular: Palantir Gotham, Palantir Metropolis, and Palantir Foundry. Palantir Gotham is used by counter-terrorism analysts at offices in the United States Intelligence Community (USIC) and United States Department of Defense. In the past, Gotham was used by fraud investigators at the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, a former US federal agency which operated from 2009 to 2015. Gotham was also used by cyber analysts at Information Warfare Monitor, a Canadian public-private venture which operated from 2003 to 2012. Palantir Metropolis is used by hedge funds, banks, and financial services firms. Palantir Foundry is used by corporate clients such as Morgan Stanley, Merck KGaA, Airbus, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV

Palantir's original clients were federal agencies of the USIC. It has since expanded its customer base to serve state and local governments, as well as private companies in the financial and healthcare industries."

Since their decision to focus on private aviation there’s been an increase in private travel for middle aged rich pricks who want to use high speed WiFi on their planes while avoiding “being stuffed into a tube with a bunch of demons” *(Hopefully some of y’all get that reference)* if not, [here](https://youtu.be/vColOxUf-8s?t=120).

*“Health and safety is one of the top reasons that explains the shift from commercial to private travel. According to Vista, the number of touchpoints significantly decreases when flying private, from 700 when flying commercial to 20 interactions with private travel. VistaJet expects the increased number of first-time private flyers to keep growing in 2021 and beyond as travelers continue to look for more safe and reliable flight solutions.”* \- **via Luxury Travel Advisors.** 

Currently we’re sitting at 32.31% SI *(ORTEX DATA)* however, a few other places are showing slightly higher percentages. Now, according to ORTEX there’s about 14.79 million shares that were reported short on Aug 10th. It’s important to note that the 14.79 million shares short were settled on Jul 30th. So there can easily be more positions that may have been opened.

p3469k,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3469k/mttr_update_explosive_avenues_of_potential/,$MTTR Update - Explosive Avenues of Potential,38,24,2021-08-13 01:07:43,"Hello, my fellow ADHD ""day traders"". Together, let's hyperfocus on Matterport. This following DD is my PhD thesis that I've compiled on this stock. If you don't know about Matterport, start off with my [introductory post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ou2ap9/mttr_bringing_3d_photogrammetry_experiences_to/). Also, check out some other bullish sentiment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/owofq2/the_stock_that_mttrs/).

TLDR: Matterport is a software company that enables individuals and enterprise clients to efficiently create digital 3D models of physical locations.

\[The bot isn't letting me post certain links. Gotta remove em\] 

## Let’s Begin With an Analogy:

Amazon started selling books with a *vision* to expand into many products. Matterport is doing something similar. They’re targeting some specific industries such as real estate and a few others. However, the *vision* goes far beyond this.

## Indexing of 3D models:

Matterport’s CEO RJ Pittman (formerly at Google, Apple & eBay) [spoke in 2008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aH6q2NOTFAE) about Google’s plan to index the world’s images. This is the essence of what Matterport is going to do with 3D models. **They’re actively indexing the world’s fastest-growing database of 3D models.** This process will be automated and powered by AI.

Why does this MTTR?

## The Apex

Let’s talk about APEX Imaging Services \[Link blocked by Bot, just google it\]. Apex is [utilizing Matterport’s](https://matterport.com/industries/case-studies/apex-imaging-services-brings-store-experiences-life-3d-site-survey) products to bring 3D building information and visualization to storefronts.

**APEX serves multiple companies such as:**

* **Starbucks**
* **Home Depot**
* **Chipotle**
* **7 Eleven**
* **CVS**
* and even **Chick Filet**

These 3D models enable retailers to take measurements of the store without sending somebody out to do it in person.

Most importantly, the features of these stores are *MASS-SEARCHABLE* because of indexing. With indexed 3D buildings, you can search for every Starbucks that has a 5 sq foot bathroom. Instantly see specific features in stores. Corporate can click a few buttons and get whatever data they need.

**Indexing Applications for Real Estate:** These searchable features carry over to real estate. Want to find an apartment with large closets? Just click a few buttons. I don't actually have any idea if this applies in real estate I just figure that it will.

I mean, after all, newer generations value integrity and honesty in real estate listings. 3D tours enable users to experience a more transparent and honest representation of the space they’re looking into. Many agree that [pictures in real-estate are becoming misleading](https://www.macleans.ca/economy/realestateeconomy/real-estate-photos-are-distorting-reality-frustrating-would-be-home-buyers/).

Not to mention, being able to measure space to see if that couch will fit. It's a real value prop.

## The potential of searchable, indexed, 3D buildings is huge.

Just look at their partnership with Facebook AI. (Search ""Habitat AI Facebook"") 

That’s right. They’re [training AI on 3D datasets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDNamn-mYAQ). Matterport’s ever-expanding database of 3D buildings will fuel AI researchers in the coming years. Not to mention the datasets can be used for training robots in simulation.

This means Matterport could inadvertently accelerate our ascent towards an AI apocalypse. How could you not be bullish?

## Explosive Android Market Potential:

Android Capture is Matterport’s upcoming app which will enable a huge amount of onboarding onto Matterport’s subscription platform. Much of their growth can be attributed to their recent iPhone app, but that's only 20% of smartphone owners.

80% of smartphone owners own an Android device.  Matterport’s stock will pop when they release Android capture. I’m unsure about the specifics of how that'll work, whether it uses traditional photogrammetry, or will be supplemented with user-owned lidar attachments for Android.

## The Team:

>A goal without a plan, is just a wish. And they’ve got a plan.

New hires are coming in from Slice, Grubhub, and other startup companies. Their reliable and quickly growing team is the sole reason they’ll accomplish their plan.

## In-conclusion

Thanks for momentarily skimming through this post that I spent the past hour writing. I’ll continue to post fresh and relevant updates on Matterport as more news comes around.

You’re all probably thinking, “WTF why Crocs? Their clogs are so ugly!” (Ticker: $CROX)

Well, despite the fact that they may have some footwear that isn’t the most attractive, they as a business are doing incredibly well and I’m sure most of you can put your feelings aside if there's some upside potential.

Crocs has had a **very** volatile history as a publicly-traded stock. They nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis back in ‘08 but managed to survive. Their stock price was then pretty range-bound for nearly a decade before finally in the last few years started moving in the right direction.

Then during COVID, they seemed to gain some serious recognition through their support of [healthcare workers](https://www.crocs.com/COVID19-REQUEST.html) with free pairs of Crocs and they’ve continued their [celebrity endorsement](https://www.theindustry.fashion/crocs-sales-soar-on-the-back-of-celebrity-endorsements-and-this-summers-clogs-trend/) marketing campaign where celebrities like Justin Bieber have endorsed their brand.

Google Trends shows a solid uptick in terms of “Crocs” queries since January 2018.

However, regardless of endorsements, PR events, and other things a company does to drive up demand and awareness, what’s most important are the numbers. So let’s take a look at their most recent [earnings report from Q2](https://investors.crocs.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Crocs-Inc.-Reports-Record-Second-Quarter-Revenue-and-Commits-to-Net-Zero-Emissions-by-2030/default.aspx) (Released July 22, 2021):

* Revenue grew **93.3% YoY** (a near double!) and 39% sequentially (QoQ)! That’s a **huge acceleration** from what was already a very strong Q1 report of 63.6% YoY.
* Non-GAAP Net Income **doubled** YoY and maintained the trend of 22% net income margins
* Non-GAAP EPS doubled from a year ago which means **their trailing twelve months of EPS is nearly triple** from what it was a year ago!
* Their shares outstanding also dropped 5% YoY from their accelerated share repurchases program, **so high EPS and share buybacks generally means more share appreciation**
* **Gross Margins increased by 600 basis points QoQ and 700+ basis points YoY to 61.7%,** for some context, 60%+ gross margins is REALLY high, especially for retail. Nike for example has 45.8% gross margins, Lululemon has 57.1% gross margins. Their gross margins have been ticking up since Q1 of last year
* Operating income came in at $195 M which represents **30% operating margins which is really good.** This is the highest operating margin they’ve ever in the past 5 years at leastt (as far as I looked).
* Their Wholesale business is on fire, in the Americas region, it increased **150% YoY** and APAC/EMEA weren’t too shabby at 76.4 and 82.6% respectively
* Their direct-to-consumer business is doing really well too. With Americas revenue going up 128% YoY. Their last 3 quarters of D2C Americas YoY growth were: 80.4%, 131.3% and 128.1%, so the second consecutive quarter of triple digit growth. In addition, what’s really encouraging is that their APAC and EMEA D2C businesses are starting to show some life with APAC which has been struggling since COVID turned out nearly 11% YoY growth and theiR EMEA business is now doing \~30% YoY growth. There is a huge opportunity for Crocs to expand internationally
* From a cash flow perspective, they **generated $212 M in cash flow which is really good seeing how they only generated $30 M last quarter and only $267 M in cash in ALL OF 2020.**
* ***GUIDANCE was 60-70% revenue growth for Q3*** **and 60-65% YoY revenue growth for 2021 which means Q4 will have 35% YoY revenue growth.** Since Crocs has historically beaten their revenue guidance, this means Crocs will stand to grow revenue 70%+ in 2021 and despite a tough comparison in Q4, will still stand to grow revenue by 35%+.

Let’s now talk about what management is thinking:

1. They are going to increase marketing spend and increase it a lot. The goal is to spend 7% of total revenue on marketing in the back half of Q2, which will likely amount to $100+ M assuming they keep up growth figures, this is a HUGE increase from their $28 M in marketing spend in Q1 & Q2 combined.
2. They expect to see strong growth in all regions and in all channels as brand momentum continues.
3. They will have net zero emissions by 2030, so a lot of people who invest in companies, this is a plus for Crocs
4. They expect the strong international growth to continue

Fundamentally, this is a company that just had a very strong Q2 where their stock increased another 10%+ the next day. Remember, this stock is up 100%+ YTD already, so a lot of share price appreciation has been priced in and yet it continues to impress with such strong earnings results.

Assuming Crocs continues to outperform their guidance which they have in the past 4 quarters, Crocs will continue to see big EPS gains which will continue to be a boost for the company’s share price.

As with any stock, there are risks:

1. COVID continues to be a problem and may impact their supply chain
2. They increased their LT debt to $386 M after issuing a $350 M note, this is the highest level of debt they’ve had in the past few years. We’re in a low-interest-rate environment, so this should be fine, but something to monitor
3. Inventories increased to $209 M which is the highest level of inventory the company has had in the past few years. Something to continue to monitor.
4. Their brand momentum may slow down which would slow down sales

I’m long $CROX 🚀🚀🚀

p0z41v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p0z41v/himx_is_a_chip_shortage_play_with_solid_outlook/,HIMX is a chip shortage play with solid outlook,56,24,2021-08-09 18:53:14,"Himax overview:

- Fabless semiconductor company based in Taiwan
- The main product consists of display drivers, basically the chip that runs a computer screen. They also provided the LCoS display for the original Google Glass in 2013, which is why yahoo finance lists it alongside AR plays.
- 2000 employees. More than 90% are engineers. 3000 patents.
- Market cap: $2.4B
- Share price: $13.92
- PE (ttm): 11.0
- Forward PE (for 2022): 8.6, but this assumes that the chip shortage is over in 2022

The automotive chip shortage was rather prominent in the news a few months ago but is still ongoing. The shortage is specifically due to the lack of display drivers. Himax controls 30% of the global market share for automotive display drivers. They expect the situation to be dire until 2023: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-tiny-1-chip-that-is-behind-record-price-increases-for-computers-11623958037

Being fabless is not an issue as we can see from the EPS history:

- Q2 2020: $0.01
- Q3 2020: $0.07
- Q4 2020: $0.20
- Q1 2021: $0.38
- Q2 2021: $0.62 

And they expect up to $0.81 ($0.69 non-GAAP) for Q3. The EPS growth is due to higher gross margins, from 20% to almost 50% in a year. (Due to the shortage, they cannot exactly grow by selling more. They are selling everything they have.) These margins are not solely due to the chip shortage but also by focusing on more lucrative segments, e.g. tablets instead of smartphones. They have 60% market share for non-iOS tablet TDDIs. TDDI is a combination of display driver and touch controller, so you only need one chip instead of two to get a touch screen.

The last big share price movement was after the Q4 2020 results. It has been oscillating ever since. Even the Q2 earnings beat and the excellent guidance had zero effect on the share price. To put things into perspective, the latest EPS of AMD were $0.63 and the AMD share price is $110. So Himax has some room to run. It will most likely overtake AMD in terms of EPS in the next quarter. They serve different markets though, so the standards are a bit different.

Competitors:

- Samsung. PE of 17 and there is no room for growth anyway. Is a customer of Himax for tablet TDDIs.
- Novatek. Only traded in Taiwan. PE of 15. Five times the market cap of Himax but extremely similar overall. Share price is 10% up since announcing their earnings a week ago.
- SiliconWorks / LX Semicon. Only traded in South Korea. Market cap of $1.76B. PE might be around 18.
- Raydium. Only traded in Taiwan. I have no idea about their financial situation because IR is not in English.
- Synaptics. PE of 20. They just beat earnings and went up 16.5%. 

Both Novatek and Synaptics went up quite a bit after their earnings and both are less profitable than Himax. The chip shortage affects them pretty much in the same way, so we can see that Himax is a safer deal than its peers.

Why Himax will likely remain very profitable after the chip shortage is resolved:

- There is a shift in demand towards segments with high margins. Higher resolution and higher refresh rates require more complex chips which can be sold for more. In the grand scheme of things, these chips are still very cheap (around $1 per chip) so display manufacturers are willing to pay a dollar extra if they can sell their 240 Hz 8K TV for an extra $1000.
- Their TDDI technology is a clear winner in the automotive segment. They say ""The number of awarded projects is already in the dozens and still growing quickly as we speak. We expect the [automotive] TDDI volume to expand exponentially starting from this quarter."" Their overall automotive market share is increasing. So even if they have to sell each chip for less after the shortage, they can make up for it in volume. They are fabless and their biggest fixed cost are the employees, so by selling more they can keep up the profits. 
- Electric vehicles typically come with more displays than ICE vehicles, so the overall demand is getting larger as well.

It is not even clear whether the shortage will be resolved any time soon. Work-from-home demand will probably go down, but then again the demand shifts towards more sophisticated displays with increased resolution and refresh rates. A chip that handles 240 Hz refresh rate is bigger than a 60 Hz chip. And the total foundry capacity is still limited. From the earnings call: 

- ""Some design requires more sophisticated design, i.e., larger IC per panel. So we believe the demand in terms of wafer area will increase. We actually, based on internal estimates, [believe] the supply can actually decrease somehow.""
- ""The fact is that the industry, overall, there is simply no new major capacity expansion this year and next year or even second half 2023""

It's my first post here on this. But who really cares. You retards only want that sweet DD right? So here I go.

Crocs (CROX) has been booming like crazy since the pandemic and the stock price has gone through the moon. But did you know that it still can go to Mars. Hold you horses. I know your dick is getting hard but bear with me.

Crocs is shoe company that consists of brands such as ""Clogs"", ""Sandals"", ""Jibbitz charms"", and ""LiteRite"". The vast majority of Crocs shoes features Croslite material, a proprietary technology that makes users feel comfortable in their shoes. And people, especially these poor Gen Z and millennials buy these products like there is no tomorrow.

Crocs has been partnering up with celebrities such as Justin Bieber and most of these collaboration products are sold out.

Andrew Rees joined Crocs as President in June 2014 and became CEO and joined the Board of Directors in June 2017. He is just the CEO I am looking for. This guy knows the company's operating and culture. He has more than 25 years of experience in the footwear and retail industry. Prior to Crocs, he served as Managing Director of L.E.K Consulting in Boston where he founded and led the firm's Retail and Consumer Products Practice for 13 years. While at L.E.K, Rees served as a consultant for Crocs from 2013 to 2014, supporting the development and execution of the company's strategic growth plan.

p0esdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p0esdp/do_hedge_funds_beat_the_market_i_analyzed_the/,Do Hedge Funds beat the market? - I analyzed the performance of 5000+ Hedge Funds over the past 24 years and benchmarked it against SP500. Here are the results!,928,207,2021-08-08 21:37:39,"Hey Everyone, it's u/nobjos back with this week's analysis!  

**Preamble**

Hedge Funds are a controversial breed of companies. On one hand, you have [Michael Burry’s Scion Capital returning 489%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry) shorting the housing market and on the other hand, you have [Melvin Capital losing 53%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze#Losses_by_short_sellers) of its investment value in 1 month following them shorting GameStop. Adding to this, most hedge funds have an eye-watering 2 and 20 fee structure -> What this means is that they will take 2% of your investment value and 20% of your profits every year as management fees \[1\].

Even with these significant risk factors and hefty fees, the total assets managed by Hedge Funds have grown year on year and is [now over $3.8 Trillion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271771/assets-of-the-hedge-funds-worldwide/#:~:text=Assets%20under%20management%20of%20hedge%20funds%20worldwide%201997%2D2020&text=In%202020%2C%20the%20value%20reached,managers%20in%20the%20United%20States.). Given that you need to be an institutional or accredited investor to invest directly in a hedge fund \[2\], it begs the question

**Do Hedge funds beat the market?**

**Data**

The individual performance data of hedge funds are extremely hard to get \[3\]. For this analysis, I would be using the Barclay Hedge Fund Index that calculates the average return \[4\] of 5,878 Hedge Funds. The data is available from 1997.

This dataset was also used by [American Enterprise Institute in their analysis](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/the-sp-500-index-out-performed-hedge-funds-over-the-last-10-years-and-it-wasnt-even-close/), so the data must be accurate. All the data used in this analysis is shared as a Google sheet at the end.

**Result**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/rrgu9o8705g71.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=781036d4ac5a896c8ed5bf391b623255f1f5898a)

S&P500 has beaten the hedge funds summarily with it returning a whopping 222% more than the hedge fund over the last 24 years \[5\]. This difference becomes even more drastic if you consider the last 10 years. During 2011-2020, SPY has returned 265% vs the average hedge fund returns of just 60%.

This awesome visualization by AEI shows the enormous difference in returns over the last 10 years.

[ ](https://i.redd.it/32eyi1hb05g71.gif)

If you are wondering about the impact of this on the average investor (who will not be able to invest in a Hedge fund due to the stringent capital requirements), these above returns correlate directly with the returns of [Fund of Funds (FOF)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundsoffunds.asp). FOFs usually invest in a wide variety of Hedge funds and do not have the capital requirements required by a normal Hedge fund so that anyone can invest in it.

The catch here is that you will be paying the management fee for both FOFs as well as the Hedge Funds. This implies that your net return would be even lower than directly investing in the Hedge Fund. This becomes apparent as if you consider the last 24 years, on average FOFs (Barclay Fund of Funds index), returned 233.1% (\~390% less than avg Hedge Fund) vs SPY returning 846%!

**Warren Buffet’s take of Hedge Funds**

In 2007, Warren Buffet had entered into a famous bet that an unmanaged, low-cost S&P 500 stock index fund would out-perform an actively managed group of high-cost hedge funds over the ten-year period from 2008 to 2017 when performance was measured net of fees, costs, and expenses. The result was similar to the above with S&P 500 beating all the actively managed funds by a significant margin. This is what he wrote to the investors in his annual letter

>A number of smart people are involved in running hedge funds. But to a great extent their efforts are self-neutralizing, and their IQ will not overcome the costs they impose on investors. Investors, on average and over time, will do better with a low-cost index fund than with a group of funds of funds.

Performance comes, performance goes. Fees never falter

While I don’t completely agree with this view that it’s impossible for Hedge Funds to beat the market (The famous [Medallion Fund of Renaissance Technologies](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/medallion-fund/) \[6\] have returned 39% annualized returns (net of fees) compared to S&P 500‘s \~8% annualized returns over the last 30 years). But, it seems that on average Hedge Funds do return lesser than the stock market benchmark!

**An alternative view**

It would be now easy to conclude now that Hedge funds are pointless and the people who invest them in at not savvy investors. But,

[ ](https://i.redd.it/hoiy89zc05g71.gif)

Given that the investors who invest in Hedge Funds usually are high net worth individuals having their own Financial Advisors or Pension Funds having teams of analysts evaluating their investments, why would they still invest in Hedge Funds that have considerably lesser returns than SPY?

The answer lies in [diversification and risk mitigation](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/121003.asp).

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/gre25fff05g71.png?width=1020&format=png&auto=webp&s=66cda7571f6f8a3ffe63e9f6ea12d2700523fc83)

The above chart showcases the performance comparison between S&P 500 and Hedge Fund over the last two decades. We know that SPY had outperformed the hedge funds. But what is interesting is what happens during market crashes.

In the 2000-2002 period where the market consistently had negative returns (Dotcom bubble) in the range of -10 to -22%, hedge funds were still net positive. Even in the 2008 Financial crisis, the difference in losses between SPY and hedge funds was a staggering 15%.

This chart also showcases the important fact that most hedge funds are actually hedged pretty well in reality \[7\]. We only usually hear about outliers such as Michael Burry’s insane bet or how Bill Hwang of Archegos Capital lost $20B in two days which biases our entire outlook about hedge funds. To put this in perspective, over the period from January 1994 to March 2021, volatility (annualized standard deviation) of the S&P 500 was about 14.9% while the volatility of the aggregated hedge funds was only about 6.79% \[8\].

While you and I might care about the extra returns of SPY, I guess when you have 100’s of Millions of dollars, it becomes more important to conserve your funds rather than to chase a few extra percentage points of returns in SPY.

**Conclusion**

I started off the analysis with the expectation that Hedge Funds would easily be beating the market so as to justify their exorbitant fee structure. As we can see from the analysis, on average they don’t beat the market but provide sophisticated methods of diversification for big funds and HNI’s.

Even if you want some effective diversification, it would be much better to invest directly with established hedge funds rather than going for Fund of Funds as with the latter, most of your returns would be taken by the two-tiered fee structure.

What this means for the average investor is that in almost all cases, you would get a better return on your investment over the long run by just investing in a low-cost index fund. Replicating what pension funds and HNI’s do might not be the best strategy for your portfolio.

Google sheet containing all the data used in this analysis: [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nOQPyHdRNaRSv-c04iBRndvsgMDP78uSLKbxMwGWkeo/edit?usp=sharing)

**Footnotes**

\[1\] To signify the impact of this fee, let’s take the following e.g. if you invest $100K into a hedge fund and at the end of the year, your fund grows to $120K, they would charge you $2K (2%) + $4K (20% of the profit) for a total of $6K. Even if they lose money, they will still charge you $2K for managing your money. Vanguard SP500 ETF would charge you $30 for the same!

\[2\] Minimum initial investments for hedge funds usually range from $100,000 to $2 million and you can only withdraw funds when you’ve invested a certain amount of money during specified times of the year. You also need to have a minimum net worth of $1 million and your annual income should amount to more than $200,000.

\[3\] Barclayhedge provides data for the performance of individual hedge funds but it costs somewhere between $10-30K. I like you guys, but not that much :P!

\[4\] The returns are average not weighted average based on the asset under management so it’s representative of the individual returns of the Hedge funds and does not bias the analysis due to the size of the Hedge Fund.

\[5\] Please note that the SPY returns are not net of fees. But this would be inconsequential as a low-cost Vanguard index fund has fees as low as 0.03%. The returns shown for hedge funds are net of fees.

\[6\] To put the performance of Medallion Fund in perspective (its considered as the greatest money-making machine of all time), $1 invested in the Medallion Fund from 1988-2018 would have grown to over $20,000 (net of fees) while $1 invested in the S&P 500 would have only grown to $20 over the same time period. Even a $1 investment in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway would have *only* grown to $100 during this time.

\[7\] For e.g., some hedge funds by inexpensive long-dated put options that hedges against a sudden market downturn. While this would ultimately make their net return lower in a bull market, in case of a huge crash, they would still be positive. [This](https://thehedgefundjournal.com/fat-tails/) article discusses more on fat tail risks in the market and how hedging is done.

\[8\] The volatility is calculated using [Credit Suisse Hedge Fund Index](https://lab.credit-suisse.com/#/en/index/HEDG/HEDG/performance).

Coinbase and Robinhood have been two popular stonks on here and in the media recently. Putting all the politics aside how do they compare?

**COIN VS HOOD The Facts**

Coinbase and Robinhood have both IPO’d within the last twelve months, both operate in a similar space and compete against each other in some segments.

**Market Cap**

COIN: $52B HOOD: $45B

**Active Customers**

COIN: 56M HOOD:18M

**Revenues**

COIN: $2.885B HOOD: $1.353B

**Net Income**

COIN: $1.061B HOOD: -$1.384B

**Coinbase Overview**

Coinbase is one of the go-to platforms for people wanting to invest in \*Bullcrap coins\* the easy way. Coinbaes was one of the first platforms to make \*Shitty Coins\*\* easy for people to buy and sell. The previous method prior to Coinbase involved terminal commands and remembering lengthy codes. A slide from one of the companies pitch decks illustrates this perfectly.

The company generates revenue via fees it charges on trades, maker and taker fees, interchange fees, interest on cash, sales of software tools, interest from personal loans, and more. This is thought to expand over time to include new services such as the Coinbase card, Coinbase Pro, etc.

**Robinhood Overview**

Robinhood is an online discount brokerage that offers a commission-free investing and trading platform. Robinhood went public at $38 a share, giving it a valuation of $32 billion. The shares are listed under the ticker “HOOD” on the Nasdaq.

Before Robinhood, anyone who wanted to invest in stocks would be charged between $5 to $10 a trade. They also needed to invest a minimum of $500 to open an account.

The company gets the vast majority of revenue from payment for order flow. The company similar to Coinbase also offer a Pro tier, cash management accounts. Buying and selling of fractional shares, options and \*Coins. In theory, Robinhood competes in the same space as Coinbase however, their offering is centred around share buying and selling.

It is also interesting to note in the company IPO filing to the SEC mentions in the future it hopes to become the most trusted, lowest cost, and culturally relevant **money app**. The term money app is interesting as it indicates that potentially Robinhood sees itself as more than an online broking business. However, it’s hard to pinpoint exactly what is meant by this.

The SEC in June said that it was conducting a broad examination of market structure, including payment for order flow. Robinhood said in its S-1 that an SEC ban of this practice would pose a “risk” to its business model.

**COIN VS HOOD Revenues**

Coinbase makes over 2.2x the amount of revenue that Robinhood makes. Coinbase also appears to be growing revenues faster than Robinhood, hood delivered a 55% increase between 31/12/20 to LTM whilst in comparison, COIN has delivered an outstanding 133% increase in revenues in the same comparable period.

**COIN VS HOOD Profits**

Whilst the two companies are growing revenues at significant rates, the Net Income tells a very different story. Coinbase stock seems to have been able to grow Net Income in line with their revenue, whilst HOOD seems to have cost’s ballooning out of control. [Graph](https://prophet-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-21.png)

In regards to the additional costs, Robinhood offered the below explanation in their prospectus documents

* Our total revenue grew 309% to $522 million, up from $128 million;
* We recorded net loss of $1.4 billion, which included a $1.5 billion fair value adjustment to our convertible notes and warrant liability, compared to a net loss of $53 million;
* Our Adjusted EBITDA was $115 million, compared to negative $47 million

**Google Search Traffic Overtime**

In comparison with the amount of Google Search traffic, the two companies seem to have had similar baseline search traffic worldwide for the previous 12 months. There are a few comparable spikes for each of the companies. The Traffic in the US slightly favours Robinhood. It’s important to note that Robinhood is a US-only platform at the present time. This may give additional growth in the future.

**Robinhood Vs Coinbase: Prophets Take**

It’s important to note that Robinhood is a US-only platform at the present time. This may give additional growth in the future. This is compared to Coinbase who offers its product to 100+ countries at the moment including other large markets such as Asian and European countries. There is also at the present in our opinion a heightened regulatory risk with Coinbase shares due to the perceived nature of \*Coins\* by governments. However, hopefully, this perception shifts over time.

Robinhood has also mentioned already that it plans to expand internationally, focusing on Europe and Asia.

We believe the competition between online discount brokers makes it hard for Robinhood Stock to generate excessive gross profits. However, over time we believe a similar circumstance will occur with Coinbase as discount \*Coin\* brokers are introduced to the market.


TLDR:
HOOD is valued similar to COIN. Yet as we know It’s pure dog crap. This breaks down the numbers between the two and shows why. If you care"
p01fg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p01fg4/clov_fails_to_deliver_yet_again/,CLOV FAILS TO DELIVER YET AGAIN,557,216,2021-08-08 05:08:23," 

A lot of us were shocked about the 19 million Fails-to-Deliver that were exposed on our last bi-weekly report, but not the GHOST! I have recognized patterns, since late May and have felt compelled to show my findings in the past. I know the overall feeling within this sub went from ""when lambo"", to ""is a squeeze still in play???"" Well I'm here to tell you, squeeze or not, CLOV is a fucking winner in the long haul, but also yes a SQUEEZE is most certainly still in play!

* First things first, yes dark pools are real.
* Yes HF'S buy on dark pools, and yes they sell on the LIT markets.
* Yes this absolutely has an negative overall affect when it comes to CLOV's current price per share!
* Yes eventually, this will cause a SQUEEZE. How much of a SQUEEZE, is anyone's guess!

**My Rinse and Repeat theory has been discussed in the past, but lets recap.**

*Every other week*, prior to the reports being made public, we have seen a trend. CLOV turns green, before eventually losing its steam mid week. Then Fridays close happens to fall short of MAX PAIN (Where the highest amount of *IN THE MONEY CALLS* lie).

The report from fintel referenced in the above link is released on or around the 2nd and the 17th of every month. The data provided from fintel I will focus on is Fails-to-Deliver (FTD). This data is extremely delayed for us as is. Therefore it's impossible to figure out exactly where we are today! IMO, this is not by accident. FTD has a major role when it comes to short squeezes!

&#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ao55tpyu20g71.jpg?width=1252&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a59a71120a4205f786613803bddcca71cb4d0e4)

* The most recent report came out on 8/2, and covers FTD up to 7/14. Now I asked the question in my last post, *""Are FAILS-TO-DELIVER why we saw a jump on 7/12th?""* Now based on our most current report, released on 8/2, the answer is as simple as YES! But I'll break it down on how we come to this conclusion.
* The Fails to deliver reported on **fintel** for Friday, **July 9th** totalled **12,701,181**. The price per share they have listed is **9.36**.
* **9.36** is what Thursday, **July 8th's** price was at close. This means we can assume the **12.7+** million shares reported on July 9th, is in fact, how many shares were considered Fails-to-Deliver at the July 9th's OPEN.
* Come monday, the **12th of JULY**, the **FTD** were reduced to **11,461,074**. The price per share they have listed is **9.27**.
* Again, we can assume 11.4 million shares were considered FTD at the **OPEN** of Monday, **July 12th**. Friday, the **9th** of **JULY,** had a closing price of **9.27**.
* This brings me to the conclusion of my question above! Are fails to deliver why we saw a jump on the **12th of July**!? YOU GOT DAM RIGHT!!!
* CLOV closed **July** **12th** with a price per share of **9.68**. The reports issued by fintel for whatever reason skip the **13th of JULY**!?!?!?!?!?!?! See for yourself below!
* The price showing for **7/14 is 8.91**. Which is the price at close on 7/13! The FTD reported is 141,301??? They covered over **11,319,773** shares between Monday the **12th** and Tuesday the **13th**, which just so happens to be missing from fintel???

&#x200B;

 

WHY IS 7/13 MISSING???

LETS DISREGARD THE MISSING DAY FOR A MOMENT!!! (I know this will be hard to move past, but please carry on).

Here's the deal. If you look above at this image you will see yet another trend when it comes to the timing they reduce their shares shorted!!! Its clear!!!

1. HF's used to be able to reduce the Fails-to-Deliver in a day or two!
2. As HF's continue to rinse and repeat when it comes to FTD, they are in need of two things to occur.
3. First HF's need to purchase shares, in order to return shares to MM'S, so they can reduce the number of FTD. If they don't purchase shares over time, they risk momentum taking over!
4. Next they have to follow up with shorting the stock all over again in order to suppress the stock price, which in turn ends up adding back to the total FTD!
5. Remember T-3. (HF's have 3 days to return these naked shorts to avoid a penalty, and they must also keep calls *OUT OF THE MONEY* in order to refrain a gamma squeeze!
6. It isn't working. The FTD are reaching highs every other week before they reduce them prior to reporting. (19 million last report, and 5 million the report prior)
7. Hf's used to reduce them on a Monday. Then they had to reduce the FTD on a Monday and Tuesday, or momentum was getting out of hand. Which makes it harder for them to suppress the stock price by the upcoming FRIDAY.
8. The report before last showed HF's were purchasing shares in order to reduce FTD over the course of 3. (Listed Below). Followed by four days in mid JULY!!! (which is also listed below).
9. WHY is this!?!?!? Because CLOVigilantes are not letting up! We keep BUYING to Down Cost Average (DCA), and HODLING for the SQUEEZE...

Here's the TREND:

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/xpb256nm30g71.jpg?width=1372&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bdc992509442b08c1081ba60f477d5e3cfb64f92)

* 6/28 over 5.6 million shares reported as FTD.
* 6/29 over 2.2 million shares reported as FTD.
* 6/30 over 1.78 million shares reported as FTD. (Last day reported prior to the most current report made public on 8/2). Remember they want to make it look like the SQUEEZE is a dying trend!

The most current report issued, shows the same trend! but instead of 3 days in a row, they were forced to lower the FTD 5 days in a row prior to the bi-weekly cycle! THIS IS PROOF they are in some serious shit!

* 7/08 over 19 million shares reported as FTD.
* 7/09 over 12.7 million shares reported as FTD.
* 7/12 over 11.7 million shares reported as FTD.
* 7/13 (missing) for whatever reason?!?!?
* 7/14 (Last day the bi-weekly report ends) ONLY 141,301 shares that qualify as FTD???

Lets break this down for a moment! The reports come out bi-weekly! They continue to reduce the FTD on the last week prior to the report being made public. My last DD shows this pattern has occurred not Just in July, but also late May, as well as all of June! Thats 4 reports consecutively! Is your jaw dropping yet!?

What can we assume will happen in MID-August!?

* The report made public will happen around the 17th of August.
* It will give us an update on what took place when it comes to FTD to close out July!

What can we assume will happen in early September?

* The reports made public that will show us the first half of August, will come out on the 2nd.
* This will give us data to analyze the FTD that is occuring as of the beginning of this current month all the way until Aug 14th.

Based upon the discussed theory discovered by THE GHOST in regards to the cycle of Rinse and Repeat, HF's are strategically reducing FTD to make it appear that our SQUEEZE is a dying trend as reports are made public. But as we have seen in the past, every report shows what?!?!?! MORE FTD at one point during the most current 2 week cycle, than what was reported in the previous two week cycle!

I'LL REPEAT IT ONCE MORE!

* Current report (released 8/2) shows a high of over 19 million FTD!
* Report prior (released 7/17) showed us a high of over 5 million FTD! (THIS IS ALMOST QUADRUPLE)!

If HF's were actually covering their short positions, we would see the following!

* HF's wouldn't continue to ladder attack us Thursday and Friday, in turn having a ton of calls expiring worthless! (Remember they make money when RETARDED APES YOLO CALLS that expire worthless. No GAMMA SQUEEZE will occur without *in the money* calls on FRIDAYS!
* We would not see reports with the number of FAILS-TO-DELIVER higher and higher throughout the 2 week cycles!

The pattern shows that come next monday 8/9 through 8/11 they will do the same! HF's will simply purchase shares, in order to return the shares to MM'S, in order to reduce the Fails-To-Deliver, in order to make it appear they are backing off yet again! How many fucking times will we see this happen, before we all understand, this is a tactic HF's are using!?!?!

Well guess what!!! This time it's a bit different isn't it!?!?!? One word!!! **EARNINGS**!!!

Now try to keep up right here.

Instead of CLOV releasing earnings in the beginning of a 2 week cycle, 8/16th, which happens to be on a MONDAY at that. This EPIC management team has decided to have their earnings call on a wednesday, prior to the end of a 2 week cycle!

I completely understand CLOV didn't ""technically"" move up their earnings call!!! The first time they made an official release was on July 15th. But the reason why 8/16 was the projected earnings date, was based upon the timing! Companies usually give earnings calls exactly 3 months apart! The fact that their last earnings call was on a monday the 17th of May, this made sense that the closest Monday 3 months later would be on 8/16! This is why the estimated earnings call was dated on 8/16 according to yahoo finance, nasdaq, etc...

You think members on CLOV's team don't remember what happen last earnings call!? You think they don't see the same trend we see every thursday and friday!?!?!? Of course they do! Everything you do, when you have a publicly traded company, is calculated by all means! They have something up their sleeve this earnings call, and they are daring HF's to try and ladder attack this shit Thursday, the day after earnings and Friday to end the week!

So many people want more from management when it comes to CLOV!

* First we got a detailed line by line explanation from **CLOV** in response to Hindenburg!
* Next we got news about expanding to over 101 counties!
* They brought on new members to their team from UBER, UNH, and GOOGLE!
* Then we got news about the warrants!
* They followed up with the FL expansion regarding primary care physicians and their partnership with **VALUEH.**
* They are purposely releasing news aka catalysts to make it increasingly hard for HF's to continue their malicious attacks!
* The only things that have changed since their first squeeze to 28, is positive changes when it comes to their team, their expansions, and when it comes to dilution of their shares, they did the exact opposite!

Now we should get our normal push on Monday and Tuesday the 9th and 10th of August. This could even run to Wednesday to be honest. This will become an even bigger problem for HF'S! During the earnings call CLOV may drop the name of their NEW CFO. Or maybe they touch up on their vision of at home care. Or maybe they have news to report about their DCE, I mean it does say COMING SOON on their website! I mean maybe CLOV improved their margins per client due to the slow down of COVID during the second quarter. All I know is one thing! If I was a HF, I cant ""plan"" to short attack on thursday and friday after earnings! It might work out that HF's can, but you cant ""plan"" on doing so!

Therefore it might be time for HF's to reverse course and start going LONG!

REGARDLESS OF EVERYTHING ABOVE!

PLEASE DO ME A FAVOR, AND SHUT THE FUCK UP WITH ""WHY DON'T THEY DO SOMETHING, COME ON CHAMATH SEND A TWEET OR SOMETHING, OUR MANAGEMENT HAS DONE NOTHING!!!""

To insinuate that CLOV has done nothing to combat what is taking place right in front of us, is the epitome of FUD, and shear ignorance.

Most of us in CLOV have legit been invested since MAY or JUNE when the price was over 20! Since when do you purchase shares at an all time high, and expect to see an increase in unrealized gain within 3 months!?!?!?

If you can't sit back and enjoy the ride, I got news for you. Stocks are impossible to time, let alone LIFE! So BUCK the FUCK up and know what you hold! Do some DD and find your conviction!

I'M JUST SAYING! This sub needs to stay positive, and if you find it hard to stay positive during the shit show thats infront of us, then don't post or comment, and take a day off from the SUB! What we need is positive energy! And although I expressed some energy above that can and will be considered negative, please don't misconstrue my PASSION as negativity! I am extremely PASSIONATE when it comes to CLOV! You should be too!!!

The way I see it is simple. Come MARCH of 2022, they will release their 4th quarter earnings of this year! This is after open enrollment occurs, where we will see an increase in patients. Then we have our expansion with physicians in FL with VALUE H! Not to mention, the amount of counties CLOV's services will be offered in, will be double the amount it was this year. By March of 2022, the 4th quarter results in itself should give you the comfort knowing you invested in a growth company, that is doing just that! GROWING!!!! Remember, maybe the squeeze got you here, and although it hasn't happened *yet*, CLOV is in a phenomenal spot!

As always, do your own DD and remember everything written above was based upon theories! This post is not to be taken as FINANCIAL ADVICE. I have no financial background, Nothing I said was to instruct nor convince you to purchase, hold, or sell anything related to stocks or calls when it comes to CLOV!

Can someone tell me why the fuck fintel chose not to report JULY 13th at a time the most Falis-To-Deliver were reduced in one day!?!?!?!?"

**This is not one of those times.**

As some of you already know, VIAC flew 7% today after a fantastic earnings report that blew the doors off nearly every metric. I know what you're thinking: welp, missed the boat on another one. And yes everyone, I'm the guy who posted the [10k earnings FD Yolo](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oxalfx/preearnings_10k_viac_fd_yolo/) couple days ago (sold those today and rolled them into LEAPS). Today was a GOOD day - aside from forgetting to screenshot BEFORE I sold for once in my damn life, typically I do the opposite and then never actually sell and lose all of it.

But this party is literally just getting started.

On Monday, Discovery (DISCA) [drilled](https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Discovery-Q2-Earnings-Snapshot-16359685.php) to the center of the earth off of strong earnings but dismal growth numbers, **falling 6%** and taking Viacom (which trades similarly to Discovery) along with it on the ride down. Ever since the Archegos collapse (more on that later but all of you know the Bull Hwang story by now), algos have undeservedly tied these two tickers at the hip. Subtract that undeserved 6% from today's 7% gain, and it pretty much cancels out: VIAC is **basically only up 1% off** of a truly fantastic earnings report. In fact, this stock was literally higher as recently as a week ago - and that's when earnings were a huge question mark, but no longer. For once, fellow apes would be getting in on the **GROUND FLOOR**.

**Q2 Earnings Highlights** (Don't feel compelled to read this part if you don't want to, TL;DR: they knocked it out of the park)

* Revenue: 6.56B (est 6.52B)
* Adj EPS: 0.97 (est 0.96)
* \+6.5M streaming subscribers (42M total between P+, Showtime etc)
* \+2.8M PlutoTV MAUs (52.3M total)
* \+45% watch time per user  (Roku's decreased)
* \+24% ad revenue yoy
* \+9% affiliate revenue yoy
* \+92% (!) streaming revenue yoy
* Paramount+ [officially launched in Europe](https://variety.com/2021/streaming/global/viacomcbs-sky-paramount-plus-europe-launch-1235035254/), expands in South America
* In this market you really need to pitch a perfect game to not get sold off on earnings. This was a clean sweep across the board: Viacom, priced like a value stock, just blew out all the growth stocks in growth metrics (looking at you Roku). And the best is yet to come (more on this later)

Ok let's review what Viacom even does for those who don't know. If you do know, skip this next part.

**1.** **The Business**

&#x200B;

[If you haven't watched something made by one of these brands there's just simply no way you live in America. ](https://preview.redd.it/k1j6my9sxmf71.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=69242a8e76eea2ce69f669d9d46ead5a9c0988cb)

Viacom basically owns every single TV channel you retards grew up watching. Nickelodeon, MTV, VH1, Comedy Central - from our childhood cartoons at Nickelodeon to the greatest comedy sketch show of all time (Chapelle's Show - no debate) to the shitty reality shows of the 2000's (Jersey Shore): Viacom owns ALL of it. It also owns Showtime which makes Billions, the unofficial TV show of WSB.

In a day and age where streaming content is at a premium, Viacom is sitting on an absolute TREASURE CHEST of content.

**How They Make Money**

* Advertising - Good old fashioned TV ads during programming (both traditional and streaming)
* Affiliate - The cut Viacom gets from the boomer retards who still pay their provider for cable TV
* Streaming Subscriptions - the 5 or 10 dollars a month from Paramount+ / Showtime
* Theatrical Releases - Did you know a Quiet Place 2 (made by Paramount) is the third highest grossing movie of the year behind Fast 9 and Black Widow? And cost a fraction of those to make? But yes, people still buy tickets to see movies (just ask the AMC apes, they know what's up).
* Licensing - Viacom doesn't keep all the content they make, they also license it out to others for LOTS of money. Much like a pimp that whores out prostitutes instead of keeping them all for his own sexual desires, VIAC is all about licensing money. HBO paid them half a BILLION for South Park. Amazon paid them 150 million for Coming 2 America, one of the shittiest sequels to a classic of all time. And as Netflix, Amazon, Apple all fight for content, fees are only going to go up. And all that money goes right back into fueling Viacom's sleeping giant: Paramount+

**Paramount Plus**

Even total retards know that traditional TV as we know is dying. Gone are the days where the whole family gathers around the tube to watch Modern Family at 9pm - these days everyone is on their own schedule, they mostly get their shows through streaming apps when they want it. More and more families are cutting the cable cord, opting instead to go with streaming apps like Netflix, Disney+, Amazon - with varying degrees of success. Streaming is the future - nothing new here.

Paramount+ is the brand spanking new streaming app that Viacom is banking on to contend with the big boys. The market has basically valued this venture at fucking zero - and you know what that was somewhat understandable: it's a crowded industry, the app hadn't existed for even a full quarter yet, the street wanted to take a ""wait and see"" approach.

Welp, Paramount just blew the fucking doors off all projections for their first full quarter and put to rest any doubts about the viability of the app. Between Paramount (and premium cable sister app Showtime), Viacom now has 42 million users, up from 36 when they last reported. And the biggest catalysts for growth are still yet to come!

Anyways, back to live TV's alleged slow death. There is one MAJOR exception to this. Sports. While we can catch our Billions episode on Tuesday night because we missed it Sunday and have basically the same experience, there is nothing more useless than a rerun of a sporting event. We need that shit LIVE, and it's basically the only kind of TV that has to be.

**Are you ready for some football?**

Did you know that the NFL accounted for 71 of the top 100 most watched live broadcasts in 2020? That's almost 75 fucking percent! In fact the NFL was responsible for $4 billion+ ad revenue for host networks in 2020 - and guess who just extended their NFL deal? When fall rolls around, P+ signups are going to fucking FLY as the CBS team broadcasts every AFC matchup this year, conveniently located in some top TV markets - Kansas City, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, and New England are all AFC / ViacomCBS territory, and all happy to look pretty decent this year unlike NFC teams New Orleans, Atlanta, and Chicago (but i'll save this convo for r/NFL).

Oh yeah, ViacomCBS also has the SEC college football rights too, the only conference in college football that even matters these days. American Football not your thing? They got the rights to real futbol too, including UEFA Champions league soccer and Serie A. More of a hoops guy? Guess who has the exclusive rights to March Madness. More of a boomer? Guess who has the PGA Tour.

With over 1000 live sporting events a year, Paramount Plus may actually be the most complete sports streaming app out there, surpassing even ESPN.

**Boomers still watch TV**

If you're reading this, take a moment to wipe the jizz off your pants from Viacom's sporting dominance as we review their more traditional businesses and check out some of these stats.

&#x200B;

[Wait, you mean to tell me ONE company has the top THREE dramas, top SIX comedies, #1 news show, and the #1 most watched show in the country on TOP of the NFL, SEC, PGA, NCAA, and soccer?! Even if you're not big on this stuff, you have to recognize how impressive that is. I for one don't watch a single one of these shows, but I know a lot of middle America \/ boomer generation absolutely still live by this shit. They aren't going away any time soon, as much as we might want them to. ](https://preview.redd.it/c32ujr09umf71.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=9170cca3860c60b53f42980660de08668eabc63e)

Don't believe this? Check out [Variety's report from May](https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/most-popular-tv-shows-highest-rated-2020-2021-season-1234980743/) about the most-watched TV shows on TV. Sheer CBS DOMINANCE.

[I'm assuming none of us watch any of these shows anymore unless it's to find new memes for WSB, but we all have a son \/ daugher \/ stepson as product of cuckery \/ sibling who is right in the Spongebob \/ Paw Patrol \/ Peppa Pig age range. No one, not even Disney, controls THIS much essential IP for the children's market. For parents, Paramount+ isn't a luxury, it's an absolute NECESSITY to shut their kids up.  ](https://preview.redd.it/45mxntowumf71.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaca6e55ff23254f30066b0c035aac5eaf949465)

The order isn't specified, but out of the [most popular children's television shows in America](https://www.fatherly.com/play/most-popular-kids-shows/), Viacom through Nickelodeon produces the vast majority of them.

Alright, enough about Paramount Plus. It's the key to VIAC's future, but we've covered enough of it. As P+ slowly begins to claim back it's IP it's licensed out to other streamers to bolster its own library and starts churning out some seriously great P+ exclusives (THE NEW [HALO](https://deadline.com/2021/02/halo-tv-series-latest-paramount-plus-move-1234698703/) TV SHOW for example) reasons to get the app will become more and more compelling over time - for sports fans, boomers, and parents especially. But what about for the poor people who don't want to pay even one penny for TV?

**Pluto TV**

Let me start this off by saying this: if you don't have Pluto TV, download that shit right now because it's free. Literally zero strings attached fucking free, don't even need to make an account with a fake email address, it's F R E E freeeeee. Whether or not you buy the stock, if you wasted all this time reading through all of this you will have at least gained the knowledge of the single greatest free cord cutting app ever invented.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v187qgwyvmf71.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=55c2638210fbbfa7b1f2268e90dced25e9570566

But how does Viacom make any money by giving you hundreds of channels and not charging you? You guessed it: ads. This nifty free app is expected to generate [1 BILLION](https://deadline.com/2021/08/pluto-tv-reaches-1-billion-annual-revenue-milestone-streaming-advertising-1234809600/) in advertising revenue for Pluto in 2021, well ahead of schedule. I have this on 8 hours a day in the background because BloombergTV is included, and it's absolutely fucking amazing. CBSHQ is a great ESPN replacement too for the sports fans that can no longer tolerate the irritating sounds of Stephen A Smith. Check it out, it's sweet. And free, you cheap fucks.

***TL;DR: Viacom is one of the most complete streaming TV stocks you can own right now, with something for everyone and strong competitive advantages in children's programming, live sports, and boomer television shows. It's the past, the present, and the future. They are taking the enormous cash flows that still continue to be generated from their linear TV business and investing the profits into the future of television: streaming - they're eating their cake and keeping it too.***

&#x200B;

2. **The Competitors (If you know the streaming space intimately, skip this part too)**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Contrary to popular belief, the SVOD pie is still growing even as we come out of the pandemic, and Viacom's share \(through Showtime and Paramount+, one of the only apps above to actually GAIN market share TWO straight quarters\) is expanding as well. Notice the 4&#37; DECLINE from Netflix between Q4 and Q2 2021 while Hulu and Disney have actually SHRANK as well. Time for a new sheriff in town?](https://preview.redd.it/uozq7ze0wmf71.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&s=6650e06867cfa58da7fee6c24c52cf5cb6492022)

**Netflix**

Those of you who thought Netflix runs this shit like Don Corleone are severely mistaken. While an early entrant and pioneer in the streaming space, growth has been hard to come by for Netflix thanks to a declining library, a refusal to compete in live sports or news programs, and more recently, a truly [bizarre foray into mobile gaming](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585802/netflix-gaming-mobile-subscription-earnings). As you can see, Netflix, while still #1, is in decline - as the most expensive app, they seem to be coasting more on the Netflix brand name. And on the off chance they make a show someone actually likes, it's probably [canceled](https://www.businessinsider.com/best-canceled-netflix-shows-one-day-at-a-time-daredevil-2019-6).

**HBO + Discovery**

You're probably most familiar with HBO as the channel that fucked up Game of Thrones beyond repair, rendering a once global cultural phenomenon to being completely wiped out from the entire pop-culture consciousness. Discovery makes all the dogshit reality TV such as 90 Day Fiancee that is tearing down the fabric of American society. Other assets include TNT (home of Charles Barkley and I really don't know what else) and CNN (the world's leading purveyor of fake news).

Welp, they're all joining together. As of [May 17th](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/att-to-combine-warnermedia-and-discovery-assets-to-create-a-new-standalone-company.html), Discovery is merging with WarnerMedia - a deal structured so poorly that it sent Discovery shares from the $41 it was at premarket that day down to a paltry $29.20 today. Not all mergers are created equal, and this [reverse morris trust merger](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reverse-morris-trust.asp) successfully transferred AT&T's HBO bags to unsuspecting Discovery shareholders, resulting in a debt-ridden entity that hopes to compete in the very long run.

I'm not going to bash Discovery too much because I do think it has a chance to be relevant down the line, but this merger isn't closing for a WHILE and there's just not a whole lot of upside for the stock in the short term. The potential of being acquired is now gone.

**Disney**

Disney has deep pockets, and Disney+ combined with Hulu and ESPN is a strong portfolio. Their dual theatrical release + Disney+ streaming release combo business model is also used by Paramount, and may prove to be the standard moving forward. Disney+ has two of the world's most valuable IP of all time in Marvel and Star Wars, so you won't catch me talking shit about them here. They're a strong player here, and is the only one that could challenge Viacom's supremacy in children's content (although IMO Paramount targets the 5+ demographic while Disney is more in the 13+ space). Then again, Disney isn't a pure play streaming stock either (Disney World, Disney Land) so it's not a perfect comparison.

**Amazon / Apple**

Both of these FAANG stalwarts have made half assed efforts to compete in the streaming space without really dedicating any sort of resources to it since they have so much other shit going on. Bezos at least pretended to care for a while, showing up to the Emmy awards and shit before getting bored and fucking off to space. Apple's AppleTV effort has been dismal to say the least, with a content library of around 50 titles and a userbase composed almost entirely of free trials that won't be renewed. More on this later.

**NBC / Peacock**The only reason to have this shit app is for Office re-runs when you invite a girl over to Netflix and Chill. Ironically Netflix actually lost the Office to its original maker (just another L in a long series of NFLX L's) but Peacock and Chill does have a better ring to it anyways. Otherwise, this app is basically useless and is the least likely to survive the streaming wars independently without some sort of merger. Which brings me to my next point.

**ROKU -** only a competitor to PlutoTV, not really a competitor to Paramount+. Have you seen their P/E multiple?

&#x200B;

[Ok, I compiled the above myself and did my best to update through this quarter's ER's. It may not be ENTIRELY up to date or accurate, but I did the best I could since as far as I could tell there was nowhere else on the internet that had this info all in one place, I looked everywhere. Does not include Pluto TV, Tubi, Roku, or any of the free ad-based apps. ](https://preview.redd.it/hy2nnltqzmf71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdd1116b95dad14ad5388422ae22b3cb28d531db)

**VALUATION**

Ok, let's talk numbers, without which this is just paragraphs of drivel that no one is going to fucking read. If you apes made it this far by the way, I salute you. Here's where it gets fun. The below is sourced from a Google sheets template I built from scatch, sourcing from Google Finance and Finviz. I'll point out what I thought was noteworthy from each screen, but feel free to draw your own conclusions.

This stock can get back there, we've seen it happen. ](https://preview.redd.it/ujkzehxh2nf71.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=22f72af4802f60044764a58e33dc92d4906cb565)

[Viacom's RSI yesterday was 34 before today's ER, while it's still basically trading below all three SMA's. While these numbers are terrible, you'll see they pretty much suck across the entire sector \(check out the SMA stats on the streaming ETF\). It's a downtime for the streaming sector coming out of the pandemic with money flowing towards reopening plays, while high growth tech has been mooning thanks to a second collapse of the 10 year yield. I expect this entire sector to recover H2 2021 via sector rotation back into communications when the 10 year yield goes back up \(it's projected to double by year end\). ](https://preview.redd.it/f6nictey1nf71.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=5770c797fbc24c8ffda3967c96ae80b07d7273b0)

&#x200B;

[The important thing to note here is institutional onwership aka \\""the smart money\\"". Viacom is a whopping 85+&#37; institutionally owned - asset managers, banks, hedge funds, pension funds, you name it. The short float number isn't high so I'm not going to lie to you about short squeeze potential. You'd have to be retarded to short here at 41 rather than back at 100 anyways.   ](https://preview.redd.it/pwc4c7ab4nf71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3f86afe54becb04fce814a784d500a8e2719047)

&#x200B;

[Yes you are reading this correctly - Viacom trades at a paltry 9 P\/E and just 1 times revneue!!! Even compared to its peers in traditional TV, this is ludicrously low. Why should FOXA be higher despite not having a paid streaming app? Why does ROKU deserve to trade at a whopping 239 P\/E and Netflix at 54 P\/E? I'm not arguing that VIAC should be anywhere near those P\/E's, but with everything it has going for it, 9 is ludicrous. You're not going to find better-hidden value than this ANYWHERE in the S&P 500. Run a screen and sort by P\/E if you don't believe me.](https://preview.redd.it/e8jgc35v4nf71.png?width=1368&format=png&auto=webp&s=1daf37f3492e539bb9db61202d35f5d26776bcbe)

**3. ARCHEGOS aka Bull Hwang gets Margin Called (Skip if you know the history)**

I don't want to spend too much time on this story because all of WSB knows it for the most part. Legendary fund manager Bill Hwang blew up his account in a matter of days in true WSB fashion by being levered 20 to 1 in names such as Viacom, Discovery, Baidu, Tencent Music, IQiYi, and other assorted hilarity. With the bath that Chinese stonks have taken lately and the precipitous fall from 100 to as low as 38 in Viacom, it's easy to dismiss good old billy boy as just another retard in over his head.

But this guy saw something in Viacom. Instead of telling the entire Archegos story, i'll lay out the sequence of events as relates specifically to VIAC's share price.

[A lot of times, retards throw out random price targets that stocks will never hit in their entire existence. Here, we already know what VIAC is capable of. Sure it took a 20-1 levered Korean fund to get us there, but this glimpse to the past is actually a glimpse into our future. I'll hold off on naming an end of year price target myself though, I don't like doing that without building a full model which I just don't have the time for tonight. ](https://preview.redd.it/rul9xc7v6nf71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=34643da441c29a25656d6a79683e40d63c08e2b1)

[This chart would probably be more useful to reflect this week's price action, however since I made this whole thing from scratch it's going to take too long so fuck it. As you can see, streaming stocks have mostly all taken a breather since March. Getting in now is a classic buy low situation, something us apes really need to start trying for a change.  ](https://preview.redd.it/h48bqj886nf71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=72cbacf88a2561531bf19d1685159119d8763346)

**4. MERGER MANIA!!?**

WSB might be composed of a bunch of retards that barely know how the market work, but everyone knows this: if you own stock or options in a company and it gets bought out, it is the FASTEST and most satisfying path to tendies. Strategic acquisitions are known to pay a [much higher premium](https://labusinessjournal.com/news/2021/jul/19/stamps-com-acquired-7-billion/) to what a company is trading for on the open market. There's no better way to exit a position than waking up to an alert that something you own has been acquired.

At least that's how Discovery shareholders felt the morning of May 17th before ***discovering*** they weren't getting bought out, they were getting CEO Zaslav's turd sandwich of a merger in which AT&T dumped HBO and all their associated debt on Discovery shareholders, who only get a paltry 29% of the new entity while AT&T holders get 71%. AT&T holders fared no better as the announcement accompanied the news that AT&T had to nuke their dividend to get this deal done, which was the only reason to own that POS to begin with. It was a rare deal in which everyone loses, except Zaslav himself.

But while DISCA owners were left holding their dick's, a world of possibilities were opened up for the remaining players in the streaming space to be acquired by the giants. Shortly after Amazon acquired the private MGM studios, which basically only has James Bond at this point. Much speculation ensued about whether the remaining players (VIAC, Lionsgate, AMCX, CURI) would be acquired by the giants of Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Disney etc.

I'm not going to sit here and lie to everyone and say a merger is imminent, I have no fucking clue. What I do know is Shari Redstone, chairwoman and largest stakeholder, is finally [open](https://www.wsj.com/articles/comcast-ceo-brian-roberts-and-viacomcbs-chairman-shari-redstone-met-to-discuss-streaming-partnership-11626743478) to shopping Viacom, something her father would have never considered. With a complete portfolio of sports, children's, and boomer linear, no acquisition would fix Amazon or Apple's lackluster TV efforts than Viacom. However, I don't think Viacom needs to be acquired, I think they have a legitimate shot of being a player in this space on their own.

**TL;DR We don't need to be bought out for tendies, but it sure wouldn't hurt. No acquisition would be more attractive than Viacom to immediately turn a tech giant into a streaming powerhouse. It's merely the difference between mooning sooner vs. mooning later. Either way, Shari's listening.**

**5. Analyst Price Targets**

Upgrades are coming. With earnings this good, we're already starting to see upgrades TODAY from analysts who weren't too lazy to pass in their work by EOD.

&#x200B;

[Bank of America also has a 53 PT from last quarter. I would expect further upgrades from the rest of the street tomorrow. ](https://preview.redd.it/mixl44gu8nf71.png?width=473&format=png&auto=webp&s=be78d48b7c413066e1372b36ce1a7646df207a58)

Even Without accounting for the new upgrades from today or tomorrow, the average VIAC price target is still $50.34, representing a 21% upside.

**6. Conclusion**

I wanted to get into some technincal analysis of this thing (cup and fucking handle anyone???) as well as risk factors but I'm out of time, I'll save those for a Part 2. Will be happy to answer any questions in the comments.

**TL;DR: Viacom has been consolidating for over 4 months and is finally about to fucking blow the roof off after showing phenomenal growth in a space primed for industry consolidation. This is the best positioned streamer as far as IP goes, and an acquisition would moon this basically immediately (while not essential to the investment thesis, it would be nice of course).**

EDIT: This blew up more than I thought it would. I've never posted DD here before but the overwhelmingly positive reaction I've received from this has inspired me to contribute more to the community. Now, initially I was going to make a separate Part 2 post but I don't want to be seen as spamming so I'm just going to put it as a comment and add it as an edit. Besides, it's probably important to have the risk factors of the trade as part of the original post.   


**8. RISK FACTORS**

Alright everyone. Some of you read the whole thing and YOLOed. Some of you didn't read any of it and still YOLOed. Most of you probably didn't do shit. And that's ok, because I want everyone to read this next part first before deciding. 

* **The entire market could crash** like the gay bears have been promising for months. This would of course take out everything with it, and VIAC is no different. The 10% Correction gets thrown out regularly, I'm not an economist so I really don't know if or when this is going to happen - although most of us will have way bigger problems than just VIAC if that does occur. 
* **The decline of linear TV outpaces the growth of streaming.** This is the worst case scenario for Viacom: advertisers pull their dollars out of linear which has been a cash cow and reallocate them elsewhere (i.e. NOT streaming), leaving Viacom underfunded for P+ growth. I must acknolwedge the potential risk of this even though I assign a very low probability to this in the short term since Viacom just completed the [best ad buying upfront they've ever had](https://deadline.com/2021/06/viacomcbs-upfront-paramount-pluto-tv-cbs-nfl-1234783415/). That article is a good read because it's not just Viacom tooting its own horn, it's the entire industry! If anything it paints a fairly rosy picture of where the money is flowing. 
*  **The P+ app fails to gain traction**. Paramount plus has seen two straight quarters of new user growth while Disney and Netflix have actually declined. However, it's certainly easier to gain new users when you're app is new. We don't know if something will keep growing at the rate it has. Reddit and Twitter do have their fair share of people bitching about the P+ app as far as content availability (some seasons of some shows are still [licensed out](https://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/2021/05/paramount-plus-missing-real-world-challenge-seasons/) to competitors and the short term) and bugs (the Playstation app is apparently abysmal while the other apps work much better - I've never had an issue on my Samsung or Fire apps). The bottom line is that while P+ has the same growing pains of any new app, the devs do need to figure their shit out, do their fucking job, and keep complaints at a minimum. 
* **Competition** \- The competitors in this space have DEEP pockets. All 5 FAANG names have some sort of video platform, Netflix is of course the leader here, and Apple and Amazon have at least made half assed attempts to be players in this space. A strategic shift from either Apple or Amazon to suddenly start pumping cash into these efforts could prove to be a threat for the survival of Viacom as a viable independent player. The silver lining here however is that should they choose to do that (Apple especially has done basically jack shit) - the easiest way to suddenly increase their position would actually be to buy Viacom's vast IP.  
* **Merger.** But wait, wouldn't a merger be a good thing like you said earlier before? Not always, and unfortunately Discovery already laid a very recent, very relevant blueprint for why not all deals are good deals are shareholders. I've seen a similar deal pitched in which Comcast unloads NBC Universal onto Viacom in a reverse morris trust merger; I would expect that to do to our share price what the Warner deal did to Discovery's. If we are going to get acquired, it better be all cash or all stock, and at a valuation that reflects our true value. I think Shari Redstone is actually our friend on this, she won't screw us the same way Zaslav fisted his shareholders. Conversely, if Viacom suddenly decides they want to be a buyer rather than a seller, history dictates that it's the acquiree's share price that moons while the acquirer's share price that takes a hit. There's no guarantee that the long-established 38 price floor will hold in the event of strategic M&A. Given the [ludicrous valuation](https://variety.com/2021/film/news/reese-witherspoon-hello-sunshine-sold-1235032618/) Hello Sunshine just got, I would much rather be a seller than a buyer in this market. 
* **Dividend.** In my infinite retardation I somehow managed to forget to mention this stock pays a fucking healthy dividend too, which is probably a factor as to why we have so much institutional ownership. A dividend cut of course would hurt the share price. I see the probability of this as basically near zero, the balance sheet looks pretty good right now. 
* **The Options Pinning Theory**. A lot of people are claiming this stock only exists to kill weekly options, but on most weeks I don't see enough open interest for that to actually be worth it for MM's. One thing is certain though, all calls bought after Archegos expecting a bounce to the 80-100 range got nuked. Thus far, call selling has been a more profitable trade than call buying MOST of the time. While personally I think shares and leaps look like the play here (my position currently reflects that also), any time this thing dips below 40 is when to go in with FD's as it very rarely spends too much time below there. For the more conservative investor, SELLING 38 puts is literally free money. 
* **Archegos -** Some say there is an Archegos curse, that nothing in the Korean hedge fund is ever going to moon again. I mean this is some voodoo shit but I feel like it has to be included here. The Chinese stocks he held are obviously down for entirely different reasons right now, and it just hasn't been a hot time for the value / comm trade, something I expect to reverse H2. 
* **The Growth Trade Never Fucking Ends.** As most of us know the tech trade was basically left for dead earlier in the year as shares of tech stocks tumbled as the ten year yield started to rise up steadily. This trade has reversed, and all the money has since gone back into tech, particularly the megacaps. The growth trade has been at the expense of the value trade, and make no mistake about it, ***VIAC IS A VALUE TRADE (LOOK AT THE P/E). It's listed on the NASDAQ, but don't call this a tech stock, it's a communications stock***. While it does look like the ten year yield has stopped drilling with today's nice bounce, there's no guarantee it doesn't once again reverse. However, I have a really difficult time seeing it going below 1%, and I'd be the whole house on the fact it ends the year closer to 2% than 1%. As the yield goes back up, they will shift the money from the growth trade back into value, which benefits VIAC. 
* **SPEAKING OF ALGOS** \- What does it mean to be heavily institutionally owned? Share price movements are more algo-induced from the big boys. They'll trade many stocks together simultaneously in the same industry, which at times can be unfortunate if you're grouped together with subar competitors. Layer a VIAC chart over DISCA between May and yesterday and you'll see what I mean, when one goes down so does the other. Today's price movement has been encouraging though, I have never seen VIAC green while DISCA is red I think ever. A decoupling here would be fantastic. 
* **The 38 Price Floor I believe in might not hold -** for all the reasons I included above, shit could go south, but this floor has stood the test of time and all sorts of wild shit this year. If it can survive the greatest margin call in history, and every retest after that, then this 38 floor is safer than any other investment I can think of since I don't know the floors of any other stock. But something only works until it doesn't right? So I'm including this as a risk factor since much of the thesis is based upon it. 
* **TL/DR:** There are risks to this trade as there are with any trade, and from the above it's wiser to go with a longer term trade in LEAPS form as much of this stuff takes longer to develop. I'd only go FD's if it dips below 40 as it doesn't spend much time below it. But when factoring in the growth potential, the safety of the 38 floor, the dividend, and the acquisition potential, this play really does have it all for me. Trade safely apes. "

Apple, Microsoft, and Google. People always bring them up so I figured id talk about it before one of you dumb fucks comments ""wHaT abOuT GoOglE Drrrrr."" 

They don't go after the same markets, Dropbox really goes after small to medium size businesses. This is their bread and butter. The other three fuckers go after larger size businesses. The cloud market is massive, there's room for all of them, especially when you consider that they have different client makeups.

**Last point**

If you haven't used Dropbox in a few years....you should. The products they are currently providing are fantastic. They have really focused on improving their services and it shows.

[Currently, only Maryland has passed this bill](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/tax/library/maryland-digital-ad-tax-delay-digital-products-amendments1.html), but states like Texas, NY, and West Virginia are trying to push it through as well.

IMO, if this becomes a countrywide standard, this is gonna be a huge fine on a bunch of companies like Google, FB, Amazon, etc. The worst part is the tax **(EDIT: bracket)** is calculated on gross TOTAL revenue:

ex. If I made $3 bajillion selling oranges and 50 cents selling ads, the tax would be calculated ~~on a percentage of $3 bajillion and 50 cents.~~  on the 50 cents from selling ads, but how much you're taxed is based on the $3 bajillion and 50 cents.

**EDIT: I can't read.** the tax is imposed on the amount you earned from the digital ads, but the tax rate depends on your global annual revenue. So it's not as stupid, but still pretty stupid. A little more faith in our government, a lot less faith in my reading comprehension

These companies could offload the tax onto their customers but that would probably deter customers and less companies will want to rent ads from bigger companies (if they make more money in total, the added charge will be higher)

This will probably be a long term play (first actual tax will occur April next year) but my ape ass is looking for ways to play this and I can't think of anything below surface level.

Thought some of yall would wanna know.

TL;DR: Orange peels are a good source of pectin."

If this is already too much words, don’t worry, I’ll be brief – and before you close this post because there are no rocket emojis, this is a play that might not have the moonshot potential you live for, but will yield annual bananas for years to come.  So, on to the stock, and more words for you to not read. 

Lumen Technologies

First off – what does this company do?  I typically like to google companies first, before investing.  They have a website, so that checks out.  I think they sell phones or something.  Their website talks about edge computing.  That’s future stuff.   

Either way – they make money selling their current telecommunications services, and a lot of it.  Net Income of $506 million this quarter (even with decline in sales).  Earnings per share $0.46 for the quarter.  Some more rambling about EBITDA and free cash flow, that I don’t understand.  But here is the ½ punch:

Board approved an up to $1 billion Stock Repurchase Program over two years

$1 billion in dividend payouts

For a company with a market cap just under $13 billion, that’s like a 16% locked in return.  (Can someone double check that?  Just an ape, am bad at math)

Seriously – after the 8% decline yesterday post-earnings, it seems like a pretty good price/entry-point for a company that is committed to returning value to their stockholders, is selling chunks of their business to raise capital for forays into more modern technology services.  They could turn things around – unlike the vast majority of tech startups and hopefuls, they already make fucking money.

TLDR

If I wasn’t brief enough, my assertion is this:  the market overreacted (it’s a model of efficiency) to their Q2 earnings report/declining sales, and this solid dividend earner is on sale.  Value plays aren’t your style, and I know you’re retarded, but you will still need a way to eat if when your out-of-the-money GME calls expire worthless.  No lambos here, but it will afford you the means to purchase bananas with the dividends for the rest of your life (or at least until all the people with landline phones die, whichever comes first).  So you won’t starve to death...which is always nice.

oyhsec,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oyhsec/context_logic_wish_vs_etsy_and_shopify/,Context Logic (WISH) vs ETSY and SHOPIFY,83,49,2021-08-05 21:41:15,"I have a question. Why is Context Logic valued at just a market cap of 8Bn while ETSY is at 21Bn and SHOPIFY at a whopping 187Bn.

I took the liberty of checking valuation cap to revenue ratios and noticed the following:

WISH - Revenue $3.2Bn - Cap to Rev: 2.5

ETSY - Revenue $21Bn - Cap to Rev: 8.9

and guess what with all the pumping from certain subscription based e-magazines and websites, Shopify is at:

Revenue - 3.8Bn and Cap to Rev: 49.2 :/

Even Amazon doesnt have that level of Cap to Rev like Shopify has and the Wish Revenues are marginally lower than Shop's yet the Wish is largely undervalued (in terms of Cap to Rev ratios) by almost 3.5 times against ETSY, 5 times against Amazon and a whopping 24 times against SHOPIFY.

To be fair, fundamentally, WISH is cash rich, has been experiencing growing revenues and have started to cut costs. With them hiring former Google and Amazon executives, I do think they are going in a great place into the developing their own logistics and warehousing and potentially entering the cloud computing industry.

If you think my analysis of the above is wrong, please feel free to rectify me.

I'm primarily looking at shares (I've been fucked too many times with options...), but might also buy some longer DTE options as well as FDs.

# Part 0: Short Squeeze

This isn't the main reason I'm buying, but the short interest on $FSLY is definitely worth noting and is high enough to trigger a squeeze.  We're looking at about 20% short interest [\[1\]](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/fsly).  

# Part 1: Company Profile and Market Overview

Fastly is a cloud computing company.  One of their main services is a CDN, which is basically how you're able to load up anime titties 10 minutes before you go to sleep.  Additionally, they have some cybersecurity operations as well, coming from a subsidiary they acquired in August 2020 for about $700M (cash + stock).

Before getting into their numbers, I'd like to talk about their most recent earnings shitshow.  At time of writing, the stock is down almost 20% after some bad forward guidance.  For the full year of 2020 Fastly called for an adjusted loss of -$0.65 to -$0.57 EPS and revenue of $340 to 350m. This is against an original analyst expectation of -$0.43 on $382m in revenue.  The main reason for this is that FSLY had an outage that lasted for about an hour and affected companies like Reddit, NYT, and Twitch, among others.  Keep in mind that Fastly reported this issue on June 8, yet from the week June 7 to June 14, the stock rally about 13%.  Rather bizarre, as you'd think this would have tanked the stock then.  What I take from this is that initially the market underestimated the impact of the outage and is now overestimating it.  Overall, the outage is a valid cause for concern, and you should take into account whether or not you trust FSLY to fix its shit going forward.

Now lets get down to the fundamentals.  FSLY has show solid revenue growth, of \~40% since 2017.  Even though that should drop to 20% this year, that still represents solid growth.  Additionally, if you think that the outage was a one-off event, then presumably we can expect to go back to that juicy 40% annual revenue growth.  It's also worth drawing attention to FSLY's total asset growth which has gone up 10x from 2017 to 2020.

With respect to Cloud Computing, I'm sure most of us know that this is an industry that's going to generate a lot of wealth.  The industry has a CAGR of \~18% over the next several years.  Additionally, the market is already estimated anywhere from $200-300b (as of this year).  Most big tech companies have spent huge amounts of money on their cloud computing efforts (see Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc.).

# Part 2: Analysts are (were?) bullish

The average price target of FSLY is around $52, representing \~50% upside from the current price of $35 [\[2\]](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/FSLY/research-ratings).  Now, it should be noted that price targets may not have baked in the bad guidance and outage, but it should also be noted that historically FSLY has traded well above $50.

Honestly, I don't really pay to much attention too much attention to analysts, but it's nice confirmation bias.

# Part 3: Final Thoughts

First, apologies for typos/incoherence.  This was written at 4 AM, and I'm retarded.

Second, do you own DD; as stated above, I'm retarded."

Every cloud company out there worth its salt has reported great earnings so far. FSLY has been sold off for last 4 quarters post earnings primarily due to concerns regarding its largest customer being banned in US, which is not the case now. FSLY hired a new CFO, who was earlier the CFO of Fitbit fueling acquisition rumors**

**Company Summary**
Fastly is a content-delivery network (CDN). Its customers include Spotify, NY Times, Shopify etc. It is positioned strongely in streaming, e-commerce, and online gaming.

**Catalysts**
- Earnings after hours today - August 4

- Potential acquisition - Appointment of Ronald Kisling as CFO, who was most recently CFO of Fitbit, which was acquired by Google.

- Potential earnings beat and increase in Guidance - FSLY recently acquired a cloud security company - Signal Sciences. This might be key for increased guidance and earnings beat as this product allows developers to protect their apps in every environment including cloud / onsite and edge.

**Why it is 10x Bagger**
- Short float is 22.25% and short ratio 6.26, that means at current volume it will take over 6 days for shorts to cover. Any increase in guidance and a healthy beat on earnings will rocket this stock to mars.
- A very small chance of acquisition announcement in earnings call

**Why it may flop again**
- Its revenue is concentrated. Top 10 clients account for 29% of sales revenue. So, if any one of them fails, it materially affects FSLY. Good thing is, in 2017, the top 10 client's revenue accounted for 37% and now it has decreased to 29%.

- Its main competitor is Cloudflare which offers everything that FSLY offers, and both are competing for the same sales share from legacy operators like Akamai etc. Though Cloudflare ($NET) product is more focused toward small and medium size businesses, whereas FSLY deals with big enterprises.

**What does analysts say**

- 12-month target - $52

- Buys - 2 | Holds - 7 | Sells - 2


**Play**
The stock is currently trading near its all-time low, current price is $46 and 52 week low - $40. $136 is all time high.

- Since it's a binary and very risky play, its best to do a strangle, that is buy a call and put together on same strike or very close strike, near the money, considering the move is highly likely going to be over 10%, it will very much cover the cost of strangle.

- You can also buy shares and hedge it with a near the money long puts for same week or next week.

- And if you are feeling frisky, you can yolo $50 strike calls for Aug 6 | Aug 13 or Aug 20


**My Position**
- $49 Calls(200) for August 6 

- 20,000 shares

- $45 Puts(200) for August 13


**Tracker**
As I am looking to do regular short and crisp DD's on /wsb for the stocks which I am playing myself, I will track my performance with each DD. My last DD is here:
https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/omvwpu/why_xpo_is_your_next_510x_bagger/?
This has done very well; stock has already gone up over 15% since the time of DD and thesis that I put in the dd unrolled exactly like that.
Score - 1/1

Do not read this post. 

""But Rhodes and other analysts were quick to note that BlackBerry QNX is hardly a one-trick pony when it comes to automotive software"".  

From: [https://obj.ca/article/techopia/fords-shift-google-infotainment-software-wont-put-brakes-blackberry-qnxs-ascent](https://obj.ca/article/techopia/fords-shift-google-infotainment-software-wont-put-brakes-blackberry-qnxs-ascent)

""An anchor of Kanata’s autonomous vehicles sector is still in the driver’s seat when it comes to developing emerging AV technology despite Ford’s decision to drop the company’s infotainment platform from its vehicles, industry analysts told OBJ Thursday. 

The world’s No. 3 automaker made headlines (...) when it announced it was ditching BlackBerry QNX’s system that controlled tasks such as syncing mobile phones for hands-free calling and powering interactive maps in favour of an Android-based platform from Google.

That means that starting in 2023, apps such as Google Maps will now be available in millions of Ford and Lincoln vehicles without requiring an Android smartphone.

Ford joins a growing number of other car manufacturers, including Volvo, General Motors and the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, that have turned to Google to power their infotainment systems in recent years. 

As a result, BlackBerry QNX ​– which employs about 400 people at its flagship Kanata R&D facility ​– has seen its share of the infotainment software market fall from nearly 50 per cent in 2017 to 28 per cent last year, according to market research firm IHS Markit. Ford’s move will only hasten that decline.

## Not a one-trick pony

“Ford was a significant piece of business for QNX – there’s no doubt about it,” says Brian Rhodes, IHS Markit’s Michigan-based research manager for connected cars, noting that the manufacturer accounted for more than a fifth of QNX’s infotainment software business in 2020. “There’s a gap there.”

But Rhodes and other analysts were quick to note that BlackBerry QNX is hardly a one-trick pony when it comes to automotive software. 

The company designs a variety of software systems used in cars made by Ford and other manufacturers, including telematics that underpins technology such as GPS navigation systems as well as assisted and autonomous driving platforms. Infotainment is just one of these systems, and experts say its relative importance to BlackBerry QNX’s business is waning.

 Rhodes notes that the Waterloo-based company has been funnelling many of its resources into enhancing the safety and security of its real-time operating systems. He says BlackBerry QNX is “incredibly strong and getting stronger” at developing secure, connected platforms that control everything from airbags to autonomous parking systems. 

As an example, he points to BlackBerry’s recent decision to expand its business partnership with Chinese search engine giant Baidu. 

Under the deal, Baidu’s high-definition maps will be integrated into BlackBerry’s QNX Neutrino real-time operating system in millions of electric cars manufactured by GAC Group, one of China’s top three automakers. 

“I think that’s exactly how they’re trying to position their business going forward,” Rhodes explains. “It’s really just phasing into a different part of their business.”

Ottawa-based automotive industry expert Barrie Kirk agrees. 

 While calling Ford’s decision unfortunate, Kirk says it wasn’t all that surprising considering the widespread industry shift toward Android-based infotainment systems.

He notes that BlackBerry QNX has spent years building a strong reputation for developing secure software focused on other aspects of automotive technology such as autonomous driving systems, adding the company caters to a wide variety of other industries, including the medical sector. 

## 'A solid company'

“This is disappointing, but let’s keep it in perspective,” says Kirk, the executive director of the Canadian Automated Vehicles Centre of Excellence. “It’s a solid company with a broad market and a well-respected product line.”

Rhodes adds that while Silicon Valley giants such as Google and others might find it relatively easy to make hay in the realm of infotainment software, building robust operating systems that can stand up to cyber attacks and other security threats is a much tougher nut to crack. And that’s where BlackBerry QNX excels.

“The infotainment space has always been ripe for disruption,” Rhodes explains. “The barrier to entry certainly needs scale, but there are a lot of tech companies with a lot of scale out there.

“The safety-critical space, you can’t buy 50 years of automotive experience, except (through) acquisition. It’s a more secure position to have that niche in – no pun intended.”

Kirk says he hopes that Ford will continue to collaborate with BlackBerry QNX on other ventures at the automaker’s $340-million Ottawa Research and Engineering Centre on Palladium Drive, which employs hundreds of ex-BlackBerry workers.

But no matter what happens, he sees a bright future ahead for a firm that’s shown a knack for weathering storms. 

“This is the same BlackBerry that really adjusted very well as its smartphone business diminished,” he says. “They reinvented themselves in a big way and did a very successful job of that. I’m very confident that they’ll do well, and they'll adjust and keep growing.”

TLDR: This is just one example of what is really going on behind the bearish bullshit articles flooding the space.
Bb lost the infotainment contract with F but that does not encompass the totality of their working relationship. Articles have been and probably will continue to be framed in a bearish lean for the foreseeable future. Do your own dd 
Obligatory 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Edit: final phases of patent sale deal. The past couple earnings reports were inaccurate due to  revenue that couldn’t be declared. If we factor in avg patent rev bb would have beat the last two losses."

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 1. The Great Woodening**

Cathie's Ark funds have been around for a while now. I know, I lost money on several of them back before she blew up. Keep this little tidbit in mind as you read on, as there are few things as effective at coloring one's views as the bitterness of missing the boat.

Over the past few years, Cathie blew up on the spot. So much so, that she gave birth to entire youtuber carriers. These guys just put on 'youtube face' for the thumbnail, add a title like 'What Cathie JUST bought!' (always important to all-cap the 'just'), and then they read out information you could've just gotten by signing up for her trade notifications yourself.

So how did this come to be? How did this random lady with a questionable investment fund portfolio get dubbed '**the money tree**' by the Koreans?

Answer: She's a fantastic salesperson with accesses to the **full** range of media in order to execute her pumping strategy. And... she bought Tesla. And then pumped the absolute shit out that motherfucker.

You see, her pumping strategy is ***several orders of magnitude*** better than anything you'll ever see here, because she backs her pumps up with next level YOLOs. In order for one of you ~~retards~~ *distinguished investors* to even approach her level, you need the best DD known to man ***and*** you need to follow that post up with a YOLO post were you bought ***tens of millions*** of dollars worth of the stock. And even then, you'd fall horribly short of what this lady can do.

Does this mean I think she's a scam artist? No. Is she running a game? Aren't we all? But I'll get to that more in Part 6. On to the Charts of Fury!

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 2. A Wooden Albatross**

The greatest decision Cathie Wood ever made was to buy Tesla and pump it harder than any stock has been pumped in the history of pumping. I haven't investigated her past enough to know whether she was captain of the cheerleading squad, but good lord, she *should've been*.

The current state of TSLA:

[Elon's back on track](https://preview.redd.it/tqvmp0b04te71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=f06f3e05363260b81cb9a83a745d708b65236332)

A couple of important points about this chart. First, it's still over that green uptrend line, which is decidedly bullish. Second, it broke out of the orange downtrend line. Again, bullish. The only worry I have is that there is a sideways channel forming. However, this uncertainty should resolve itself by the end of this month (August) at the latest.

&#x200B;

Before shitting all over TSLA, let's first compare it to ARKK:

[Should've just bought TSLA](https://preview.redd.it/8ollr3bn4te71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=b67e0273de08a10972ab8b504df1e24d08001d31)

Here we can see that Cathie is under performing her own major holding. And TSLA is far and away her largest holding (some of the other big ones are down below). She holds TLSA as her number one holding in ARKK, ARKW **and** ARKQ (over 10% in all three). If you wanted to outperform Cathie Wood, all you had to do was just buy TSLA yourself. (The percent difference *down* from the top is nearly the same, however, TSLA is *up* 400% from the same point versus her 150%). Why pay her to do it for you? To be fair, she does have other stuff and it's not all bad. However, I named this section the Wooden Albatross because her position here is so large that **as Tesla goes, Cathie goes**.

Which brings me to the problem with Tesla: ***competition***. Tesla was a great investment. Elon got out front of everyone with EVs, proved the doubters wrong, and has reaped outsized rewards for it. But the competition is coming for him. It might not be this year, or even the next, but Tesla ***is going to bleed***. Mark my words, it is going to happen.

With excellent earnings, Tesla is bringing that stratospheric p/e of over 1,000 in 2020 down to something more '*reasonable*' of \~230 for this year, and by 2022 to \~130. That's great. **However**, in order to keep up, Elon is going to need to keep smashing out of the park again and again and again and again and.... You get the point. One miss and this puppy is going for a ride down blood bath mountain.

Still, the chart says up, and I'm by no means bold enough to call the top on Tesla. Tread carefully, friends.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 3. Back to the Future**

If Cathie is known for anything (other than buying Tesla) it's what I like to call 'Cathie Woodisms.' This is a whole universe of new age buzzwordology such as: innovator, disruptor, AI, machine learning, next-gen, etc. Now, I've pointed and laughed at this shit on a fair number of occasions here on the sub. But I also wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ousepa/the_roaring_2020s_why_the_mother_of_all_crashes/), where I made the case that this shit will underpin what I've dubbed **M.A.Rs** **- the Mother of All Rallies**.

Now, what at first blush looks utterly inconsistent, after the application of contorted logic becomes totally consistent! These buzzwords are, ***for the most part***, bullshit and just slapped on any old thing in order to make the pump sound better. However, there are some cases where I think these appellations are more than just sound bites, but represent something truly new. So let's look at some of Cathie's investments that meet that criteria (at least in my eyes).

First, and probably the best, CRSP:

[Not a great chart, but I want that third arm](https://preview.redd.it/ldkkwbr59te71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3289a6dfc74a66ca54b5a0190ce3a5bcf510b99)

The CRISPR gene editing tool is most next level shit that exists today. Sure, the present applications are limited and for the foreseeable future this will be constrained to dealing with genetic disorders (which should bring hope to you all). The potential of this, however, is truly mind bending. You could no longer be a manlet, for example. You could no longer have to suffer having a woman laugh at you when she sees how small your penis is and ask, ""Is that *really* it? I guess I get to sleep through this session..."" I get to have my 20-year-old hairline back. ***Possibilities***.

If this leads where I'm thinking it leads, then we are in for borderline miracles here, people. Now, just because *this* company has CRISPR in the name, does not mean it will end up being the Chosen One. But for now, let's just say it is. If you're looking for an entry, this is kinda, sorta settling into a channel and is at the bottom of that. If you're a ***believer***, TA doesn't matter; buy it at any price. I regret not picking it up at that dip under a $100.

&#x200B;

Next up, the embodiment of evil, PLTR:

[The Eye of Darkness sees .... a 'maybe' uptrend](https://preview.redd.it/2r1mpc21bte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab25127dfa2315936f5ab4a26f72266bfdf0c06d)

Palantir is difficult to wrap your mind around, but basically they do AI shit, specifically data analytics. While this seems ho-hum, I'm told that it is in fact the precursor to ushering in Big Brother and giving **all the power** to our Totalitarian Corporate Globalist Overlords. Which both gives me a hard on and makes me want to buy the stock. I mean who wants to be on the team with the tiny little hobbits when you can be on the team with the hundred-story high flaming eyeball? Have you guys seen how the Globalist Overlords live? I have it on good authority its just like the rich asshole bad guys in every Gundam series. Man that looks awesome.

As for the chart, it's finding its way into a channel, but there's also support trend line underneath us right now. I think it's a buy at these prices, personally. Though I haven't actually bought it, so you know.... Like CRSP, I think Cathie is right on this one and it's a good ***long*** hold.

&#x200B;

Now let's look at something Cathie was absolutely fucking ***wrong*** on, WKHS:

[Dead-ish Horse](https://preview.redd.it/dgcoewescte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cade3c1428ee8da90fa816f527f849d258d69e9)

This is my third time talking shit about this ticker so I'll keep it brief: **I don't like it**. Nothing they do impresses me. The problem is that anything they do, someone else does better. Drones? Amazon. EVs? Tesla. They are so unimpressive that even Cathie bailed on them, as she no longer holds any shares of this amazing buyout opportunity of a company.

From the chart, again I'm seeing a potential channel forming, which is *amazing* news for the bagholders.

&#x200B;

Next, and because I'm a whore for karma, HOOD:

[What TA!](https://preview.redd.it/4apb6z1udte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=3694002b6d5912eaa9ec3710f3d81a707c0d3cce)

Okay, this is basically a joke chart. Doing TA on a ticker two days on the market is like deciding to marry that kinda chubby girl on your second date because she promised she was working real hard to slim down. And now you have special van to carry her around and can't own a house with more than one story. I'd say more about HOOD, but I don't want to incur the wrath of the **Titans of Wall Street**.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 4. Hardwood Flooring**

Under girding Cathie's ~~degenerate gambling~~ *wise, forward thinking investments* are some pretty solid companies. Indeed, there are too many to cover here, but to give you an idea: **she owns John Deere in her space fund ARKX**. (And her robotics fund, though it makes more sense there as Deere is likely moving toward self-driving tillage equipment). She also owns all kinds of other 'boomer' stuff (e.g., GOOG, AMZN, etc.), so I'm going to limit this part to the other three of her top holdings in ARKK after TSLA.

&#x200B;

First, the second major holding, TDOC:

[That whole re-opening thing in chart form](https://preview.redd.it/k0hfqxe5gte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c6edb9ddba318a1bc93e07bd59390d47db906e6)

So this tele-medicine company has performed as expected after the lockdowns ended: *poorly*. In addition to ARKK (2nd largest position), she owns this in ARKW (#3), ARKG (#1, to be expected), and ARKF (#15). She sure likes this stock. I don't know all the much about it, but its recent under performance is certainly dragging her down given its position among her family of funds.

From the chart, we have a pretty clear downtrend channel. The sliver of hope would be the support line I drew, but it's way too early to call the bottom here. I'll not be buying this at these prices (or ever, if I'm being honest).

&#x200B;

Next, something people around here actually know about, ROKU:

[Nice chart, 9\/10, would fuck](https://preview.redd.it/hcm8mebchte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=040eddc1c05adcbf6e258154597e8fdb1b7c8712)

I'm seething with regret that I passed on this ticker ***several times*** back in 2019. Cathie's not, though. This is one of her better performers, if not the best given it's #3 position in ARKK. I still don't like the company because I don't see how they're going to beat out Amazon, Netflix, etc. But given how horribly wrong I've been thus far, you should definitely not listen to me.

But if you wanted to listen to the chart, you'd wait for a retrace to the uptrend line. The ticker might not give you that, though. With that double top, however, I think more likely than not, *it will*.

&#x200B;

Lastly, some fin-tech magic, SQ:

[The definition of showing up after the party's over](https://preview.redd.it/iedoxkj1ite71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=71bbc455f0b4d93df3d14b88b4651fe4a2d6f606)

I never even heard of this until it was way too fucking late to buy it, so again Captain Sour Grapes has little good to say about it. I do understand what they do, because my nephew works at a restaurant that uses their app for payments. There are others in this space, but the chart says people like Square's chances and I'm not going to argue with that.

On the other hand, we're clearly out of the channel and there is no hope of recovering **that** channel. In keeping with Cbass's top notch TA skills, I eyeballed a rough sideways channel, but just going straight the fuck up from here is just as likely. (Probably in a new parallel channel). Still, this has the shape and feel of a typical big-tech chart: run up, pause for hot sideways action, then resume the run up. I'll not be buying it, I think, but y'all have fun with it anyway.

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 5. Cathie & the Chairman**

Cathie's been in the news lately for dumping her Chinese positions. She's certainly not alone in this and if you take the general pulse of investors vis-a-vis China it's.... let's just say ***not good***. I'm going to constrain myself to just her positions, rather than pile on this orgy of 'go fuck yourself.'

First off, she's fully out of Tencent (she dumped the last on Friday, but it's not yet reflected in the holding lists on her website). I won't show the chart because this ticker is on OTC, so I think that's a no-no 'round these parts. There's some other shit she's selling too, but ~~nobody's ever~~ *I've* *never* heard of it.

One of her larger positions that she's still unloading is JD:

[Maybe Xi destroys you, maybe he doesn't... it depends on how his breakfast was](https://preview.redd.it/imq7835hlte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=426c7630ae777261d97a8f37ef08a575b67520c5)

JD is an online sales company like Alibaba or Amazon. It's #2 in China, I believe. I haven't heard any bad news specific to this company, but the general crackdown has hit the whole sector, no exceptions. The chart gives you a maybe-channel to work with if you've got the testicular fortitude for this kind of gambling. It is $10/share back to the top of that channel.... Or a complete breakdown a couple weeks from now when news breaks that the entire board of directors got sent to a gulag.

&#x200B;

I haven't seen any news of her unloading the magic carpet, BABA:

[This looks FINE! \(Weekly candles\)](https://preview.redd.it/qehlylrcmte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=20b50a35e7cb5bcf7c91c9570ac9b69291f6e876)

But it sure is unloading on her, right in the face. Fuck me, this is a nasty chart. You can tinker around with that downward channel all you like and it's never gonna look like anything other than you losing more money.  The $180 mark is your beacon of hope, because after that I don't see all that much in the way of a slide all the way to $130.

&#x200B;

Let's take a look at the daily chart, just for fun:

[Yep, still looks bad](https://preview.redd.it/qzs8yizwmte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cd95571285e835337935af6a7c79857a0f984c)

You see, by making this chart that doesn't show anything under $170, that means the price ***cannot go under $170***. This is because charts are magic spells that you cast on the ticker. Try it out next time you're losing all your money!

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 6. Romancing the Wood**

Looking at her recent under performance, one must inevitably ask: Has Cathie Wood lost her touch? Or perhaps: Was it nothing but luck all along? There's no easy answer here.

Without a doubt a cult of personality has risen up around Cathie and that has helped her outperform, as hordes of retail investors decided to buy into whatever she was buying into. Indeed, ***this very processes*** appears to be part of her strategy: i.e., she buys a new, 'innovative' company, goes on CNBC to talk about, then all the youtubers make videos about it and the subs dedicated to her start talking about it, and boom, just like that she sent the ticker to the moon.

Despite this, I don't think she just some charlatan. Some of her choices are questionable, certainly, but others indicate to me that she is doing exactly what she claims: investing in the companies of tomorrow. It is simply that she, like any human being, can be wrong. And sometimes, *horribly wrong*.

I'm not going to make a snide comment about how she came to her idea for these types of investment funds. The younger version of Cbass wore that cloak of sneering superiority, and doffing it was one of the better character choices I've ever made. Perhaps the only good one. People like to snicker when someone describes their epiphany in religious terms, forgetting that every human until these most recent times did exactly that whenever an idea came to them.  I'll say no more.

As for whether her idea will work out for her, that has yet to be decided. As I've seen others here note, she appears to be trying to play catch-up, afraid that her recent slips will trigger a rush to the gates causing the collapse of her whole endeavor. This is a real danger for her, but doubling down like a degenerate gambler at 5:00 am in the casino is probably the wrong call. To that point, I'm actually happy to see her selling, even for a loss. For a while there, it looked like she was going to just keep buying into failing positions, hoping her very act of buying would be the thing that re-ignited the play.

Now, our old buddy Jim Cramer sure does like to talk about Mrs. Wood. Some have called him all sorts of names for his seeming obsession with her, but I rather think he saw what she was doing with her purchase-and-pump routine and it *irked* him. This is his game, too, but in Cramer's mind he only pumps 'responsible' plays, while Cathie is pumping crap.

Or maybe Jim was just trying to Romance the Wood:

[Good luck Jim!](https://preview.redd.it/qsap2lax0ue71.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be0e0cbfd1ee6ceaba5ded01887a1229f07df2bb)

&#x200B;

***Good luck, and may the lambos be with you.***

Just good “company name 10Q” and you should find a page that lists all their financial reports to the SEC.

AAL CEO's said  **""incredible"" post-COVID recovery and that its business is ""well on our way to getting back to normal.""** 

\- July 29 Hilton beat on EPS missed in revenue

HLT said: **Hilton expects continued strength in leisure demand and further upticks in business travel to drive continued resurgence in the back half of the year. The hotel operator sees full year net unit growth of between 5.0% and 5.5%.**

# ABNB last earnings

\- May 13  EPS of -$1.95, Revenue of  $886.9M (+5.4% Y/Y) 

 Airbnb attracted over $10B of bookings in Q1 2021, an increase of over 50% from the same prior year period as travel returns.

# ABNB Business

Tech company based in silicon valley that offers the home of people who want to rent it for small periods of times, to people who want to travel or work.

The houses they offer are inspected and well photographed so guests know what they are renting.

They profit from a fee of \~10% from the guest.

Currently ABNB has 4Million hosts from all around the globe.

Since covid ABNB has expanded their business to other areas like experiences (cooking, pets, sailing, surf, food/wine tasting).

Usually their hosts offer houses that are competitive to hotels but may lack hotel normal services (except cleaning)

Airbnb offer insurance up to 1Million dollars in case guests damage the property, recent case from a party in Dallas, which led to airbnb ban parties and guests who might be into parties.

Airbnb model protects them from house expenses, in a covid world they have no expenses with unrented houses and rooms unlike hotels.

# ABNB keeps it Safe

As you can see trusting your house to strangers might not be relaxing, thus Airbnb needs to offer a safe ecosystem of people who can be trusted.

Hosts need to be sure their property will be intact and guests want to get what they paid for.

For that Airbnb has a method of rating, both host and guest will review one another. In this process they can filter out the worst guests and hosts, and keep the good ones.

Creating this environment is important for hosts, as they can know, how the guests they are receiving, have behaved in previous houses. 

Leads to less uncertainty and more focus on making their property more appealing to well behaved guests.

# ABNB Chart

Since February ABNB defined a clear resistance line that is merging with resistance at 130$.  
The stock is currently testing the resistance at 143$ which might be broke after a strong earnings.

The chart indicates an interest rate for the past 5 years.  
As google indicates in the ? icon:

> Numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means that there was not enough data for this term. 

It's clear that interest over airbnb is rising once again.

&#x200B;

My position:

82 stocks at 143$ and will add more if earnings show success

CLF gang is happy today. Not only is there a reduction in dilution of the stonk, but the infrastructure bill somehow passed the first procedural vote in the senate. So I figured I'd put myself on the record and give some price targets for you degenerates. 

Please keep in mind that these price targets reflect many different scenarios, so don't get all butt hurt just because the first few scenarios are not bullish. 

Also, we need to drop the ""to the moon"" bullshit when we are bullish on a stock. Instead, let's set better goals. To Mars.  I like imagining of a life that I'll never have.  I can see the moon.  I can't see Mars.   🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀 

&#x200B;

**PT Scenarios - 4 months out:**

1.) Economic crash and Everything is closed (25% or more market decline) from Delta variant and highly overvalued stonks - Please, save enough money for a rope or a therapist. My shitty analysis won't help you. I make a good friend, though! :D

2. ) Economic slowdown due to Delta variant and standard market correction (between 10-15% market correction). No infrastructure bill. - PT anywhere between $10-14. There is a legit probability as the CDC has reinstated mask mandates, and Biden is set to announce mandated vaccines for fed workers/contractors. The market is poised for a pullback, so that it will be a great ""buy-the-dip"" opportunity. These minor 2-3% corrections you see in the markets are nothing - Shit is still overpriced. RIP for short-term gains, sexy on the long, though!

3.) Scenario 2, but we get the infrastructure deal. PT between $17-22. You better start loading up calls because the dip will be short-lived. Infrastructure can be pitched as a way to keep people working during Delta. A lot of work can be completed outside (less need for masks / social distancing.)

And holy shit… Conspiracy theory time… Skip to scenario four if you want a more realistic take on life…

Delta will be used as a way to force the infrastructure bill/rebuilding of America. We are so caught up in living as consumers that we've forgotten to take care of the essentials (roads, bridges, streets, damns, electric charging stations, 5G, ETC.). We'd instead work for fancy companies like Google and spend money on useless shit (iPhones, cars, guitars, etc.)

4.) The economy stays flat, and things trade sidewise. PT $22-25.

5.) The markets keep pumping, and Delta hardly makes a dent. No infrastructure deal, though. PT $26-32. The company is poised for growth, as clearly indicated by the past three earnings and future guidance.

6.) Everything works our way. No Delta, no correction, and the infrastructure bill passes. PT $32-Mars landing. 

Final note, don't forget these facts… First, the company is on a zero debt path and expects to be debt-free by 2022. Second, the company is vertically integrated, meaning that they own the upstream supply chain (Everything from mining the material to polishing it up for delivery to the customer – Car manufacturers and construction companies). Third, inflation continues to help this company. The more inflation, the faster this debt is paid down. We are doing well regardless of inflation because less inflation means more demand, thus increasing overall volume. Smaller margins, though.  

Let's send CLF bussin!

In this post, I will provide a quick overview of option pricing in its most simplified form, aimed at beginners. Why, you ask? There is no shortage of resources online, but many focus on the definitions, introduce the Greeks, and omit the complicated math. The Greeks are definitely important, but when you're starting out, it might be easier to think about options pricing in a different way.

If you're an expert, you likely won't learn anything new from this post. With the preliminaries out of the way, let's begin.

**The random walk model**

To price derivatives, i.e., options, we need to first have a model for the underlying. The commonly used model is that equity prices exhibit [*Geometric Brownian motion*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion). In this model, the price of an equity continuously compounds with time, but at a varying rate; at any instant, the rate is the sum of two parts: a steady component (or drift), and a random component (that can be positive or negative in a compounding period). 

[Example of a price history with a daily drift of 5 bps, and a random component with a typical daily scale of 100 bps, values that are typical of SPY over the last 10 years](https://postimg.cc/cgcKJHQv)

[Distribution of daily growth rates for this price history](https://postimg.cc/ph5GNw8c)

Given a starting point, several price histories can fan out from there, for different realizations of the random components of the growth rates (the above price history was for one realization). 

[5000 randomly generated trajectories for SPX over the last 10 years](https://postimg.cc/3d2pQ4mX)

If we could look at this universe of possibilities (a' la Dr Strange), and record the final price for each history, we would obtain a distribution of final prices from a starting price.

[Theoretical, and empirically derived (by generating random trajectories) distributions for the final SPX price](https://postimg.cc/YL3QTRXy)

Here are a couple of important features of this distribution:

* Over an extended interval that spans several compounding periods, odds are the total growth rate within the interval is *below* the expectation from the steady rate (this pops out from the graph above). This means that the price action will **underperform the mean more often than not**, and make up for it with relatively **shorter/fewer spurts of overperformance** (legs up), so that the average growth rate will equal the steady one. 

 [Another way of looking at the same feature: we map each final SPY price to a compounded daily growth rate for that trajectory, and look at the distribution of these rates; notice how it peaks *below* the steady rate](https://postimg.cc/Mnx1qCk3)

* The *spread* in the universe of possibilities (i.e., how much the universe of trajectories ""fans out"", as measured by, say the [logarithmic range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithm) that the trajectories explore, after factoring out the mean return) grows as the square root of the elapsed time.

 [Standard deviation (or typical spread) in the natural logarithm of the SPY price over the universe of trajectories, as a function of time](https://postimg.cc/4mFbb8jW)

 This spread is usually expressed in terms of an annualized volatility percentage, so over a finite time (t): 

 **Spread in the natural logarithm of price = (volatility percentage / 100) * square_root(t / 252 days)**

 assuming there are 252 trading days in a year. For reference, the trajectories in the plots above have a volatility percentage of 16% (which is coincidentally not far from the IV of leap options on SPY). **Note that if the changes in price are reasonably small, the spread in the natural logarithm of price equals the spread in the price, measured as a fraction of the price.**


**Option pricing**

Given the model that I described above (and its parameters), how do we value a call option to purchase shares at a given strike (K) and a given day in the future (T), given the current price (S)? The classical method is to proceed via the [Black-Scholes model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model), which answers the question in terms of the solution to a differential equation. 

Let's think of this in another way: if we think of the call option as an asset, its present value is the discounted value of all the future cash flows that we're exposed to if we hold it. If we buy the call option, we have two kinds of future cash flows:

* We pay the strike (K) at time T.

* Assuming we immediately resell the underlying at the time T, we get a cash amount equal to its future price.

These transactions happen only if the price at T exceeds K. For a moment, assume that we are forced to purchase the underlying at K regardless of price and immediately resell it (i.e., no optionality). 

* The present value of the first cash flow is easy: it equals -K * e^(-r T), where e is Euler's constant and r is the risk-free rate of borrowing (i.e., if we have K * e^(-r T) in the bank today, we will have K in our account at T that we debit in order to purchase the underlying). 

* For the second cash flow, our expectation is that the (unknown) price at T is distributed like in the model above ([remember](https://postimg.cc/YL3QTRXy)). To discount this distribution to the present time, we cannot use the risk-free rate (since it is a risky investment), but rather we have to use the expected rate of return. After we do this, the steady rate cancels out, and *the distribution of discounted prices only depends on the current price (S) and the expected spread in the future price (i.e., volatility and time remaining)*.

 [Distribution of discounted 10 year prices for SPX on 2011-05-02](https://postimg.cc/8sSc0kwr)
 
 [Distribution of the natural logarithm of discounted 10 year prices for SPX on 2011-05-02](https://postimg.cc/Cd3NtqXs)

 The fact that the value of the option does not depend on the steady growth rate (or the equity risk premium) means that **by purchasing the option, you're not betting on the expected growth of the price, you're betting on excess growth**. In other words, **stonks go up is priced in**.

*If we add the optionality, only those parts of the discounted distribution that are profitable count*. Here are the same figures as above, with the relevant regions marked for a discounted strike price of 2115.

* With the optionality, the first cash flow (paying for exercise at T) has a present cost of -K * e^(-r T) * area of blue shaded region (i.e., exercise cost * the estimated probability of exercising the option).

* With the optionality, the second cash flow (earnings from reselling the underlying) has a present value similar to the area of the blue shaded region, but with an extra weighting factor that depends on the exercise price (the precise calculation involves some extra mathematical details).

These two terms are precisely those that appear in the solutions to the Black-Scholes model, e.g., [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model). 


**Volatility and time**

From the previous discussion, and [this](https://postimg.cc/Czk6hgqD) figure in particular, we see that the probability of exercise, and hence the value of an option, depends on the area of the normal distribution beyond the strike price. This is called the *survival function*.

[Survival function as a function of the departure from the peak of the normal distribution, in units of its standard deviation, or spread](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda362.htm#SURVIVAL)

Notice that as we move toward positive values of x, the survival function falls exponentially. 

From [this](https://postimg.cc/Czk6hgqD) figure, **the spread in the distribution of log(discounted prices) depends both on the volatility and the time to expiration**; Hence if the volatility dies down or the time to expiration draws nearer, the spread narrows, and for a fixed OTM strike price, even if the underlying price doesn't move, the **difference between the logarithms of the strike and the price, measured in units of the spread** (which is what the survival function depends on) rises steeply, and hence the probability of exercise and the value fall steeply. 

[Change in the probability of exercise for an OTM SPX call option with 3 years remaining vs 10 years remaining (neglecting the change in the discounted strike due to the risk free rate)](https://postimg.cc/3kNcpbfJ)

Depending on what is changing, this effect is captured by a combination of a few of the options Greeks (theta, charm, vega, ...), but we can see that at the core, all of these are describing the same phenomenon.


**Why did I lose money even when the price moved my way?**

The volatility that is priced into options is **not backward looking (historical volatility), but forward looking (expectation of future volatility, or implied volatility (IV))**. 

[historical volatility and implied volatility of the GOOG options chain this year](https://postimg.cc/18Sp1gwx)

**Prices move by small amounts, but the IV moves by a lot in a small amounts of time, and hence the IV is the most important metric to consider when buying options**, considering the sensitivity of options prices to this parameter. Buying calls when the IV is high (e.g., earnings) is equivalent to betting on a loaded dice with the bias not in your favor.


**Caveats**

I have neglected several real-world effects in this discussion: dividends, early exercise, etc. 

Another important factor is that the Geometric Random Walk model isn't really correct, since the distribution of daily returns is very non-Gaussian: there are many more days with small moves, and very large moves, than the model predicts. The market deals with this by using different volatilities for different strike prices. Moreover, the moves can exhibit correlations on various timescales, which are not accounted for in this class of models.

Let me tell you about two small companies called AirBnb and Uber. AirBnb, the room rental company that owns no houses, and Uber, the taxi company that owns no cars. It's genius.

What does this have to do with LCID you ask? I'll get there.

McDonalds is a real estate agent, Tesla is a battery salesman, Google is an advertising company, your mum is a hoe. All of these things are well known.

LCID is the car manufacturing company that has manufactured the same amount of cars as you and I have. 0. Now let me tell you why this is genius:

Have you ever been to a restaurant and been so dissappointed in your food that you left a bad review? Yeah, me neither. But there are Karens out there that do and LCID know if they don't produce any cars nobody can find any flaws in their cars, because there are none.

Have you ever been scared of flying on a plane because you heard of an aviation accident on the news? The owners of LCID have. And their cars have had a total of 0 accidents ever. Imagine that.

&#x200B;

TLDR: just because I've never run a marathon it doesn't mean I can't win the olympics. Just because LCID haven't made any cars, doesn't mean they can't drive our broke asses to the moon.

I’ve been seeing a lot of misinformation and rumors spread about $LCID since it’s introduction to the NASDAQ today. Im here to try and answer some questions and clear up some of the information regarding $LCID.

Q: Why am I seeing hundreds of Lucid posts and why are they posting now?

A: Lucid just completed their merger and is no longer a SPAC, therefore it can finally be talked about on WSB. Not only that, but Lucid might have been the most hyped SPAC ever (correct me if I’m wrong).

Q: What is this scam? 

A: Well, no… Lucid was formerly known as Atieva, a battery and drivetrain manufacturer for formula E. They started in 2007, they later decided in 2016 that they wanted to throw their tech into a car of their own. They have been around a long time, and the Lucid team has tons of experience in the industry (Lots of ex Tesla, Porsche, Apple, Google, Lotus, etc employees)

Q: Are they just another Tesla ripoff?

We’ll start with a note that Tesla started in 2003 and released their first car in 2008, a similar 5 year development to that we are seeing with Lucid - 2016 - 2021 (With any luck). Lucid and Tesla are two very different companies reaching two different markets (at least for the moment). Lucid is luxury EVs whereas Tesla has a great EV for pretty much everyone (if you can afford it). Peter Rawlinson of Lucid has stated that he intends to eventually manufacturer affordable EVs as well as their SUV (Gravity) and other cars. 

Q: They’re way too overvalued and they have no cars on the road.

A: You’re right, but aren’t all EVs. Rivian has an estimated valuation of 70b, despite no cars on the road. According to Lucid’s timeline we should see some of the 10,000 preorders on the roads sometime around Q3."

What's poppin' bull gang, I hope you made some awesome money last week! The spreadsheet was spot on for nearly every company, and all of my plays came to fruition! **$MT and $X ended up bagging us anywhere from 300% to 500%, $JETS gave us 1100%, and $SNAP netted us 250% on our strangles and nearly 600% on binary options!** I’m looking to keep this momentum going throughout this week as well, and with all of FAAMG (I kicked $NFLX out for $MSFT after their disgraceful earnings) set to report, this week could prove to be more lucrative than the last! We’ve got a large variety of trades we can make this week ranging from educated gambles, to good old fashioned theta plays. We’ve even have a couple of opportunities to sprinkle in some collateral plays if we wish! Let’s get into it! 

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Pinterest is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $PINS has had an average post earnings move of **14%**. The options this week are pricing in a move of *roughly 6%* on both sides of the chain, which is likely going to shrink significantly going into earnings as theta eats away at the contracts. Even though I’m extremely bullish on $PINS, this trade could honestly move either way, so I’m personally opting to play a straddle like I did with $SNAP last week. Given that we get a historically average move, we’ll be making some money on this trade. Keep in mind, this trade *is* riskier than the one we played on $SNAP, since the average historical move is smaller. Don’t over leverage yourself, and don’t be afraid to turn the straddle into a reverse iron butterfly to reduce your cost basis on the trade.

&nbsp;

- **Over the past 24 earnings seasons, Shopify has gone up nearly 75% of the time!** The odds on this trade are phenomenal, and we have quite a few options for how we want to play it.  If you want to gamble directionally, call debit spreads would be your best bet from a risk to reward standpoint. Alternatively, we can also join theta-gang for this play by selling ATM put credit spreads allowing us to net some extremely nice premiums. If you want an even safer spread, $MSFT also has a similar win-rate (~65%) while having a historically smaller move, allowing you to defend your capital in the event that the trade goes against you. Since both $SHOP and $MSFT report on different days, we can look to make this play twice to ensure we’re not overleveraged on any given day.

&nbsp;

- **Counterintuitively, $XLE is NOT a good [collateral play](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays) this week!** $XLE actually has a *higher* IV than both $XOM and $CVS, so if you wanted to play oil earnings, you’d actually be better off rolling the dice on the individual companies. I’m not sure why this is the case here. Either the MMs are catching onto my bullshit (unlikely), or there’s some nuances to trading oil that I’m not aware of.  I’m sure there’s an arbitrage play you could make regarding the individual price and IV differences proportional to the ETF holdings, but I don’t have time to crunch the numbers nor do I think I’d have enough capital to abuse it. Regardless, I just wanted to bring this to everyone’s attention since this is one of the rare cases where the collateral play puts us at a disadvantage.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I haven’t had much time to review any extra trades given that I’ve been extremely busy this weekend. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.

#Summary and Conclusion

We’ve got another fun week of earnings ahead of us! I personally tend to avoid playing FAANG stocks in general, so my analysis was concentrated elsewhere. If you see any appealing plays, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment! If you want access to more trading tools, or have any specific questions or observations you’d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links within the spreadsheet or on my profile. **Happy Trading! :)**"

I know it's not well structured, I'm trying to delete a lot of  the less useful stuff to get to the point with the latest news as they come.

Join: [https://www.reddit.com/r/EDU\_stock/new/](https://www.reddit.com/r/EDU_stock/new/) for the latest updates! 

===

We all know Chinese education stocks took a beating last Friday on rumor of non profit conversion.

Now the official regulation is out: [http://m.news.cctv.com/2021/07/24/ARTITWxyXnCQlhkq7XY0d21j210724.shtml](http://m.news.cctv.com/2021/07/24/ARTITWxyXnCQlhkq7XY0d21j210724.shtml)

&#x200B;

For New Oriental Education, my idea is BUY at the current price of $3, intrinsic value is about $4-5 for a 33% to 66% return in 3-6 months.

(Apologies that I cannot reply directly, quite a few people have messaged me on the upside being low. Obviously we want to maximize the probability of price going up, AND maximize the amt that's the price will going up by. For such as short period of 3 months, I think the probability of getting a 33%-66% return is very high with a 90%+ probability, and personally, I believe this is very attractive risk/return profile because that's the risk/reward ratio I personally look for. Some people have a more aggressive view and target stocks that have a much higher return amt but lower probability, like some have pointed out 50/50, up to $8+ or $0. As I do more work, I believe the key value of this post is to narrow down that 50/50 probability split with price of $8 or $0, to a 90/10 probability split of $5/$3. The goal is to assess short term probability of it going up, I hope my post at least got that pt across. While $2 increase may seem low to some, at high enough probability over a short enough time frame...if my thesis is to be believed, then simply buy calls to boost returns - my pt is, at a high enough certainty both on probability and timing, there's ways to structure the investment financially to lever up the returns.)

Rationale:

The new regulation mentions a few things that are unfavorable to EDU:

1. K9 core (Chinese, Math, Sciences etc) will be not for profit. Rolling out in major cities like Beijing and gradually rolled out across the country, with fees to be set by the government. For EDU, the profit margin of these will be 0.
2. No weekend/holiday tutoring of any kind. Online tutoring is to be restricted in 30 min intervals.
3. No tutoring on topics that's too advanced for the student, meaning a grade 6 student cannot do k11 materials.
4. No new tutoring companies can raise capital on the stock market via IPO
5. Existing public tutoring companies like EDU cannot acquire other tutoring companies.
6. Foreign capital cannot acquire chinese tutoring companies through M&A, VIEs, etc...This applies both in the context of a controlling interest AND general share interest.

The question is, EDU is trading at $3/share. Ignoring #6 above, what is the intrinsic value if EDU spins out the K9 core piece of business into a separate entity that's non profit. What's the remaining worth?

To assess this, I took EDU's FY2020 revenue breakdown to see how much revenue is left, then applied an EBITDA multiple, finally backed out the net debt to get the per share price:

Revenue Breakdown:

Overseas Test Prep (12% pre, 12% post, no impact)

U-CAN Secondary School (45% pre, 22.25% post, cut by half since this includes k7 to k12, assume k7 to k9 is non profit at a 50/50 split. In reality, this mix is overweight k10-k12 since tutoring mostly done by highschool students for the university exam, this is a conservative assumption on my part, you also have to factor in no holiday, no summer and winter tutoring. But this may lead to more book sales, videos that kids can watch themselves etc...the $ is there to be made if not from direct tutoring, then by other means some $ will flow into EDU.)

POP Kids (24% pre, 0% post, assume all not for profit. Music and Sports courses are likely able to keep but assume not material)

Online (4% pre,  1% post, assume online restrictions will have significant impact)

Other courses (5% pre, 5% post, no impact)

Books (10% pre, 10% post)

Overall, revenue reduced by about 50%.

Valuation: Let's use the 2020 annual revenue of $3.5 billion USD as a rough estimate. Reducing by half is 1.75BN x 12.5% EBITDA margin (compression from historical 15%, again to add conservatism about future pricing pressure even on the for profit piece) is about $225 million. At a 10x multiple (implying a 5% annual growth rate at 15% WACC) gives us 2.2BN enterprise value.

Current total debt is 2 billion, cash is 6 billion. We have 4 billion excess cash

Share count is 1714 million.

Per share value of the cash only is about 2.4/share.

Per share value of the business is 1.3/share.

Implied value is about $3.7/share. Oversold it seems.

Note this assumes immediate change. In reality, new rules are being gradually rolled out, first in major cities. Which means there's still leftover revenues to be made from now to when it's fully implemented. That might be an additional 0.25/0.5 cents a share, getting us well within the $4-5 range (apparently EDU will have as much time as needed to restructure per latest update [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/29/china-to-still-allow-ipos-in-the-us-securities-regulator-csrc-says.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/29/china-to-still-allow-ipos-in-the-us-securities-regulator-csrc-says.html)).

\[Also, THIS REDUCTION MATH IS FLAWED, I REALIZED, SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM TO SEE AN UPDATE - basically we cannot just say the k-9 will be 0, since now capacity will be freed up to tutor more highschool students at reduced prices, overall impact on profits is not half since volume will likely increase for k10-k12\]

Now onto the last piece: Foreign capital cannot acquire chinese entities.  Here is the quote ""外资不得通过兼并收购、受托经营、加盟连锁、利用可变利益实体等方式控股或参股学科类培训机构。已违规的，要进行清理整治。""

Google translate: ""Foreign capital may not control or participate in academic training institutions through mergers and acquisitions, entrusted operations, franchise chains, and the use of variable interest entities. Those who have violated regulations shall be cleaned up and rectified.""

Better translation: Foreign capital cannot gain controlling/non-controlling interest in tutoring companies through the four ways outlined (and other ways as applicable but the pt is cannot control & participate via share ownership).

This entire sentence is to limit control of foreign capital on chinese tutoring companies.  But the fact the chinese government explicitly listed those 4 ways to gain controlling interest (控股) or participate via stock ownership (参股)  ties two points together: First, the four ways explicitly listed are all ways to DIRECTLY inject capital into china, it means giving money to the tutoring company to use to grow. Second, the overall point of that paragraph is to limit the flow of foreign capital into china and halt the growth of tutoring companies (restrict supply), which when combined with no weekend/holiday tutoring, will restrict demand -> free up time for kids.

In addition, major institutions like Singapore Government's investment fund, Blackrock, JP Morgan, all institutional investors own 85% of total stock. With a significant number being foreign firms. These firms are not currently managing EDU and exert no influence, forcing them to sell or delist the stock would severely restrict all future capital investment into china AND wouldn't really matter in the context of controlling tutor companies in china at this time, since it is done retroactively. Therefore I do not believe existing shareholders of EDU will be directly impacted through a delisting or what not. It matter more if a foreign firm already has control and if a foreign firm is thinking of controlling in the future (currently in the middle of an acquisition negotiation process for example). It's helpful none of the major tutor companies are foreign owned currently.

&#x200B;

Therefore I see the foreign capital point as more of restricting FUTURE capital investment into china to stem the capital fueled growth and less so to penalize existing shareholders.

To conclude, it is likely EDU will revert to a conservative intrinsic value of $4-$5 dollars a share in the near term (3-6 months). Longer term, depends on if K10-K12 can be maintained, and if the non profit services will drive the for profit k10-12 business if so, that will drive future growth.

&#x200B;

TLDR:  Basically, buy at $3, sell at $4-5 (I personally believe upside is higher but that require a 1 year hold period or more). If the company liquidates today and give you its cash it's worth $2.4/share excluding buildings etc and after paying off debt. This ignores a business with 1 billion enterprise value (0 debt, since that was already netted against cash to get to the $2.4/share) from future operations.

&#x200B;

Edit: Further note on the no foreign ownership part. The full paragraph is as follows: "" 13.坚持从严审批机构。各地不再审批新的面向义务教育阶段学生的学科类校外培训机构，现有学科类培训机构统一登记为非营利性机构。对原备案的线上学科类培训机构，改为审批制。各省（自治区、直辖市）要对已备案的线上学科类培训机构全面排查，并按标准重新办理审批手续。未通过审批的，取消原有备案登记和互联网信息服务业务经营许可证（ICP）。对非学科类培训机构，各地要区分体育、文化艺术、科技等类别，明确相应主管部门，分类制定标准、严格审批。依法依规严肃查处不具备相应资质条件、未经审批多址开展培训的校外培训机构。学科类培训机构一律不得上市融资，严禁资本化运作；上市公司不得通过股票市场融资投资学科类培训机构，不得通过发行股份或支付现金等方式购买学科类培训机构资产；**外资不得通过兼并收购、受托经营、加盟连锁、利用可变利益实体等方式控股或参股学科类培训机构**。已违规的，要进行清理整治。 ""

Bolded section is the part I quoted earlier. If we take the words ""curriculum-based tutoring institutions"" it is  ""**学科类培训机构""**. This is what confused a lot of readers, myself included since that sentence alone seem to mean no foreign ownership in tutoring companies that teach school curriculum.

But if we look at the start of the paragraph, it defines ""**学科类培训机构**"" as institutions tutoring for compulsory education, meaning k-9. This earlier sentence defines it for us: ""各地不再审批新的面向义务教育阶段学生的学科类校外培训机构，现有**学科类培训机构**统一登记为非营利性机构。"" It means: no more approvals for tutoring companies that serve compulsory education segment (i.e. k-9), existing tutoring institutions (bolded in that sentence) will become non for profit. Therefore, within the same paragraph, the definition of ""**学科类培训机构**"" is the same, meaning foreign capital cannot own tuition services that serves the compulsory education segment. If EDU strips out k-9 related services, the rest should be allowed foreign ownership.

&#x200B;

Also, unfortunately I cannot respond directly since I don't have 100 karma. This is my first DD post after all. To address other questions on the source of my revenue breakdown. Management quarterly press release contains data for specific segments. An example: [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-oriental-announces-results-for-the-third-fiscal-quarter-ended-february-28-2021-301272286.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-oriental-announces-results-for-the-third-fiscal-quarter-ended-february-28-2021-301272286.html)

You also need management call transcripts. What I did was to go through past press releases, transcripts of management calls and looked at analyst reports (historical data only, since forward looking is all opinion) to validate the reasonability of my revenue breakdown.

Update: official release from EDU on the restrictions: [https://www.stonkmoon.com/news/EDU/aa602be4ce5e60c32b93ae35c373f162](https://www.stonkmoon.com/news/EDU/aa602be4ce5e60c32b93ae35c373f162)

Summary:

The Opinion \[That Chinese link at the very start of the post\] contains high-level policy directives about requirements and restrictions related to after-school tutoring services, including:

(i) institutions providing after-school tutoring services on academic subjects in China's compulsory education system, or Academic AST Institutions \[**学科类培训机构** per above\], need to be registered as non-profit, no approval will be granted to new Academic AST Institutions, and an approval mechanism will be adopted for online Academic AST Institutions;

(ii) foreign ownership in Academic AST Institutions is prohibited, including through contractual arrangements, and companies with existing foreign ownership need to rectify the situation;

(iii) listed companies are prohibited from raising capital to invest in businesses that teach academic subjects in compulsory education;

(iv) Academic AST Institutions are prohibited from providing tutoring services on academic subjects in compulsory education during public holidays, weekends and school breaks; and

(v) Academic AST Institutions must follow the fee standards to be established by relevant authorities.

The Opinion also provides that institutions providing after-school tutoring services on academic subjects in high schools (which do not fall within China's compulsory education system) shall take into consideration the Opinion when conducting activities.

EDU did a much better job at it than I did. Hope this clears it up for everyone, and again, compulsory education in China is k-9.

===

Edit: I think a lot of people missed this. The importance of EDU's official response is that they cleared up what the foreign ownership restriction relates to: it is for Academic AST Institutions defined as China's compulsory education (k-9) system. Meaning the rest, K10-K12 and areas like books, etc, can still be owned by foreigners AND be allowed for IPO, mergers, acquisitions etc...none of those apply to the non core, non k-9 aspects of EDU's business.

===

Update: Another note on the shorter hours. In a market where all competitors cannot tutor during holidays/weekends etc, the supply remains the same, if the market has the appetite to pay for the services, pricing won't be impacted as much. For example, if EDU charged $100 before for a course, TAL charged $95. Now both TAL and EDU cannot tutor as often, it's still EDU and TAL that's doing the tutoring (for example) with the same amount of students, IF price competition does not happen, there's no reason why EDU nor TAL should decrease their price. Tutoring time went down, but not like the consumer can go to another tutor who offers longer hours, since every tutor is restricted.

But price competition is a separate topic. See below:

&#x200B;

Saw Goldman's target of 3.6/share and their model. What GS, and my own flaw is assuming EDU will lose the not for profit revenue. That is true, but they can now have capacity to sell more to K10-K12 at reduced prices (hence get more volume at lower price/student). While margins are lower, the high school enrollment count will increase, hence the overall hit to profitability is not nearly as bad has 1/2.

Think about it this way: before, EDU had 100 students, 50 k-9, 50 k-12. Each student pays EDU $1. EDU made margin of 15%, making a total of $15 for the 100 students. Now, EDU lowers the price for each student by 1/3, making only 10% margin per student. 100 students are now all highschool. Overall profit is 100 x 10% = $10. The actual hit to profitability is only $5, not half of the old $15.

Long-term impact: now it will become a pricing war between the large players, a race to the bottom to offer much cheaper tutoring for non k-9 students and get the volume. BUT they cannot fund raise (near-term even if it's for k10-12, since gov't don't want them to grow via fundraising). So it'll be an interesting dynamic. EDU historically had positive margins, the one education company with the most cash and least debt, so there's room for EDU to decrease their price and take a hit to margin. Especially now is the perfect time to do so, and price TAL and other competitors out of the K10-k12 market, since TAL/others have less cash, and already lost money before, unless they can cut their expenses to match EDU's margins, they will have to deal with EDU who may now significant cut pricing to increase volume and take TAL/Others market share.

Let's look at the numbers:

Enrollment for EDU: middle and high school (7 million)

Enrollment for TAL: 4.6 million or roughly 5 million

GOTU: 5 million.

Total capacity by student count is about 7 + 5 + 5 million. This is about 17 million of students.

If we look at the total student count in 2019 ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/227024/number-of-students-at-high-schools-in-china/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/227024/number-of-students-at-high-schools-in-china/))

Total student count for k-7 to k-12 (7, 8, 9, is junior high, 10, 11, 12 is senior high) is 72.4 million split as 48.27 junior vs 24.14 senior in millions.

Looking at the data, I think my earlier example about 100 highschool students is probably too optimistic. That 72.4 million is for all of China, but tutor companies are more in demand in first tier and second tier cities (where ppl are richer). Plus government restricts expansion and new licenses (if we assume licenses are given out for each teaching center in a city, this means EDU/TAL etc will have a harder time to expand to new cities now). So the total addressable market (or TAM) for highschool students only is (using urban/rural pop split as a proxy - [https://www.statista.com/statistics/278566/urban-and-rural-population-of-china/#:\~:text=According%20to%20the%20Seventh%20National,million%20in%20rural%20in%202020](https://www.statista.com/statistics/278566/urban-and-rural-population-of-china/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Seventh%20National,million%20in%20rural%20in%202020).) 64% urban population x 24.14 million senior high = 15 million.

If they don't expand to rural China, for urban highschool students there's excess capacity now, this will drive pricing pressure for courses offered.

Average selling price for K7 to k12:

EDU: about 2k RMB per student (offline), Gross and EBITDA margin of company: 55% and 13-15%

TAL: 3.3k RMB per student (offline), Gross and EBITDA margin of company: 55% and 8%

GOTU: 1.5k RMB per student, Gross and EBITDA margin of company: 74% and negative -20%

Teachers related costs go into gross margin, fixed costs like renting learning centers go into after the gross margin and makes your EBITDA margin lower.

So now that we know there likely isn't enough capacity for everyone, if pricing war happens, EDU has the most room to move, they can lower their prices by probably 5% and still break even (pricing decrease and EBITDA margin decrease is not 1 to 1, for every 1% of revenue you lose, after paying fixed costs like rent that won't go down as much, you lose more than 1% in EBITDA margin, so for EDU the breakeven pt for revenue decrease is probably around 5%, since I excluded the KIDS segment from EDU's capacity, losing that will lower their margins somewhat. I know we don't have the true margin for each segment of the revenue, this assumes every segment in EDU makes the same 13-15% EBITDA margin). The same 5% decrease cannot be said for TAL and GOTU (TAL, after stripping out k-9, their EBITDA margin is likely much lower than 8%, GOTU is negative so it's a moot pt)

What I'm saying is: the total market size is barely enough to account for the excess freed capacity of the 3 players. They'll have to lower prices to get more volume. How much that counteracts the loss of k9 revenues is debatable, but EDU is the best positioned out of the 3.

&#x200B;

Therefore: if you want to hedge your bets, the long/short play is probably long EDU and short GOTU. But I prefer to have all of the upside at EDU's current price so I personally went 100% EDU long via a mix of calls and stocks.

Update: [https://vnexplorer.net/chinas-state-media-moves-to-reassure-rattled-investors-after-rout-wiped-us574-billion-off-stock-market-er2021314452.html](https://vnexplorer.net/chinas-state-media-moves-to-reassure-rattled-investors-after-rout-wiped-us574-billion-off-stock-market-er2021314452.html)

I wasn't able to find the original article on: [http://www.cs.com.cn/](http://www.cs.com.cn/) (the one telling people to buy the dip). If anyone can find the link to the original please paste via response below.

But if true. The window to buy is probably closing fast. Chinese government usually signals in subtle ways: First, in the official regulation that restricted foreign ownership for k-9, it ended that paragraph with ""you figure out how to comply yourselves"", not directly taking ownership away, not banning k-12, this enables a spinout to take place and gives ""wiggle room"". Second, official regulation was deliberately vague on high school and excluded high school (which is the most intense period of tutoring) from the strictest interpretation of China's new rules. Now the state-run newspaper is telling people to basically view this as a buying opportunity for Chinese stocks in general.

Some pundits may not trust the Chinese government, but so far it has been logical steps from China's government's perspective. 1. Regulate tutoring more as the cost has gone out of control (I agree, EDU's stock price leading up to Feb 2021 is an indication) 2. Timing makes sense cause of the 3 child policy that got announced recently 3. Upcoming IPOs on the education space are in progress (the regulation halts that immediately, investors in the pre-IPO ones are likely the most impacted AFTER EDU's share bounce back of course).

Now, with the massive wipe in value in China's stock market since entire sectors are down, not only EDU obviously (the stock market is where a significant number of Chinese citizens invest their savings btw, they don't have a social benefit system as well as Canada or Europe, so that's literally retirement money). So it's in gov't best interest now to make sure it doesn't go out of control for ALL Chinese stocks.

Forecasting timing of moves is the hardest part. Much harder than the intrinsic value calc, business model potential changes etc. After all, the famous economist John Maynard Keynes once said, “the markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.""

===

Update: I wanted to elaborate a bit more on why China is doing what it's doing. We know birth rates are declining and tuition schools are out of control as of late in China. What the regulation is actually doing is to basically force the industry to consolidate (not rocket science I know). But under normal circumstances usually industries consolidate when market becomes saturated. Given China's student population AND the fact government want 3 kids now, clearly market will grow (or so government hopes). But it also means the tutor industry will grow even more out of control (especially with foreign capital, making money off teaching Chinese kids). How to control the cost aspect (encourage more births), but also control this potentially overheating sector. Some may say it's freedom of thought etc, but I think the more important issue is when one sector overheats (grows so big so fast), it'll suck in more capital and have a very real influence on the overall Chinese capital markets given the size of the industry.  If Chinese government doesn't step in now, the education sector could grow to much larger and will sway the overall Chinese market, that's worrying as well.

It's actually very smart to simply announce that government is banning tutoring (some elements) AND banning foreign capital (some elements). Capital markets, despite what efficient market hypothesis will tell you, is actually not super smart cause it's still a population of people. Near term everyone will shun education sector in China. No more capital AND government saying they'll subsidize public schools to tutor as well means what? Price competition. Chinese government is using capitalism to work for its own goals of lowering tutoring costs. The Chinese government doesn't have to actually pay any $ to subsidize public schools, way before that happens, due to the efficiency of the capitalist sytem, tutoring companies like EDU/TAL/etc will start to drop prices themselves, saving Chinese gov't having to spend any $ to subsidize public schools to build up their own programs to compete against EDU/TAL/etc.

&#x200B;

Very soon, public tutoring companies won't be able to make a profit cause of price competition amongst themselves, and a few will be left WITH CHEAP COURSES. If at that point the ""survivors"" dare to raise price, it's very easy to control, since foreign capital is gone. Capital within China is easily controlled.

&#x200B;

What is the cost of doing this from the Chinese govern't perspective: short term stock market goes down, but it may basically stop education industry growth for a very, very long time, since after the ""winner"" comes up on top, there's a monopoly basically, no more new entrants etc. and easy to control. Near-term pain for Chinese stock market, for long term stability and avoid overheat in the education sector. During which China is free to boost population growth via birth rates or whatever, with the possibility of education sector overheating out of the equation.

All that's needed is a simple announcement of ""k-9 will be not for profit (and ban foreign ownership :P)"".

&#x200B;

So what does this mean IF EDU wins in the end? 1. EDU will become more like an ""infrastructure"" investment with margins fixed by the government, essentially working as an extension of the chinese public school system. 2. There'll still be a demand for premium tutors, cause the underlying chinese economy is capitalist, but these premium services will be private and will be super careful to go under the radar, not grow too big or the same investor own like 100 different private companies across all regions in china, so it appears each ""premium"" tutoring company is still small as to not attract attention.

Back to EDU, worst case, long-term it's a publicly traded Chinese ""utilities-like"" company. To be fair those trade at decent multiples due to stability of revenues etc. So essentially China is IPO'ing a part of the public education system through this change (i.e. bringing in EDU/TAL etc into the public education system but publically traded).

Update: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/29/china-to-still-allow-ipos-in-the-us-securities-regulator-csrc-says.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/29/china-to-still-allow-ipos-in-the-us-securities-regulator-csrc-says.html)

"" However, the securities commission’s Fang said the policy was intended to reduce the burden on parents — not shut off foreign investment — and the education companies will have as much time as needed to restructure, according to the source. ""

Good to hear. EDU might go back up to $6-$8 by year end.

===

Update August 3rd, 2021: I know the stock has been relatively ""stable"" as of late. No large movements (if you are a long-term investor, current movements are not ""large"" by any means). Unfortunately, I cannot say that I would know, definitively, when the pop will come, nor do I have any real data to share. But, noticed [https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3143557/china-names-top-computer-scientist-head-education-ministry](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3143557/china-names-top-computer-scientist-head-education-ministry) head of education got replaced August 2nd, slight ""tweaks"" to policy may come, but most importantly, the key piece of info I'm waiting on is EDU's delayed management call (whenever that may be).

&#x200B;

===

Update August 4th 2021: It seems EDU has started setting up separate schools for k-9 segment. ([https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/2021-08-04/doc-ikqcfncc0911049.shtml](https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/2021-08-04/doc-ikqcfncc0911049.shtml)) Perhaps it may hint as to how EDU will pivot during mgmt call (which is currently delayed TBD)

===

Still do not believe EDU will get delisted at all, CEO is well known in China, demand for EDU's services won't be satisfied near term (public schools simply do not have capacity), and in addition to cash value, the brand of EDU is worth quite a bit as well. Anyways, I do not want to get into too much of the assumptions/hearsay, but I wanted to reaffirm my conviction in this play. If you are still in this, then let's ride it out together. Many thanks!

Well the virus and variants didn't get bored.

Reviewing the top five economies and their case trends -------------------------

Source : Worldometers.info

USA:  new cases curving upward, especially in FL

China:  they lie about their numbers

Japan:  new cases increasing at a roughly linear rate

Germany: new cases growing again, though off of a low base

France:  new cases surging and strong in the numbers, curving up

UK:  new cases surged though showing signs of starting to drop

Keeping your elder family members safe from your infecting them is still a cultural truth.

One political party in a given country wants to make another fail.  One party will weaponize the virus and threaten the other to take action.  This is what leads to restrictions.  Before it was the Democrats shutting down businesses to make the economy worse for Republicans.  Now it is the same, but Repub states will shut down and Dem states will want to keep businesses open.  In another country similar games will play out.

So all the potential economic shut downs are still there.

What is different is that all the technology that was bought to have the kids educate from home, such as tablets and web cams and online meeting subscriptions don't need to be bought a second time so soon.  So the 2nd set of restrictions on the population comes without a sector that gets an economic boost.  The exception is grocery stores and online shopping.

The extra unemployment benefits end on Sept 6th in numerous states, but investors know that and would sell effected stocks sooner.  The moratorium on evictions ends this fall, and so tenants will stop the games and scramble to pay their landlords, taking away their spending money.  If they don't they will get an eviction on their credit record.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

Now to valuations

[https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe)

shows that the Schiller PE ratio of stocks is 38.3.  The .com bubble was the highest it ever got, higher than this level for 2.5 years, and getting to the mid 40's.  Other then that, at no time in history was this valuation ratio this high.

Note also that in 1982 at the peak of interest rates 13 to 14%, the average stock had a PE of 7 to 9.

A book by O'Shoughnessy ""What Works on Wall Street"" studied 40 years of stock market data.  Its results shows that a price to sales ratio is 'the king of value factors', since sales can't be manipulated like earnings can.

[https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales)

shows that this valuation is higher now than at any time charted.  The book suggests that a price to sales of 1.5 is considered a good deal.  We are over twice that level on average.

The market breadth has eroded under the mega techs.  Not the Russel 2000 declined recently.

Here are the price to sales of the mega techs, using data at Reuters.  This can be hard to find in navigation, but a direct link will help, for example

[https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.N](https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.N)

use .N and .O at the end of the symbol for NYSE and NASDAQ.

price to sales:

MSFT = 13.3 ; FB = 10.4 ; AAPL = 7.5 ; AMZN = 4.3 ; GOOG = 8.76 ; NVDA = 25.2 ; AMD = 9.5

These clearly can fall and still be overvalued.

Some have sighted the growth in the money supply, such as M2, as part of what has pushed the market higher.  However, it is important to note that M2 was recategorized in 2020.  So even though you can go to the Mises Institute's site and see articles of big increases in the M2 money supply, much of that is due to the recategorization and strangely the articles omit this but for a footnote.

Inflation ----------------------------------------------

A large part of what we pretend to understand about inflation is the CPI and PCE.

We think that we know that the last CPI reading was 5.4%.  That is above the target of 2% of course when action by the recipe is needed.  This coupled with Powell not wanting to raise rates and desiring to de-prioritize inflation is ""bad enough"" from a stock perspective.  Jim Cramer described Powell as ""having a heart"" in wanting to prioritize helping people back to work.  Recall that interest rates have to be jacked up in response to inflation eventually.  Acting to late makes it worse.  From business school texts, higher interest rates put downward pressure on the value of future earnings.  Thus the forward looking value of stocks drops.

  But I challenge all of you to take the CPI by its percentage components and REBUILD it yourself with online research.  I did.  While the published number was +1.6% year over year at the time, I found no component less than 2%, and most were a good deal higher.  It is easy to find information showing education expenses rising at a +5% annual rate for many years.  Medical costs I found web sites saying +4% annually consistantly over many years.  At the time, only oil was lower than 2% price growth.  Today, with oil back up above $70 a barrel, that is not to be taken lightly.

  Recently the Fed has emphasized the PCE, the Personal Consumption Expendatures index.  Do you find as I do it strange that they publish the 'this month vs last month' number, making it look like small 0.1 to 0.3% rise, and not the more useful year over year number, which would show a larger % increase?

  The National Debt takes no small part in the desire to have inflation be low and keep interest rates low.  But that combination is impossible over time.

  I have been at individual stock investing since 1996 and I have sold most of my stock holdings.  I lived through the .com crash which I took on the chin (with small dollars since I was young and I learned from it such that I was 66% in cash for the crash of 2008.  If you have not been in the habit of thinking about economic impacts, valuations, and questioning what real inflation is, it is certainly time to start.

  The great bull market of the 1980's in the USA was spurred by the acceleration of women entering the work force and the personal computer.  The great bull market of the 1990's was spurred by implementation of the internet, immigration, and foreign economies developing.

  What is the story now?  5G networking is just a faster version of the same thing, but only over shorter distances.  Artificial intelligence is intended to replace humans.  Electric vehicles only reduce pollution after 100k miles according to an article in the WSJ.  I think to move on to much higher valuations we need a big economic story that just isn't there right now."

They started building software for the intelligence community in the US to assist in counterterrorism investigations by helping them identify patterns hidden deep within large data sets. Later, they realized that similarly to the intelligence community, commercial institutions did not have the most effective tools to manage and make sense of the data involved in large projects. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9fvuzczr1tc71.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b5c0be5fc4da1a37bbbbfdfc8893617d005ee3e

Any large scale company or business will always collect a ton of data most often stored in texts such as spreadsheets or databases (which requires programming knowledge to navigate through). A common issue large companies have is simply having too much data. Palantir creates software that consolidates a company's data and displays it in a comprehensible, easily digestible user interface for the company to use. This allows Palantir to work with companies/organizations like the CDC for medicine, the military for national security, etc. 

With Palantir, a normal non-technical operator can click their computer to pull up an order, or an issue that Palanrie detected, make any changes and or notify whoever needs the attention. Let's take the CDC for example. When the vaccine rolled out, Palantir had a huge hand in this. Palantir gives a visual display of where the vaccine is going, how many, and any issues that have risen (if any), allowing for fast response time. For example, Palantir could display a map with the various routes to different deployment sites with pictures of a little truck representing the shipments being routed to their destination. An operator could click one of these shipments/routes and pull up any data of that specific point. With data being displayed and organized in this way it makes it easy to analyze data, where things are going, and what kind of picture the data represents, rather than staring at a spreadsheet of numbers. This is just one example, Palantir is customizable enough where it can represent any business/organization's structure.

Palantir’s revenue streams consist of their two main software: [Gotham](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-gotham/), which was designed primarily for the defence and intelligence sector, and [Foundry](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-foundry/) for the commercial sector. However, the platforms are not exclusive to either sector. For example, Gotham is also offered to commercial customers in the financial services industry. The two platforms can either be used separately or bundled together as a single ecosystem. Currently, revenue is more or less evenly split between the government and commercial sectors. 

Gotham’s main tools include:

Gaia – lets users plan, execute, and report on operations via a shared live map. Live maps track real-time data and users drag and drop objects from other Gotham applications directly into Gaia.

Dossier – is a live collaboration document editor to share analysis and discover intelligence. Users can collaborate across teams and organizations to create a living, interactive, and up-to-date document.

Video – an application designed to interact with both streaming and historical video data. Users can review video footage in the platform as well as enhance raw footage with geospatial information and overlays based on other data sources.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q927qfws1tc71.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaaf57a3db79d3446b09c24f5205bc918159d4e1

Foundry’s main tools include:

Contour – enables exploration of large-scale data. Users can filter, join, and visualize datasets to answer analytical questions and publish the results as a report or new dataset that will automatically update with the underlying datasets.

Object Explorer – allows users to interact with data represented as objects – like customers, equipment, or plants – rather than rows in a table.

As we know, Palantir started in the defence and intelligence space. This required Palantir to have elite-level security from the start. Their software had to be secure enough to handle national secrets and transparent enough to ensure that the data could be monitored and traced. This was no easy feat, however, Palantir managed to achieve this, which is why they have been renewing their contracts with several government agencies.

This is important when trying to sell their products to their commercial clients because they need something safe and reliable to protect themselves and their data. Furthermore, Palantir currently has IL-5 clearance with the Department of Defense, which makes them 1 of 4 software companies with this level of clearance, alongside Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP (Google and Snowflake have IL-2 clearance). It has also been rumoured that Palantir may achieve IL-6 clearance, which has never been done before as it is the storage/processing of classified information.

This level of clearance should speak volumes to how safe and secure Palantir’s technology is and should provide ease of mind to companies that they are in business with."

“We are a software and technology company that powers the global travel industry. We partner with airlines, hoteliers, agencies and other travel partners to retail, distribute and fulfill travel. We connect the world’s leading travel suppliers, including airlines, hotels, car rental brands, rail carriers, cruise lines and tour operators, with travel buyers in a comprehensive travel marketplace.” - 10-k

To put this in perspective, they power all travel market places and have no competitors

**Long-term play:**

The company makes money off the volume of travel, not price, so as soon as the DELTA variable winds down and travel begins to pick back up this business will be fine. business is underpriced considering it was trading around $23 before covid

**short term play:**

short interest is at 20%, with earnings in two weeks possible short-squeeze.

Bought 5k of shares and $500 of calls. Will add on after listening to earnings call first week of august. Will try to write this play up better in the coming weeks if people are interested."

Shouldnt Robinhood be worth like $0.8B, why are they being valued at 100 times more than Fidelity? 

Robinhood has less assets and offer less services, what am I missing here?

Also why do they think they are entitled to a third of their customers assets, seriously they are basically just calling their customers degen gamblers, but how long can they just expect people to lose money?

Really hoping this IPO actually opens at $85B valuation."

[Top 10 Stocks on mainstream media \(past 4 weeks\) - source: stock-shark.com](https://preview.redd.it/0ah954s6q5c71.jpg?width=972&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9a2911373f9ee8a1974304e75b3203bc8b99600f)

The top companies mentioned on the news has been relatively unchanged, Pfizer & AstraZeneca has received continues news converge mainly to their vaccine roll out. Most of these stocks are significantly overvalued now.

[https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/explore?q=Pfizer,AstraZeneca](https://preview.redd.it/bobuqi28s5c71.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9367fd86e9fd6ef07eb5c5e6a4d8dec0286b269)

As you can see Pfizer significantly peaked during COVID, followed by AstraZeneca, AZN seem to be declining in news coverage . Both stocks have a EV to sales ratio of about 6\~.

**Google Search Trends**

But lets take a look deeper on the top 10 stocks on google search instead. What are investors actually searching for?

[Top 10 stocks on Google search - source: stock-shark.com](https://preview.redd.it/0evq6uf2t5c71.jpg?width=940&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf98aba36eeb996434171ccbbe6046a053b85537)

The top searches on google looks very different and gives us some interesting insights in Realtime interests.

[BLNK - Blink Charging Co](https://stock-shark.com/stocks/BLNK) has the highest search volume in the past 4 weeks. They specialize in electric vehicle charging equipment. Very overvalued at this point with a **Enterprise to Sales ratio of 282**!

That is 282x it's sales to enterprise value, which absolutely bananas.. It seems mainly driven by social media/ retail investor hype. Could this be a stock to short?

[Blink Charging has been declining ever since.](https://preview.redd.it/9isrfve7w5c71.jpg?width=724&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4dc2990aeea6a979a2b5f76a08d09da0ed622160)

So we can use google search trends to see what stocks are over hyped, or which stocks are feared.

For example lets look at [JD](https://stock-shark.com/stocks/JD), number 7 on the top google searches, and the only one that has a EV to sales ratio of less then 1. (JD is an internet market place in China)

https://preview.redd.it/naoxq89fx5c71.jpg?width=714&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e06cd5c48f84d1b3386a2fc5fc3909b0a67f9b28

JD is declining in price, but why? Well most of it is due to Chinese regulators clamping down on tech companies. So that has been allot of negative press lately. Retail investors seem to be existing their positions. But is this wise? 

Well JD has an enterprise value to sales ratio of  **0.92**, which is one of the few large tech companies in the market today 's that is actually **undervalued**. They have a avg sales growth of about 7%.

This is actually a really rare Jem.

Anyway, if you guys find this analysis useful, i would love to do more. Peace!

Today, I compiled all open interest of AMC calls and puts. The total amount of open contracts for calls/puts are roughly similar. However, the distribution of open in-the-money contracts are highly in-favor for puts. Below you will find the summary by total, expiration dates, and strike price. Data is current as of 7/14/21.

**UPDATE 07/15**: Posting my position screenshot per request. 🚀🚀🚀

https://preview.redd.it/1rf401nq1hb71.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bb755fad583d2feea6af2ad2be6d76ba5a6f7df

I know next-to-nothing about money markets, but I know a lot about EVs and the car sales industry.

My small business has put a lot of EVs on the road over the past year, and I am on a **quest to put most, if not all, of my earnings into EV Charging Stations!**

People are buying and leasing cars they can’t put gas in, but they still gotta go places, so I want to buy in to the Charge Stations!

I want to buy in to the most convenient charge network: one that delivers a fast charge in convenient places where I’d park anyway.

**Tl\~dr**: $EVGO went on sale today as they acquired PlugShare.com. The best charging network bought the best site for finding a charger. **I like $EVGO and bought a lot! Then I bought more!** – Actual EV drivers on the East Coast prefer this charge network. So do [GM](https://www.evgo.com/press-release/general-motors-and-evgo-aim-to-accelerate-widespread-ev-adoption-by-adding-fast-chargers-nationwide/), [Tesla](https://www.evgo.com/press-release/evgo-further-extends-nations-largest-fast-charging-network-to-tesla-drivers/), [Nissan](https://www.evgo.com/case-studies/nissan-evgo-five-years-ev-infrastructure-leadership-counting/), [BMW](https://www.evgo.com/press-release/bmw-helps-ev-drivers-plug-into-evgo-charging-network-for-fast-reliable-and-100-renewable-charging/), [Ford](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2015/11/17/ford-offers-three-years-complimentary-charging-c-max-energi.html), and the [Biden administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-biden-administration-advances-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure/). EVgo has the balance of cost-to-install and utility-to-drivers figured out, which is absolutely key to scaling in this industry.

**I don't like $CHPT** \- I think it's a trap because the product is not very useful in real life, despite being “#1 largest EVSE network in the US”. The more I unravel, the more I realize that this network is more about raising money/valuation than it is about charging cars and getting drivers on their way.

**BG & Motivation**

People will need to charge their cars, and EV adoption is climbing big time, so it seems like investing in charge stations is a great bet, as long as you invest in the right one!

This idea started because I actually wanted to own my own charge station in a strip mall.. or a Wendy’s parking lot… or something. My research into that taught me enough about the material costs of electricians and permits… and thus I have pivoted into trying to buy charge station stock, instead of a physical charge station. (If anyone knows how I can own my own commercial EVSE in strip malls in NJ, please message me! I am interested!)

**Who am I? \[I try to restrict being a shill to this section\]**

Everyone is presumed a shill posting investment advice here. Here is my stake: I own and operate a 1-man car lease brokerage LLC. I help connect people that want to lease new Hyundai Cars & SUVs (Electric, Gas, and Hybrid) to authorized dealerships that have those cars at fair prices. I post content (including price guidelines) on car buying/leasing forums to better educate prospective customers on market conditions when it comes to leasing their new ride. Beyond that, customers can text me, where I charge a $249 brokerage fee to provide a more personal level of service, and an escalation point outside of the dealership. You may have seen enough “dealership horror stories” to understand why I may have a place in the new car market. Frankly, my level of pricing/process transparency is unique in the US market for new Hyundai vehicles. All that aside, this post isn’t about getting you in a new car today.. it’s about profiting off of charging your car in the future, whatever you buy/lease and wherever you buy/lease it from.

**If you look at how important Gas prices have been to the economy… it’s a no-brainer that EV charging is going to be big money.**

More chargers will be a necessity, and the lack of enough fast chargers is a potential bottleneck to seeing more new EVs join the road. If there is nowhere to charge the cars, I’m worried that I will lose opportunities to connect prospective customers to new EVs. As an EV driver myself, I find EVgo to be the most convenient app and station network to find a charger, and so I bought a heavy position in CLII before the merger. Today, I bought more as the stock dipped below $11 again!

**Why EVgo is the Best Charge Network for Consumers.**

EVGO stations are, on average, and by my approximation, 30-50x more expensive to install, but charge a car 7x faster – compared to the average Chargepoint Station. Over 100 miles of range per hour, vs 25 miles of range per hour (again this is on average – most of Chargepoint’s stations are Level 2).

Electrify America (Volkswagen) does have a few faster stations that are, on average, 100x more expensive to install than ChargePoint Level 2 stations, or 3x+ more expensive to install than EVGO stations. Those stations can charge compatible cars, even faster, [as fast as 160 miles in 22 minutes](https://media.electrifyamerica.com/en-us/releases/75). but I believe the infrastructure costs will keep those stations at designated sites, major interstates, etc.

EVGO provides that “Sweet spot” where its feasible to deploy to the average American strip mall, 50kW charge stations in more places. Per Forbes: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2020/07/09/the-future-of-ev-charging-may-be-at-50kw-not-the-gasoline-thinking-of-250kw](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2020/07/09/the-future-of-ev-charging-may-be-at-50kw-not-the-gasoline-thinking-of-250kw)

As an EV Driver, it is delightful to pull up to a station that is conveniently near the shops/business/attraction you already want to go to, and know your car can add 100 miles of range per hour while you’re parked running your errands. In my opinion, in this business, it’s not about a race to having the fastest charge station in the middle of nowhere where you have to watch Netflix in your car. This is what EVGO gets right, consumer-facing. Fast enough charging in the right places.

**Why EVGO makes sense as an Investment to Me.**

In addition to a superior charging network, and partnerships with major automotive players, the executive leadership at EVGO has strong ties to the Biden Administration. Biden recently test drove the all-electric F150 with a big smile on his face, so I’m going with the political climate of EVs and EV charge stations to be healthy. Biden also visited an EVgo station recently.

My philosophy is that even if this dips, people will \*need\* to charge their cars, and there’s no way it’s not a solid long-term play. This stock doubled in price when the EVGO/CLII merger was first announced, but now it’s basically back down to its original valuation, which is what made me feel that now is the time to strike again.

Additional Facts:

* EVGO is the only 3rd party charge network that displays its own logo in-Dash on charging Teslas (due to partnership with Tesla)
* EVGO only builds new stations that will be cash-flow positive in 7 years or less, based on their model of EV adoption in given locales.

**Why CHPT is Annoying for Consumers.**

The problem with Chargepoint is two-fold.

1. Most of their chargers are sloowwww.. but labeled as “Level 2 fast chargers” (25 miles of range added to your car, per hour plugged in)
2. “Find a Charger” apps/GPS/etc don’t always differentiate charger types when routing, frequently directing EV drivers to shit stations that leave them stranded in parking lots for extreme amounts of time. Frequently, the driver thinks they are going to a “fast charger” – but their definition of Fast is very different from Chargepoint’s definition of fast.

The advantage of Chargepoint is: it’s simple & cheap to install. You just need a 240V 40A circuit, such as one for a dryer or air compressor, to add a Chargepoint to your existing building/lot. If you want to charge faster than this, you need 480V three-phase power. The difference in investment-to-install goes from a $10k job to install one charger to a $300k+ job to install one charger.

The result is Chargepoint advertises this massive network of chargers, but in reality they’re only useful if they’re at.. say.. a hotel.. where your car will be plugged in overnight. You see these things at supermarkets and hospitals and at strip malls all over, but they only recoup 20-30 miles of range while you’re in the store running your errands, basically negating any benefit after circling a parking lot and finding one to plug in. You also see a bunch of small Boomer town halls getting excited about “being part of the future” for installing one ChargePoint L2 [charger](https://www.kingston-ny.gov/evstations) in a [municipal](https://www.kioskmarketplace.com/news/connecticut-town-installs-ev-charging-station/) lot somewhere.

The best example I can give is, on two different occasions I got stuck on a Chargepoint. My destination was 100 or 200 miles away, but I only had about 30 miles of range left on my car. The nearest Chargepoint was 25 miles away, and the nearest DC Fast Charger was about 50 miles away. I could not make it to the Fast Charger, so I had to divert to a Chargepoint. Since the Chargepoint was a detour, I needed to sit at the Chargepoint to recoup 40 miles of range before I’d be able to make it to the fast charger. So I spent 90 minutes in a hospital parking lot in the middle of nowhere. Then, my car had just enough range to drive to the nearest fast charger. Once I got to the fast charger, another 90 minutes added 300 miles of range to my car. But still, because I was 10 miles short on range getting there, I had no option but to add nearly 3 hours of detour. Over 80% of Chargepoints are useless for getting you any further than the next charging station. Consumers expect the average charge station to perform 10-12x faster than what most of Chargepoint’s fleet provides! (And 10-12x faster than Chargepoint is still a lot slower than getting Gas)

**Why Reddit Has Made me Think CHPT is Also a Scheme.. Financially**

So this part is inspired by Reddit. I noticed during the height of the GME volatility that there really was enough evidence of some of these “popular” blogs pushing an anti-GME shill agenda type of thing. I saw that Cramer interview and I took a step back and realized that it did make sense that the companies buying Google Ads to hype stocks might have a financial stake in those values. And sure enough, when you Google for NYSE:CHPT, those same type of sites come up: StockNews, SeekingA\*pha, InvestorPlace, Motley Fool, etc. These guys are pumping CHPT, and so this is where I can see this alleged shill-blog behavior (could be either ignorant or dishonest) in a market and landscape I actually understand the fundamentals of.

I think about being stuck for 90 minutes at a Chargepoint to add 40 miles of range to make it to an Electrify America where 90 minutes added 300 miles of range and took me home, and I call bullshit on these Pro-$CHPT articles. Thank you, Reddit, and thank you to those sites themselves that tipped off the general public at how they work during the period of peak GME-volatility. That historical information gives me confidence in asking this \*opinion\*, and shower thought, “What if a large Chargepoint shareholder actually tried to use a Chargepoint Station, got stranded or inconvenienced on the side of the road, and realized that this needs to pump/dump to get out, thus paying for some media coverage to hype the stock?”

I just don’t want to buy $CHPT because the service isn’t useful to me. The question I’d love to ask anyone that owns that stock is, is the service useful to you? Have you used it to charge your electric car?

**A point on Electrify America (main competitor of EVgo growth)**

What not everyone knows is that **Electrify America is a wholly owned subsidiary of Volkswagen, and its existence is punitive, as a result of the Dieselgate settlement**.

The Electrify America stations are awesome, but also very costly to deploy. 150kW charging needs really beefy transformers and electrical equipment to charge your car that fast. On interstates, 150kW and 350kW charging will be king. But on the more local level, in malls and supermarket and movie theater parking lots, EVGO can install 50kW stations at a fraction of the cost of what VW Group is installing 150kW EA stations at. Electrify America is also a bit of a showcase of the technology, and enables VW to sell more cars like the Porsche Taycan to compete with Tesla. Their end-game is more about interstates than about around-town EV charging. EA’s pricing is also currently regulated as a result of the whole dieselgate fiasco, whereas EVGO’s pricing is not regulated, and the charge station owner is free to mark up the electricity.

**Final Point: EVSEs are more like ATMs than Gas Stations.**

I believe that the EVGO model will ultimately follow the ATM model. An enterprising company will put one in every parking lot that makes sense until there is saturation. At that point, rent and rates can be negotiated between the business/utility/ATM owner. Gas Stations are more standalone, whereas the sell of EVSEs is putting them in places that make strategic sense – where people are already driving and spending 45-120 minutes in one place.

In Summary, I like $EVGO. I don't like $CHPT. And if you haven’t yet: Try driving an electric car! They’re so much fun to drive as long as you can find a place to charge!

Thank you for reading!

ok4l9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ok4l9c/i_analyzed_the_performance_of_companies_in_the/,I analyzed the performance of companies in the “best places to work list” over the past 10 years and benchmarked it against S&P 500. Here are the results.,696,122,2021-07-14 21:42:01,"**Preamble:** Every year Fortune publishes the top 100 companies to work for in the world. The results are based on an anonymous survey conducted on over half a million employees.

I wanted to check whether companies where people are the happiest to work produced better returns for their shareholders when compared to the market. My hypothesis is based on two assumptions

a. An employee would create his/her best possible output when they truly love the place they work

b. Companies with excellent culture would create a feedback loop to attract top talent by word of mouth and referrals.

I feel that both of these factors would contribute to the company innovating over their competitors and creating outsized investor returns.

**Data:** There are a lot of players that create the best companies to work for list. I chose Fortune as they are the most established company and have been doing this over the past 20 years. Their survey sample size is also very high (more than 5,00,000 anonymous responders), which would give us a fair representation and minimize the chances of false positives.

For this analysis, I took companies present in the best places to work for list in the last 10 years (2012-2021). But, not all the companies on the list are public and listed. So, the current analysis will only focus on the companies whose shares are listed.

All the data used in the analysis is shared in a Google sheet at the end.

**Analysis Methodology:** Every year Fortune publishes its result on the 2nd week of February. I have considered two different ways to invest in the best companies to work

a. You invest in the company as soon as the list comes out and hold for 1 year and then sell and repeat this every year

b. You invest in the company and hold (This is based on the assumption that company culture does not change year over year and once the company makes it into a list, it’s a good long-term investment)

Returns from the above strategies are then compared to the S&P 500 returns \[1\] over the same period.

**Results**

https://preview.redd.it/fxgwbdq9m6b71.png?width=1032&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a26a48dd0922c14776c97a6fab8ba706315aadd

The companies in the best places to work consistently beat S&P500 in stock returns. There is a noticeable difference in return as you move up the list with the best place to work (Rank-1) beating the market comfortably by 9.5% every year! \[2\]. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/uxfqsqebm6b71.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=93e4c7d47160e3accf8fbc845417413ef3e367a4)

The difference in returns becomes more noticeable if you buy and hold the company for the long term. Here we can see a steady increase in returns as you move up the ranking ladder with the top company returning a whopping 131.5% more than the index over the last 10 years. This also validates our assumption that companies having great cultures create superior investor returns over the long term.

Now that it’s out of the way, we can dive deeper into the data and find out which stocks made the best returns and how your returns would have faired over the years.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/4s97sp3dm6b71.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f5aa6f005cc1f72f5acb30c5f15180567ac27a0)

The best long-term return among the top companies to work for was generated by Adobe! The stock has returned 1762% over the last 10 years. As expected, tech companies have generated the most amount of returns with Microsoft, Google, and Adobe all present multiple times.

For our final analysis, we can check if the returns were consistent throughout the years or was it just a few years that are contributing to the overall positive results.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/tcry8ieem6b71.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=48368f25abadca99ca2f9e7ba0184b10b3b45d13)

I think this graph shows one of the most important takeaways from this analysis. As we can see best companies to work for have beaten SPY by a considerable margin in 8 out of the 10 years (80%) of our analysis timeframe. Even in the years that our strategy did not beat the market, the difference between the returns was negligible.

**Conclusion**

No matter how you slice it, the above analysis shows that companies that are exceptional places to work create exceptional returns to their shareholders.

I think this ties in nicely with our initial hypothesis that companies having great culture will have happy employees that create the best possible results and also would attract top talent. Both of these in turn would lead to market-beating shareholder returns.

Now you know what to do when the next year's results come out!

**Footnotes**

\[1\] I have considered the benchmark as S&P500 as the Best Companies to Work for list contains companies across industries and I think that S&P500 is a fairer representation of the overall list.

\[2\] 6 out of the last 10 years, the top company to work for was Google.

ojznqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ojznqe/screening_for_breakouts/,Screening for breakouts,37,33,2021-07-14 15:59:01,"Okay, so I have had enough of missing out all these massive premarket plays, that end up going up 100's of percent up when market opens. Everyday I open my trading app, only to find some stock that has gone up 150% in a matter of minutes. There has to be a statistical way to catch these.

Now I want to present to you this wonderful options strategy, known as the straddle. Now, for most of you retards this is going to be more complex than your smooth brain can handle, but I assure you, I'm gonna lay this out as simply as possible. A straddle essentially involves buying a put and call of the same quantity ATM. This way you are looking to make bank on volatility, since the movement of the options is cancelled out (the strategy is delta neutral). Now, why not just buy naked calls/puts you ask, because this is the tradition among retards on this subreddit. Well, that's because with naked puts/calls you have to actually predict which way the underlying instrument goes. With a straddle you don't. It moves up bigly, you make money. It moves down bigly, you make money. As long as it doesn't hover around the same ATM strike (usually within 2% of each direction, but this depends on IV and a bunch of other factors) you are gonna make money.

This is what a straddle profit/loss graph looks like:

[Straddle P\/L graph. Not mine, found it on google. ](https://preview.redd.it/u1wx30bqw4b71.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=82fde30aafef64a52f80cc58cb4ed98f44b25d25)

&#x200B;

The one thing that is setting all these plays apart, is massive volume in the premarket. We are talking volume that is sometimes 100-200% higher than average volume. This usually already causes a jump in the stock price. Now in order to actually profit of this strategy, one actually has to know the percentage of these plays that go on to have massive moves during market open, and also what this average move is. I haven't back tested this, hence I don't have this info, because I don't really know how. If someone could suggest how to do this, id be willing to analyse the data.

Hence this is what I propose. Note, this is not going to work for all stocks, as some of these stocks are relatively unknown, and have no options contracts issued on them.

Step by step guide:

1. In the premarket use FINVIZ to scan for unusual volume activity. You want liquid stocks. So I suggest setting the average volume to 1million, current volume to 2 million and the most important part, relative volume to above 3. The relative volume is crucial, because this is what measures current volume compared to average volume. The higher this number the better, since the further the current volume is from average volume.
2. Once you find a stock you that meets the above criteria, check the company out. Was there news? No news usually means smth is up, and this is prolly gonna moon/crash. It means someone knows smth you dont, and there is a market inefficiency which you can exploit. Also, check the company is actually worth smth, and not one of those Chinese shell companies that are a complete scam.
3. Before market opens, check option availability. If options are available you are in luck. Construct the straddle, and have a look at [optionsprofitcalculator.com](https://optionsprofitcalculator.com) how much you need the stock to move to make money. You can construct a straddle using the 2 legged option. Note, the price of the straddle and most of this info is going to be different when market opens, because massive volume means that IV will change, and usually if the price has moved to, the options will be priced slightly differently too. This step is just to give you a rough idea of what you can expect.
4. Place the order before market opens, and pray for the best, so that your trade is executed at open. You can wait and see what happens at open, and see what actually happens to your straddle price, or you can be a real wsb retard and just yolo like a real ape, and just go in blind.

Now, I am not a financial advisor, im just an Economics student, and a fellow ape. Dont take this to be financial advice, Im merely speculating here, and I wanna know whats wrong with this strat, because it seems to simple to be any good. I wanna know what you retards think. Is this completely stupid or can it be refined to actually be worth a second look?

&#x200B;

Edit: In step one, you can remove the current volume of 2 million, since you are already filtering by relative volume which accounts for at least 3 time average."

Edit 2: The main suggestion is wait until Netflix's earning report, they report  first. Then see if they lost domestically and guess who relatively  gained the most subscribers of the remaining streamers (using google  trends).

Edit 3: Internationally Netflix is present in more countries, than Disney, and  last HBO (due to licensing deals).   The domestic growth should be the relative most different between them i.e. one may have stagnated or decreased while other gained. They probably all grew internationally and it is too hard for me to tell  which one grew the most. I made guesses below.

Edit 4. Slight risk that people wait until both earnings have posted before making a bullish decision,if AT&T's financial statements indicate that.

* AT&T  earnings = July 22nd.
* Discovery earnings = August 4th (estimated).

Edit 5. Woah games for Netflix. Doesn't change information below, estimating subscriber growth. AT&T is already decent with games. Disney has lots of games IP that it sells out. Time will tell.

**Disclaimer:**

* My position: Extremely Red on $T Calls.
* Data pulled from a variety of sources, may be inaccurate. Especially google trends.
* I am biased, thus more of AT&T is presented.

**TLDR:**

* Netflix fell last earnings report due to weak subscriber growth, the price has since risen. Google trends indicates a repeat of low subscribers for the quarter.
* Disney  fell last earnings report due to weak subscriber growth and parks being  shut for the pandemic. Disney+ seems to have had an alright quarter for  subscribers, it really started taking off in July so that's good. This is after Q2  earnings so it will not greatly affect financials yet.
* AT&T  price rose last earnings on strong subscriber growth in both  businesses, but then fell on merger announcement with Discovery. Google  trends indicates their greatest subscriber growth for HBO to date.  Feeling a repeat.
* VIACOM this DD has less on them but seeing competitors is good. Great past earnings.
* Discovery, your now stuck on the HBO train.
* Netflix's  success or failure domestically and internationally will be reported on July 20th. This may  help assess AT&T, Disney, Viacom, and Discovery investments.
* It would be smart to wait till after Netflix earnings before making a decision.

1. Google Trends review posted a month ago. More current info presented below.
2. Options Play for Q1 2021 ER, Disney vs Netflix vs AT&T. Big success.
3. AT&T call before prior earnings. Big success then a big fail on merger.

**Past Quarter Price Action:**

Below, in order, are the 3 month graphs for Netflix, AT&T, and Disney.

Netflix down, AT&T up, and Disney down on earnings.

* The red line represents the earnings report. As stated above subscriber growth for the three companies influenced the bullish or bearish behavior.
* Google trends was fairly reliable last quarter in predicting this. No guarantees as to the current quarter.
* The blue line for AT&T represents the merger announcement with Discovery.
* Order of earnings for current quarter is Netflix, AT&T, Discovery (est.), Viacom, Disney.

**THE BOX OFFICE 2021**

Having  Box Office hits has been one of the major drivers of subscriptions to a  streamers platform in the past year. Many of these hits do well  internationally in countries such as China.

\-  The list below shows the top grossing movies of 2021 domestically. A  movie such as Wonder Woman 1984 released in 2020 will be shown on this  list as it earned revenue in 2020.

Below I have totaled the revenues from the top 25 Movies from the list  above both domestically/internationally by studio. Only those released  since 2021, so not including Wonder Woman and some other titles.

**Google Trends**

***Disclaimer:***

1. Data is not perfect and does not truly reflect subscriber-ship for a variety of reasons
2. Consumers  already owning Netflix/Disney+ may be less likely to search for them,  whereas HBO users may be new inflating google trends data.
3. Two search criteria exist, ""Television Network"" and ""Search Term"".  Netflix can unfortunately only be searched for as a ""Search Term"",  therefore I interchange between the two criteria.
4. Using ""search term"" would include data such as  Disney's Parks. Netflix and Disney are also the names of the parent  companies, etc...

***Past Data Accuracy:***

For  Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 HBO's uptrends along with box office hits did add  subscribers. A lot for WW 1984, their biggest addition to date, and some  for Batman Snyderverse. The uptrends associated with Netflix and Disney  for the holidays did not coincide with a box office hit. As such the  uptrends did not add meaningful subscribers for Disney and Netflix.

***Semi-Confirmation of data accuracy before AT&T and Disney Earnings:***

Netflix  will release subscriber data on July 20th prior to AT&T and Disney.  It may be a good idea to compare the the results to google trends to  see if downtrending or uptrending does indeed help estimate subscriber  prior to investing in AT&T, Disney, Viacom, or Discovery.

&#x200B;

**Trends data for HBO vs Disney+ for the past 12 months in the United States**

**Search criteria= ""Television Network""**

[https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/explore?geo=US&q=&#37;2Fg&#37;2F11fmb4rx9b,&#37;2Fg&#37;2F11f5bxylc0](https://preview.redd.it/v7tjtk4jq1b71.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd5506ce9a8d31ea0f7a8c902e7725a13a37928b)

&#x200B;

* The blue line for HBO has four major upticks.
* First uptick is for Q4 2020 during the holidays along with Disney.  HBO had a box office hit, none for Disney.
* The  upticks for HBO during Q2 2021 are for Godzilla vs Kong, Mortal Kombat,  and the Friends reunion. There is a good chance of above expected  subcribers gains domestically.
* Disney's  most recent uptick is both due to Loki the Tv series and the Black  Widow movie. Black Widow seems to be sending it higher though not yet as high as GvsK. have to wait to see if it peaks.
* Also more theaters  were shut down both domestically and internationally for GvsK than BW. Vaccines not being out which could have influenced interest in GvsK. Less to do, could also mean more likely to subscribe.

&#x200B;

**Search criteria = ""Search Term""**

https://preview.redd.it/eycygn2br1b71.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=210a6d610ab40259429408f7357bb71d8cd67fe3

* As can been seen Netflix has been down-trending during Q2 2021 relative to both Disney and HBO
* Disney overtaking Netflix could indicate a change in overall sentiment to be followed internationally.
* Previous quarter financials:

1. Netflix down due to weak subscriber growth, since risen back up.
2. Disney down due to weak subscriber growth and parks being shut during pandemic, since risen back up.
3. AT&T up on strong subscriber growth and good financials, since risen back down.

Trends  indicate AT&T has continued strong subscriber growth while stock  price falls as Netflix continues weak subscriber growth while stock  price rises. Disney seemed to have a slow uptrend during the quarter but  a strong finish, not as prominent as AT&T via google trends. Once  again google trends data may be inaccurate.

* As Netflix has such a high P/E if doubts about it's future to continue rapid growth arise the stock price could fall.
* Netflix's  earnings report is first on July 20th. It can be used to assess growth  of AT&T, Viacom, and Disney before their earnings. Compare Netflix  subscriber growth domestically and internationally to past quarters and  competitors.
* People seem unwilling to cancel Netflix even if they prefer a different service.

&#x200B;

**Worldwide, Past 12 months**

The graph below shows the worldwide google trends data in the past 12 months for Disney and HBO.

The  upticks that were seen on the United States graph are present but less  prominent. HBO has mainly been available in the United States up until  June 29th 2021 when they launched in Latin America (Regional breakdown  to follow). As such there was no way for them to compete  internationally.

**Search criteria = ""Television Network""**

https://preview.redd.it/6twyclwzq1b71.png?width=1064&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a3b4c947bbac7ceef9cf66bc16a6ab71654e032

* Disney while having a week start of the quarter has since up-trended for it's Marvel releases.
* HBO began a strong quarter on the release of GvsK. This is mainly due to the United States.
* HBO  has a final uptick seen here but not seen in the United States graph.  This is due to HBO's international launch in 39 countries and  territories in Latin America which seems to have edged them extremely  close to Disney on an international scale.
* HBOs final uptick could strongly be influenced by a big marketing push in Latin America.

Note:HBO  will call there platform different things in different countries. For  marketing reasons and due to deals with regional providers. In Canada  HBO is called ""Crave"" and distributed by Bell. It will not show up on  the search results. It can also be called HBO Latin America or HBO Asia  depending on your region. This last point google may be smart enough to  interpret for google trends, I am unsure. Disney is just Disney+.

&#x200B;

**Search criteria = ""Search Term""**

https://preview.redd.it/erngtyj5r1b71.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a2670a4f208d958b99f1c90a2bd6863e3056041

* Worldwide  Netflix is still on a downtrend over the past quarter, seemingly  following last quarters trends. (Once again google trends data may be  inaccurate). Still the leader by a lot and a bit of an uptick at the end.
* Disney  has been higher this past quarter than the same time last year.  Worldwide it has still not had the same interest as during the 2020  holiday season but it has been steady all quarter and then up-trending  strongly since July.
* HBO  worldwide continues to uptrend more strongly than it's previous high  during the holiday season where they added the most subscribers to date.  International users will not greatly affect Q2 financials apart from  maybe adding subscribers in the final 3 days of the quarter.

&#x200B;

* Search Term used and Discovery is an actual word, might be other reasons to type this in.
* Paramount just launched/ changed it's name this quarter.
* Discovery seems to have more appeal than paramount but it is on a steady downtrend over the quarter.

**United States**

* Only the US got it free on HBO $20 internationally to rent, e.g. Canada, UK, etc..
* More theaters were closed during March due to the pandemic worldwide than for  Black Widow.

FOREWARNING: I am aware that the great stock CLNE was apeified a little bit ago. This DD isn't about some crazy ladder climb short delta theta jump.

Howdy,

As we all know, CLNE has been trading flatter than your wife for the better portion of a month now. However, I think that is all about to change. Also, I think it has actually been a good thing that the flatness has been getting tighter and tighter each day (seriously, CLNE moved like 5 cents back and forth today). Before I get into why it's about to run, here's some background on why CLNE is an amazing company (especially at $9).

**WHAT THE FUCK DOES CLNE DO?:**

Clean Energy Fuels (CLNE) is in the business of creating Renewable Natural Gas out of organic waste. Cow shit (and other shit!). Renewable Natural Gas is one of the best bridges to move into green energy. EV's, Hydrogen, Solar, all are not prepared to power the worlds trucking fleets, despite their claims. They are in fact years away. It is exponentially cheaper to convert a long haul trucking rig to natural gas than to buy an EV rig. If you're an average trucker, your truck is where pretty much all your money and value is stored. It would be bonkers to buy a new EV vs to spend the $20,000 to convert your current rig to Nat gas.

Clean Energy Fuels already fuels more than 250,000 vehicles with RNG daily. This isn't some start up or nonsense gravity truck firm (looking at you NKLA). They have over 570 stations across North America already. CLNE is fervently building new stations at a breakneck pace. What that really amounts to is a substantial lead over any competitor. Which really means that you'd have to either use them or buy them out to try outpace them at their current rate.

Renewable Natural Gas is good for the planet also (I know this is a stock presentation, what is the environment, but hold on). The current administration in the USA, and honestly the next ones too if they want the youth vote, are highly motivate to shift to green solutions. But they have to deal with the people who will drag their feet and won't want to spend millions on all new green solutions. RNG is the perfect bridge between the two. You can convert your trucks, your mail delivery fleet, whatever, all to RNG much cheaper than buying a new one. Renewable Natural Gas reduces carbon emissions, especially on big trucks) by a minimum of 70%. CLNE is committed to reducing that to 0 by 2025. This makes it highly likely to be chosen as a green solution. Methane is 20% of greenhouse gas emissions, so it's a double whammy, stopping two sources of pollution.

Finally, CLNE already has contracts with big companies. The ever so touted Amazon contract is one of them. UPS already has a contract with them. They are the largest provider in California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard program. People are coming aboard before they're forced to convert a much higher price (California especially is stopping a lot of non green shipping, but that's a whole other rabbit hole). There has been institutional buying of the stock over the past month and before, as these prices are a steal. WAIT WASN'T THERE A BIG SELL OFF EARLIER OMFG? That was Total taking a profit on their shares they bought for next to nothing years ago. It has already been announced over the twitter that they have stopped, as they just wanted to make sure they got a return on investment.

**WHO GIVES A FUCK, WHY IS IT GONNA RUN?:**

EDIT; I AM SHIT AT TECHNICALS AND THIS IS WRONG APPARENTLY First, the technical. Now I am not the Adeptus Mechanicus, but apparently technical do something so I'll lay some out with my moronic knowledge.

Just for fun, here's today. There's a little cup and handle there, I think.

Now, over 6 months, something interesting comes out (yes I took this from Google, not all of us are billionaires who buy fancy crayon software):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5a3uo4nheva71.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=907c6e4bf44319fd07901680144bd82daf2bce02

There seems to be a cup and handle growing here too. It is also following a similar drop and spike pattern as from May to June, suggesting another upward jump coming.

CLNE has consistently bounced off the 200 SMA, which suggests that that will stay a strong support. So $9 is a pretty safe entry point to buy some long dated options at, and a downright boomer safe entry point if you're buying shares. Over the last 6 months, we've stayed trading above $8, and really actually $8.50. With CLNE consistently growing, I don't see why we would drop past there.

But in reality, I don't speak stock robot, so technical aren't really my thing. Just my thoughts on the techs.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sawts0akeva71.png?width=893&format=png&auto=webp&s=498b5bbd606be4ea2313092614a0f86d95bac941

There is a large amount of near the money options open on CLNE (someone once told me this doesn't matter because there's not as many as GE or Amazon. If you say something silly like that, you belong in the poorhouse).

Now here is where there becomes two routes for CLNE to run. The first (the more unlikely, and the more ape like option tbf) is that CLNE starts to rally as it did near the June option expiry. This sent CLNE to a spike of $14.60 ish. If CLNE gains the interest of an institution looking to start getting foolish or becomes back in favor to fickle fools, then CLNE would already jump past where we we've been holding for weeks and your investment would already be profitable, or it would set up to become more profitable in the real run to come for July. Expiring option dates have generally been good to CLNE based on past performance.

The more realistic route is that the options all expire OTM. This seems bad (and indeed is for those option holders) but would actually still be good for CLNE. After we are finally away from an option expiry, CLNE can begin its run to August earnings. It has been announced that there will be a conference call immediately following the earnings report. Now, Clean Energy Fuels usually likes to wait to announce big deals for their earnings. They got very close with their Amazon deal to the May earnings call (15 ish days). That sent CLNE jumping up to the near 20's price. I think there is a high level of anticipation for this earnings call. While I personally believe a new contract will be announced (I think new, expanded UPS deal, but that's pure speculation so is not necessarily relevant in a DD, besides that is SEEMS like it'll happen haha), I think the belief of institutions and the average buyer that CLNE wants to announce a deal will cause CLNE to run up until earnings. CLNE already has received interest as a top trending stock on reddit, among other places, and the CEO went on Cramer and roused some interest there. There is also a suspicion that there might be more to the Amazon deal, as he stated that he couldn't go much more into it, as Amazon wanted to talk more about it. So, I think the belief of an Amazon deal or belief of a new contract will fuel CLNE to run until earnings. After earnings is anybody's guess, especially depending on the conference call. However, it is an easy run up to earnings, as I think most people (including analysts below) expect it to be pretty great. Also, with the temptation of a new contract, it will double the general excitement leading up to earnings.

Earnings will also most likely be good. Most people panic at CLNE's past earnings with just a glance, but they almost always are 0.00 because they reinvest every penny into building more RNG stations, just furthering their lead in the sector. So even if CLNE holds on to 0.01 for the quarter, it will be gangbusters in terms of their earnings, which makes it very easy for CLNE to smash earnings.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1xo3of4meva71.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=3363ca2c18ebd48e86c517dde7044826e9808607

Analysts have high projections for CLNE for the next 12 months.

Even the lowest is $2 above close, and the median is $20. There is clear real belief in the stock besides just WSB think. Most analysts put it at a ""buy"" rating, because it is criminally undervalued.

 

**TL;DR:** CLNE will have a a gangbusters run up to earnings after 7/16 options expire (or an even higher climb if they somehow expire ITM) due to sentiment and belief that CLNE will announce new contracts/have an even okay earnings report. CLNE is also an extremely safe bet at these levels as it has consistently held them. Personal price target: $18 the day before August 5th earnings.

**POSITIONS:** 500 Shares, 80 ish September $20 calls, 5 7/16 $13 calls and 5 7/16 $12 calls (the July ones are just for fun FD gambling)"

It was clear that with PE's getting stretched and value names falling behind, 2021 would not have another broad market rally in store, but rather be a stock pickers market.
Now gay bears are coming out of hibernation left and right, predicting the next 15% broad market correction, with posts longer than their wife's boyfriends dicks, talking about all the indicators their little google search had to offer on why we would crash, while missing the obvious: Single sectors have been going through their own corrections all fucking year long, while others regained momentum. 
A 1.5% down day in SPY after 7 straight green days is not the beginning of the end. A 5% drop back to the moving averages is not a fucking bear market but rather your chance to get in at a price you wish you would've gotten months ago. 

The market is not moving in unison right now, and that's fine. Have bets on different sectors, have cash to buy dips and most important stop trying to catch a fucking top and keep your gay ass bullshit armageddon posts to yourselves.

Tldr; fuck you and your market crash predictions, if it's so obvious, buy your puts and get slaughtered by a different sector every single week."

Tom Lee believes that the S&P 500 index is expected to continue its upward momentum and may surge 9% to 4700 points by the end of the year.

Tom Lee said, “I think FAANG stocks will be out of yield, which means they will have a glorious second half of the year, not because interest rates will fall, but because these great companies have almost nothing in the first half of (2021). Performance. We believe that if the S&P 500 index rises 25% this year and many of these FAANG stocks rise 5%, then they may rise 20% in the second half of the year, which makes their rating become'overweight'.""

FAANG refers to the abbreviation of five large technology stocks, namely Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google's parent company Alphabet.

At the same time, Tom Lee said that core stocks related to the reopening of the economy will be in the best position and are expected to rise further. ""The core sectors (related to the new crown epidemic) will rebound strongly as they are most sensitive to rising interest rates,""

Among them, Tom Lee is most optimistic about energy stocks. He believes that under the circumstances of economic recovery and high demand, oil supply may shrink, which may cause oil prices to continue to rise.

As of the close of trading on July 9, the S&P 500 index was 4,369.55 points, an increase of 1.13%.

As of the close on July 9, Facebook's stock price was US$350.42, an increase of 1.38%; Amazon's stock price was US$371.34, a decrease of 0.32%; Apple's stock price was US$145.11, an increase of 1.31%; Netflix's stock price was US$535.98, an increase of 0.98. %; Google stock price is 2510.37 US dollars, an increase of 0.38%."

Here's a few reasons why I think this will keep going and if you do not want to miss another MSFT or AMZN, you should buy Oracle.

&#x200B;

1. Oracle is extremely undervalued with a P/E of 19.19 as a Cloud/Software company.  Usually Cloud/Software companies like Microsoft or Google have P/es in the high 30s/40s.
2. Oracle does massive stock buybacks with them announcing a 20 billion stock repurchase plan this year as well as having a dividend yield of 1.46% which is way higher than AAPL or MSFT.
3. Oracle is growing massively with 8% YoY growth from last year yet they are being priced as a boomer company
4. With the recent JEDI news being cancelled now Oracle has a shot of receiving this contract which should also boost stock price.  [https://www.barrons.com/articles/oracle-stock-defense-cloud-contract-51625863023](https://www.barrons.com/articles/oracle-stock-defense-cloud-contract-51625863023)
5. Stocks love round numbers. When was the last time you saw a stock at 80 or 90 and eventually never hit 100? Almost never. Stocks love to hit round numbers.
6. Options are extremely cheap on oracle with them sometimes being less than 10 cents even though the stock is at 80$ currently. This means there is alot of gamma squeeze potential with Oracle as it is extremely cheap to buy OTM options for Oracle and thus force MM's to buy shares.

&#x200B;

Tl;dr: Oracle is an extremely undervalued Cloud/ Software company that is currently breaking out right now with an extremely high chance of hitting 100 very soon. I would recommend buying calls on Oracle as they are currently very cheap with them being a few cents each for OTM calls."

The company usually gets a bump in stock price following the announcement and there is a significant increase in retail interest for the stock.

The underlying principle for this is that institutional investors which track these indices would have to buy into the stock and that this would cause a considerable bump in the stock price.

At the same time, there are some contradictory opinions regarding this expected jump in price. Some people believe that there would be profit booking following the index inclusion which would actually tank the stock price.

What I wanted to analyze was

**Whether the stock price rise following index inclusion or would the profit booking cause to stock price to fall?**

This in turn would allow us to create the best strategy for trading using index inclusion news.

**Data:** The data for index inclusion time was surprisingly difficult to obtain. [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies) list from Wikipedia was the only source where I could find when each stock was added to S&P 500. Data from official sources are split by years and only the latest years’ data is provided on the website.

All the data and my analysis are shared as a Google sheet at the end.

**Analysis:**

One of the major limitations of S&P500 index inclusions is that there is no set time delay between the date of announcement of inclusion and the actual inclusion \[1\]. As detailed in [this post](https://www.thestreet.com/tesla/articles/when-will-tesla-be-added-to-the-s-p-500), it can vary from 1 day to 10 days with the average being 6 days.

To incorporate this complexity also into the analysis, we will calculate the returns of the stock (keeping the date of inclusion as the benchmark)

a. 1-week leading up to the index inclusion

b. 1-week following the index inclusion

c. 1-month following the index inclusion

**Results:**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/qsax10i4nz971.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=a02ec75a31b64e02711ccb13c0033146687a5fdd)

As expected, on average the stocks made positive returns only during the week leading up to the index inclusion. Out of the 313 stocks analyzed, more than 60% had positive returns with an average return of 1.7%.

After the stock had been added to the index, the returns on average were negative. There is a consistent drop in the stock price in the following weeks after the index addition. On average, the stocks lost 0.7% in the week after the index inclusion. One probable reason for this would be profit booking where investors pull out after the run-up leading to the index addition.

We can further deep dive into the mechanics of index addition to understand the best possible plays. For this, we will take case studies of some popular stocks that were added to the index.

**Domino’s Pizza ($DPZ)**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/yyg21nh6nz971.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a5534e2ac5180ace000bd41e88ec373caeed776)

The inclusion of Dominos into S&P500 was announced on 6th May 2020 and the date of inclusion was on 12th May 2020. As we can observe from the graph, all the indices which track S&P 500 had to buy Domino’s stock before the market open on 12th May due to which there is almost an 11x jump in traded volume and a 2% gain in stock price. In this case, the stock continued its upward trend for one more day before dipping.

**Tesla Inc ($TSLA)**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/sq0l4ak7nz971.png?width=873&format=png&auto=webp&s=0662bd22d1acb150c14e9cc578100432a255a930)

Tesla was the largest company to be added to S&P 500 at more than $500 Billion valuation. The inclusion of Tesla into S&P500 was announced on 16th Nov 2020 and the date of inclusion was on 21st Dec 2020. As we can see from the graph, there was a nice bump in traded volume as well as stock price following the announcement.

Since the company was added into the index in one step before the 21st Dec open, all the funds had to buy the stock on 18th Dec (19 & 20 were weekends). There was a 6% jump in stock price and almost 4x normal traded volume on that day. We can also see the profit booking following the index addition where the stock briefly dipped before continuing on its rally.   

**Conclusion:**

The analysis does prove that stock prices positively react to index inclusion. But this is only applicable till the stock is added to the index. As we saw earlier, stocks rise 1 week leading to the inclusion and then fall due to profit booking.

So, the best strategy to trade based on index addition is to buy the stock as soon as the news breaks and hold it till the day of inclusion.

**Footnotes**

\[1\] If you are a diligent investor, you can analyze the quarterly earnings report and understand whether the company is now in a position to be added to the index. But then again, the final decision of whether a stock will be added to the index will be based on the [index committee](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/additional-material/sp-500-brochure.pdf)

Comparing the popularity of the google searches, using the insights query found [here](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=scotiabank,bmo,td,rbc,cibc), it is clear that TD is most searched for.  The focus of this research will be the Canadian markets, but it is important to consider the distribution of searches worldwide.  In Mexico, there is a heavy concentration of searches for Scotiabank.  In the US, TD dominates searches, as well as in the UK.  RBC and TD are both around 45% of searches in India.  There is an extreme concentration of searches for Scotiabank in Peru, and it is the only instance where there are more searches than in Canada for all 5 banks.  Overall, the relative distribution over 14 years is this:

Fig.1

|Bank|Average Interest over time, google searches (Index)|
|:-|:-|
|TD|79|
|RBC|36|
|Scotiabank|24|
|CIBC|21|
|BMO|20|

&#x200B;

This doesn't tell us much other than that TD is likely present in the US at some scale, as well as Scotiabank in Peru.

Most data from Finviz, specifically from this query: [finviz.com](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&f=cap_largeover,fa_pfcf_u5,geo_canada,ind_banksdiversified&ft=4)

All five banks have managed to keep their Price/FCF below five, even during the post Covid bubble.  This forces a deeper analysis to be carried out.  Amazingly, all of their P/E ratios fall between 12 and 15.  The figure below corresponds to these values.

Fig 2.

&#x200B;

|Bank|P/E|Price/FCF|
|:-|:-|:-|
|TD|12.66|0.59|
|RBC|14.59|1.18|
|Scotiabank|14.50|2.31|
|CIBC|13.65|1|
|BMO|13.99|1.28|
|Average|13.878|1.272|

Now a difference between a P/E or P/FCF of 2 is not grounds for elimination from consideration for almost any cases. However, it should be noted that TD appears to be the most favorable from these preliminary figures.

The next three values to be analyzed relate to earnings and sales.  Here, we start to see some differences between the banks, with TD managing to grow earnings significantly more than the other banks in the past 5 years.

Fig 3.

|Bank|P/S|EPS growth last 5y|Sales growth past 5y|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Scotiabank|3.36|\-1.30%|7.9%|
|RBC|5.22|3.1%|8.9%|
|BMO|4.46|2.8%|12.1%|
|CIBC|3.43|\-1.5%|8.8%|
|TD|4.58|8.8%|7.5%|
|Average|4.21|2.38%|9.04%|

&#x200B;

TD is a clear winner in this section.  It would be ideal to bring the P/S down, but because the P/FCF is so high for all of the banks, it is not a worry.  TD is the only bank managing to become more efficient as they scale, which potentially shows an effective management team, or increasingly more profitable businesses, or both.  It is possible that the earnings increase may be a result of a lack of attention to other obligations or competitive endeavors, which could possibly hurt them in the future. CIBC and Scotiabank have managed to decrease earnings as they have increased sales, possibly hinting at ineffective management, or defective operations.  It is also possible that the lower earnings are a result of restructuring, which could be positive in the future.  All of these values will have to be analyzed much closer.

The analyst does suggest that a new measure be conceived to gauge growth sustainability.  The value would be determined by dividing EPS growth over a period, x, over Sales growth, over that same period, x.  The measure could be called the income growth sustainability measure, and is formatted as follows:

IGSM = EPS growth in the past x  / Sales growth in the past x years

Where at least one value must be positive for the calculation to be effective.  The value produced is unitless  The ideal value is 1, and deviations outside the range of 0.5 and1.5 are to be considered unsustainable.  This value is only rough estimate, and would have to be refactored t in order to be used commercially because it produces inaccurate values the further you stray from 1 (a value of 2 is clearly unsustainably, as well as a value of-1 with positive earnings).  Using the newly constructed equation, the figure below can be constructed.

Fig 4.

&#x200B;

|Bank|IGSM|
|:-|:-|
|TD|1.17|
|RBC|0.34|
|Scotiabank|0.16|
|CIBC|\-0.17|
|BMO|0.23|

Again, TD clearly has the most sustainable growth.  An average is not computed here because of the nature of this value, and it will not be used to determine any conclusions.  A better evaluation of sustainable growth must be formulated.

No securities analysis is complete without analyzing the balance sheet.  All of the companies have a P/Cash ratio between 0.23-0.25, so those values do not need to be discussed on a relative basis.  Current ratios, D/E measures, and P/B are considered in the following figure.  Some of this information has to be sourced from [SEDAR](http://www.sedar.com/).  Just press “ctrl f” and type in “annual” to get to the reports.  Other data is from [Macrotrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/), probably the best source of long term information on the internet.

Fig 5.

|Bank|Current ratio|Debt to equity|Price to book|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|TD|0.93|0.13|1.68|
|RBC|0.90|0.11|2.02|
|Scotiabank|1.05|0.41|1.49|
|CIBC|1.03|0.12|1.46|
|BMO|0.98|0.14|1.42|
|Average|0.98|0.182|1.614|

All of the values, except for RBCs P/B and Scotiabanks debt to equity fall within range of their peers.  Objectively, these values are ridiculously strong, but nonetheless, we are looking for a winner among winners.

The last rudimentary fundamentals to be considered are some alternative financial ratios that work best when relatively compared.  This is the largest section.  We will be looking at all of the ROx’s, as well as PM and OM.

Fig 6. 

|Bank|ROE|ROI|ROA|Operating Margin|Profit margin|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|TD|13.50%|5.20%|0.70%|56.90%|36.30%|
|RBC|14.30%|4.00%|0.70%|60.00%|36.10%|
|Scotiabank|10.40%|17.30%|0.60%|51.20%|23.50%|
|CIBC|10.90%|16.00%|0.50%|54.30%|25.40%|
|BMO|10.30%|5.40%|0.50%|59.10%|24.20%|
|Average|11.88%|9.58%|0.6%|56.3%|29.10%|


For the returns, Scotiabank and CIBC slightly ahead of the other three because of their exceptionally high ROI.  For operating margins, RBC and BMO are slightly above average, where Scotiabank is lagging behind.  TD and RBC have exceptionally higher profit margins.

Culminating the rudimentary analysis is a large comparison of Figures 2-6, excluding 4.  For each figure, a “winner” can be determined, and a “loser” can be determined.  Here are the overall rankings for each figure.

For figure 2, TD is the most attractive in both fields.  CIBC is the second most attractive for both fields.  The first two fall below the average P/E, but because of the limited deviation between banks, this is not a huge accomplishment.  The next two rankings are subjective.  BMO and RBC are tied for third.  Their percent difference between PEs and P/FCFs are quite similar for both of them, and each value carries similar importance.  Scotiabank is fourth

In figure three,  TD is again the winner.  Their sustainable growth is extremely attractive, despite having a higher P/S than the average.  BMO is second for the same reasons, and RBC is third because of their high P/S.  Scotiabank and CIBC are tied for fourth because they both have similar P/S ratios and their Sales growth to eps growth are similar.

For figure 5, CIBC is the slight winner.  Most values are very similar, but CIBC is in the top two for all categories.  Second is BMO, lagging slightly behind CIBC with their CR and D/E, but winning the P/B category.  Third is TD.  Fourth is RBC because of their higher than average P/B.  Last is scotiabank with the highest D/E ratio despite having stronger values in other fields.  Scotiabank is in last because this value is almost four times the next highest D/E, whereas the highest P/B is only \~25% greater than the best P/B ratio.

In judging figure 6, a higher priority is placed on profit margin.  Giving equal weighting to ROE, ROI and ROA, TD is the winner of figure 6.  RBC is very close behind.  CIBC is third, and Scotiabank is fourth.  BMO is last.

Fig 7. The results of the preliminary relative analysis

|Bank|Figure 2 ranking|Fig 3 ranking|Fig 5 ranking|Fig 6 ranking|Overall|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|TD|1|1|3|1|1|
|RBC|=3|3|4|2|3|
|Scotiabank|4|=4|5|4|5|
|CIBC|2|=4|1|3|2|
|BMO|=3|2|2|5|4|

Clearly, TD was the most attractive followed by CIBC.

Market analysis.  Data is mostly from [stockhouse](https://stockhouse.com/).

This section will analyze more sensitive factors of each company, such as short position, large and insider transactions, volatility, and other factors related to the current situation of the company.  It will be split into individual sections for each bank, as well as a composite section comparing some factors.

Lets begin with TD.  TD has a market cap of 150 billion, which is quite large for even american companies.  Their beta is 0.9, which will hopefully draw speculation away.  They have a dividend yield of 3.825%.  Not a lot of insider information is available, but most insiders have historically bought below 60 and sold at 70.  The current price is 65, but is extremely attractive.

|Bank|Market cap|Beta|Yield|Short interest|Sales|Assets|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|TD|150.24b|0.9|3.825%|0.33%|43b|1.7t|

BMO has a market cap of 74 billion, just about half that of TD.  They have a beta of 1.17, which is higher than desired.  They have a yield of 3.71% and a short interest of 0.59%.  Their yield is slightly lower than TD, despite having the higher beta.  Recent insider purchases have been below $90, and a number of sales have happened above 100.

|Bank|Market cap|Beta|Yield|Short interest|Sales|Assets|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|BMO|74b|1.17|3.71|0.59%|25b|0.95t|

CIBC has a market cap of 59 billion.  Their beta is 1, and their yield is 3.34.  Short interest is 0.98%.  There have been a number of insider sales above 100, and insider purchases below this number.

|Bank|Market cap|Beta|Yield|Short interest|Sales|Assets|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CIBC|59b|1|3.34|0.98%|18b|0.73t|

RBC has a market cap of 134 billion.  Their beta is 0.79, which makes them quite attractive if considering their dividend. Their yield is 3.34.  Short interest is 0.34%. The buy/sell line is at around 80 for insiders.

|Bank|Market cap|Beta|Yield|Short interest|Sales|Assets|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|RBC|134b|0.79|3.64|0.34%|47b|1.62t|

Overall

|Bank|Market cap|Beta|Yield|Short interest|Sales|Assets|Overall|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|TD|150.24b|0.9|3.825%|0.33%|43b|1.7t|3|
|BMO|74b|1.17|3.71%|0.59%|25b|0.95t|5|
|Scotiabank|74b|0.85|4.64%|0.34%|31b|1.14t|1|
|RBC|134b|0.79|3.64%|0.34%|47b|1.62t|2|
|CIBC|59b|1|3.34%|0.98%|18b|0.73t|4|
|Average|98b|0.942|3.83|0.516|32.8b|1.23t||


Scotiabank has a market cap of 74 billion.  Their beta is 0.79, which makes them quite attractive if considering their dividend. Their yield is 3.34.  Short interest is 0.34%.  Scotiabanks buy/sell line is around 75 with a lot of deviation.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

All five institutions have some attractive things and some ugly things in this table, relatively speaking.  Scotiabank's yield is offset by the low ranking it got in the previous relative analysis.  TD has the most attractive yield other than that, and the low short interest is reassuring.  RBCs low beta is very attractive, as well as their large sales and massive asset pool.  They are the second most attractive entry in the table after Scotiabank.  TD is third at a relatively neutral position.  CIBC is fourth and BMO is fifth because of BMOs large beta.

Back in October 2020  Newegg, an online retailer that mostly sells electronics, announced it is going to go public back  in a ""reverse merger"" with LLIT in some time in Q1 of 2021, which we now know [closed on May 20, 2021](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1474627/000121390021027815/ea141330ex99-1_neweggcomme.htm)

Now here comes the juicy parts and it’s all based on Form F-1 located on edgar ([See link to double check what I’m saying](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001474627/000121390021025755/ea140678-f1a7_lianluosmart.htm))

There are 363,325,542  shares outstanding but the public float is only is less 1% of this number . There are two chinese guys who own most of the shares outstanding Zhitao He and Fred Chang, owning approximately 60.91% and 35.98%, collectively 96.90% of the company,  so Zhitao owns about  224,394,452 shares and Fred owns about 130,724,530 shares. The shareholders of Newegg before the merger own  1.31% of shares outstanding, so 4,759,564. Leaving the public float  1.79%, aka 6,503,527. In the form they say that they are authorized to issue 6,250,000 common shares with 4,736,111 as Class A (aka the shit we can trade), and 1,513,889  as Class B. As of the filling of this form (May 12 2021)  there were 3,465,683 common shares outstanding. The float directly offered to the public is 2,729,755 out of the 3,465,683 and the float that the underwriter owns is around 735,928.

*Unsure about the chinese risk F-1 & edgar forms getting hard to read only sure about float ---to be continue*

**Shout out to** u/GhostOfGregDoucette **for figuring out the float was funky**

# When does lockup end?

Well according to the SEC form that summarizes the investors rights ([link](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-027834/)) lockup ends 180days after the closing of the merge. The [merger was closed on May 20, 2021](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1474627/000121390021027815/ea141330ex99-1_neweggcomme.htm), and 180days from May 20th is November 15th. Now my mans Zhitao He is a bitch, straight up owned by the Bank of China, in the filling it explicitly says Zhitao pledged all his shares as collateral so he wouldn’t get double tapped. So that’s 60.91% of the shares that we really don’t have to worry about, even though we never really had to worry since lock up ends in November. Fred Chang is a boss, probably counting down the days when he can sell his shares, travel to Tulum, and start drinking soy milk latte’s, do ketamine, and  meditate and be zen while sporting his Jesus robe.

# What about the squeeze

So we have verified that the float is between \[2,729,755, 3,465,683\], which is the smallest number I’ve actually ever seen for a company. How squeezy is it? Well I came across this company doing a completely different analysis. I was interested in failure-to-deliver data that the SEC provides and what it could tell me. You see recently there have been alot of seemingly random stocks popping. Me and some others share the opinion that it’s due to NSCC-2021-002 being implemented a couple weeks ago, and rule DTCC-2021-005  being implemented a couple months ago. See [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/user/jn_ku/comments/m4fnfg/gamestop_moass_no_tinfoil_hat_required/) to see it’s significance for all the meme’s we know and love. So I got all the FTD data from the SEC from 08/2020 - 06/2021 (1st half of June) from the [SEC’s website](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm), and calculated FTD/Float for all the meme stocks we know and love, and some rando stocks that popped recently as well. For $NEGG I calculated the float to be the midpoint of average of the two number, 3m.

&#x200B;

[i meant 6\/15\/2021  whoops](https://preview.redd.it/vypk6jmnzt971.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d2574130393469dc40d032dbd92d62d9aff4ef0)

&#x200B;

I gave the outliers colors, and all the other stocks grey scale. So yup your hunch is correct shit has become more volatile after cooling down a bit after the GME squeeze. Outliers usually are the most volatile stocks, GME/AMC  ftd data was screaming “look at me” before the actual pop in shortly after. $NEGG is screaming the same thing right now.

Let’s consider Ortex data and its relation to FTDs. Ortex doesn’t have a API and if it did I don’t have time to look at it so I’m doing a spot check. So let’s pick a random stock say $SENS

The average loan age hit one of it’s peaks on June 7th at 54.23days,  so a good amount of loans were taken out on around April 14  (*54days before June 7th*). Go back to the FTD graph search for $SENS, the peak of \* \`FTD as a percentage of Float\` almost exactly lines up\*. Let’s try another one, $GME.

Peak of average loan age at Jan 25 2021 of 85days, placing the date on Nov 25th, the FTD graph shows this as well. Ok, last one let’s check $UWMC

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8jm3pzeqzt971.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2219785964acacb666a42e2e77e707838a59a93

$UWMC had a peak of avg loan age on Jun 10th, subtract 41days from that day and you get April 29th lining up pretty well with $UWMC largest FTD spike.

Ok so I’m basically saying that for stocks without data on ortex you can get a sense of where the shorts have opened positions by looking at the peaks of ftds. I only checked stocks with relatively large peaks as a percentage of float idk about others. So basically for $NEGG there has been a considerable amount of short positions opened May 15 - Jun 15, these guys are underwater.

Next notice that GME FTD spike wasn’t the day that the tendie god turned on the money printer that magical January, it was actually in November. Every stock that has reach GME level of \`FTD % of Float\` moons later, the spike never really lines up with the dildo to heaven. It could happen a week later, months later, days later, but it seems that for the outliers its going to happen. $NEGG is in the middle of a squeeze and its FTD spike rival stocks that have gone +200 to +400% during the moonshot. The smaller the float and the higher the spike, the more the pop. I haven’t quantified this.

If you checked interactive brokers during the day you would have noticed that $NEGG had 0 shares available to short, and the borrow rate is >50%. At peak squeeze borrow rate usually spikes >100%. Lastly, in the last two days the short volume ratio has gone up by a factors & volume has gone up as well

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k32u8odrzt971.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8700f42420fd701af7899bffd6551844984163d

One thing I failed to mention is that the stock is already expensive to buy -- $20 -- ensuring that doubling down on shorting requires substantial capital. Looking at iborrowdesk.com we see that nice juicy slow creep up of borrow rate, and reduction of shares available to borrow, while the price slow bleeds up. So $negg is expensive to double down on and it expensive to borrow. Now look at your fave stock that has squeezed borrow rate   > 100% rn $negg borrow is a moderate \[50%? Need check\]. So basically what I’m saying is that $NEGG is in the beginning to mid part of a squeeze. Not a squeeze perpetuated by a hardened group of loyalist and propelled by whales. A squeeze caused by a <3.5m shares float, while all the exchanges having the wrong information, the realization is happening that there were barely any shares to begin with. This will be like a bank run, and I don’t have a logical price target. It could go up to $70.

Lastly, for squeezes price instability is needed aka liquidity is drying up. If you’ve been watching the intraday movements at all, with wide bid/ask spreads and limited orderbook. This plus increases in historic volatility indicated price instability/liquidity drying up.

Liquidity/ price instability is one of the main characteristics in which you can identify a squeeze; in general it indicate future volatility either a big move up or down, (too many buyers smashing the ask button, or too many sellers smashing the bid button) but we have enough information to identify the direction

# Fundamentals

This is the part i care least about,but it feels good to not yolo on a shit company (sorry $RIDE hodlers).

Newegg has been a one stop shop for PC building for years. Additionally they have also been expanding into selling in other areas such as VR, gaming consoles, digital games, and Auto parts.

Newegg is the #7 ranked electronics seller in the US

The 2020 numbers show significant growth from 2019.

(2020) 157m cash on hand       (2019) 80m

(2020) 30.5 net income              (2019) loss of 16m

(2020)  2.1 billion in net dales   (2019) 1.5billion

$CRSR, $LOGIC and other electronics sellers have been reporting record growth this year, just pencil Newegg in too for a booming sector.

Oh and they are reliable with a hardened group of supporters

Random dude on reddit - he knows more about a company I frankly don’t care about lol

>Not financial advice in anyway. I love Newegg as a company, and I'm freaking amped that they're public, so full disclosure, I've got biases. That being said, I think it's a solid buy. It seems only one analyst has really put a price target on it. I don't know who the analyst is, but any google search for a price target pings back the same, beautiful, 44$ prediction, spread across all of our favorite market commentators. (WSJ, Market Watch, Yahoo) If that's not enough to get you excited, we go to their financials. In 2016 they made a measly 13M$. 2017 came around, and they made an abysmal 1M$. 2018, though? 2.15B$. Mind you, they went from making 1Million dollars... to 2.1 BBillion. 2019, and 2020 were both in the 2 Billion dollar range. (Via WSJ) And now? GPU prices are inflated to high hell, son! Despite that, Newegg seems to be able to Earnings announcement is going to be fantastic! Lastly, let's take a look at technicals. Yesterday and the day before, NEGG had a huge run up! Literally having doubled its price at one point. (Ran from 10$ to 21$ before coming back down.) In that time, it showed strong support at 13. I thought we might see 13$ again today. Besides that, it showed support yesterday, at it's first dip, at 15$, bounced from there up to 19.5, before getting rejected. After it's rejection, it showed support at 16.75 for AH/PM, at 15.75$ for the intraday low. AND THEN IT BOUNCED BACK TO 17.75! If we break down under 15$, We might see 13$, again. Right now, it's gearing up to retest 21$. A rejection from that will likely put us back in this 17.75 range. If we break that 21$ resistance? Then we might get a test of 22$. We might see another gamma squeeze as brokers start hedging for the 22.5$ Calls.

I’m risky af probably better positions out there, took out 20k yesterday (Jul 6, 2021), positions above are as of of pre-market July 7.

The 13 $30 calls bought Jul 6, 2021for about $3 a pop, end of day they were $6.3, high of $8.1. Don’t think i’ve said this, but I believe legit $NEGG is a money printer.

# Advice

Taken from u/Fatinspiration

* **Don’t sell on dips.** You’re only helping the shorts. If you need to sell to take profits, sell when it’s heading up. *Sell high, not low, retards.*
* **Don’t buy calls on rips.** With everyone expecting a squeeze *at any moment* option premiums that are already high rocket to insane levels in minutes. You’re absolutely fucked if you buy calls on rips, even if you’re right.

There seems to be a lot of misinformation (likely for pump purposes) or lazy research out there.

**If you’re just riding the pump or are doing a covered call play, god speed. You may not care about this post.**

For anyone actually planning on holding through August 3, 2021, especially those trading on RH, please consider the following:

Shen sold their telecommunication business to T-Mobile (T) for $1.94 Billion (I’ll refer to this as TA)

$936.6 million to shareholders via special divided of $18.75

$684 is going to be used to pay down debt

The rest towards taxes I believe

After the sale of the telecommunication business, Shen will shift its focus to it’s broadband and tower business. I’ll refer to Shen post-sale of their telecom business as ShenP.

PE and Earnings Moving Forward 

The EPS for **TA** for 2020 was $2.48 and $0.97 last quarter (this is very solid)

The EPS for **ShenP** was $0.05 in 2020 and a solid $0.06 last quarter, 2022 forecasted EPS of $0.29

The revenues for **ShenP** were $220.78M and are forecasted to grow 10.6% for 2021 ($244.2M) and 2022 ($270M)

Google and yahoo give you a PE of 18.59 (I’ve seen this same number in posts), but **ShenP’s** PE for last Q’s earning is closer to 254 and the forecast for 2022 is a PE of 210. These are based on $61 per share.  Let’s say you’re still comfortable dealing with share price of $42.25 (61-18.75) because you get that juicy dividend, the PE is still very high at 176.

I’ve also seen a lot of information and spamming of don’t worry about your shares there will be a buyback after August 3, 2021. The buyback is about $20 million dollars. This is not worth talking about. Insignificant. Just being used as pump fodder. (Haven't see anything else related to a buyback)

Insiders didn’t hold many shares but they have been dumping this thing and now hold less that 1% of shares, sales as recent as June 10, 2021 for $50.43.

To those of you without premarket capabilities, you are far more likely to get stuck hold bags during the eventual sell off.  So what’s a company with $220.78M revenue and a forward guided EPS of $0.29 worth to you? If you buy it at $61 and are stuck holding the bag at $42.25, the special dividend premium was eaten up by your loss, you’re saying that company is worth $2.1 Billion dollars. **You’re paying $160M more than T-Mobile paid it’s acquisition but the company you own has 16x less earnings.**

For transparency, I hold puts, many many puts. I am not trying to create FUD or telling you to sell, I just want people to know what they are buying, I decided to use forward guidance and last Q which was solid for **ShenP** instead of 2020 numbers to try to be as fair as possible. If any of this looks inaccurate, please let me know."

This 'iBuying' of houses, where a home owner can sell directly Zillow, Redfin, and Opendoor, has some synergy with other revenue streams in the home-sector, such as mortgage lending, moving, renovations, renting, and insurance. 

A break-down of home flipping at scale, essentially: a home owner wants to sell his house, but doesn't want to get bogged down in the process of selling the house (fixing, renovating, countless showings to strangers, sentimental issues, bank stuff), so they \*one-click\* (probably a handful of clicks, but not many) sell their house to a RE-tech company at an agreed upon price. For the three RE-tech companies I listed above, their iBuying service is only available in a few markets---like 20, 25 cities with predictable home price trends. Places like Arizona, California, Texas.

Rich Barton, Zillow CEO / Co-Founder (who is a long-time tech badass, and like Musk and Dorsey has founded at least three companies with multi-billion dollar valuations---which puts him in a special class), said on the last earnings call that the target margin on their iBuying business is +/- 2%. This is a new business, and the dynamics are being tested out, but it looks good, he said. Getting the sale on their platform means more than the 2% gain (or loss) per each individual house because they can offer other products, like a mortgage or a listing advertisement. The house price itself is only one element of the whole Real Estate 2.0 vision.

The competition between Zillow, Redfin, and Opendoor might play out like that of UberEats, DoorDash, and Grubhub, where each company is burning a lot of money by making their apps better and their products cheaper. But in the case of RE-tech companies, one is not like the others. 

If you compare the profitability of the three big RE-tech companies, the one that stands out is Zillow. They are the clear leader when it comes to home searches, and that top-of-funnel does give them an advantage home flipping in the same sort of way as Google or Amazon having the advantage in their own search results.

[Zillow showing 3 quarters of Positive Operating Income](https://preview.redd.it/1dl4bwityp971.png?width=1331&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e53cb8c9be2ac6952aa7290de8b34644e08b05a)

Operating Income means revenue minus the costs of running the business. This is a super foundational aspect of a real company: can they make any money selling stuff. To note: the 3 quarters of positive operating income we see at the recent end of the chart set up Zillow (Z) for 4 quarters of profitability, which is required for inclusion into the S&P500 index---index fund managers need to buy a proportion of shares of any company that is included in that index, boosting its stock price. 

Using Hypercharts, I wanted to compare other industry leaders to see what kind of operating income was normal for a growth company. The graph turned out to be pretty surprising:

&#x200B;

[A profit comparison of Zillow, Spotify, Snap, and Square](https://preview.redd.it/qakuuqoa1q971.png?width=1331&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d3ff70b5f087d4e0a9a27bfabf24df24a7b4ca)

The crazy thing is: Zillow makes more money selling products and services than Square, Snap, or Spotify, which are all close to $100B in market cap, while Zillow (Z) is only $30B, three times less. Again, the operating income is what we would call the *money these companies make*\---it's the size of the checks they are putting into the bank.

&#x200B;

This is only Part 1 of my DD. Please like for Part 2, which will look deeper into the financials.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Zillow is the market leader in Real Estate. iBuying could be competitive, but Zillow is already making a surprising amount of money."

(and what little selling may occur from employees- is a drop in the ocean compared to retail buyers... considering SOFI has less than 1000 employees). 


Cramer just included SoFI as 1 of the post merger SPACs to buy now. SOFI has all buy ratings from analysts- with an initial $30 price target.  SoFI also has one of the highest short float % at around 45% (which meaning many Millions of shares have to he bought to cover those short positions). 


And with a market cap under $14B, SOFI is extremely undervalued (consider Robinhood going public later this summer around $40B.. likely to be $60B after 1st day of trading).  Buying SOFI anywhere near current prices- will definitely be a winner going forward.... and if SOFI gets several days of sustained volume... it is very likely to have a big run/squeeze combo in the immediate future. But its a definite big winner either way.  Not to mention a 2 for 1 deal... as Galileo will be worth just as much as SOFI- and an option to spin off in the Future (similar to EBay & Paypal)


**Summary of SOFI Becoming a Fintech Behemoth**

Fintech is becoming the next big disruptor- and Sofi is being positioned to be the real leader in this category (and currently- the dinosaur banks have market caps of 300B, $450B, etc). Not only is SOFI the only internet bank with the full slate of financial products...
they also have Galileo for the platform/
Software fintech play... just look at the top quality leadership team SOFI is attracting... Anthony Noto as CEO.. CFO came from Uber... person in charge of Galileo from Google,etc.


**Overview of Business **

SoFi acquisition of Golden Pacific will make it a
national bank, like JPMorgan Chase. This will
allow SOFI to take direct deposits & make
loans based on those deposits, rather than
acting as a re-seller.

Sofi also offers Credit Cards & recently
announced it deal to offer auto loans. Also,
theres SoFi brokerage, which competes with
Robinhood.

(Part I: Balls of Steel),407,62,2021-07-07 03:57:18,"Prepare to ask yourself: ""Is that scrap steel in my pocket, or am I just happy to meet SCHN?"" as I kick off an epic three part series on Schnitzer Steel with a balls-of-steel short term bet. These junkyard bums used to barely scrape a living by buying your junk car, removing the upholstery stained with your trisomy sperm, stripping the car down more than your mom did on stage while pregnant with you, then finally harvesting the steel for cash.

Nowadays, Schnitzer is rolling in tendies, and not just the ones they find underneath the car seats. Due to several industry tailwinds set to continue for years, scrap prices are at decade long highs. As Cleveland Cliffs CEO and steel oracle Lourenco Goncalves stated just last week: **""Prime scrap is the new precious metal.""** Schnitzer are industry experts at collecting, sorting, processing, and selling and exporting the stuff.

I'm balls deep long on SCHN because I agree that the demand for scrap will reach record highs in the coming years, and because SCHN is perfectly situated to take advantage. However, **currently there's a short term play that worked out for me last time, and this time around the set-up is even better.** It'll make for a good introduction to this ticker.

In this part 1 of 3, I go over that idiotic bet for you to get all apish over and blame me if it doesn't work out. Parts 2 and 3 will be much more in depth and long-term focused.

**tldr:**

* The previous three quarters, SCHN went down after beating earnings, only to quickly recover and hit new 52w highs. SCHN just posted an earnings beat last week and, surprise surprise, it went down. I think it will pop back up, because:
* SCHN trends with the price of HRC (steel futures), since this drives demand for scrap. HRC has been going up up up.
* The SCHN/HRC spread is at a low right now; recently it has always bounced back up within about a month, and always before next earnings.
* SCHN's IV is low since they just reported earnings, making the upside to this quite significant.
* Other steel companies post Q2 earnings this month... look at HRC prices and tell me they won't blow the lid off earnings, taking SCHN up with them.
* In my estimation, there are several significant upside risks, and few downside risks.
* PTs: $55 by end of July, $60 by end of August.
* Bonus: **I did this play last earnings and flipped $3k into $10k.** With 4-month out options.

Positions:

* Jul Calls ($50, $55): 15%
* Aug Calls ($50, $55): 15%
* Commons: 70%

# I. SCHN's earnings cycles summarized

===============

Note: **I created an Appendix for actual wrinkle-generation at the bottom. Go take a look now if you care.** You don't really *need* to know that stuff to smash the ""buy-FDs-at-market-price"" button with your closed fist while grunting ""fuck hedgies"" or whatever, but knowing this stuff will certainly help you explain to your step-dad why his credit limit was reached.

===============

This short-term play is mostly based on the last three post-earning periods that all show the same pattern: **SCHN gets dumped after beating earnings, then roars back to 52w highs and closes the spread with steel prices.** I believe this post-earnings price action is driven by two factors: A rise in steel prices, and positive earnings from steel companies. **The set-up this time around looks even better, and further catalysts are listed in another section.**

Why am I only looking at the three last earning periods? This is when the steel boom really began (HRC going from $475 to $1800). Prior to that, steel prices were dirt cheap and steel related stocks were in a glut. If you don't know about the whole steel resurgence thing, read some CLF/TX DDs or wait for Part II. Long story short: demand is increasing (infrastructure, autos, etc), supply is decreasing (limited capacity, China not exporting as much).

Anyway, **this dump after earnings is not a surprise for those of us that follow the stock.** We SCHN traders call this the ""back up the truck"" period: After earnings, we load up on more shares. Now you can be like us! (Except you probably won't buy shares.)

I did this same strategy last earnings and flipped $3k to $10k. This time around has some advantages: SCHN/HRC spread is better, 52w is already established at \~$60, HRC has gone up the roughly same, and Q2 steel earnings will be randy-at-computer.jpg. There are also some possible catalysts (but I wouldn't bet on those alone).

# II. The Chart

Here's a pretty picture for you:

[Crayons make me want to buy.](https://preview.redd.it/ap7xzhs0en971.png?width=1819&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2033e9b07541842b8b6fae7285948da3b2cf3dc)

I'll describe the chart in more detail, as surely the bright colors are causing some sort of primitive fight-or-flight response. It's ok, guys, daddy is right here.

## The Pattern

1. Steel prices (the gray line) rise a ton during the quarter.
2. The market expects SHCN to have a huge earnings beat.
3. SCHN gets pumped up in the week prior to earnings.
4. SCHN reports, and it's only a really big earnings beat, but not an OJ-Simpson-beating-murder charges type of beat.
5. Market over-sells SCHN.
6. HRC inevitably rises more, after the sideways leading-into-the-month period.
7. Within a month, steel stocks report record earnings.
8. Market realizes: Oh, shit HRC prices are still climbing and SCHN actually *did* crush earnings pretty bigly, and everything steel is raking in cash!
9. SCHN races upwards and obliterates the SCHN/HRC spread.
10. Multibagger, depending on how retarded you play it.

## The SCHN/HRC Spread

This is the graph at the bottom. It's the price of HRC (steel) divided by the SCHN share price.

If you want a better understanding of this, head to the appendix. Otherwise, just read this sentence: **When HRC goes up, SCHN makes more money**. So, the two should track relatively well, and for the most part, they do (+/- 15%).

The pattern I notice is that when this spread gets low, it doesn't stay low for long. It inevitably goes back up as the market takes into account that SCHN will be selling their scrap for beaucoup dollars. In fact, it seems to run up at least once before the next earnings period, often times within just a month. **I'm betting on run up occurring again soon.**

The yellow circles are good buy points (if red) and good sell points (if green). Follow the yellow lines up...

## The Wieners

The yellow lines are the ""bump"" periods we want to capture. I highlighted the price action between the ""buy"" and ""sell"" periods to create some of my patented beautiful [green dildos](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nzszyd/bgs_green_giant_dildos_and_cream_of_wsb/).

**I actually played this strategy after the earnings in April:**

[$3k to $10k after last earnings.](https://preview.redd.it/55d2sfu1en971.png?width=968&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e995942051ba727486c1ffe8737b85091412888)

Being the conservative little bitch that I was back then, I bought a full four months out to *August*, paper handed some calls, and still managed to 2.5x my initial investment. I don't have historical data, but if I followed the yellow dots and bought March or April calls instead, I'm sure that's at least a 10-bagger.

# III. HRC Prices / Other Steel Stocks

Critical to this short-term thesis:

1. HRC prices continue to rise (or, at least not fall), and within a month or two.
2. Steel companies blow out earnings.

## HRC Prices

Let's take a closer look at HRC prices:

Prices of HRC contracts over time. They go up.

[$3k to $10k after last earnings.](https://preview.redd.it/q9tb01o2en971.png?width=1095&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c291cc469d7a6e8eac3d64f3c3d4a44b852a3df)

This charts the price of each HRC contract through time. You won't find this chart anywhere else because I had to scrape websites and do a ton of tedious bullshit to make this chart.

The whole reason I track this is because bought a ton of HRC contracts (\~300 tons worth of future-steel) right before that big dip in May, got margin called four days in a row, didn't fold like a paper handed bitch, and just finally made it out alive with a bit of profit. The reason the chart is rainbow colored, however, is because I'm super gay, and not because it's the default colors of google charts.

Anyway, here's what I learned trading futures and what you should notice: **HRC prices move sideways into the new month, then start to climb a week or so later.** Go ahead, look at each new month. I even marked it with scribbles.

I believe this is due to low volumes during the front of the month as hedges against steel orders for future months are just starting to get worked out. It just occurred to me I could plot the total volume of all contracts... (30 minutes later)...

&#x200B;

[ Volumes and prices often pick up after the beginning of each month.](https://preview.redd.it/8wmklz44en971.png?width=938&format=png&auto=webp&s=6882045d216f7560755f77f1f26cb42d52cfc7b7)

It looks like there are two patterns:

1. Volume (of all contracts) does tend to settle during the month change.
2. The more volume there is, the more the price changes (roughly).

It's not iron clad, but it looks more often than not HRC prices like to run-up mid month as volume picks up. I just checked my calendar. It's almost mid month.

Now, here's the kicker: **SCHN reports near the new month, when HRC prices trade sideways.** That's to our advantage, because what happens when HRC prices start to climb again? That's right retards, SCHN goes up with it.

## Steel Earnings

Besides HRC prices themselves, the other part of this short-term thesis is that steel stocks will post incredible earnings (yet again), causing share prices to rise and pulling SCHN up with them.  Steelmaking stocks have been covered to death in other DDs, so I won't go into too much detail.

However, I will say that steelmakers are absolutely rolling in cash right now. Their profit margins are so high that each dollar increase in HRC prices are effectively a dollar of profit (times the millions of tons of steel they produce).

**This quarter will be even better, due to the lag between steel prices and the revenues steelmakers actually get, as well as HRC outpacing everybody's expectations.** Steelmakers, such as CLF, have different types of contracts -- some yearly, some quarterly, some monthly, some at spot. A significant amount of their contracts, with auto manufacturers for example, are yearly and quarterly. As the old contracts expire and the new ones are negotiated, steelmakers rake in the profits from high steel prices.

I expect steelmakers' earnings to be quite solid, as they have been all year. There's zero reason to believe otherwise.

## The takeaway

Drill this into your brain:

* HRC trades sideways into the new month, then starts to rip. This is good, because you can buy SCHN cheap before HRC takes off again.
* HRC has been ripping non-stop all year. These insane prices will show up even more in steelmakers' Q2 earnings due to contracts being renegotiated.
* What's good for steelmakers is good for SCHN.

# IV. Downside Risks

Now before you get all giddy over this, it's time to go over the bad news: Your mom hates you, and you could lose money on this bet.

## Past results may not be indicative of future results

This is obvious, which means it definitely needs to be stated. The past three earnings have shown SCHN to bounce back (relative to HRC) before the next earnings period.. but this doesn't make it a guarantee. Ok?

Also, HRC could *fall* to close the SCHN/HRC gap. As unlikely as I see this, anything is possible. The reason I don't think HRC will fall is because demand is so solid, and supply is not increasing. If anything, worldwide supply is decreasing as China is increasingly showing signs of cutting production and disincentivizing the exporting of their steel. Remember, they export 15-20% of the world's steel, so what they do is *very* significant.

Oh, right, downside risks. Ok, here we go:

## China

HRC took a big tumble in May because [China fucked with their commodities market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/china-exchanges-move-to-cool-iron-ore-steel-price-rally-2021-05-10) in an attempt to suppress runaway commodity prices. They basically jacked up margin requirements overnight, so that in the morning traders got slammed with margin calls and either had to liquidate or deposit more capital to hold their now-shitty positions in contracts that were getting liquidated by everyone else.

From the article:

>BEIJING, May 10 (Reuters) - China's commodity exchanges on Monday moved to raise trading limits and margin requirements for some iron ore contracts and reinstated fees on steel futures as a blistering rally in the ferrous metals complex showed no signs of abating.

This dip in commodities spread overseas, and I got fucking slammed by it, so I am fully aware of how effective China can be when it comes to manipulation.

**China still has an incentive to manipulate HRC prices downward.** They want to keep their steel within their borders, and keep that steel cheap, to feed their 6% yearly growth target. As such they can do crazy shit like fuck with their futures market (which will have contagion around the world), make crazy announcements, and who knows what the fuck else.

However, I find an export tax to ""seal the borders of steel"" to be much more likely and beneficial approach. See upside risks.

## The Fire in May

On May 22, 2021, SCHN experienced a fire at its Cascade Steel Rolling Mill in McMinnville, Oregon. They stated in earnings that they very confident insurance will fully cover the repair costs as well as missed revenues. However, that's not settled yet, and they are waiting for confirmation.

It's possible they are found at fault and/or that the insurance payment is much less than expected. This could ding the stock a bit.

On the flipside, the confirmation of coverage could come sooner and be higher than expected. (It's in the upsides as well.)

## The usual, contagions, etc

SCHN is not immune to any of the following:

* Unforeseen bad news for SCHN. I don't know, maybe their [hottie CEO](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tamara+Lundgren+bikini&tbm=isch) dies or something.
* Unforeseen bad news for US Steelmakers (SCHN correlates highly).
* Unforeseen bad news for market. Burry, JPow, just stfu for a few weeks. Biden, stfu about taxes.
* A continued dumping of value stocks for shiny growth stocks.

\---

# V. Upside Risks

**The largest catalysts have already been mentioned in depth:**

1. SCHN/HRC gap closing short term and/or by next earnings. This has been a consistent pattern.
2. HRC bumping up mid-month, after the into-the-month sideways pattern.
3. Q2 steelmakers' pulling up SCHN with them.

I'll move on to other catalysts now. To be clear, I would not be making the bet based on any of these catalysts occurring, they're just possible ""bonuses"".

## China

China produces, consumes, and exports the most steel of any country. To a large degree, they dictate the global price of steel. Any decrease in the amount of steel they export will lead to higher HRC prices globally. **Higher HRC prices means higher scrap prices, means more profits for SCHN.**

Furthermore, any drop in production increases the likelihood they will export less. Why? China needs the steel for themselves to fuel their 6% GDP growth.

So, count 'em, two possible catalysts from China that may increase steel prices:

1. An export tax. [This has been rumored for awhile](https://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3990727/FOCUS-What-Chinas-possible-new-steel-export-taxes-mean-for-global-ferrous-industry.html), but could become a reality at any time.
2. A drop in production. [A decrease in 30% production in the main steel town in China](https://finance.sina.cn/2021-07-06/detail-ikqciyzk3735769.d.html?sinawapsharesource=newsapp&wm=3200_0024) was actually reported yesterday, July 5.

## Positive News on Chip Shortage / Autos

I don't follow semis or chip shortage news much, so perhaps this is already priced in. However, anything good for autos is good for steelmakers, which is good for SCHN.

If the market digests news that auto manufacturers are running at full speed again, they may begin to value US steelmaker stocks more highly. This would likely pull up SCHN.

## Other Macro Stuff

Not long ago we had a shift from growth-to-value. That seems to have reversed, but it's always possible it starts back up again. This play is so short term that I wouldn't bet on it, unless you are going out until to November or buying shares.

## Little Schnitzer Things

## Possible Dividend Increase?

I'm not sure where or when dividends are declared, so feel free to call me a complete dumbass about this. I searched their last earnings report and could not find the declaration of their next dividend (the one after this upcoming July 9th one).

So, there's a possibility they announce their next dividend soon, and it's higher than expected. I do not expect there to be much impact from this, but just throwing it out there as a possibility.

## Insurance Settlement

As noted in the downside risks, in May Schnitzer experienced a fire in their steel mill in Oregon. In their earnings report they mentioned they are still waiting for the exact settlement number:

>We have insurance that we believe is fully applicable to the losses and are currently working with our insurers on claims for property loss and damage and business interruption losses. We anticipate that insured recoveries made of policy deductibles and various conditions, exclusions and limits will cover most of the cost to repair and replace lost and damaged assets and also a significant amount of lost income as a result of the fire. The accounting recognition of such recoveries is expected to occur over several quarters.

It's possible this number is announced soon. Though it's not likely to be impactful, I thought it was worth a mention.

\---

# VI. Appendix (Optional): Steel, Scrap, and SCHN.

**You can skip this if you are manically scrolling to the bottom to see positions and shit.**

## Scrap

Steel is one of the most recyclable materials in the world. It is also environmentally taxing (and increasingly expensive) to create from scratch. As such, steelmakers prefer to buy scrap and melt it down to make new steel.

Scrap metal in the US is plentiful, as we enjoyed much of the 20th century being the steel center of the world. We have a lot of if laying around. Think: those junkyards with car skeletons and washing machines stacked high. (You should have a drive-by and see for yourself if those piles are getting higher or lower.)

Being responsible soy cucks that care about the environment, the US has also spent the last 100 years building out businesses to collect, sort, process, and reuse scrap metal. One such leading business that is publicly traded is SCHN.

## EAFs

An elecrical arc furnace (EAF) is a new-ish type of steel furnace that uses electricity to smelt steel. [They are loud as fuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j2jESz7Zl8#t=1m32s) and if I could choose my own death, it would death by EAF.

Anyway, EAFs are great because they *drastically* reduce CO2 emissions as well as PM2.5 emissions (small 2.5um particles that make humans sick when they breath them). They can take scrap metal as input, allowing for cheap and easy recycling of steel. **EAFs are the future of steelmaking, and is why ""scrap will become the next precious metal.""**

## Steel Prices

The price of steel (eg, HRC prices) is a rough proxy for how valuable scrap is. Steelmakers can buy scrap, smelt it, and then sell the new steel. If they can sell steel for more, they can afford to buy scrap for more.

SCHN collects scrap and sells it. As steel prices climb, SCHN can sell the scrap they collect for more. While it may become more costly for them to collect the scrap, their margins have actually increased. Their margins have steadily increased: 13% (Q4 - quarter ending Aug '20), 14.63% (Q1), 18.84% (Q2), 17.35% (Q3 - ending May '21, reported last week).

## China

China makes 55% of the world's steel (and exports 15-20% of the world's steel), and until now they have not been responsible soy cucks. As noted in [this article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tangshan-steel/china-environment-minister-urges-crackdown-on-steel-mills-illegal-production-idUSKBN2B407Q) (March '21):

>China has pledged to cut its crude steel output in 2021 from a record 1.06 billion tons it churned out last year to reduce carbon emissions. The steel sector accounts for 15% of China’s total emissions, topping all other manufacturing categories. “Steel companies are the main body responsible for air pollution...(they) should not just focus on performance and leave pollution to local people,” said Huang (the ""Minister of Ecology and Environment"" in charge of cracking down on steelmakers)

Their air quality sucks, it's killing people, and they have the Olympics coming up:

&#x200B;

[Apparently some regions are like smoking 40 cigarettes a day.](https://preview.redd.it/ev6pr9f5en971.jpg?width=580&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5add313e6aa51a7a8e606788daacb2a98d1b6d3f)

To cut pollution from steel, China is doing the following:

1. Cutting down on production
2. Cutting down on exporting (they recently removed an incentive to export steel, and a tax is rumored to be in the works)
3. Switching to EAFs. (BTW: China doesn't have 100 years of junk cars laying around.)

**All three of these drive a higher price of steel and a higher demand for scrap.**

## tldr long-term basics:

* Steelmakers love scrap
* High steel prices (HRC) means SCHN makes more money
* China makes, consumes, and exports the most steel (by far) of anyone in the world
* China essentially dictates the price of steel around the world
* China is exporting less = HRC prices go up
* China is switching to EAFs = China will want scrap

# VII. The Bets

The risk/reward metrics for various calls are for you to determine, but I'll share my notes.

The ""moderately retarded"" bet would be Aug $50's. They're \~$2.50 and I think they'll be above $10.00 at some point. That's about the same risk/reward as Aug $55's ($1.25, could end at $5.00), but the $50s, being closer to ITM, are much safer.

Some more notes/advice for you to ignore:

* My PT for this bet is $55 for July and $60 by August.
* Both IV and share price on SCHN are looking juicy on the drop after earnings, and especially given today's price action in steel. (It's interesting to see SCHN recovering faster than the pack.)
* SCHN IV, at time of writing (3:30pm Tuesday) is at 48% -- 14th %'ile over 26w period. Looks good to me.
* The volume on SCHN is rather low... based on past experience posting about WWE and BGS, that could mean the stock and/or IV pops. If it does, then sit it out and wait for better entry. You have time.
* Don't YOLO, determine what you are willing to pay right now before looking at the prices, and if the market is pricing it otherwise, then wait.

As noted in the DD, I expect steelmakers' earnings will be good and will lift SCHN, though it may take a week or two for them to actually move. Here's a list of upcoming earnings:

* STLD: Jul 19-ish
* NUE: Jul 21-ish
* CLF: Jul 22
* X: Jul 28-ish

## Aug 20 Calls

The real taster's choice shit. This give exposure to steelmakers' earnings, plus some time for the market to digest them. They cover August 1st, which could be a possible China export tax announcement date. They also give plenty of time for SCHN/HRC to close. Based on the past three post-earnings periods, SCHN has gone up significantly within 45 days.

The prices are nice -- $55 calls are around $1.10 a pop, so that's a 4-bagger if my $60 PT is hit, and more if the IV and/or share price rally before expiration. Given that the $50's are similar ($2.50 each), they're a safer bet.

## Nov Calls

In my opinion, these are pointlessly far out for this bet. The main catalysts will have already happened by Aug 20, so why pay for time you won't use? There might be a play here to go OTM and hope for a volatility spike into steelmakers' earnings -- but I think liquidity will be shit. I'm passing on these."
of0hls,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of0hls/let_me_clear_the_air_here_regarding_gme_amc_clov/,"Let me clear the air here regarding GME, AMC, & CLOV",15065,2132,2021-07-07 02:06:24,"Alright you retards, I'm taking the initiative to clear the air. I'm probably going to get a lot of downvotes, but I'm going to be straight up honest here.

We are not a team, this is not a cult, and this is not fucking collusion.

GME, AMC, & CLOV are three completely different plays. Stop fucking comparing the 3 with this cult like attitude.

**GME** \- Was being shorted because as per ""technicals"" it was a company that was going to shit (bankruptcy) if they didn't change leadership and incorporate strategic changes to their business model aka E-Commerce and the like. Additionally, the biggest reason GME picked up in late December/early January is because it had a ridiculous/unprecedented short interest of %140. Making the short squeeze extremely likely to occur. The stock picked up, gamma squeeze and short squeezes occurred and it's still the play to this day. Why? because the remaining \~15-20% short sellers still holding their positions are the same ones from the beginning who have accumulated billions in loses, thus still considered a major play + the company making big changes to their board of directors, adding e-commerce and more etc.

**AMC** \- This stock sucked dick when it was first picked up. The only reason this stock got picked up was because of nostalgia and because of people missing out on GME. The SI% on AMC back when GME rallied up was well below 20%. This company as well was on the verge of bankruptcy. It got picked up by the supporters like us apes and more shorts loaded in. AMC due to the retail investors ""Picking"" this stock to rally up actually has started to work on their business model and accrued $1B in investments and has started to really concentrate on building the business into a success (hopefully). When the CEO said the talks of bankruptcy are no longer on the table, is because even they knew at the time that filing for bankruptcy was a real possibility for the company. Again, the CEO has fucked over investors in the past by trying to continually dilute the float with adding more shares. On top of that prior to the stocks rallying up the board and CEO's paid themselves handsomely when the company was about to fail. Now, the narrative is different for AMC as the shorts that are in this stock are the same ones from the beginning and have also accrued unrealized losses. Also, seems the company has really pivoted to reconstruct their business model to become a success once COVID-19 is no longer hindering the world from being normal again, thus, making AMC still a very big play.

**CLOV** \- Was ridiculously shorted the moment it hit IPO. This had nothing to do with GME or AMC. The short interest on CLOV has been there since IPO. The play for CLOV is that it's a Medicare Advantage Disruptor, and provides a real use case and a cost effective solution to the traditional Medicare Advantage sub-segment that hasn't changed in ages. This stock has a large short interest, now probably greater then AMC and GME combined, low float, no debt, and has a very bright future for growth. It's also heavily invested by Alphabet (Google) and other major players. The firms shorting CLOV are not the same as those who shorted GME and AMC, separate that from your minds.

Yes, Melvin Capital, Citadel and others targeted GME and AMC, but this has no relevance to CLOV. No one gives a fuck, a viable stock that has a potential to disrupt a market segment that is also heavily shorted is the play for CLOV. That's it, simple as that.

All 3 of these stocks are completely different plays. Yes, a short squeeze and/or gamma squeeze will always be appreciated on any stock. But get this through your heads, THEY ARE NOT THE SAME PLAY! They are completely different in respect to each other.

WSB is a casino, we're here to place bets and hope for the best. This is not a team sport, this is not a cult, and this is not collusion.

If you don't like a stock, then don't throw money at it. But stop with the shilling and the cult attitude predominantly from GME and AMC diehards that can't grasp that WSB is a casino and not a subreddit solely about GME or AMC. (I'm not talking about GME and AMC holders as a whole, most of you are chill af, just some that are constantly shilling everything with a ticker thats not GME or AMC).

Now with this shit said, I'm a big supporter of all 3. But for fuck sakes they are not the same play, stop comparing the 3.

Don't forget AMC dropped to $6 and AMC bagholders were bag holding for months before it moved. GME dropped to $40 and GME holders were bag holding for months before it moved.

Everyone needs to chill the fuck out, play your plays and keep it moving. Stop shilling shit and comparing shit when they're not correlated at all.

BB and NOK became ""Meme"" stocks because fundamentally, they were undervalued for what the company actually does and where they're positioning themselves for the future.

People just need to stop comparing and having these debates. 3 stocks, 3 completely different plays, fuck off and throw your money at which ever stocks you like and hope for the best, just stop with the comparisons and cult shit it's ridiculous.

Also, the short squeeze is nowhere near in sight. You think the short sellers are dumb as fuck? They're going to wait until inflation hits and fucks up the whole market. They're probably betting that once the market goes tits up, people bag holding these stocks will sell, why? Because they anticipate people will need to pay for bills, mortgages/rent, their children etc, and with the cost of living, cost of commodities inflating due to inflation, I can easily see how they're going to hold onto their positions (shorting these stocks) until this occurs. They're banking that when shit goes tits up, the investors in these stocks will also go tits up and FUD will kick in causing massive selloffs. (My personal opinion).

Some plays on WSB are value plays, short squeeze plays, gamma squeeze plays, undervalued plays, oversold plays, etc the fucking list goes on.

WSB is a god damn casino, so treat it as such. I wish you all the best and many tendies, regardless of what you're invested in. Downvote me to oblivion, idgaf.

**Important update**: I want to say thanks to everyone for the awards, upvotes and comments.

I want to clarify some FUD here after the traction from this post. When I was referring to \~15-20% short sellers for GME I **was not** referring to short interest or the ""naked"" shorts everyone is talking about. Simply, that the original short sellers that are still in their positions haven't closed out their positions yet, same goes for AMC, and the big MOASS that everyone is mentioning is not what I meant when I said gamma squeeze or short squeezes. I was simply referring to when GME spiked to $438 and months after again to $330. I wasn't talking about the big MOASS.

I've been on WSB since December 2020 but only joined on January 28th, 2021 when I felt like I wanted to start to contribute myself. I was here before there was 500k members. I used to only use reddit to view posts and discussion and never really felt the need to create an account until I found stock/investment subreddits etc. Hopefully this clears some shit up. Again, the purpose of this post was to explain why these 3 stocks are not the same and shouldn't be compared to each other and for people to stop shilling others and having this ""cult"" like attitude/behaviour.

Oh! and the reason why my post mentions GME, AMC, CLOV is because it was the 3 top tickers on the thread for the day this post was made, 07/06/2021.

PUBM has been a name that has been floating around for a few weeks now, usually in the context of its high short interest. As we dug into the name further, we were pleasantly surprised to find out that this company is not dog-shit, is not failing, nor is it in a dying industry (as most of the other short interest plays that will remain unnamed), but a thriving company in an accelerating industry. This post will guide you through how we stumbled on the name, the company and its financials, the industry, the short-interest, and the plan. There are several angles of attack here, enough for everyone to get their grubby little hands dirty: traders, investors and gamblers. A summary:

&#x200B;

* Clean financials, with earnings beat and raised guidance
* Undervalued compared to peers
* Secular tailwinds as digital advertising expands
* Dual class share structure which disincentivize insider selling
* High short interest (anywhere from 20%-50% as of 6/24)
* High institutional ownership (74%)
* Small float with tight liquidity
* Bottoming chart pattern with reversal
* Options chain initiation on 6/25 - with more strikes to be added imminently

Plan: Shares for the conservative players. Options - the chain is limited because options were just introduced - pound any and all strikes - with focus on the longer-dated.

Disclaimer: Multiple people have contributed to this report, and most have shares in the $30 range when the idea of this play was first conceived.

**The Origins and Chart Analysis**

What caught our interest originally, was a volume scan. After market close on 6/7, $PUBM showed up on a scanner looking for relative volume increases. This is a scan I use a lot, as it’s a good way to follow the whales as they tip their hand when scaling into a position. When you see big volume moves (over the relative average), but little price movement, it’s usually a sign of institutional accumulation. The big players piece into positions slowly as not to price themselves out with a massive market order. In the case of $PUBM, despite a 3x volume spike, price only increased a modest 5%. These moves are often signs of trend reversals when an institution slams its wizard staff into the ground and says, “You shall not pass!”. The last three weeks have seen the most shares traded in $PUBM’s history - even more than when $PUBM IPO’d in December of 2020.

In addition to accumulation volume, the PUBM chart is a perfect example of both types of head and shoulder patterns (topping H & S, and bottoming inverse H & S) - see Chart 1. The original H & S called out the top, and now we see an inverse head and shoulders formed, which is typically a signal of a bottoming, reversal pattern. The breakout was rejected at the original “neckline” of the topping pattern, and retested the breakout point on 7/2/21 - and has held. This is the beginning of a text-book trend-reversal breakout. The chart setup is a buy.  But what is it we’re buying?

**So What Exactly is Pubmatic?**

In short, Pubmatic is an advertising technology company. For most of human history, business owners have been using ads to sell their products, inform their customers of a value proposition, or build brands. With the advent of the internet, “adtech” companies like Google have grown rich and powerful by allowing advertisers to communicate with any type of customer they want, virtually instantaneously, as much as they want. No other form of advertising offers these features and as such, the digital advertising market has become *extremely* complex with hundreds of billions of dollars on the line every year. This trend toward digital advertising is expected to continue (figure 1):

Pubmatic operates and competes in this space, specifically programmatic advertising. Before programmatic, digital ads were bought and sold by teams of people on either side of the equation, which was slow and cumbersome. Now there are scores of companies that have built software and infrastructure that allows digital ad space to be traded programmatically. The market share of programmatic advertising as part of all digital advertising has been on the rise (figure 2):

https://preview.redd.it/bh073a1m4l971.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9444f4c9a7635ea35bfcd5b0cd76bdaef28c397c

Since Pubmatic is a programmatic ad company – it is benefiting from these two tailwinds: more ads are becoming digital and more digital ads are becoming programmatic.

Programmatic channels primarily have two sides to them: the buy side and the sell side. At a basic level, publishers generate revenue by selling digital ad space on their content, and advertisers/marketing agencies will purchase this ad space to place an ad in front of a potential customer.

Pubmatic is an SSP or supply side platform. Publishers will integrate and configure Pubmatic’s software to allow for the transactions to take place. Publishers want the best outcomes possible for their ad slots, so more often than not, they’ll integrate with multiple SSPs in an effort to increase their overall yield. I can’t stress this enough: the programmatic ad market is so complex, I would be willing to bet that a single person couldn’t wrap their head around the whole thing. It is mountainous in size. **Trillions and trillions** of programmatic ads are served up across advertising verticals, across global markets, and across billions of devices every month. Any sizable publisher that wants to efficiently sell their inventory at scale must work with an SSP and compete in the broader programmatic ad market.

Needless to say, most digital channels continued to grow as people spent more time inside and on their devices. Pubmatic’s revenue continued to grow YoY as overall advertising spend took a big hit (due to COVID). The most exciting part about this is that global ad spend is projected to return to its normal growth pattern – you can see this already taking place in figure 3.

So not only did Pubmatic gain a greater share of the total advertising dollars in 2020, the overall advertising pie is going to grow as well. This rebound in ad spend is yet another tailwind for Pubmatic. If you’re keeping count – that makes three so far:

1. More ads are becoming digital
2. More digital ads are becoming programmatic
3. More overall ad spend in the future

**Shut up and talk about the short interest!**

Since short interest is what all the kids talk about these days, that was where we headed to next. In addition to looking at squeeze probability, it is good to know if a company is highly shorted. Most short-sellers know their stuff (except maybe Melvin), and if a company is highly shorted, it’s usually for a reason. $PUBM has short interest that is estimated as high as 50% in some places. We actually believe this to be an inflation due to a quirk in the public float involving share types, which the aggregators such as Bloomberg and others haven’t caught on to yet (will explain later). There is a chance we are incorrect about this, but according to our calculations, the short interest is closer to the 20% mark - which of course, is still very high. Price peaked at $77 during the first week in March, and shorts have hammered it ever since. The question is, why?

**The insider lockup**

Like most newly IPO’d companies, there was an insider share lockup. These insider shares were mostly of the class B variety; these were shares awarded to VC firms and investors that have been with the company since its inception in 2008. PUBM announced during the Spring that those insiders with class B shares (of which there are 40+ million of), were free to sell as of 6/1. While we don’t know if this is what short-sellers had in mind, it is probably a safe bet. A similar situation happened to PLTR a few months back when they had their own insider lockup expiration. So the next question is…

**Did the insiders sell?**

Some did, but not many. It is estimated that roughly 4-6M class B insider shares have been sold - only one firm has liquidated, the other big players are still in. Why are they still in the game? $PUBM has an interesting quirk in their share and voting structure where class B shareholders hold a 10:1 voting advantage over the class A (public float) holders. Their one class B share gets 10 votes per share, vs our 1 vote per class A share. If you want to still retain voting power within the company, you really do not want to sell your class B shares. Furthermore, if class B shareholders sell, it consolidates the voting power of the remaining class B shareholders. Why this is important is because everytime a class B share is sold, it converts to a class A public share; this is what is missing when everyone talks about the short interest. Some of these class B holders have sold, converting their shares into class A and thus increasing the public float, and diluting the short interest. However, most insiders have held - and will most likely continue to hold if they still want a voting stake within the company. Worth noting is that two of the biggest holders, VC firms Nexus India Capital and August Capital, both have seats on the Board of Directors - so it is unlikely that they will sell a meaningful amount any time soon. So the lockup has come and gone without too much damage - share price bottomed out and has now increased. Why else would someone be short?

**The privacy wave**

Consumer data has been called the oil of our generation. All of the data that is generated on your devices is sold, recorded, and analyzed. Companies do this in order to serve you targeted ads based on your spending habits and characteristics. In the past, all of this has been done without the full knowledge or consent of the end user (you). Once people started to realize just how far the tracking had gone, governments and individuals started to demand better privacy from adtech companies. Apple has been leading this effort across the board since privacy has become part of their brand image. Agencies and advertisers have become drunk off of readily available third party consumer data and as the privacy wave makes its way across the world, we’re going to see less third party data available to advertisers.

Last year, Google said they would start phasing out browsers from accepting the third-party cookies that help advertisers, publishers and data brokers profile you to help advertisers target ads toward you. The change would prevent an adtech company  (PUBM) that recorded your visit to a trading website from later showing you ads for that stupid day trader guy with long red hair and a beard (I know you’ve seen those ads before). This in effect would hinder all adtech companies from doing what they do.

But this dropped two days ago (6/23)

[https://www.cnet.com/news/google-delays-chromes-cookie-blocking-privacy-plan-by-nearly-2-years/](https://www.cnet.com/news/google-delays-chromes-cookie-blocking-privacy-plan-by-nearly-2-years/)

Google delayed this cookie phasing out until 2023 so the show goes on (Leo trading gif).

**But cookies ARE eventually going away, right?**

The adtech industry is addressing this with the use of identifiers, typically in the form of hashed email addresses or phone numbers that are collected upfront from the end users. Pubmatic has been working vigorously on getting these identifiers put in place through the use of their identity hub product, which is identifier agnostic. There is a lot of speculation surrounding which of these identifiers will end up winning, but since Pubmatic can integrate with any of them, they don’t much care which one wins out in the end. Pubmatic’s management will need to keep a close eye on the privacy developments as they move forward, because the sunset of the third party cookie won’t be the only problem. That said, the adtech industry is notoriously finicky, and Pubmatic has been able to keep up with the times. Management has repeatedly said that they take a long term approach toward their investments, and I expect them to continue to be able to deliver value to publishers and agencies as these investments like Identity Hub pay out. While the privacy wave is a headwind, Pubmatic has been working on addressing it for years now. In aggregate, Pubmatic has a lot more going for it than against it. Next stop… financials.

**Financials.**

*Revenue acceleration* (% are YoY growth rates - from right to left) :

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xatm11bo4l971.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=7309e0ed0a96f48232d5cdf267a3105088e86241

I’ve seen this sort of thing in the past (Etsy, Livongo, The Trade Desk for example) where a company finds its stride. This revenue growth is twice that of the larger industry, so we can assume that Pubmatic has indeed found its stride and is gaining market share. Management has echoed this sentiment.

One important risk to note is that Verizon Media accounts for 20% of their total revenue (taken from their first quarter prepared remarks):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ykm8t4at4l971.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=08551f2ffad273a1601db701fe558a671e050064

It’s good that this percentage has been coming down as they gain market share, but we’ll want to keep an eye on that over time to make sure it continues to trend in the right direction. Also the partnership is growing over time - this is an example of SSP consolidation.

*Gross Profit:*

Pubmatic operates with a high gross margin, as you would expect from a cloud-based software company. Their gross profit has also been trending upwards, so they are gaining more efficiency as they develop. Their long term gross margin target is 70%, which has already been achieved.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dc70fn7s4l971.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83f35e2160b8e1fe72a6a7265dddf7c7c16258bb

*Net Income:*

What’s more, their 2020 net profit fell in line with a highly efficient cloud computing company.

Wall Street analysts aren’t predicting their profitability properly. If we assume a 20% net margin on $200 million in revenue for 2021, earnings per share is going to be 81 cents based on 49 million outstanding. Current estimates are only showing a high estimate of 38 cents per share, much lower than what should be achievable for Pubmatic. They’ve already handily beat earnings for Q1 so they are well on their way toward the \~80 cents figure. If they can hit these numbers, **their PEG stands at .63** at the time of writing.

&#x200B;

*Financial summary:*

Pubmatic is a highly profitable company, in a growth industry, that is stealing market share, and has **no debt**. Wall Street is underestimating them, while trading at a lower valuation than competitors ([https://twitter.com/HsSajwani/status/1403342066445283330/photo/1](https://twitter.com/HsSajwani/status/1403342066445283330/photo/1)).

**In closing**

We don’t know why anyone would be short this company. Maybe there is something under the hood that we are not privy to, but we only know what’s publicly available, and everything looks really clean. I suspect shorts are closing - there’s no reason not to. But the beauty of this potential play is you can attack this from multiple angles. Want to play the short squeeze? Go ahead - it’s a possibility. Want to play the value investor? That works too - Pubmatic is undervalued compared to its peers. How about growth? The digital advertising industry is accelerating, and PUBM is still trading at levels below its valuation.  How about a market mechanics liquidity play (see the bonus section)? Want to play the chart? Easy reversal pattern and ride that trend with the accompanying volume.

Bottom line is, most trading opportunities offer one or two avenues for profitability - PUBM has lots of different pathways for success - pick a path that suits your risk tolerance and hope the market doesn’t shit itself.

A wise trader once told me,

“You can either trade for justice, or for profit, but not both”.

Pubmatic may just offer the rare opportunity to trade for both.

**The plan**

Shares and the limited calls are what’s recommended for now. As some of you may have noticed, PUBM did not have an options chain up until 6/25. Some limited strike prices have been added, but still not enough. Pound ‘em and make our friendly brokerages add more. PUBM managed to get to $77 without the aid of options leverage so I see no reason why a revisit of that price is unattainable by summer’s end with the company and industry tailwinds. Considering that any case for shorting PUBM has been removed, it appears a new trend is starting. Where things may get a little spicy is in the bonus section - and it is in regards to the restricted liquidity.

**Bonus section - “if it ain’t tight, it ain’t right”**

The liquidity for PUBM is very, very tight. If you’ve been watching the intraday movements at all, you’ll notice a barren orderbook, with share bid/ask spreads routinely above $.50, and sometimes even in the dollar range. Exacerbating the already restricted float is the high institutional ownership - which currently sits at 74%. With most of the shares sitting in the coffers of big players, there aren’t many shares exchanging hands on a day-to-day basis - which makes for wild price swings.  What makes this interesting is that as mentioned in the paragraph above - options were just introduced as of 2 weeks ago. This is very unusual for a $1.5B market cap company that has been traded for over 6 months. Only minimal strike prices and dates have been added thus far, with more additions anticipated. The more strikes that get added, and the more OTM call bombs that people lob PUBM’s way, the more interesting and volatile things can get. I say again, PUBM accelerated into the 70’s after IPO, without the aid of options dynamite. With the company and industry headwinds dulled for now, sprinkle in the FD leverage and anyone short should probably pack up their bag, cash in their tickets, and GTFO.

Trade responsibly and good luck!

# About SHEN

[SHEN](https://www.google.com/search?q=shen+stock&rlz=1C1GIVA_enDK879DK879&oq=shen+stock&aqs=chrome.0.35i19i39j69i57j69i60l3.1018j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), or Shenandoah Telecommunications Company is telecommunication company providing various broadband, wifi, fiber optic services. Totalling 1139\~ employees and being in business since 1902, you can see that we are talking about a company that has been around for some time, managed to adapt and be a relative success in oversaturated market.

SHEN has few major streams of revenue:

* Access, Local, and Fiber Lease
* Cable Service
* Wireless
* External revenues and investments

I won't go deep into the all of these streams, briefly what you need to know is that the Company has sold their wireless asset sale to T-Mobile US and is focusing more on their broadband infrastructure, further expanding their main source of revenue.

# Fundamentals

&#x200B;

Remember reading [Intelligent Investor](https://www.google.com/search?q=intelligent+investor&rlz=1C1GIVA_enDK879DK879&oq=intelligent+investor&aqs=chrome..69i57j46j0j0i395l4j69i65.1819j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) or listening to any financial legend talking about P/E ratios, EPS, ROE and bunch of other things that you barely understood even though they seemed important ?

In the times when everything is priced in several years ahead, it's really hard to find a company with solid fundamentals, that is still going under the radar.

* Shares outstanding - 49.94 mil
* Market Cap - 2.84 B
* P/E - 17.24
* EPS - 3.30$
* Divi yield - 0.60%
* Avg. volume - 187K
* ROE - 29%

For a company in oversaturated market such as Telecommunications and controlled by giants such as T-Mobile, Verizon, Viacom, to keep such a great fundamentals is nothing but amazing. How did they achieve it ? Simple, while everyone was trying to dominate big cities and get the main piece of cake, SHEN was focusing on expanding their influence in the rural areas. Yes, internet, exists, outside of the metropolis and even the folk in the country side want to be online so they can eat some popcorn watching you lose your life savings on AMC puts.

Let's sum up why these fundamentals are a good sign of a healthy company. Anything with P/E under 20 is almost a unicorn nowadays, everything is being priced in several years ahead and on potential that might not be there yet, while SHEN goes under the radar this entire time.

In Short, SHEN does better in fundamentals than most of the Industry respective to the company size.

What this all mean ? In the most simplistic way, with 52 Week 38.77-57.65 you can be certain that the company is not going away anytime soon, they have been around for more than 100 years, they are slowly expanding, sure it's not Google, it's not T-Mobile, but they are keeping it lowkey in the rural areas where there is still plenty of room to expand, opposite to the big cities where you have to rival the giant companies.

The company is beating expectations on quarterly basis

https://preview.redd.it/mooxgloo7g971.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=02ee797165edab7b125aaaf7b3b7fb1717312ed2

Seeing a lot of green, that's what I like.

Regarding the potential market cap and share price targets. I believe the company just solely based on their fundamentals and stable revenue/earnings streams, could be worth much more. However, the average volume on the stock is barely 187K therefore it's been going under the radar for some time.

**Why there seem to be no interest in the stock?**

Even though it's only a speculation, we are living in the time where everybody wants to get rich quickly on the most notorious stocks or invest in the to known giants that took control over their respective industries. If you want something a growth stock, you can always just buy some giant company in the sector or just buy some index fund.

That could be one of the reasons why it's hard to notice a company that had been around for a long time, is growing in the rural areas, expanding, closing deals and makes sure there is a stable income/revenue stream. However, that does not change the fact that the company has much more potential and could be undervalued.

# FREE TENDIES (SPECIAL DIVIDEND) - 18.75$ / share

Now to the actual play. To be honest, I too haven't known about SHEN since this announcement, I had couple of dividend paying stocks, but this opportunity was too good to ignore.

SHEN is focusing more and more on their main revenue stream - broadband and decided to sell of their Wireless assets and operations to T-Mobile in an [insane sale](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shenandoah-telecom-declares-special-dividend-122122682.html). The sale totaled 1.94 billion dollars which at the time was almost the amount similar to the company's market cap.

SHEN is giving away 936.6mil of this sale back to the shareholders. ,making it 18.75$ per share, which is insane and will be payed out on August 2nd if you are a shareholder as of recorded date July 13th !

The rest of the proceeds they used to cover all of the debt and are expected more than 19.6mil to be reinvested back to the stock, further pumping the price up.

Why is it such a big deal ? If you didn't just skim through the fundamentals, you would have found out that the company's fair value is around 56$/share. What is it trading as of this moment ? 56.81$ so even despite the news of crazy special dividend, we are trading around the fair value of the company !

**But but but, the share price will always rebalance itself after the payout date.**

Yes and no, in some cases it doesn't have to, but if you enter anywhere under the 60$ in order for you to lose money on this play, the stock would have dump below their 52 week low. This is basically free guaranteed gain. You don't have speculate if Richard Branson reaches the Space or if Elon finally delivers on the self driving system. This is almost literally free win, or as it is common to say, it can't go tits up.

Just the fact that 19.6 mil is expected to be reinvested back. That's 345k shares bought at the current price, almost twice as much as your average daily volume.  So even if the stock dumped right after the Dividend payout, you have guaranteed stock buybacks happening, all while the fundamentals and future outlook for the company is still holding strong.

**Yes, yes but it's a dividend stock and I don't know a lot about them.**

One of the best metrics for the divi stocks is to see if the company keeps increasing the divi

# Final Thoughts

Special dividends does not occur that often, they are here and there and can cause massive spike in the share price in the short amount of time while. Especially if the pay out is literally almost 1/3 of the entire market cap.

I believe that any entry below 60$ - 65$ / share is still amazing because in order for this to go ""tits up"", the stock would not only have to drop below it's 52 Week low (38.77), but also stay there, all in while being fairly valued at 56

Moreover, selling a big portion of their assets to T-Mobile could make the company an acquisition target. Since they are popular in rural parts of the country, acquisition of SHEN could be an easy entry for any of the telecom giants to enter rural areas. Which in turn could further skyrocket the price, but that's purely a speculation.

I am planning on holding after the special dividend pay out with selling a small portion of the position on the dividend payout and holding rest for the longer term.

I would like to hear any opinions on this play, any bull/bear case is very welcome. Any criticism is welcome, let me know what you think !

# TL;DR

Company paying out insane special dividend 18.75$/share on August 2nd if you hold shares before July 13th, while maintaining solid fundamentals.

**Position**598 shares at 56.96 avg  


# UPDATE 1

Due to special dividend being greater than 25% of comapany's value. You would need to hold through the ex-dividend date in order to receive the dividend. Therefore you need to hold shares from 9.7.2021 through 3.8.2021 in order to receive the $18.75 special dividend.   


There is a 2 day settlement period for transactions. Therefore your shares have to be settled in by this Friday (9.7.) the latest in order to receive the special dividend   


# UPDATE 2 - THE PLAY - THE TENDIES - THE FREE MONEY 

 Givens:   
\- SHEN share price $60 (right now)   
\- record date 7/13   
\- payable date 8/2   
\- ex-dividend date 8/3    


Since the market takes 2 days to settle. The shares need to be purchased by Friday, July 9th to be on record with the company. Due to the circumstances of this special dividend, in order to receive payment, you need to hold through the ex-dividend date which means tying up funds for a little over 3 weeks.    


# Play: 

Purchase shares in multiples of 100, and buy an equal amount of puts with a $55 strike price expiring on 8/20. These currently trade for approximately $2/contract ($200 is the full value of contract). If purchased correctly your maximum downside potential is $7/share, even if the stock price falls below $53 after the ex-dividend date. However, here’s the kicker. You are entitled to the full $18.75 special dividend because you held shares during the appropriate time frame. Therefore you are guaranteed to net approximately $11.75/share which is a return of 20% with little to no risk over the course of 3 weeks.

The Kaseya ransomware attack this weekend affected 17 countries and 200 businesses. Cyberattacks are growing more and more frequent. Surely you've seen the news reports. Cyberattacks are also growing more and more sophisticated, so much so that they can even infiltrate American government agencies. The $750B the Pentagon gets every year wasn't enough to prevent that.

The consequences include breaches of sensitive user data and trade secrets, operational shut downs, and millions lost to paying ransoms. So, clearly, preventing these attacks is in the best interest of everyone from CEOs to Presidents to Winnie the Pooh looking ass dictators. Clearly they need to spend more. Cybersecurity products and services are going from ""nice to have"" to ""gotta get it"" status real fucking quick.

**Business Model**

CrowdStrike is the first of its kind among cybersecurity companies. Incumbents like Palo Alto Networks, Symantec, and even FireEye (FireEye has a lot of respect in the public sector) are all Dotcom era dinosaurs. 

That's because CrowdStrike is a cloud-native SaaS that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to prevent attacks. That enough buzzwords for you? 

Forrester, Gartner, MIT, and Google (an early investor) and many other reputable sources have called CrowdStrike leader in endpoint protection. The cloud-nativity has allowed it to strike partnerships to integrate with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=f4fb055a-5333-4b6e-8d8b-a4143ad7f6c7) and [Google Cloud](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiuodTa-srxAhXaAnIKHcIlAPQQFjAAegQIBhAD&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.google.com%2Fpress-releases%2F2021%2F0506%2Fcrowdstrike-google-cloud&amp;usg=AOvVaw0GTGScrx6huf5ULshEqTDA). CrowdStrike can just piggyback off their explosive growth.

**The Bull Case**

According to Grand View Research, the global [cyber security services market](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/cyber-security-service-market?utm_source=prnewswire&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ICT_13-Apr-21&amp;utm_term=cyber-security-service-market&amp;utm_content=rd) size is expected to reach USD 192.70 billion by 2028.

I say the true opportunity is even bigger, because they haven't factored in all out cyberwar between America and the evil trinity of Russia/Iran/China. State-backed cyberattacks are nothing new. Remember North Korea and Sony back when the JamesFranco-SethRogen masterpiece *The Interview* came out?  Or remember when [Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/09/10/cyberattacks-us-elections-trump-biden/) reported that foreign hackers were trying to compromise the 2020 elections? Remember when [China agreed to invest $400B](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/27/world/middleeast/china-iran-deal.html) in Iran's tech sector?

Want more proof? Just look at the [FBI's webpage](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/cyber/news) for cyberattack press releases, there's a fuckton. [Recent research](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252499042/Nation-state-cyber-attacks-double-in-three-years) estimates that state-backed cyberattacks have doubled in the last three years.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Geopolitical tensions will of course continue to heat up. This is because humans are just a bunch of glorified, nuclear-powered apes. We will see stronger legislation mandating that businesses armor the fuck up. We will see outsized and reactionary government spending on cybersecurity. We will also likely see tax-payer funded incentives and subsidies directed toward cybsersecurity firms.

**Management**

When I worked in venture capital for a summer, I realized just how important the management team is to potential investors. And CrowdStrike lives up to all expectations in this area.

George Kurtz, the CEO and Co-Founder of CrowdStrike has a track record of CyberSecurity success. His startup Foundstone was acquired by McAfee in 2004, after which he worked his way up the ranks to become the CTO of McAfee. Clearly, this guy knows what the fuck he's doing. He's no sleazy salesman, he's a princely technocrat.

The Chief Strategy Officer used to be the Executive Assistant Director of the FBI’s Criminal, Cyber, Response and Services Branch. I'd bet my house that this white male has many white male friends in high places. Friends who'd gladly toss him a contract or two.

The rest of the C-Suite are all cyber veterans, even the CFO. It's a who's who of hacker nerds who saw the light.

**Financials**

Who the fuck cares.

Okay fine, I care a little.

Here's an overview of Q1FY22 results: Revenue increased 70% YoY, which reflects 82% growth in subscription customers. They had a net loss of $85M only because they are investing aggressively in growth and R&amp;D. At the end of the day they have $1.7B cash on hand to weather any shitstorms.

The customer relationships are deep and broad. Recurring revenue is over $1B. Furthermore, existing customers end up buying more and more products from CrowdStrike as time goes on. 64% of customers have now adopted four or more CrowdStrike products into their subscription. And it's not like companies who need to cut costs are going to get rid of their cybersecurity provider.

**Conclusion**

Why buy a shitass SPAC for upside? $CRWD is a litass business with the world at its feet.

**TLDR:** Lick lick lick my balls

Sources: Most recent 10-Q, company website, Cybersecurity news reports on Financial Times, my friends in tech and the public sector, *Mindfuck* by Christopher Wylie, *1984* by Georgei Orwellovski, *The Communist Manifesto* by Karl Marx, and -- most important of all -- the tingling in my balls

First things first: Desktop Metal is a speculative buy that’s based on a macro industry movement called the Industrial Revolution 4.0. If you’re looking for a stock with *strong earnings, PE ratios, and a history of revenue growth* kindly fuck off on outta here. 

If you’re looking for the **next potential Carnegie Steel**, this is about to blow your mind. 

Desktop Metal is positioned to be a once in a generation type of company. Additive Manufacturing is a major part of Industry 4.0 that will entirely flip manufacturing on its head. Before I dive into Desktop Metal and why we all need to be bullish on this particular company, let’s briefly go back in time and take a quick history detour on how manufacturing got to where it is today and why **additive manufacturing** is the next giant leap forward. This information is paramount to understanding where Desktop Metal is and where they’re going relative to the industry backdrop. I will scatter some colorful and fun photos to help digest the information:

&#x200B;

### There are three major groups of manufacturing:  

* **Subtractive -** Prior  to the industrial revolution, subtractive manufacturing was the primary  way products were produced. Subtractive manufacturing is the process  where parts of a block of material are removed until the desired outcome  is created. Imagine you’re manufacturing something like a high-end  violin. You would start with a block of wood from a spruce tree from the  corner of the Italian Alps in the Fiemme valley and start carving away  at it until you end up with violin-shaped parts. There’s a lot of waste  and it takes a lot of time to carve out. Today, this process has been  fully automated and produces highly refined products that can withstand  long-term and high-stress usage. However, there’s still a lot of waste  and the process takes a set amount of time per unit of output.  
 
* **Forming -** This  is one of the most common processes for mass manufacturing today. A  mold is created of the final product that is looking to be produced and  that mold is filled by injection with the material, which then cools,  hardens, and takes on the form of the mold design. This process is used  for everything from metal products, plastics, glass as well as a variety  of other materials. The major advantage of this process is the ability  to produce thousands of identical parts at a low cost per unit. However,  the downside is that injection molding is costly in terms of the time  and money it takes to develop the mold. Once completed, making any  changes requires an entirely new mold.
* **Additive -**    
Additive  manufacturing means the products are created by adding layer after  layer. There are 7 main types of additive manufacturing, and Desktop  Metal specializes in carbon fiber and metal manufacturing. The main benefits of additive manufacturing are:     

* Speed:  Companies can now build prototypes and innovate faster than ever.  Rather than using traditional means of manufacturing, with 3D printing  companies, they are able to test their ideas in real time and make  changes faster than ever. By doing this, companies can rapidly increase  the speed at which they bring new ideas to market and quickly  validate/invalidate ideas.
* Cost:  Compared with traditional means of manufacturing, the cost of printing  objects is significantly cheaper and more efficient. Layer in the saved  labor costs and the cost of innovating and scaling products can now be  cheaper than ever!
* Quality:  During the manufacturing process, errors can easily be introduced that  get amplified and can lead to catastrophic consequences. With 3D  printing, you remove all of the manor labor and introduce new  efficiencies that make products not only higher quality, but safer too!
* Sustainability:  Similar to the above, traditional manufacturing creates significant  waste which can be improved via 3D printing. With also fewer parts, and  more efficient designs, less energy is used too, creating a more  sustainable, healthier and cheaper product.

### Focusing on Additive Manufacturing:

 The  technology for additive manufacturing started in the 1980’s and was  primarily used for prototyping. As it evolved, 3D printing transitioned  into creating molds and tools for traditional manufacturing. In the last  few decades, additive manufacturing has gone more mainstream to produce end-use parts. 3D printing is an innovative technology that lets you create a physical object from a digital model. All you need to do is make a design, transfer the file to a 3D printer, then bring your object to life. (Let's print a LAMBO!) Once printed, the 3D printer produces layers of material, one  on top of the other. This forms the finished object. So, for example,  instead of manufacturing traditional hardware, 3D printers can recreate  the same finished products by designing it on a computer and just clicking print! Think of it similar to a traditional printer but instead  of 2-dimensional, it is 3-dimensional, and can use other materials (not  just ink - it can use metal, graphite, etc.)!  The industry is expected to grow 11x over the next decade from **$12 billion in 2020 to $146 billion in 2030.**

# History lesson is over... FF to the inception of Desktop Metal

Desktop Metal was founded half a decade ago in Boston. Their initial product was to develop a metal-printing 3D printer that could be  small enough to operate within an office environment. Today, they have  four products in its portfolio: Fiber, Studio System, Shop System and  Production system. The Studio, Shop, and Production products support  both the printing of both metals as well as fiber composites such as  Carbon Fiber. DM’s flagship product is their Production  system, built from the ground up to be the fastest 3D production printer  in the industry at 100x the speed of laser based systems while keeping a  consistent quality. They’ve pioneered a precise and rapid process to  accomplish this speed through the following: 

  
**DM’s  Production system has developed a more efficient process for the powder processing unit.** The unit’s job is to deliver consistent metal powder  across the printer and other systems do this by starting with a pile of  material and then spreading it out across the print bed. DM meters out a constant rate of spread that’s dispensed and then compacted to produce the final print layer.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8obzt2v968971.png?width=2794&format=png&auto=webp&s=b668e1271234befa5865503ca5daf8d13852de1f

Once  the powder is placed on the print bed, an anti-ballistic system to  control powder as a binder is sprayed on top to prevent the powder from  dirtying the print heads. This is where the geometry of each layer is  created and it’s repeated layer by layer. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gximh7cc68971.png?width=731&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa767476d04db3c2be2d91a1608ab5da9c1a1c59

This process is made more efficient by developing an entire box full  of parts at the same time and it’s capable of supporting multiple  stacks of parts. The next step is called cross linking. The build box is put into an oven to activate the binder and creates the parts. At this stage, the  parts are still in powdered metal form, but are strong enough to handle  and move to the next stage called depowdering and centering. This is  where the parts are put into an industrial oven and the powdered metal  is heated until it forms a solid piece of metal in the shape of the  final product itself.

&#x200B;

  


https://preview.redd.it/lglm3mve68971.png?width=2792&format=png&auto=webp&s=18cc0c6bf92c2f2c836134cc7782c068cf592c6a

Speed is only half the battle, consistency is the other half. DM’s  prints with the most advanced industrial print heads available on the  market at 1200 DPI and has a proprietary camera system that images every  layer of every bed with two different angles of light to detect defects. If any problems are encountered, it’s automatically flagged and  the operator is notified.   


Another major advantage of DM  that was incorporated from the ground up is that it uses an open powder  system. What that means is a customer can use their own powders from  traditional supply chains directly with DM’s  production system. This open powder system means customer’s can develop a  process that works for their business and the Production system can be  adapted to fit. To make implementation even easier, DM  produced a smaller R&D machine that uses the exact same software  and steps to help businesses design a process, develop their product,  and be able to quickly transition from R&D to full production.  
The  production system allows customers to do things that just wasn’t  feasible previously. From a time and money perspective, it’s able to be  highly competitive with traditional manufacturing methods, a feat that  has previously not been possible in the additive manufacturing industry  for metals and carbon fiber. This means that all of the benefits of  additive manufacturing, the designs that are possible, as well as rapid  iterations on the production are all now possible with DM’s Production system.  
A  major advantage for businesses is additive manufacturing’s capability  to combine the number of parts needed to develop a single component. **An example of this is back in 2016, Airbus was able to produce it’s fuel  nozzles for it’s engines using additive manufacturing and reduce the  number of parts from 20 to 1.** This reduced the components weight by 25%  (incredibly important for the airline industry) and reduced the assembly  time.  

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hiyv22vt68971.png?width=1243&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cd2a234133546d694f59494a2ecb4031f9c7a71

On top of their hardware, Desktop Metal has pioneered an  industry-leading AI-driven software for designing and modeling. This complementary SaaS product, along with secondary products like their  printing cartridges, Desktop Metal’s business model positions them well  to bring customers in and have a consistent revenue stream for years to  come.            

Today, Desktop Metal is one of the fastest growing unicorns in US  history. Their 2020 revenue of 16.5 million USD is tiny compared to  their valuation, but their growth has been tremendous. They only began  shipping their Shop System and Production System in Q4 of 2020. Q3 of  2020 was reported at $2.5 million and rose to $8.4 million in Q4, a 236%  increase. The company’s aggressive expansion strategy positions it well  to take advantage of the growth opportunities that lie ahead. It’s  projected to be around $1 billion in revenue by 2025, a 87% CAGR. As of  now, the company has 90+ production systems on reservation, which means that they’re sold out until the first half of 2024!   

 

https://preview.redd.it/bnuxnhrw68971.png?width=1433&format=png&auto=webp&s=740c6ac4379b9af86a3715e727a50da6fb03d6a2

Compared to their peers in the space, Desktop Metal as a stock can be  considered relatively cheap and underpriced. With no outstanding debt  and $600M+ on it’s balance sheet, there’s a wide cushion for the  business to operate over the next few years to accelerate its growth and  capture market share. This large balance sheet, something unheard of  for a company of their size, gives them an unfair competitive advantage  in the industry. This is just another one of many reasons Desktop Metal  is poised to outperform over the long term. 

On top of their existing suite of products, Desktop Metal has an  aggressive strategy for mergers and acquisitions. They’ve already  identified $2 billion of revenue across 60+ potential targets, with 10  of them in contact and under analysis.  

&#x200B;

**Who else has skin in the game?**  
Over the last few years, institutional money has been rapidly coming into  Desktop Metal with over 2/3rd of the institutional investors increasing  their positions. Many of the big players are seeing the same trends and  have begun taking a position within companies in the 3D printing space.  Desktop Metal happens to be well positioned and from our analysis,  underpriced for the time being. Some of the biggest and most innovative  investors such as Aunt Cathie Woods at Ark Invest, Papa Chamath, and Google Ventures are currently holding positions within Desktop Metal.         



**KEY TAKEAWAYS**

* Desktop Metal’s high quality products are positioned to ride the rising wave of the fourth industrial revolution!
* Industry leading technology platform.
* Massive and rapidly growing addressable market.
* DM’s production system provides better value for certain applications, which opens up multiple industries to the benefits of additive manufacturing at a comparable cost and time efficiency.

**Desktop Metal is a stock that has the potential to 10x or more in the next few years. It has an incredibly talented team helming the ship, a  backlog of sales for the next 3 years, an aggressive M&A plan in place to continue to fuel its growth, and thus is well positioned in the  market to capture the industrial revolution 4.0 wave.** 

 And not only do they have the opportunity to execute, they're proving they can. Let's take a look at the numbers:                  


* 2025 expected revenue $950M (represents over 100% YoY revenue growth relative to where they are today)
* 2025 expected EBITDA is $260M (representing net margins of 27%)

**THIS IS UNHEARD OF FOR TRADITIONAL MANUFACTURING!** Looking  across their ""competition"" we all can see margins in the single digits and YoY  growth in the single digits too. What this tells me is that DM  is in a unique position to take significant market share from legacy  players. When we see dynamic shifts like this unfolding, this becomes  massive opportunities for us to partake in! While there are obvious  risks (new entrants, anti-competitive practices, new laws, etc.) I am going **long and hard** with Desktop Metal.

BOX,6,5,2021-07-03 00:15:01,"This will not be a DD because lets be honest even the most intelligent and eloquent DD gets overlooked at times. This is more of a history lesson. 

Box, Inc. has been on slow and steady climb since the beginning of this year. Starting out 2021 just below $18 at 17.81 and since then it has reached highs of $27 as of today. Some of the initial spikes in spring were due to buy-out rumors, but Box squashed those and it declined slightly only to continue to rise on real growth due to the financial moves and acquisitions the company has made this year. 

The historical high for BOX was a handful of years ago when it teased with $29 but that was mostly on a prestigious analyst/VC mentioning them as a stock he liked long term. Then it fizzled down to the teens before hitting a COVID low in March 2020. Since that single digit price of $9 in 3/2020 it has only climbed and has become a serious threat to Amazon and Google for cloud content providers. Box has 67% of Fortune 500 companies as customers, departments of the US government, and multiple sports leagues. 

Like I said, it may not be a quick gainer, but the steady growth of the company is encouraging for future $$$.

Instead of investing in innovation and entrepreneurship, it is researching which stocks have heavy short interest and creating a movement to exploit this in order to create explosive growth.

The technique is clear and obvious.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

Now onto the classic part of this post:

Every day I check a list of equities.  I don't pretend to think this is a great list or even a good list but it's my list hah

I first look at Tesla (I still think it is over valued but I like to see how it tracks).

I then look at Ride, NKLA, QS.  NKLA in my opinion being the trash of trash and a great example of how a bull market can keep anything afloat Lol

Then I go to Pltr, Peloton, Bmbl, Door Dash, Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Snowflake.

Then I go to Nakd, and Fold.

Then I check out some classics like Pfizer, AT&T, Coca-Cola.  I weirdly like to look at Moderna.

Then I check out Endeavour Group Holdings, Coinbase, Thredup, Walkme.

Then I check out Canopy.

Then BB, AMC, GME.

Then SLV, GLD.

Then Trillium, CRISPR.

Then onto the coins.

Then RKT and SPCE.

It is a weird routine I have each and every day almost.

I think it provides a good exposure to a various class of equities sometimes by groups, sometimes by weird segments of the investing sphere.  

I think everything is insanely priced and way to high hah but we are in the everything bubble so that is what it is.

All in all the classic narrative is that it provides me a good understanding of what is happening in the various big blocks of the investing world.  Also through google finance I get some good recommends on companies that I don't know about that maybe I will like based on that list and then I expand it sometimes.

Companies like CRISPR being the things I want to invest in for a better world.  Despite that I am not touching any of this shit with a 10 foot poll based on the pricing and our current market.

What equities would you add to look at and why.

I'd love to know what your lists are and the reasoning you like to track those particular sets of equities and such. :)

Let the shit throwing begin as I know many of you identify as apes but I still like to identify as the evolution known as human."

obawi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/obawi4/forget_the_trade_desk_buy_pubmatic/,"Forget The Trade Desk, Buy PubMatic",31,15,2021-07-01 09:05:44,"PubMatic is a small-cap growth stock in the quite quickly growing adtech space, which may be facing further tailwinds from the reopening and trends such as CTV.

Its valuation is lower than others in this space such as market darling The Trade Desk, while also growing faster.

Large growth prospects and a reasonable valuation, combined with a low absolute market cap, provide a recipe for a successful investment.

Buy potential multi-baggers while they’re small.



Investment Thesis

One of the core tenets of growth investing is a company’s relatively small market cap in light of a potentially large long-term opportunity. A small company with a differentiated technology or product in a large market could deliver supercharged returns if it keeps growing.
This may exactly be the case with PubMatic (PUBM). The company operates an adtech platform, has a reasonable valuation, is growing fast, and has the relatively small market cap that growth investors would look for.
I would contrast this stock with The Trade Desk (TTD). While they’re not exactly competitors, both operate in the adtech space. However, The Trade Desk has the opposite characteristics: while the company also reports respectable growth, it already has a much larger market cap and a high P/S valuation.
Put differently, though, the investment thesis is that potentially PubMatic could replicate on the sell-side of this market what The Trade Desk has accomplished (both as a business and as double digit-bagger on the stock market) on the buy-side.

Company overview

As indicated, PubMatic operates in the adtech space. The company provides a sell-side cloud infrastructure platform purpose-built for digital, real-time programmatic advertising. As such, the company should benefit from general ad spend growth as well as some of the higher-growth areas in this space such as programmatic CTV (connected TV). PubMatic also expects some acceleration tailwinds from the reopening.
In succinct terms:

PubMatic has created a sell-side ad tech platform that leverages data-driven algorithms and tools to help content publishers and app developers maximize the value of their ad inventory.

The reasoning behind such an infrastructure-driven approach is that advertising is inherently data-intensive, and also real-time. Hence, PubMatic can deliver increased value (such as higher revenue for publishers and higher ROI for buyers), and also innovate faster, by controlling the full stack from hardware to software. This also results in a cost advantage.
The alternative approach is using public cloud infrastructure, which only allows for controlling the software stack.
PubMatic also claims it benefits from consolidation of ad budgets on fewer sell-side platforms, resulting in increased market share. This occurs through Supply Path Optimizations or SPOs. As evidence for this trend, PubMatic disclosed that revenue from those arrangements nearly doubled in Q1.

Lastly, to come back to the term “sell-side”. This can be contrasted to The Trade Desk, which is a demand-side or buy-side platform. In simple terms, the buy-side are those who buy advertising inventory, while the sell-side are those who offer ad space, anywhere on the internet. As such, the thesis really is that PubMatic may become (both as company and as a stock) on the sell-side what The Trade Desk has become on the buy-side.

Q1 results

In Q1, PubMatic reported $43.6M revenue, up 54% YoY. In particular, mobile and omnichannel video grew 83%, and represented 63% of total revenue. CTV grew 55% QoQ. Gross margin also increased from 65% to 72% due to increased utilization. This signals a scalable business.
PubMatic’s accelerated growth over the last year is also evidenced by its increased TTM net retention, which has expanded from 112% to 130%, which is best-in-class for growth companies in general.

Guidance

PubMatic has guided for 33% growth for the year.
While this implies a slowdown, some part of it does seem like sandbagging or conservative guidance: as discussed, the net retention was 130% in Q1, and growth in mobile and video also grew markedly faster than the overall business.

Valuation

PubMatic’s valuation should be considered compelling. At the stock’s current ~$40 price, the forward P/S stands at ~10x, which is over 3x cheaper than The Trade Desk. Obviously, the bullish case would be that given that both operate in the same market, PubMatic could deliver similar growth as the former, which would result in both long-term stock and valuation expansion.
Although PubMatic certainly does not yet have same multi-year track record of elevated revenue growth yet as The Trade Desk, this stark difference in valuation arguably well offsets potential execution risks. At least in Q1, PubMatic was growing faster than The Trade Desk.

Risks

PubMatic’s growth has accelerated since COVID-19, and the company also expects continued tailwinds from the reopening, which should result in increased ad spend. However, a risk would be if growth would slow down to pre-pandemic levels; obviously, the best growth stocks, including The Trade Desk, are able to sustain elevated growth for years.
Another potential risk are some of the recent and ongoing changes in the ad space, including changes in Apple’s (AAPL) policy and the phasing out of third-party cookies. However, PubMatic reports that the majority of its revenue comes from different identifiers than those two. As such, PubMatic actually views this is a competitive advantage, similar to how The Trade Desk has been boasting about how the Open Internet will prevail over the walled gardens. PubMatic is in fact investing in a portfolio of alternative solutions to the third-party cookie, including The Trade Desk’s UID 2.0 as well as Google’s (GOOG) (GOOGL) Privacy Sandbox (which includes the contested FloC).

Note that The Trade Desk and PubMatic are not really competitors but rather partners, as The Trade Desk is a demand side platform. PubMatic says it is integrated with around 100 such platforms.
A last risk I found was that although PubMatic especially touts its infrastructure, the company nevertheless seems to get more mixed reviews (i.e. a lower rating than TTD). This could imply it still has some way to go to truly become best-in-class.

Primer on ads and cookies

This section serves for those who aren’t all too up-to-date on some of the terms used here.
As I would describe it, the core issues stem from privacy concerns regarding (third-party) cookies and tracking. This is leading to the phasing out of those cookies (now planned for 2023 by Chrome). However, this causes issues for the digital advertising market, which relies on targeted ads to increase their efficiency.
As such, alternative, supposedly more privacy-friendly, tracking solutions are being introduced. One of the most well-known is The Trade Desk’s UID 2.0. Google, for its part, is backing on a collection of a few dozen of APIs, which it calls Privacy Sandbox. One of those is the controversial “FloC”, even though it does (more or less) achieve its goal to provide privacy without sacrificing targeting accuracy.
Another point of dichotomy is regarding what some like to call the Open Internet vs. the walled gardens. The latter are the big ad platforms such as Google, Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN).
The gist is that those walled gardens have a privileged position given that they have an enormous amount of first-party data. Hence, they could survive the phasing out of third-party cookies quite unscathed.
Some claim, for example, that it is in Google's interest to phase out those cookies, which could put Google at a competitive advantage as others would lose the ability to serve targeted ads.
However, one might note that this dichotomy isn’t all that clear. For example, both Roku (ROKU) and Unity (U) (and likely plenty others) certainly wouldn’t be considered walled gardens among the likes of Google and Facebook. Nevertheless, both companies have said that given their own first-party data, they deem themselves to be quite unaffected by those changes in the ad landscape.
Lastly, given the observation that there are so many alternative tracking solutions being developed, which may or may not conserve privacy, ultimately there may be relatively little tangible changes in the ad landscape. As such, the bottom line may be that the recent rally by the likes of The Trade Desk (due to Google’s Privacy Sandbox delay) is overblown.

Investor Takeaway

PubMatic offers a compelling proposition, both with its full-stack technology as well as with accelerated business results. In general, the company operates in the growing digital advertising market, and by being at the forefront with its technology and innovation, seems to be well-positioned for market share growth as well.
The company has reported high growth, expanded margins, and a high 130% net retention in Q1. PubMatic is also capitalizing on the latest trends such as CTV, which grew 55% sequentially. While no stocks are risk-free, these are definitely signs that the company is able to capitalize on the growth opportunity in its adtech space.
Just as importantly, compared to other growth stocks I have covered, both the company’s market cap and P/S valuation are rather low for growth stocks. That implies the risk is reduced, while the potential upside could be significant.
Hence, bottom line is that PubMatic does not even have to exactly replicate The Trade Desk’s performance to deliver solid or even significant long-term investor returns. As I said about another small company a while ago, Sumo Logic (SUMO): buy potential multi-baggers while they’re small (and cheap)."

As many of you know due to some hedge fund tom foolery (thanks Bill Hwang) VIAC lost about half of its value. He went out in true WSB fashion, but thanks to him he have some WSB opportunities.

VIAC is an old media company that has lots of appealing properties, and now has recently announced they are focusing on streaming services. In their streaming service portfolio they have Paramount+, Pluto, and Showtime with Paramount+ being their new darling garnering lots of attention.

Now many have pointed out how VIAC has an extremely low P/E, great earnings reports, and more, but repeating that would be a waste of your time and mine. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n3k1gk/god_tier_dd_viac/) post if you want to learn more.

Today I would like to point a few things out that many of us haven't noticed that are food for thought:

1.Paramount+ is doing better than many would have you believe.

https://preview.redd.it/rrfh4lw9ch871.png?width=1974&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe1effae0ad2e94b4fa92682586a6ae01074b692

Now Google Trends is no guarantee for sales, but it is a good indicator of interest. I have heard lots of slander on how Paramount+ has no good shows or how it can't compete with others in the field, but frankly I disagree. Their library is impressive if you dig into it and they are adding thousands of movies as we speak. On top of that, their ad campaigns seem like they are working and streaming has been gaining quarter over quarter for them on lesser streaming services they own like Pluto (seriously who uses Pluto). Paramount+ is gaining steam and that is going to show in the next earnings report.

2. Their Earnings Projections are underestimated

https://preview.redd.it/bl0d0nxuch871.png?width=1660&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b1b08b72987d60dd08a48a04230f24eb6a718b0

The current estimates have VIAC underperforming their last quarter. I believe there is no possible way this is the case. Their steaming revenues have vastly increased and the data coming in about their legacy cable networks indicates better than normal performance. For example, there have been reports that their ad cost per million views being higher than normal and that many of their flagship events have been going gangbusters (just see the BET awards ratings if you don't believe me). All signs are showing big revenue coming in that the analysts aren't factoring in, and I believe the earnings surprise is going to be bigger than last time.

3. The Acquisition Rumors

Out of all the major media companies that could be acquired, VIAC is the most likely to happen soon. There has been a frenzie to consolidate rights in media companies and VIAC is an obvious play for many media distributors. They are relatively cheap unlike other options like ROKU (which has been frequently talked about in acquisition rumors) and so it is very likely VIAC will be picked up in the next 6-12 months in the $70-100 dollar range.

Yes, really. 

Both in terms of production and sales, Tesla needs China. 

But does China need Tesla? With three viable EV startups on the market, the answer is no. 

First off, it is no coincidence that XPeng, Li Auto, and Nio all opened around 2015, when Tesla first started to become profitable. DiDi drove out Uber, Baidu drove out Google, and these EV startups will drive Tesla out of the biggest EV market in the world, because the Chinese government has a history of economic protectionism. They subsidize the fuck out of the industries they want developed, then force out Western companies by any means necessary. 

Look, I’m not saying “don’t invest in Tesla.” I’m saying consider the three EV startups in China, and watch that market very, very fucking closely.

oazs4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oazs4f/why_i_believe_in_amd/,Why I believe in AMD,383,146,2021-06-30 23:33:56,"So I’ve been following AMD since it was a $30 little boy share, and I’ve always believed in it long. Looking at its history, you can see the annual returns over the last five years have been great. But here’s why this particular autist really likes this stock. But first, a bit of backstory about AMD.

###Who is AMD and why do we care?

**Advanced Micro Devices** (AMD) is a computer hardware development and manufacturing company at its core. They design and sell Processors, GPUs, APUs, and the like. For anyone who has been into gaming or building PCs, you’d probably recognize AMD as the “budget build”: the company who’s processors you buy when you don’t want to shell out $900 for a top shelf Intel. They have always been seen as an underdog in Intel’s shadow, with Intel having the superior clock speeds, Hyperthreading tech, and better clout when it comes to contracting.

###Next Gen Consoles

Currently the latest gaming consoles are the PS5 and the Xbox Series X, both being relatively impossible to get your hands on due to the microchip shortage (more on that later). *AMD powers both.*

Let that sink in. AMD has no competition for this generation of video game consoles. Every PS5 and Xbox X that gets built, AMD gets a chunk of that change. This is basically guaranteed profit for the life of the console, historically that’s about 6-7 more years.

###Server Hardware

AMD has been expanding their server hardware lineup, and their biggest competitor Intel has dropped the ball on this one: their new server hardware isn’t rolling out til Q1 2022. Meanwhile, Google is replacing outdated hardware with AMD processors. This is a big step for AMD, because it puts them in the position of no longer being the underdog, and gives them juicy, profitable market share.

###CEO Lisa Su

Lisa Su is an awesome woman. She has a diverse background including Texas Instruments and IBM, and since she took the reigns of AMD in 2014, the stock has soared. She helped diversify their product line success, and saw the immense benefit of getting AMD server chips licensed in China.

###The future of work

Lots of people see the future of work moving towards a larger working from home model (anecdotal). Working from home requires hardware, and people buying hardware prefer to spend less if they can, and this is the hardware AMD specializes in.

###Semiconductor Shortage

The massive demand for semiconductors for everything from cars to laptops to servers has been a drag on literally the entire economy. Auto manufactory lines in Midwest America are at a standstill while car lots are barren of new vehicles because of the world’s “just in time” production model collapsing under increased demand.

I personally believe this shortage is artificially holding down the price of AMD, as big money is slower to invest in a company that could potentially suffer from the shortage. Once things pick back up, there is a lot of potential for accelerated movement upwards as things become available to the public for purchase.

AMD is a preferred client of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), which has invested billions into additional manufacturing capacity.

###Get on the train before it leaves!

Once these processors start shipping out, the profits will roll in and sentiment will return. Boarding this rocket begins now! 🦍 🚀 🌝

oawsxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oawsxf/i_analyzed_last_15_years_of_news_articles_to_see/,I analyzed last 15 years of news articles to see how many times Michael Burry predicted a crash and how many times he turned out to be right! Here are the results.,5482,1229,2021-06-30 20:58:42,"**Preamble:** Michael Burry is definitely a controversial figure. He rose to fame betting against the subprime mortgage market and making a 489% return for his investors between Nov’00 and Jun’08 (SP500 returned just 3% in the same period).

But, I recently observed that in every news article/tweet, he always talks about an impending crash. As recently as last week, he issued another warning stating that there would a “mother of all crashes soon due to the meme-stock and \*\*\*\*\*currency rally that will approach the size of countries”. Basically, what I wanted to analyze was

**Whether Michael Burry always predicts a crash and gets lucky when there is an actual crash or does his prediction actually turns out to be true most of the time?**

**Analysis**

The various news articles spanning over the last 15 years were obtained from Google News \[1\]. I flagged the date of each crash prediction and then analyzed the performance of the market/stock over the

a. Next 1 Month

b. Next 1 Quarter

c. Till Date

I will not be including the subprime mortgage crash prediction in this analysis as we all know how that turned out and how that made him famous. Also, there are no news reports covering Burry before that.

The performance figures are calculated based on the prediction. If Burry specifies a stock, then I am using that particular stock as the benchmark. If its broader prediction relating to the overall market, then the benchmark used is S&P 500.

**Results**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/y2bct7sphe871.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dd6d0b6163ad7ed0bfc917af373ce9f65bce71d)

There was a long gap of 9 years after the 2008 crash where Burry stayed out of the public view and did not make any warnings or predictions about the market.

His first verifiable prediction after the 2008 crisis [came in May 2017](https://www.lombardiletter.com/michael-burry-stock-market-crash/10895/) where he warned that we can expect a global financial meltdown and World War 3. In his exact words

>I didn’t go out looking for this, I just did the math. Every bit of my logic is telling me the global financial system is going to collapse

But it’s been 4 years since the prediction and the market is chugging along just fine. S&P500 has returned a respectable 93% to date and there is [no imminent threat](https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/timeline/) of a World War happening.

Burry’s next prediction was in [Sep 2019](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/the-big-short-s-michael-burry-explains-why-index-funds-are-like-subprime-cdos-1.1310874) where he said that index funds are the next market bubble and are comparable to subprime CDOs. He said that index fund inflows are now distorting prices for stocks and bonds in the same way that CDO purchases did for subprime mortgages more than a decade ago. He said the flows will reverse at some point, and “it will be ugly” when they do.

This prediction also did not pan out as S&P500 has returned 50% to date over the last two years and the only crash that occurred during this period was the Covid-19 flash crash from which the market made a sudden recovery.

Burry’s next target was on Tesla where he said that Tesla’s stock price is [ridiculous](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/big-short-investor-michael-burry-reveals-hes-short-tesla-tells-elon-musk-to-issue-more-stock-at-its-ridiculous-price/articleshow/79538731.cms) and that it would [collapse](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/big-short-investor-michael-burry-predicts-tesla-stock-will-collapse-like-the-housing-bubble-enjoy-it-while-it-lasts/articleshow/80171258.cms) like the housing stock bubble. I have kept both the articles there which had only one month difference as we don’t know exactly when he shorted the stock. The returns would be substantially different if he did it in Dec’20 when compared to Jan’21 as Tesla had a phenomenal run in December.

He [reiterated](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/big-short-investor-michael-burry-warns-the-stock-market-is-dancing-on-a-knifes-edge-and-fears-hes-being-ignored-again/articleshow/81154288.cms) again on Feb’21 that the market is dancing on a knife’s edge and he is being ignored again. He felt the boom in day traders due to the meme stock mania and the increasing cash flow to the index trackers would cause a massive bubble. This prediction also hasn’t turned out to be right as the market has returned 11% to date over the last 4 months.

Burry’s only prediction that we can say confidently was right after the 2008 mortgage crisis is that he called [\*\*\*coin a speculative bubble](https://moguldom.com/340499/michael-burry-who-predicted-2008-mortgage-crash-says-bitcoin-is-a-speculative-bubble-sends-prices-lower/) in March’21. \*\*\*coin has since dropped 28% in around 3 months. Even in this case, we don’t have enough data to showcase how this prediction would turn out over the next one/two years.  

Burry was most active in 2021 making the most number of predictions with the latest in Jun’21 stating that we are currently in the [greatest speculative bubble of all time](https://moguldom.com/358632/investor-michael-burry-who-predicted-2008-subprime-mortgage-crisis-says-this-is-greatest-speculative-bubble-of-all-time-in-all-things/). Only time will tell how this one will turn out!

**Conclusion**

I have immense respect for Michael Burry and his skills. He was a doctor and worked as a Stanford Hospital neurology resident and then left to start his own hedge fund that became [extremely successful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry). But, as you can see from the above analysis, he is more often wrong than right with his predictions \[2\].

But, the stock market rewards predictions disproportionately \[3\]. Out of the 100 predictions you make, even if you get 99 wrong but get one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still be extremely high.

The key point here is that if you believe in Michael Burry, you will have to follow all of his recommendations \[4\] and not pick and choose what you feel comfortable with as most of the returns would be from an extremely unlikely scenario.

A few weeks ago I began posting on AMD. At the time, the stock was trading in the mid-70's.

Today, as expected, we crossed $90 price... but our trip is just getting **STARTED**!

The deal with TESLA was announced, as well as the next AMAZING technologies in Computex, including the stacked cache for Zen3, Fidelity FX Super Resolution, the 6900 XTX Liquid Cooled, etc.

There's a very simple reason why AMD will go past the MOON and MARS: **ENTERTAINMENT**

The world revolves around entertainment and in this new era, this activity is mandatory to deal with Covid-19, the lack of international travel, work from home, etc.

TESLA adopting AMD for its new Model X and S is HUGE. It will take a Navi23 and an APU (two chips) per car, likely becoming an optional for all other vehicles in the future. More automobile brands will follow, as TESLA is leading the way in the industry.

&#x200B;

[TESLA selected AMD chips for its upcoming vehicles](https://preview.redd.it/aekg7gm3u8871.jpg?width=2243&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c178f47df42b4159f92d1248ac9618a3f8440643)

With autonomous driving, gaming in a long trip will be mandatory. But even without it, the rest of the passengers can game, either with their fellow companions or online, from their car.

So, yes, the current automotive revolution will have AMD as a main supplier.

Then you have consumer processing, which includes CPU's and GPU's, where AMD is dominating (mostly on the former). The Zen3 architecture is a MONSTER. Intel just cannot compete. And with the stacked cache providing up to 15% more gaming performance, that lead will continue on AMD's side.

On GPU's, AMD's Navi31 is expected to be MCM (multi-chip module), aiming to repeat AMD's success with Intel, but now against NVIDIA. ""Chiplets"" allow for economies of scale to thrive. More silicon, with less defects, better binning, cheaper... it is an AMAZING IDEA. Just add cache and the latency problem can be mitigated.

On console gaming, AMD is the undisputed KING. They're in the PS4, PS4 Pro, PS5, Xbox model and series X/S. Also in the Aya Neo and expected in Valve's next handheld, which will be a MONSTER.

On Datacenter, AMD is groundbreaking. Epyc and the new offerings from **GOOGLE** for virtual machines is an INCREDIBLE deal. **AMAZON, TENCENT, ALIBABA, AZURE** (Microsoft), they are all buying chips from AMD. More CORES means MORE power processing, lower energy, lower licensing costs and certainly better SECURITY (as INTEL has been plagued by Spectre & Meltdown issues). AMD is now expected to go from 64 cores in EPYC to 96... and also 128. That's just ludicrous, 128 CORES and 256 threads. And X86 clients are THRILLED to buy more power in a more efficient chip.

[Google wants AMD Milan Epyc Chips for its Datacenter](https://preview.redd.it/36x8ygt6u8871.jpg?width=2284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d96e3eab884218203d9fbe906b9ba3474902e13)

Deals with the US Department of Energy (El Capitan), Singapore and Germany, all for public datacenters worth millions of dollars. That's just the tip of the iceberg, as private players are taking note of EPYC.

Last, **but certainly NOT least: MOBILE**

AMD will power Samsung's S22 flagship phone. Its GPU is expected to break records, as engineering samples already have it beating MALI and Apple's options, by **double digits**.

**Samsung** is delighted and **Google** also wants AMD chips for its phones.

&#x200B;

[Samsung wants AMD's chips for its flagship GALAXY S22](https://preview.redd.it/xu07hgobu8871.jpg?width=1919&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dfea79ba818835fb83a9cb5f51d5189cf2d034e0)

But enough on the PRODUCTS. What about the fundamentals?

Revenue growth is expected at 50% by the end of 2021. How many companies are growing by 50%?

And that guidance was provided with the Q1 results in April, which were exceeding expectations. AMD raised the guidance from 37% to 50%... and will certainly BEAT IT.

AMD is NOW a profitable company... and it literally CANNOT keep its products on shelves, as its clients are buying ALL THEIR CHIPS.

AMD's valuation is $110 billion, while NVIDIA (w/slightly more revenue & profit) is $500 billion.

How is NVIDIA 5 times the value of AMD???... Just because of a stock split?

It is currently trading at 38 times earnings, which if they grow by 50% in 6 months, will certainly drop.

So yeah, the stock is currently above $90 and aiming to reach its all-time high of $99 which was reached a few months ago, in January.

Analyst consensus of the stock is currently $106.54 ([https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast)) which is roughly an 18% upside, taking it to a mere $ 132 billion market cap.

If you ask me, AMD should be **at least HALF** of NVIDIA's $500 billion market cap.

Lastly, the Xilinx acquisition, which will aim to create synergies among functions (e.g. HR, Procurement, Engineering, etc.). It will also increase AMD's share of the silicon purchasing world, as TSMC will have AMD as its #2 client, only second to Apple.

Xilinx cancelled its dividends as its shareholders approved the merger with AMD.

AMD may choose to bring dividends back after the merger... yet in the meantime, they announced a $4 Billion share buyback program. They know their stock is trading **CHEAP**.

# On the positions (full disclosure): YES, I hold AMD stock.

I bought $25K back in 2013, when the stock was at $2.46 (on January 18th, 2013), a bit over 10150 stocks. I saw the stock go up to $20 and sold half of it in 2018. Later, I bought back a bit (crazy ape mentality).

Today, I stand with 7500 stocks. Certainly worth a couple of Lambo's, yet I drive a Nissan.

If you ask me, my next car should be a TESLA... with AMD chips (yet I'm not selling AMD).

WE ALREADY PASSED THE MOON, we will pass **MARS** (Tesla) and also our **Galaxy** (Samsung).

# Join me, together we will conquer the Universe!!!

Pack your bananas.... we're in for a journey!"

This stock isn't about that shit, it's about YOLOing on some dope random company I heard about that has been cranking out massive gains to the tune of +40% over the last 3 months and no sign of slowing down.

I'm talkin about VRT, the best value stock on the goddamn market right now. Nobody is trading this shit, it regularly has less than a million in volume a day. ""What the fuck is Vertiv holdings?"" I see you wondering. Well, they're basically the wal-mart of data centers. they supply data centers with everything they need. Server racks, power, air con, i dunno, other shit that data centers need who gives a fuck, they're data centers. They make you get your porn of your wife fucking her boyfriend and his 8 best friends faster.

There's about 3 million data centers in the US, and they upgrade their equipment every 3-5 years. Vertiv works with all of them that aren't shit. Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, all work with Vertiv to supply infrastructure to their farms.

Just look at this 3 month graph and 1 year graph and tell me this shit isn't on a straight shot to the moon. [3 months](https://gyazo.com/bd0047e2dfa283f6c93166c2155e5b72)

At the end of the day, This is a random ass company I found that is in a space that's going to continue to explode with literally trillions of dollars invested in the coming decades, and they're the biggest player in the space. Their current market cap is still under $10B. Insane.

Now obviously my DD blows because i'm not retarded so I didn't waste my time going to business school and i'm not an autist so I have no idea how to look at shit beyond charts and knowing that a supply company in a trillion dollar industry should probably be worth more than 10 billion. I'm just here to let you guys know VRT is the fucking tits, and if y'all wanna look into why more that would be all the better. Get on board and I'll see everyone at the Lambo convention.

I found this shit and instantly Yolo'd my entire portfolio into it, position is 120 $30c 9/17 and 2500 shares."

# Why is TTCF about to devour the food industry?

Even if I, and probably tons of you, are beef eaters rather than grass enjoyers, it's estimated that a 100m degenerated in the US right now that are interested in plant-based foods, but there hasn't been enough innovation within their sector to really fulfill their needs. The food industry is dominated by the same companies since the 1950s. However, we've seen starting to disrupt this sector. We want to invest in this innovation, in a way that gives a high probability of great returns. Here comes the most undervalued company in this sector, TTCF and likely in the whole market.

By disrupting the market, TTCF is not competing with anyone right now, they are creating their own market. They are not competing in the plant-based meat category, they are creating a whole array of plant-based foods, but most importantly, products that customers actually like. This is pioneering at its best. I can already hear you saying: oK bUt wHaT aBoUt BYND? Beyond Meat only produces plant-based meat. TTCF has a whole range of plant-based MEALS, like a ratatouille that tastes better than Rémi's and ready in minutes, cauliflower mac & cheese, etc. They have products for everyone. Your average fitness girl that eats her Açai Bowl like a hipster, your risotto for your date night, a pizza for a Football Match. You get the idea.

These guys source all their vegetables from their fields in fucking Italy to get you the best possible Pomodoro on the whole damn planet.

I like the product but who gives a shit, here are reviews from a vast array of different people so you can make your mind on what most folks think about their products

&#x200B;

If you don't trust the reviews and think it's all the same person, then look at this.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pmvnpjgcm7871.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=15be2b9f4dc5348ba205544a7e274c93fe1f5a56

&#x200B;

The sell-through is ridiculous, I have more pictures of empty shelves than photos with my parents. The lucky few who discovered TTCF LOVE the product, there's no doubt about that, but most folks haven't heard of TTCF yet. TTCF hasn't even spent a dime on marketing yet. They've only started their first advertising campaign this quarter!

We know from Walmart data, that people who have tried the product are coming back without any ads. I can guarantee you that this is pretty rare in the food industry. We are witnessing a beast in the making. They are even expanding in the Mexican food industry. Look at the reviews by yourself, they are going to eat Chipotle alive ($42 bn food giant) without a sweat.

Now that they will start marketing, this is going to supercharge sales. Their recent acquisition will allow them to ramp up production and meet this demand.

**TTCF Expansion**

The growth they have is just insane and historical in this industry. They achieved these results without spending a dime in marketing.

https://preview.redd.it/9a4wi21fm7871.png?width=2339&format=png&auto=webp&s=778a1f7d5d7f0a0c7354702400de3636b73e62b0

They've been conservative on their targets and have always beaten their revenue expectation.

&#x200B;

They are vertically integrated. For the toddlers in the back that have no idea what I'm talking about, it means they own the whole damn supply chain. From the vegetables all the way to the final product. They are constantly increasing capacity to be able to meet demand. This enables TTCF to munch on inflation, as they don't have suppliers.

Essentially, this will guarantee rock-solid margins once they slow down their growth and focus on profitability. This also means they'll be able to diversify out of frozen food. TTCF is super cash-rich with not debt! Other acquisitions are likely to come, increasing their domination in the industry.

Keep in mind that TTCF is only selling in the US for now. They are going to be growing even faster, once they start expanding in Europe and the rest of the world.

&#x200B;

# Valuation

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0j3v5uoam7871.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8e58c8f679372a8d544ded9fcdf56a10e5ea70c

TTCF has more growth and trades at a much lower multiple than its peers. And I've taken the analyst's estimates for 2022 and 2023, but these are rookie numbers and they are very likely to beat them. Indeed, this dumb-ass analyst forgot to do his job and price the catalysts, as explained below.

TTCF is worth about 6 times less than BYND, for example,  but has more growth and trades at a lower multiple. You're essentially getting a BYND but for one-sixth of the price. But most importantly, their products taste 1000x better.

The day TTCF really ramps up marketing and starts doing partnerships with famous people, they'll be trading at a much higher EV/Sales ratio. Just like OTLY with Oprah.

Unlike many other companies on this list, TTCF is not burning cash like there's no tomorrow, and is almost profitable, putting them in a strong position to continue to acquire new companies.

&#x200B;

# Unpriced News and Catalysts

This is where it gets interesting, and for once you have a real hedge. A lot of positive information has not been priced yet, as only 2 analysts are covering the stock. Even on my company's freaking expensive Bloomberg Terminal, there's almost no analysis of the stock. Just Google any of the following catalysts, you'll find nothing. Fortunately for you, I've been following this stock for longer than your wife's had a boyfriend, and this is what I found.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hsopapyfm7871.png?width=677&format=png&auto=webp&s=3091465438015baa2d2d7a16833322e52576eb6d

**Target Revenue Coming in:**

THE HISTORY OF TARGET! It gets even better. They only launched Target products on March 15^(th). This means that last quarter didn't account for Target's revenue. I had to read their 120 - pages long 10-K 5 times, in order to find that. Of course, there is no way that these two garbage analysts read that.

Analysts expect TTCF to do 54m this quarter, which is only 1m more than they did in Q1. There is absolutely no way, literally impossible that TTCF doesn't beat these numbers by at least 10m, bare minimum. With a nationwide Target presence, these numbers are a piece of cake to beat. On earnings day this could easily pop 15%.

**Kroger Leaked Website:**

On Friday, I was doing a list of all company's selling TTCF products, I noticed a glitch on Kroger's. I entered a specific query in their engine. I  saw a page containing TTCF products, but no announcement was made yet! This is huge. No one has seen that. Considering this is such a big deal. When these two sleepy analysts and the hedgies find this out (any time now), you can expect a very large green dildo. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, suits will soon wake up. You either eat them now or they'll rob you tomorrow. If they have the same success as in Target, my god they're gonna destroy their estimates. The stock could easily rise 10% on the day investors learn this.

https://preview.redd.it/z7hbugogm7871.png?width=1913&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1e17a53b512db9a7f1ec99cc62bedd3eb987ab6

**Russel 3k and 2k:**

Last Friday at the close, TTCF got added into the Russel 3000 and Russel 2000. This will increase awareness of the stock in Wallstreet and most likely prop up prices thanks to passive index tracking.

https://preview.redd.it/uzpyd3p8x7871.jpg?width=488&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44d38ebc4bbb0c8ae49c115a83ce46444f192ca8

&#x200B;

# Price Targets and Outlook

I've been in the market for years and have never seen a stock like this. Considering all the unpriced information, this stock can conservatively hit **$40+** once people find out about Kroger and how ridiculously low the revenue estimates are. **$50+** after earnings, minimum.

A **$100+** is not a stretch. This is stock is a hidden gem.

You can play it like a degenerate gambler and buy calls, but I'd recommend buying shares. Again, I don't care, but do me a favor and buy one share so you'll be able to tell your children you were a shareholder. You'll thank me later

**Positions:**

30k in Aug/Jul Calls

1650 shares

&#x200B;

**TL:DR**

Vegan apes strong together. Have you ever dreamt of a stock where you have more information that even hedgies don't have?  Numerous unpriced catalysts? Ludicrous growth? At a cheap price? Here is TTCF saying yes to all these questions! Bus or Lambo, it is up to you

The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. I have also added the Week-on-Week stock price change due to popular requests.  

Hope all of you had a pretty good week in the market. After moving sideways for the last 2 months, the S&P 500 hit a new high last week (+2.7%) ([Fun fact:](https://www.edwardjones.com/us-en/market-news-insights/stock-market-news/stock-market-weekly-update) This is the 33rd time this year S&P 500 is hitting a new high - a spectacular 26% of all trading days in 2021).

In spite of the pullback experienced in mid-June following the concerns of a Fed Policy shift, both the Nasdaq Composite (+2.4%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+3.4%) also ended the week with strong gains. Even though the overall market was green, some of the most popular stocks did end up taking a beating as shown below.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

WISH finally overtook AMC to become the most discussed stock! This was mainly driven by the 20% increase in stock price over the last week. Investors were also extremely bullish about the stock as reflected by the sentiment. Tesla has made a comeback to the top 10 list with an 8% jump in stock price.

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.

**Globalstar($GSAT):** GSAT, an American satellite communications company gained a massive 46% this week following a [Buy rating with a 150% upside](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/globalstar-rated-buy-b-riley-likes-potential-for-return-on-assets) from investment bank B.Riley. The stock jumped \~18% on Monday following the report and has continued its upward trend. According to Riley,

>Globalstar and its sponsors, after years of development, support, and patience, are at long last starting to realize a return on satellite system and spectrum assets, making 2021 an excellent time, in our opinion, to buy GSAT

**Paysafe($PSFE):** Paysafe jumped 9% as the company is set to join the Russell 3000 index. Most of the retail crowd is trying to front-run the purchases by hedge fund managers (Fund managers that track the Russell index will need to purchase the shares after its added to the index).

**Trade Desk($TTD):** TTD was generating discussions as Google announced that they would delay the removal of third-party cookies that help advertisers track users until 2023. The news also sends the stock price soaring as the stock finished the week with a 25% gain. 

**Purple Innovation($PRPL):** The current volatility of the market is perfectly reflected in this stock as an 8% run-up in a billion-dollar company has generated zero news! The retail crowd was hyping up the stock as the company has announced an off-cycle investor event which will take place on 6/29 and also because the company was one of the first meme stocks that were picked up by Reddit almost a year back.

Alright retards, I’m writing this DD because I want you guys to buy $TRQ and I’m going to explain why. I will try to make it short, but there is a lot to cover. Bear with me.

First of all, I would like to disclose that I used to work for an investment fund as a commodities consultant. My job was to go through earning reports and keep up with geopolitical bullshit all over the globe. Now, I trade with my own funds. I work for myself. 

Now, let’s go back to J Pow. He said a couple of days ago that they expect inflation to go up. My autistic brain tells me that there will be some market movement and some funds will change hands. He also said that the rates would eventually go up. What will happen in the next 6 months to a year? With a higher Fed interest rate, Macroeconomically, high growth stocks will go down as well Dow stocks because it will become more expensive to borrow money. However, that change is scheduled two years down the road, so why the transition will happen faster? Because big capital is always ahead of the market, that’s why those pendejos stay rich. Big capital will dump all their high growth shit and move to safer options. As for inflation rate, higher rates trigger a transfer from growth stocks to commodities because those are considered refuge assets. Gold, Silver and all the other shit that your grandma loves to buy is part of that. Those things will go up, but me I don’t fuck with that boomer shit because I’d rather invest in a commodity that has real use and growth potential.

My two main targets are Uranium and copper.

I’ll come back to Uranium in a different DD but now let’s talk about copper. 

Commodities experts and market movements show that we might be in the beginning of a copper demand super-cycle. The reasons are the following:

[https://preview.redd.it/7dx2pcha92771.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=887bfe8ee882ba61696b9f4cb9b4428c4513a8e1](https://preview.redd.it/7dx2pcha92771.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=887bfe8ee882ba61696b9f4cb9b4428c4513a8e1)

* Copper resources are scarce, deposits are limited and it takes about 10 years to develop a new mine and start producing. There are no new mines in development now, just extensions. Copper producers cannot keep up with the global demand. 

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/copper-is-the-new-oil-and-could-hit-20000-per-ton-analysts-say.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/copper-is-the-new-oil-and-could-hit-20000-per-ton-analysts-say.html)

* Chinese demand for copper is out of control. They want to dominate the world’s economy and they are doing so by heavily investing in their infrastructure. Chinese demand for copper accounts for about 50% of the global supply. 

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/copper-prices-51623884044](https://www.barrons.com/articles/copper-prices-51623884044)

* Copper scrap supply is decreasing dramatically. The world is running out of copper to recycle and that’s good for miners 

[https://www.recyclingtoday.com/article/copper-output-recycling-2020-icsg-data/](https://www.recyclingtoday.com/article/copper-output-recycling-2020-icsg-data/)

* The cost of copper accounts for about 15% of the green energy transition (wind mills, EV’s, etc..)

[https://www.fnarena.com/index.php/2021/06/04/esg-focus-copper-key-to-energy-transition/](https://www.fnarena.com/index.php/2021/06/04/esg-focus-copper-key-to-energy-transition/)

* The U.S. is about to heavily invest in infrastructure (assuming that politicians figure out the difference between their buttholes and their mouths)
* Many other reasons will drive the copper prices up. Google it for fucks sake.

Now that we figured out that copper is a smart play. How to invest in copper? 

Option one, buy a couple tons of copper and store them in your mom’s shed and sell them in a couple of years, or option two, own stocks from a mining company that has a good outlook. I personally chose option two, but you do you. 

When I researched the different stocks, here are the final five that made the cut:

* Rio Tinto ([NYSE: RIO](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=RIO))
* Southern Copper Corporation ([NYSE: SCCO](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=SCCO))
* Newmont Corporation ([NYSE: NEM](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=NEM))
* Freeport-McMoRan Inc. ([NYSE: FCX](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=FCX))
* **Turquoise Hill Resources (NYSE: TRQ)**

From the title of the article, you can tell that $TRQ is the one I picked. Why?

* Presently It has a P/E ratio of about 5.2. This stock is CHEAP for what the company delivers.
* The fundamentals are solid. Debt is under control and all the other metrics are solid (Trust me, I checked).
* After many years of development and negotiation with the government of Mongolia. The mine it owns finally started delivering. The first of SIX Oyu Tolgoi deposits is beating yield expectations by almost the double. The first open pit deposit is scheduled to be followed by a more promising underground deposit expected to deliver 550,000 tons of copper yearly by 2025, from about 145,000 now.
* Rio Tinto managed to own 51% of TRQ via hostile acquisitions and is now trying to dilute the stock and the goal is to own the whole fucking thing. They found some success because the stock suffered some big setbacks due to a heavy short activity. Their pressure won’t last though because TRQ is gaining a lot of visibility among investors (gained about 15% the last three days)
* Again, you need to do your own research and you’ll figure out why this stock is promising. Stop being lazy and stop believing everything you read on Reddit. 

this is my position:

\[Posting again because I made a mistake in the first version that I wasn't able to edit for some reason. Also, posting this as discussion because I don't think this is suitable as DD. It isn't as extensive as most DD is, and I'm here to see what other people think.\]

\[Also, no part of this post should be construed as financial/investing advice. You should always do your due diligence before putting your money anywhere, and this is no exception.\]

Tl;dr: Leveraged ETFs such as SPXL, UPRO, TQQQ tend to be very favorable over the long run, despite popular belief. They tend to over-perform their leverage when the return is positive, and under-perform their leverage when the return is negative, causing there to be a sort of lopsided upside.

In this post, I attempt to find a way to model the return of SPXL, a 3x leveraged bull S&P 500 ETF, based on the return of SPY, over long periods of time (mainly 1 year).

It seems that the general consensus among investors is that leveraged ETFs are a bad long-term investment mainly because these ETFs only multiply the the return of the underlying *daily.* For example, SPXL, a 3x leveraged fund that tracks SPY, only returns 3-times the return of SPY daily, so if SPY goes up 3% on a given day, it goes up 9%. The implication of this is that there is a great deal of uncertainty over the *long-term* return of the leveraged ETF - there is no guarantee that the ETF multiplies the return of the underlying over longer periods of time.

The second main argument against leveraged ETFs is that, as a consequence of the magnified movement of the underlying up and down, the math works against leveraged ETFs, causing them to lose value over time - a phenomenon known as **negative return bias**. People that support this point argue that this negative return bias causes the leveraged ETF to underperform the underlying in the long run, and, in many cases, even go down when the underlying goes up. Although there is some evidence to back this, a closer look at the historical returns of SPXL and SPY in green years would say otherwise - SPXL out-performed SPY in 2019, 2017, 2016, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2010, 2009. An important outlier here is 2020, in which SPXL under-performed SPY despite it being a green year. I will address the reasons behind this later on. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVt6ilphs7Q&amp;t=499s) does a better job debunking this belief by performing an autocorrelation t-test to determine if the negative return bias is statistically significant. It is not.

Either way, the main purpose of this post is not to counter the second argument, but to address the concern behind the uncertainty of the long-term returns of leveraged ETFs. I did so by trying to develop a mathematical model that predicts the return of the 3x leveraged ETF (SPXL) based on the return of underlying (SPY) over a one-year timeframe.

First, I collected the historical prices of SPY daily since 1993. Then, I calculated the daily return of SPY (in %) every day since 1993 using the formula: (close - open)/open \* 100 to get a distribution of all daily returns historically for SPY. I could now model SPY's movement over longer periods of time by stringing together these returns - specifically, I was able to simulate SPY's yearly return and a 3x leveraged S&P bull by randomly selecting 250 daily returns (since there are 250 trading days in a year) from my distribution of all daily returns. I did this 10,000 times to simulate 10,000 years. I then plotted the the 3x daily-leveraged ETF VS SPY, and the results were interesting:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kcwtxloxpm771.png?width=397&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d3f8a25ccdf5c3e5cee47e387d82caa4c8ed11f

As you can see, there seems to be a very clear polynomial/exponential pattern shown with some variability. I fit a cubic model to this data and it seems to be a nice fit:

&#x200B;

[The axes are kind of mislabeled: it was supposed to say SPXL on the y-axis and SPY on the x-axis, not vice-versa.](https://preview.redd.it/r122j7zypm771.png?width=397&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9644507150cfe0e85956b7f7f146b579499fb5a)

My primary observation is that the data seems to be curved in a way that makes the 3x leveraged ETF very favorable - it tends to overperform the 3x leverage when SPY goes up (for instance, when SPY goes up 25% in a year, it is estimated that the leveraged ETF will go up by more than 75%, in this case almost 100%) - and it tends to underperform the 3x leverage when SPY goes down (for instance, when SPY goes down 10%, it is estimated that the leveraged ETF will go down by less than 30%. This is supported by historical data - SPY has gone up an impressive 42% in the last year while SPXL has returned 173%, more than 3\*42 = 126%.

Obviously this model would be meaningless if I didn't test it with actual, historical data. SPXL was established back in 2009, so I used the plugged all the yearly returns of SPY since 2009 into my model to predict the yearly returns of SPXL since 2009, and I compared those findings to the actual yearly returns of SPXL since 2009. On average, I was off by about 9%, which isn't really that impressive but is still reasonable when you take into account that the average absolute return of SPXL is about 56%. To me, overestimating or underestimating 56% by 9% isn't a big deal. From what I saw, it is very good in predicting the return if the volatility is less, since that leaves less room for compounded variability. The model was eerily accurate in predicting the return of 173% in the last year - it was off by about 2%. It was very inaccurate in predicting the return of SPXL in 2020, mainly because that was a period of high volatility and low net movement. I haven't really rigorously tested the model, but I plan on doing so when I get the time. 

An analysis with QQQ and TQQQ yields similar results, which leads me to believe that leveraged ETFs are a good way to get better returns. Although it isn't advisable to pour your life savings into such instruments, investing a part of your portfolio in leveraged ETFs might be the move.

BeachBody, historically known for their workout DVD’s and many famous programs (P90x, Insanity, 21 Day Fix, etc), successfully made the transition to streaming On Demand.

(Remember 89% margins on digital subscription revenue).

**OpenFit PartnerShips**

OpenFit (backed by Lebron & Arnold) recently announced a partnership with Concierge Health, a technology platform that provides health engagement solutions to reduce healthcare costs. Concierge Health has a user base of 150M People, which will now have access to OpenFit and receive credit for completing workouts through the app. (Again, 89% margins) Link to that article [here.](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210609005208/en/Openfit-and-Concierge-Health-Announce-At-Home-Exercise-Incentives)

OpenFit also has a partnership with LA Fitness over 700 physical locations , giving all of their gym members access to the app for $5/month.

**Myx Fitness**

A simple google search will show that MYX has the cheapest bike among competitors. Cheaper is obviously not always better, as a lot of times quality will suffer.But in our situation it seems that it is cheaper and better in quality than most of the competition. I have seen mostly good reviews and comments on social media about MYX bikes. The most negativity I've seen were complaints about shipping times, but also that customer service has been very responsive about this issue. A simple search will show you many people that dumped their old bike even it was more expensive for the Myx one. Interestingly, Myx has sold over 27,000 bikes in their first year of sales with the average user completing 15 workouts a month. The attractive pricepoint of their bikes at $1,299 is $600 cheaper than peloton’s basic bike.

**Nutrition (thats a big one) Shakeology**

Shakeology is a superfood nutrition shake that can be a spark that prompts positive change in your life. They’ve also recently acquired Ladder in 2020, “the sports nutrition company founded by LeBron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Ladder product is NSF Certified for Sport®, a third-party certification trusted by all major sports governing bodies and verifies that products do not contain any of approximately 270+ substances banned by major athletic organizations and that the contents of the product match what is printed on the label”

You can do a research on all of these on the official websites for more info.

Lets continue with

**Quick Financial Overview:** 1.1B (est) revenue for 2021, 68% gross margins on that rev (which is better than NFLX, DIS, PTON, etc). Digital subscriptions have 89% margins. 43% YoY revenue increase for Q1. Added literally a million subscribers YoY. 400M free cash on the books upon merger w/ no debt. Also expanding to 10+ countries globally in the future starting with Spanish and French from now. Growth company and also tech company as you will see below in the post. Beach body already has more than 3.3 + **MILLION** paid digital subscribers. We will talk about subscribers, coaches and followers below. All in all, this is a financially solid company with plans for growth and expansion (in an industry that is expected to have a CAGR of 33% by 2027, $59B) which happens to have a few meme-like qualities and dont forget **NO DEBT.**

**2021 Q1 Financials**

Total Revenue: $243M - 43% increase YoY

Total Subscriptions: 3.2M - 39% increase (record high)

(Not an actual earnings report, assumed to be released after merger)

**Q2** mentioned on interview will be even better.

**Future Plans & News**

Here’s where they’re really making moves. Carl Daikeler (CEO of BB) and BeachBody has been operating on free cash flow and has been profitable for 20 years. Upon this deal closing, they’ll have what they referred to as a “war chest” of $400M free cash (with no debt) on the books for M&A, marketing, and expansion.

**International Expansion**

The team has recently stated plans of expanding worldwide to 10+ countries in the near future.

**THATS IMPORTANT**. Lets make a break from facts and discuss numbers of followers and subscribers.

If you check company's website and social media and put all the followers together you will see that they have millions of followers, almost 3.4 million paid subs, thousands of coaches that each one have thousands of followers so again millions of people. Celebrities backing this one Lebron, Shaq, and Arnold together have 70 !!!! million followers only on Twitter, on Instagram they have over 100 million!!!!. Insiders have also thousands of followers, so here its good to say we speak about literally an army of people. **A cult that loves Beachbody.**

Important also is that Carl is a so well organized CEO that knows that BB has thousands of followers so as he mentioned lots of times he has well organized groups and teams in order to connect with each other, in order not to exist many groups on FB or any other social scattered all these people are well organized and managing thousands and millions of people, subs and coaches to connect each other.

Lets talk about

**Tech in Fitness**

Anytime you throw tech into an industry or sector, it instantly becomes more attractive. This is exactly what BB, MYX, and OpenFit are doing. 2020 saw a serious surge of fitness apps being downloaded. OpenFit has good ratings on the app store, 4.9 stars from 15k reviews. (App is also backed by Arnold and Lebron) People like the idea of being connected in their workouts, giving them the ability to compete with friends and strangers alike. There is a YouTube account called Garage Gym Reviews, this guy makes a living reviewing equipment and how that equipment will fit in your garage gym. He recently reviewed Tonal, and spoke on how tech connected fitness will be a huge market going forward. Some people will obviously not be able to afford to build a garage gym, or $3k Tonal, or an expensive exercise bike. This is where a $99/year BB subscription could come in.

What about???

**Future of At-Home Connected Fitness**

Why would people continue to workout from home after the pandemic is completely over? This is a valid question, but I fully believe people will continue to do so. A study conducted by Wakefield Research in July 2020 concluded that 87% (of 1000 participants) who plan to return to the gym say they will continue to work out at home at least some of the time. Links to those are [here](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200817005351/en/The-Future-of-Fitness-Americans-Embrace-a-Hybrid-of-Home-Exercise-and-Gym-Workouts) and [here](https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/blog/home-workouts-future-of-fitness). A survey of 3500 American by *The New Consumer* and Coefficient Capital found that 76% of people have tried working out at home during the pandemic—and crucially, 66% prefer it. Among millennials, the number is even higher: 82% made the switch and 81% like it more. Link to article [here](https://www.fastcompany.com/90587575/gyms-arent-coming-back-heres-how-youll-work-out-in-the-future).

Say the truth who prefers working at his own pace with his own music and great programmes instead of being next to people especially after pandemic waiting for his turn on the bikes.

Lets see if there is any

**Bear Case**

None. Only thing bears came in mind was something about MLM scheme but i wont discuss it since Kevin and Carl answered already on all their interviews *(Kevin Mayer and Carl Daikeler last interview on Fireside Chat : This is social commerce not MLM company , with influencers and no inventory on them. None intermediators , not MLM model at all.)* plus i wont mention MLM companies that their stocks are 50-100 pps because bears are getting nervous. *(HLF, NUS, PRI)*

Finally most important

**PAY ATTENTION TO THE Short Squeeze (summer lemonade) POTENTIAL**

**Check this image**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[8.8&#37; only public shares!](https://preview.redd.it/unkrgq17gh771.png?width=362&format=png&auto=webp&s=6849de07ad327d6a808d1f44d4fc55147312d165)

&#x200B;

Monday $BODY will have less than 30 milly shares available (around 22-25) for shareholders that makes it a very low float stock. Already buying pressure from retail is obvious. Already many tutes have positions with big names among them **74 total tutes, 65 long only**, 1 short only, 8 long/short with a total of 9 million shares already. As of 15/6 Short float was **20% !!!! in an already low floater**. Check this tweet for proof

[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1404894383728730112](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1404894383728730112)

Add all of the above to the equation and lets see...

The stock already hit 18+ back in February and since then shorts attacked it for several months creating 20% short float on a proven highly profitable growth company and dropping over 50% of its value. Now shares remaining are very low because **most float is locked**. Shorts need aprox. 8 days to cover and they getting trapped more and more every day and while trying to bash the stock everywhere in order to drop the price and get out since the dont have the shares to fight back the pressure. If everyone wants a little piece of this pie as it seems public float will be all locked fast and then ...

Dont forget Monday $BODY rings the bell and will attract more investors and retail plus all the cult behind this company as we mentioned above. This can creat a massive squeeze with shorts covering.

**IMPORTANT-->** Retail shareholders have high conviction and not selling shares, Carl already told that he wont sell even 1 share of his 41%, same applies for the insiders lots of them forgot to mention are unknown **Silicon Valley** investors. If they not selling, I’m not selling.

**More MEMEish features**

&#x200B;

* $BODY ticker (hard to ignore) [This](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/01/stock-picking-buying-a-winner-is-easy-just-find-a-cool-ticker-symbol.html) article details a study that concluded that companies with cool tickers tend to outperform the market better than companies without. Its summer anyways right?
* Comparison to PTON
* Arnold, Lebron, and Shaq are all confirmed shareholders. Collectively, they have 128.7M followers on IG alone. You can imagine what will happen if they start being vocal about their involvement in the company. Dont forget anything big Diesel touch along with the others turns to **gold**, no need to mention other tickers we all know. Who goes against these guys? Everyone loves them.
* Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs, both former Disney execs, will be staying on the BeachBody team to help with future growth, post-merge. Kevin Mayer played a large role in the success of Disney+, also former TikTok CEO
* 1+ billion revenue that Carl on interview said that we should add one or two zeros in the future on that **without DEBT** at all and with 400m on chest for marketing and promotion.

I dont want to post links to interviews and websites since we all know to google and search. All are available in youtube and www and i dont want to make this thread longer. **The only thing i will say is this DD thread was to put your attention on this company that as CEO mentions along with all shareholders, insiders and celebrities is the Biggest leading subscription Health and Wellness company offering Tech and Nutrition for the masses in the market. Its the PTON for 99% and the Netflix of digital fitness , all words from the all star team proven to turn into gold everything the worked with.**

Some people say $BODY to 0, 5, 20, 30, 50, 100 i wont post or mention any pt but with so low float and so big Short float **everything is doable with volume**. Share thoughts share anything like i shared mine , and also i have to share my memeish feeling of the stock since day 1. Somewhere my eye caught a quote i liked - its better to be in a Meme before it becomes one (unknown - 2021)! First time such an all star team behind the wheel with so many followers behind them thats the fact. Shorts already seems to be in trouble into my eyes. **DEEP VALUE** my fellow apes rangers Ogs whatever you like. Everyone likes the stock it seems in social and you know the power of social media from Kitty.

**Tip---> No pumpers (yet) on $BODY its a pure fundamental - growth - behemoth of a company that offers huge potential to investors in early stages. They target triple digits and they are capable of as a team.**

**Small Update : $BODY rang the bell this Monday 28/6.** But received many messages from people they couldnt find it to buy , thats because most brokers had issues since late at closing bell. From today 29/6 all will work fine. Despite all these issues on first day (that screwed some of the retail) $BODY opened strong and remained strong all day although more shorts piled in and raised SI more! (volume before price) As of today many brokers like IB have no shares available to short!!! Lastly i want to thank you for the feedback on the DD i really appreciate it, and the messages i got especially from people that know $BODY from inside!

My personal take that yes they are huge companies, and they so carry so much cash, however, without these big companies, the US economy wouldn’t be the same…. Thats just my take on it.

Finally, I feel like the government should focus more on providing a better work environment in Amazon since clearly it is an issue for almost everyone that worked there (including me).

I wouldn't be surprise to see AMD @95$ in July and 110$ end of year. Could be $140 by mid-2022.

Jmia 17
Meli 15.55 
Amzn 4.22
Pins 23.39

As you can see Wish P/S is significantly lower than its competitors. On 12/31/2020 WISH P/S was 4.37. Wish is trading at only 56% of the    P/S value it was in December. 


Over the past 12 months Wish has generated almost 3B in revenue. 

Wish is projected to become profitable in December of 2023 according to analysts projections. 

Revenue Estimates Year End | YOY Growth | FWD Price/Sales
Dec 2021 3.32B | 30.59% 2.13
Dec 2022 3.81B | 14.82% 1.85
Dec 2023 4.49B | 17.85% 1.57
Dec 2024 5.24B | 16.76% 1.35 
Dec 2025 5.99B | 14.20% 1.18 
Dec 2026 7.40B | 23.62% .95
Dec 2027 8.38B | 13.18% .84 
Dec 2028 9.43B |12.58% .75 

There is no arguing that thing is MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE than a lot of the other 
e-commerce stocks out there. 

I like that there is no debt and almost 2 Billion in the bank. 

I think that the product quality, and delivery time will become better for the consumer over the next 12 months based on recent hires, and partnerships. 

Wish local allows the buyer to save money by picking up at one of the wish local locations and allows the small businesses to have an extra revenue stream. 
Wish boost (sellers can boost their products for a certain amount of time. Similar to tinder or bumble for all you horny fucks out there)

Google trends. Wish is trending more THAN DOUBLE what it was in Jan-April. 

Because of this I expect wish to have strong revenue, and user growth for this upcoming quarter. 

I like the stock. This is not financial advise. I’m just an ape 🦧"

Earnings is Friday [DD],630,137,2021-06-24 02:59:19,"TL:DR - Used Car sales are at an all time high thanks to the chip shortage. CarMax is the largest used car dealership and have significantly more reach to acquire used vehicles for resell vs. smaller dealerships. CarMax is going to report HUGE earnings. 

**CarMax's business**

CarMax makes money 3 ways

1. Used car sales
2. Auction of used cars to dealerships
3. Services for dealerships

**Used Car Sales**

Look at any car related sub-reddit or Google it used car sales it at a all time high. This demand for used cars is largely driven by the fact you can't easily buy a new car due to the chip shortage. Because there is such a huge boner for used cars dealerships can't keep them on the lot. If you don't believe me take your POS Nissan Sentra and go get it appraised by CarMax, Vroom, Shift or your local dealership. I guarantee they will offer you more money for your vehicle then you would have got 6 months ago. 

*Question* \- But you may be thinking well golly whizz if every dealership is paying for used cars how does CarMax really beat out anyone else? 

Right here in this answer is the key to why CarMax will sky rocket with their earnings. CarMax is dominating online search for car appraisal traffic. Everyone in the today's age isn't strolling down to their local dealership and asking how much they can get for their car. Instead they are going online and Google ""how much can I sell my car for"" and other terms. Because CarMax (and other major websites like Vroom) are able to win online they deliver appraisals all online. They are gobbling up all the inventory before you even take your broke ass to the local dealership to upgrade to a Honda Civic. 

*Question* \- But if they everyone offers a bundle of cash for my used car won't they lose money?

Yes, CarMax (and other competitors) are paying a premium for the vehicle. However, those SOBs are marking that vehicle up and passing the expense onto you. Any vehicle they are unable to sell they clean up and sell in their auction service to the dealerships desperate to get inventory.

***Acquisition of*** ***Edmunds.com***

It floated under the radar a bit but CarMax made a massive acquisition in June. They acquired the car review website Edmunds.com. However, what you may not know about this website is they have a shit load of content related to selling your car. Again CarMax is making acquisitions in an effort to takeover everything related to selling and buying a used car. This acquisition gives them incredible reach to customer's looking to buy and sell their used car. 

[Acquisition of Edmunds](http://media.carmax.com/press-releases/news-release/2020/CarMax-Partners-with-Digital-Automotive-Leader-Edmunds/default.aspx)

**Auction of used cars to dealerships**

If your still with me congratulations. I think this is pretty straight forward. CarMax buys a lot of shitty cars. A huge part of that business is to refurbish the cars and sell them off to other dealerships with low inventory. Remember if a dealership has no inventory they have no business... 

At the start of June CarMax opened up jobs to hire 1,800 people for vehicle prep work. You really think they would open up that many positions without something behind it? Use your smooth brain to read behind the lines.

Services for dealerships

This part of their business is a little more unknown but I think has huge potential. CarMax is going to be announcing a series of services they offer dealerships at a significant cost. This is additive to their business model so anything is gravy.

**Positions or ban and why CarMax is so undervalued**

I love this stock. I am a huge fan of CarMax's long term strategy and think they will continue to take over the used car eco-system. 

When I think about their stock price it blows my mind that Carvana (a online only competitor) has a market cap of 54B and a stock price of $315. Carvana is a shittier version of CarMax. Case in point Carvana has revenue of 5.5B. CarMax has revenue of 18B and a stock price of $118. CarMax's market cap is only 19B. Let that sink in... I put it in a chart for you true autists. 

|Company|Market Cap|2020 Revenue|Stock Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CarMax|19.33B|$20.3B|118.50|
|Carvana|54.45B|$5.59|315.84|

Buy the stock buy calls. Just get on the rocket ship as we are about to blast off. 

***Earnings call is this Friday pre stock opening. So buy before the market closes Thursday.***

o6j74s,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o6j74s/high_inflation_higher_interest_rates_what_is_your/,High inflation? higher interest rates? what is your commodity play? I picked $TRQ,11,3,2021-06-24 02:44:45," 

Alright retards, I’m writing this DD because I want you apes to buy $TRQ and I’m going to explain why. I will try to make it short, but there is a lot to cover. Bear with me. 


First of all, I would like to disclose that I used to work for an investment fund as a commodities consultant. My job was to go through earning reports and keep up with geopolitical bullshit all over the globe. Now, I trade with my own funds. I work for myself.  

Now, let’s go back to J Pow. He said a couple of days ago that they expect inflation to go up. My autistic brain tells me that there will be some market movement and some funds will change hands. He also said that the rates would eventually go up. What will happen in the next 6 months to a year? With a higher Fed interest rate, Macroeconomically, high growth stocks will go down as well Dow stocks because it will become more expensive to borrow money. However, that change is scheduled two years down the road, so why the transition will happen faster? Because big capital is always ahead of the market, that’s why those pendejos stay rich. Big capital will dump all their high growth shit and move to safer options. As for inflation rate, higher rates trigger a transfer from growth stocks to commodities because those are considered refuge assets. Gold, Silver and all the other shit that your grandma loves to buy is part of that. Those things will go up, but me I don’t fuck with that boomer shit because I’d rather invest in a commodity that has real use and growth potential.

My two main targets are Uranium and copper. 

I’ll come back to Uranium in a different DD but now let’s talk about copper.  

Commodities experts and market movements show that we might be in the beginning of a copper demand super-cycle. The reasons are the following:

* Copper resources are scarce, deposits are limited and it takes about 10 years to develop a new mine and start producing. There are no new mines in development now, just extensions. Copper producers cannot keep up with the global demand.  

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/copper-is-the-new-oil-and-could-hit-20000-per-ton-analysts-say.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/copper-is-the-new-oil-and-could-hit-20000-per-ton-analysts-say.html)

* Chinese demand for copper is out of control. They want to dominate the world’s economy and they are doing so by heavily investing in their infrastructure. Chinese demand for copper accounts for about 50% of the global supply.  

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/copper-prices-51623884044](https://www.barrons.com/articles/copper-prices-51623884044)

* Copper scrap supply is decreasing dramatically. The world is running out of copper to recycle and that’s good for miners  

[https://www.recyclingtoday.com/article/copper-output-recycling-2020-icsg-data/](https://www.recyclingtoday.com/article/copper-output-recycling-2020-icsg-data/)

* The cost of copper accounts for about 15% of the green energy transition (wind mills, EV’s, etc..) 

[https://www.fnarena.com/index.php/2021/06/04/esg-focus-copper-key-to-energy-transition/](https://www.fnarena.com/index.php/2021/06/04/esg-focus-copper-key-to-energy-transition/)

* The U.S. is about to heavily invest in infrastructure (assuming that politicians figure out the difference between their buttholes and their mouths) 
* Many other reasons will drive the copper prices up. Google it for fucks sake. 

Now that we figured out that copper is a smart play. How to invest in copper?  

Option one, buy a couple tons of copper and store them in your mom’s shed and sell them in a couple of years, or option two, own stocks from a mining company that has a good outlook. I personally chose option two, but you do you.  

When I researched the different stocks, here are the final five that made the cut: 

* Rio Tinto ([NYSE: RIO](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=RIO)) 
* Southern Copper Corporation ([NYSE: SCCO](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=SCCO)) 
* Newmont Corporation ([NYSE: NEM](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=NEM)) 
* Freeport-McMoRan Inc. ([NYSE: FCX](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=FCX)) 
* **Turquoise Hill Resources (NYSE: TRQ)** 

From the title of the article, you can tell that $TRQ is the one I picked. Why? 

* Presently It has a P/E ratio of about 5.2. This stock is CHEAP for what the company delivers. 
* The fundamentals are solid. Debt is under control and all the other metrics are solid (Trust me, I checked). 
* After many years of development and negotiation with the government of Mongolia. The mine it owns finally started delivering. The first of SIX Oyu Tolgoi deposits is beating yield expectations by almost the double. The first open pit deposit is scheduled to be followed by a more promising underground deposit expected to deliver 550,000 tons of copper yearly by 2025, from about 145,000 now. 
* I hate Rio Tinto because it always fucked poor people over by bribing government officials around the world and pillaged their resources. Rio Tinto managed to own 51% of TRQ via hostile acquisitions and is now trying to dilute the stock and the goal is to own the whole fucking thing. They found some success because the stock suffered some big setbacks due to a heavy short activity. Their pressure won’t last though because TRQ is gaining a lot of visibility among investors (gained about 15% the last three days) 
* Again, you need to do your own research and you’ll figure out why this stock is promising. Stop being lazy and stop believing everything you read on Reddit. "
o6j1k9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o6j1k9/palantir_the_solution_to_the_problems_that_didnt/,Palantir. The Solution to the Problems that didn't exist (Yet),347,110,2021-06-24 02:36:04,"Palantir. Love it. Hate it. You will never stop hearing about it. And here's why.

Palantir was created for a world that didn't exist yet. A world where information and data would become so large no human workforce could ever be able to manage it effectively let alone, extrapolate insight from. So what's data do? It either sits there, or becomes a parasite on you for companies like google and facebook to target your dollars in the form of user specific ads. This way of utilizing data is indeed parasitic, and Palantir rejects this use of data in everyway possible.

But what if data wasn't used to fuck over your own customers, but instead used to help save them money and resources. Perhaps their lives? Restore supply chains, accelerate cancer research, and help restore the world to (somewhat) normalcy post pandemic. The sophisticated tools required to manage this type of data would have been inconceivable. No one predicated this kind of disjunction. Well. maybe some, but no company that would sacrifice half their revenue in R & D to solve problems of this magnitude they may or may not come to fruition. No one. Except 1 company. Valued at less than 1 billion back in 2010, then up to 9 billion in 2013 and 20 billion in 2015. And as high as 41 billion right before becoming public. Palantir 40x in 10 years is impressive, but its total addressable market would suggest a runaway so large and growing so fast that those returns are far from over. 

How big is this market? Well. Looking at the S-1 Filings it's estimated to be 119 billion. This is broken down into 63 billion in government and 56 billion in commercial. This is less than a fucking percent. How fast is it expanding? Well the S-1 is old news in my opinion of the ""macrotrend"" that Alex Karp says is happening.  

This comes from COO Shyam Sankar himself...

 ""And -- and with our investments in the end-to-end, sensor-to-shooter workflows from space to mud, we're not just going after the roughly $60 billion of government IT spend anymore, we're talking about the quarter-trillion dollars of U.S. DOD weapons system spend in 2020.""

This is fucking huge. And is completely overfucking looked. Everyone is still looking at the S1 filings about PLTR's TAM and its just wrong, it's so far much more now. This is why perhaps that government revenue is actually picking up at a more rapid pace despite it being their main customer base to this date. Government revenue grew at 68% YoY in Q3 2020 and in Q1 2021 it was 72 percent (With US revenue at 83%).

All-in-all I believe that a price to sales ratio of 40 is completely justified. This TAM is most definitely expanding into the commercial space as well. As IBM pointed out, 90% of all data has been generated in the last 2 years alone. This means that the data is growing faster then people can analyze it. This is where software like Palantir will be crucial in the future. What we're seeing with covid is all but just 1 example of how Palantir has been preparing for a future of disjunction. Palantir's investments only exacerbates  the obviousness of the problem the large amounts of disperse data creates. They're putting their money where their mouth is by not only putting half of their revenue into R&D  (561 Million, up 100% from 2018)  but taking whatever's left over into data-intensive business startups that utilize Palantir software. These actions of SPAC investments are probably more or less on Peter Thiel's part considering he's created the Founder's Fund and has a track record of picking innovative companies. This doesn't suggest that Palantir is slowing down and that Palantir simply doesn't know where to put their money, but they're more or less trying to plant seeds in industries and sectors that they are wanting to penetrate. Not only could they see significant returns that startups that succeed bring about, but also an increase in reputation and a testament of Palantir's usefulness in that sector. They want to make examples like BP saving 50 million in the first 2 weeks to potentially a billion a year off using Palantir's software become the Rule and not the Exception to the Rule. Palantir's usefulness is not 'niche' but can be applied across any sector.

I don't want to consider this DD as I barely did any research that I'm sure most of you guys didn't already know. My main point here is the counter argument to Palantir's valuation. And the skepticism surrounding its potential slow down in the future. In my opinion, Palantir and their competitors aren't growing as fast as the TAM and that's why I don't expect to see revenue both on commercial or government to grow slower than 45% in a couple years when the entire commercial sector will start to generate so much data that they'll have to switch to something new then their own built in piece by piece enterprise software that simply just doesn't work. This is the reoccurring problem Palantir has on it's sales side. It's not other software enterprise companies that they mainly compete with, but their own customers that try to build their own systems.  If they can get this much revenue from less than 200 customers (not to mention that the top 20 customers continue to pay 30%+ more for their subscriptions on a YoY basis) then any fear of a slowdown should not be on your mind when deciding whether or not to purchase Palantir stock. 

My main concern for Palantir is ironically how much cash it has. I say ironic because Peter Thiel ripped in Googles cash hoard saying they aren't innovative enough to know how to use their 50 billion cash hoard. Now Palantir only has 2.3 billion cash but there market cap is much smaller than Googles back in 2012 when their massive cash hoard was addressed. (50 billion Vs Googles 270 billion). Now this cash hoard isn't nearly as severe and a drag as google's through the forces of inflation but it does pose some headwind if they cannot utilize it in innovative ways. Now Palantir has invested in 4 additional SPACs that I'm aware of since their ER (Perhaps 5, Idk if the ""partnership"" with Primer includes a PIPE investment) and perhaps we may actually see a decrease next quarter on their cash on hand which I'm not opposed to, as long as its being reinvested in some way.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Palantir may be a multibillion dollar company but the the billions of dollars spent on R&D are just now beginning to pay off as the macrotrends are beginning to point closer and closer to companies like Palantir to be the next solution to the next problems that will plague the world in the not too distant future.

""In June 2007, Szulczewski transferred to Google’s new office in South Korea and got a lesson in tech outside the Silicon Valley bubble. Koreans preferred search portals that were busy and crowded with information over clean, minimalist home pages like Google’s. Former Google colleague Mark Rabkin remembers debating the point with Szulczewski when he visited. “I could tell he was starting to think like a local,” says Rabkin, who’s now an ad executive at Facebook. The experience would help shape Szulczewski’s strategy for Wish: He learned to focus on building something people wanted rather than what Silicon Valley thought they should want.""  


Does WISH sell shitty products?  


""Wish’s open-door policy meant that sales were taking off, but so were quality-control problems—which is somewhat inevitable when you have one million registered merchants, of whom 125,000 are active on Wish each month. By way of context, Amazon hosts an estimated 2.5 million active third-party merchants, while Walmart has roughly 21,000, according to Marketplace Pulse, a New York-based e-commerce intelligence firm.  

To tackle this, Wish automatically culls about 8 million products over a week, or close to 3% of all products available on the site. Most are cut because visitors have scrolled past an item at least 1,000 times and haven’t tapped on it once. Wish also culls products from merchants who’ve received bad reviews or put up fake reviews. To automatically detect the fakes, Wish’s engineers trained its software on reviews that were obviously made up. One example: “Did not expect so soon, the owner of service enthusiasm.” Now the software can identify reviews with similar nonsensical phrases.

Szulczewski seems unfazed by the quality-control challenge, pointing out that sometimes customers themselves are the problems.""We sell 5 million contact lenses a year. Someone's going to sleep in them.""Overall, there is a set of roughly 60 rules. If Wish’s algorithms see that a merchant has listed counterfeit products or shipped an order with a fake tracking number, they’ll be “fined” $500. Shipping a package with no product spells a potential $10,000 fine. Wish collects around $3 million a month in fines, and it can do that by simply withholding payments from merchants, says Szulczewski. Merchants can also get kicked off the platform, he adds. On the flip side, good reviews can lead to faster payments or a higher ranking in search. 

Zhang, who is 6,000 miles away, overseeing operations in three locations in China with 150 staff members, is just as paranoid about being gamed. “Merchants definitely care about making money first,” Zhang says. The rules and monitoring software don’t always go down well. “The merchants look at Wish’s platform as very robotic,” he says, meaning there’s no way for merchants to negotiate a better deal by cultivating personal relationships with Wish staff.

 “It’ll never be perfect,” admits Tung, the GGV investor. “You get what you pay for.” But Szulczewski paints a rosier picture. The flywheel of customer data going into Wish will mean more reviews, smarter targeting software and, eventually, better-quality items. Those unbranded smartphones will get better every year, he says, “just like our iPhones.”

# The Roaring 2020s:

People are desperately looking to get out and go somewhere. And where would you want to go after being cooped up in the house year long? The beach of course. Thanks to the money printer, US total personal savings have almost doubled from pre-pandemic levels. You bet some of it is going to be blown on nice vacations. 

We have all witnessed how the recovery plays took off in the past few months leaving tech FD chads who had been winning last year on the breadline. Last week was not so good for these plays but many of them are still not at levels worth buying the dip.  While any recovery stock has been literally free money so far, as the boomers over at CNBC say, tHe eAsY mOnEy hAs bEeN mAdE. It is now time to pick the clear winners of the reopening. The market is bigly underestimating pent up leisure demand.

Playa Hotels & Resorts is a luxury all-inclusive oceanfront resort chain with hotels and properties in Mexico, Dominican Republic and Jamaica. They are very well run and raking in money. They are perfectly positioned to take full advantage of the deluge of tourists who will be coming in waves.

[\*insert obligatory wife's boyfriend joke\*](https://preview.redd.it/yxcf3dr0ct671.jpg?width=510&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2be91356644726d4114149a8b54480cf127bc533)

# The setup:

The market is pricing $PLYA as if things will be just be going back to normal by next Jan, which is usually peak demand season for their beach resorts. However, they are going to absolutely crush the numbers from previous years as their business is picking up steam rapidly. Their average room rate is already exploding and they could be operating at peak demand from July which is unprecedented. Their June and July rates have also surpassed December recently based on data from booking.com, hotels.com etc. 

Here are some stunning trends:

[It's June and the search interest is spiking; every other peak was in Jan in prior years.](https://preview.redd.it/l10irfjs8z671.jpg?width=903&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bf74164723873c579413100a4046555a03b76c8)

[US Google search volume for beach resort is 25&#37; higher than pre-pandemic levels.](https://preview.redd.it/53kbt8ez8z671.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3608bbfa6ea96bde2ded380574fdf334b7b075f)

[ YouTube search interest for “beach resort”  spiking bigly.](https://preview.redd.it/ubg35ovgxz671.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=59b04a6343f81cda3d072f1564f6b3887bcb4449)

[Worldwide search interest is recovering, should give another boost to $PLYA.](https://preview.redd.it/co4hfxc4yz671.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3e1dd47dec6bbd2fe0a518583e52145b561377c)

Their hotels also have some of the best reviews and ratings for a luxury resort chain in Tripadvisor, bookings.com, hotels.com etc.  They don't have properties in business locations so the uncertainty about the return of business demand does not affect them. Flight trend data (from kayak.com) also points to an increase in traffic to the locations where $PLYA has resorts.

All this without significant traffic from Europe, Canada and Asia. They have been slower to reopen compared to the US, but when they inevitably do, expect the demand to skyrocket even higher.

Unlike many recovery plays, they have pricing power. And they are going to absolutely milk this opportunity by charging top dollar. Here is what the CEO had to say about it in the last last earnings call before this crazy spike in demand. 

https://preview.redd.it/f19jeep6vy671.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e94839cee17f93b1b4d7d818084cf92b25f354a

That is a nice way of saying that they will be adopting a ""fuck you pay me"" approach to doing business when demand booms.  So they were anticipating this and planning accordingly. So far, it looks like they are going to have a  blowout quarter.

# Financials:

Not that y'all care, but they have a healthy balance sheet. They raised cash back in Jan with an underwritten public offering of shares. Cash and cash equivalents are up and debt and liabilities are down compared to the previous quarter so there is little chance of further dilution now that their resorts are starting to get packed again.

# Analyst ratings:

The average Wall Street PT sits at $7.25, totally oblivious to what is happening. But the big boys have started to take notice. Deutsche Bank has upgraded the PT from $8.00 to $10.00. Even Bank of America, which which used to have a $1.5 PT on our beloved gamestonk has initiated coverage recently with a PT of $10.00. 

# Technicals: 

I passed PLYA through u/pennyether's tried and tested SMELL system.  

* **Short Interest:** SI is currently estimated to be 7.03M shares by MarketWatch, which is about 5.5% of the float. Even though it is low (which is good news fundamentally ya apes), this is a very illiquid stock with an average volume of 1.29M shares and 5.34 days to cover. So shorts covering quickly due to the market waking up to the potential should give a nice boost to the SP.
* **Market Cap:** Market Cap is $1.23bn.
* **Extremely Memeable:** Memeable? Idk, I really like how the ticker sounds.
* **Low Liquidity:** Average volume is just 1.29M shares ($9.38M), or 0.7% of market cap. Institutional ownership is high and sits at 75.74% which makes it even more illiquid.
* **Low IV:** IV is currently at 51.64%, with the IV Percentile at 10% and an IV rank of 4.46%. So the IV currently is nearly as low as it gets for $PLYA. I have seen that many of you regularly make generous recurring weekly donations to our favorite market maker Citadel by buying overpriced FDs with IV above 200%, so here is a chance to not do that.

I don't play with crayons, but $PLYA briefly dipped to the 100-day SMA last week with JPow tanking the market and the general drubbing of the recovery plays. Expecting this short term dip to be eaten up very quickly.

Also, I am just another tard and did not come up with the trade. I shamelessly copied most of the stuff from the amazing research done by Chris Camillo (The incredibly successful social arb trader in Jack Schwager’s Unknown Market Wizards.) and friends who specifically hunt for opportunities like this. This trade has gone under the radar so far, though I suspect it shall not remain so for long.

# Bear case:

The only bear case I can think of is another COVID surge which could potentially drive down demand, but the chances of that happening in the short term is small enough to neglect imo. Even then they are less likely to be affected compared to other hotel chains as they don't have any business locations.  


# TLDR:

People are flush with cash and the pent up demand for leisure is exploding. $PLYA is perfectly  positioned to take advantage of this with their amazing all-inclusive beach resorts and the market has failed to appreciate it so far. Technicals and fundamentals point to a good entry now.

# Positions:

Commons are safe, but I am allergic to commons and playing options only. 

* Jul: $7.5C - Betting on the market realizing that Playa is going to absolutely crush it this quarter and capture the pre earning run-up.
* Aug, Sep: $7.5C - Safer calls that expire post earnings.
* Sep:$10C - A tiny handful of lottos for dIvErSiFiCaTiOn.

A server platform company specialyzed in IA chose AMD for its next gen, in Taiwan. 

We already heard rumors today for another potential (indirect) client : V!VO for its smartphones, will use Samsung CPU based on AMD's RDNA2 (n°5 company on the smartphones market). 
We know it could be the same for Google, and potentially for small laptops. 

AMD keeps growing in different fields ! 
(Without mentioning the merger and the buyback stock program)

I look forward to see the earnings in the end of July"

\*i might or might not change your life, or atleast your account balance.

today i will be writing about alibaba stock ""BABA"" and exlplain my thesis regarding the underlying.

# intro:

Alibaba Group Holding Limited operates various segments including : core commerce, cloud, digital media, entertainment, payment services...

business which Alibaba group own: Taobao, TMALL, Freshipo, Lazada, Ali-express, Alibaba, ele,me, 1688, youku, alibaba-cloud, alimama, cainiao network, dingtalk, ant group, ali-pay

Alibaba group does business in almost every thing you can imagine, therfore you can compare them to every big tech you know, they stand with the big dogs.(AMZN, GOOG, AAPL, MSFT) but they get less attention at the moment.  i think the sentiment towards alibaba is bound to change, very soon.

**Why BABA ?, why now ?**

baba showed negative performance relative to the other tech stocks at the moment (market sentiment due to politics - alot of impact on the stock) . but baba strength can be seen in a few areas: revenue growth, solid financial position with reasonable debt and very reasonable and cheap valuation. the profit margins are lower when comparing to peers right now but baba business have much to grow and much to be expected to fix that issue.

Baba stock experienced little decline in most recent quarter in comparison to performance from same quarter a year before, but i think the next earning this year will reveal growth in EPS.

Now, lets start of with the basics and take a look on baba financial and valuation.

&#x200B;

# valuation:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/anm5scpa30771.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a6194d33f1165898de0cc04ce59c7e736bb9dbc

so looking at valuations:

Mkrt value:  573B

p/e: \~25x

Fp/e: \~21x

p/s: \~5.2x

p/b: \~3.9x -> very attractive at this rate !

eps(ttm): 8.48

eps(ntm): \~12

next e/r : Aug 19

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pkphleqb30771.png?width=226&format=png&auto=webp&s=102d445ee3ce2b7d931e42e4e62ea38ee0ae9d5e

At BABA current stock price of $211, the market is expecting revenue to grow at 48.8% for the next 1 years. Over this period, BABA is also expected to generate an average Economic Earnings Margin of 13.8%

Baba have increased theirlong term debt looking at their financials but due to increase in future revenue i believe it is nothing to be bothered by. debt is not an real issue to baba.

\*\*very important note is that comparing baba to other big techs valuations at the moment proves that baba is dirty cheap and can be a good short/long term play . even is market goes sideways i dont see baba going any lower than right now. 200 price is pretty strong ressitence and still a good price.

revenue growth: 47.96%

eps growth : 14.42%

i will be including a look into baba Assets and Liabilities, which i believe is showing us a healthy company which keep growing and expanding and inceasing their cashflow, revenue and shareholders equity.

## Liabilities:

## Assets:

**Profitability:**

Profitability in baba business is quite larger comparing to peers.

&#x200B;

# ANALyst reports:

most of the ANALysts recommend this stock. various price targets between 260\~350 price targets.

**and a few buying into: (including ark queen which i dont follow but nice to see)**

alot of big hedgies hold baba, you can check it out. (blackrock, goldman etc)

# Technicals:

52wk High: 319.32

52wk Low: 204.39

Avg volume (3M) : 15.8M -> breakout will increase volume obiously everybody watching the stock movement right now.

baba is down \~33% from the top at 319.32 (10/27/21).

I expect to see a bullish breakout in a couple days, can be happening anytime right now. good support at 209-210 level, every time we get there i can spot large money flowing into baba.

I believe that a price of 300$ before the year ends is possible and quite easy with a very little catalyst or sentiment change towards the company. right now from what im reviewing the sentiment towards baba is starting to chagne across the internet and financial market.

NIO is forming a good bullish movement for the next week based on previous movement data.

JPM is looking for a long bullish mode, the FED is going to raise interest rate sooner than 2023 predicted because fear of inflation. also it hit $148 3 moths resistance point.

PLTR is losing it's gains for the last 2 weeks after may 13th Long bull run. PLTR is nothing but a high customer Saas company which companies include only high profile government and government agencies. Because of their very narrow targeted audience and client base there is very little room to grow.

JMIA: I would look into JMIA into great interest. This is one of the top ecommerce site in Africa region, Many big companies are investing heavily in africa. I have a prediction amazon will also try to take over the Africa market, and soon JMIA will get an offer to for getting bought either by amazon or Alibaba for africa market dominance.

RIDE:

If u wanna short any company ride will be your #1. The CEO said fake numbers, new CEO also saying fake numbers. Doesn't have a product ready. They only formed a company only to lure investors and milking them. Lawsuits are piling.

MNMD: They are creating a new market. very new, but effective. Although it may take years to see a useable product. This is like the very early stage of NIO or TLRAY. FDA approval will boost to the moon.

&#x200B;

AMC: Amc might get boost until it hits $100 but will fall off rapidly. AMC is not like GME where there is good business. HULU, NETFLIX are making AMC business nonexistent. I would be very caution as a long term investor.

ZM: Zoom might be a winner in the pandemic but it will be fruitful for longterm short players. With Google meet's free software and people are coming back to the office, ZM's over value position will trubmle.  Their growth is already falling down

It reached this week more than 85$ (after Google announced it was working with AMD for Google's Cloud computing which was huge news), and went back to 82,6$ after a dip that hit both AMD and NVDA. 

Here is different articles I found that seem to show that this dip could be an opportunity before a rise : 

https://www.notebookcheck.net/Exynos-with-AMD-mRDNA-2-to-be-unveiled-in-July-peak-performance-better-than-next-gen-Mali-GPU-while-beating-latest-Mali-even-with-30-throttling-Google-signing-up-for-mRDNA-2-as-well.546822.0.html --> it has been public knowledge for sometime now that Samsung and AMD are working on a mobile GPU, but official announcement should be next month, AND, as mentionned in the article, Google could also use AMD's RDN2 tech for something in short term (Google Pixel?). Concerning Google, this is the third time that I see this rumor. 

https://www.thestreet.com/investing/amd-no-ec-objection-to-xilinx-merger --> for the moment the acquisition of Xilinx seems to go well 

https://www.neowin.net/news/amds-next-gen-rdna-3-performance-jump-rumored-to-be-absolutely-insane/ --> some good news about 2022's GPU 

I think next earning release is on 07/27/2021 ; we should see good things there. 

There are also the Xbox/PS5 that are a huge success and based on AMD's GPU ; Microsoft and Sony will keep buying tons of AMD's GPU (maybe more than expected originally).

It's my point of view but, to invest in mid-term, it looks good.

Original post:

Hello everyone,

I believe that $AMD is on the verge of experiencing a catalyst that will push the stock to a new ATH. As many of us know $AMD has been trading sideways and down for the past year (with some noise) since last October. I feel fairly certain that that is about to change.

Last October $AMD announced a merger with $XLNX. The two giant companies have been working it out since that time. Recently, both companies share holders overwhelmingly voted in favor of the merger.

To summarize what this merger means to $AMD we're talking about increased revenue, increased profit margin, better synergy and heading towards better products. The number 1 thing $AMD is going to get out of this? A better shot at taking down $INTC for the cloud market. A company with a market cap of roughly 225 billion compared to $AMD's 100 billion. So this is a David vs Goliath moment.

There's plenty of articles written out there on how this changes the financials and prospects for $AMD but I know you guys aren't going to read it if I re-write it here. To put it simply: This is a big deal. If you felt bad about missing $NVDA's stocksplit run, this is the potential chance of catching the 'next' big chip manf. movement.

So why am I writing this now instead of last October? Well, it's because things changed last week. We know who the customer is now: $GOOG.

That's right. A 1.67T company is tapping $AMD over intel to help support their cloud.

Proof: [https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/17/why-amd-stock-rallied-on-thursday/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm\_source=yahoo-host&utm\_medium=feed&utm\_campaign=article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/17/why-amd-stock-rallied-on-thursday/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article)

So we know they picked up $XLNX. Now we know they are teeing up for $GOOG. This is freaking huge. Not to mention they also acquired business from $TSLA, another 600B+ company.

Proof: [https://fortune.com/2021/05/31/amd-tesla-contract-chips-infotainment-system-lisa-su/](https://fortune.com/2021/05/31/amd-tesla-contract-chips-infotainment-system-lisa-su/)

So, let's list them out...

Catalysts:

1. $XLNX Merger
2. $TSLA contract
3. $GOOG partnership

This is clearly a big picture strategy on $AMD's part to push $INTC's weakening cloud business straight into the grave and take it's spot. I believe if $AMD is succcessful they will eventually reach a valuation closer to 200-300 billion dollars within the next 1-2 years. That's a 200-300$ share price.

So what am I suggesting?

&#x200B;

1. I believe that post merger the fair value of $AMD is closer to 120-160 a share
2. Without the merger $AMD has a value of about 120 a share(due to new contracts and overall market conditions. Just look at $NVDA's recent 50% run. Staying neck to neck as a competitor puts them at 120. But they have new business to justify it instead of black magic stock splits)

Is there TA to support this? You bet there is. I use 2D time frames to wash out noise. I made some small crayon circles to give the picture some scope. You can use a 1W time frame and the analysis is the same. The stock's slow moving averages have begun to move higher and are approaching a cross, moving the stock towards positive. In simple terms: Gaining share value on average, every 2 days. And that rate is growing. The OBV is increasing meaning that **someone** 'aka Wall Street' is secretly scooping up shares and holding onto them. They are doing all of this while keeping the stock suppressed well below it's ATH. I believe they are intentionally gathering as much as they can before the catalysts combine and create a giant bull run. This is a long term run that could make a lot of people rich. The moment when $AMD sprints after $INTC and $NVDA. We all know as gamers and redditors that $AMD has become much much stronger and better in recent years. It's been amazing to watch their progress.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Here on the 1 week you can see the faintest flicker of bullish life. This is due to the recent contract developments and the quickly approaching date of the merger. As I wrote above, **the catalyst is incoming**.

So. When is the merger? I am sure you want some dates and some juicy possible plays. Here you go...

We've got 3 approvals that have to happen.

1. EU - Believed to have no problems and will probably be approved end of June, end of July at the latest.
2. UK - July 6th Deadline. Also rumored to have 0 problems
3. CCP - This one there's no rumored date, but CCP supposedly has no issues as well.

Where can you verify these dates? I encourage you to google it. There is a SA article with them written down, but due to WSB rules I cannot post the link here. I highly suggest googling that data before you enter the trade.

What is Wall Street doing? They are both shorting the stock while sweeping July calls as well as 2 year leaps. Take a look at July:

&#x200B;

You've got 19498 calls purchased for July 16th at a 90$ strike. That sure sounds like Wall Street betting on it hitting 90$... after something happens. But we know what that is. It's the merger.

[Unusual Option Chain July 16th](https://preview.redd.it/s3ez29jl2q671.jpg?width=942&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae8892e1f6a9a53eef3d2dc7a56f57c5a60926be)

How is this unusual? Take a look at the week prior:

&#x200B;

[You could sum this up and it's barely even the volume for the 90$ strike on July 16th](https://preview.redd.it/53uatc9r2q671.jpg?width=944&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42bc7cd9650553fe2f3f34107f10c29c8a5e7ad6)

So how to interpret this? Well, I read this as Wall Street ***knowing*** what's about to happen. I believe they know the status of the merger, and approximately how far it's going to take the stock. I believe we're looking at $AMD pushing above 90$ by Mid July. This is a potential 10 bagger. Especially with them trying to push down $AMD's price today, now is a good opportunity to get in.

So what's the play? The easiest one is the 7/16/21 90$ strike. Go alongside wall Street and when you're happy with the profit--sell it. The merger could be announced any day so buying to at least that date is wise (IMO -- but I am just a degenerate not a financial expert).

Buying longer could potentially let you capture more of the run if things play out the way I think it will. You could also take advantage of the current low to grab leaps and sit back and watch how this story unfolds over the next 2 years. Either way, there's real potential here in something most people are considering dead in the water.

I am currently holding 119 contracts. A large portion are for the 7/16/21 90$. So yes, my money is on this play and continues to be what I pursue. This is my YOLO.

&#x200B;

My recommendations: Buy shares, Buy calls for mid july. Buy leaps. If you buy shares wait for the catalyst to occur. When it reaches an apex, start selling $CCs because the IV is going to grow.

As a disclaimer, I am not a financial expert. I am just a retail stock trader. I love to do TA as a hobby. I truly believe that $AMD is being suppressed as Wall Street 'fattens' their positions. You know what I say? Fuck 'em. They think they are hiding what they are doing but I definitely see it. They are preparing and we can too. And, if we're right, we can make more than them.

&#x200B;

Best of luck out there. I hope you enjoyed my DD. I don't post DD often on WSB, but I hope y'all enjoyed the read. You guys are great and I love you all.

As a disclaimer. I don't take responsibility for anyone's gains and losses. While I am in this and have put my own money on it, I do not promise 100% sure success. Only my own idea of what will happen.

My position screenshot is below. I do edit out my current value and cost basis. I hope you don't mind but I am a relatively private person. My positions are not for everyone. I change them dynamically depending on how the stock is moving between dates. Please do not use my own as a template for yours.

Update: the UK regulator issues approval on 6/29. I don't know how much farther the trade goes in the short term. This is my last update. Best of luck everyone. I still believe we head towards 120 over the long term."

Some have an **unusually high open call interest relative to float**. Not financial advice.

Gather 'round boys and girls! For those of you who don’t know, this Friday, the 25th, is when new stocks are added to the Russell 2000 (R2K). I was working with [u/FatAspirations](https://www.reddit.com/u/FatAspirations/) on his latest DD, and he needed to **analyze all of the stocks being added to the R2K**. His idea is to find the stocks market makers will need to buy after inclusion based on open interest, which would indicate stocks with a higher probability of seeing a gamma event after inclusion.

We converted that Russell 2000 PDF into a google spreadsheet and included the total call open interest and shares outstanding for every one of them. I've also added the total July open call interest for the ones with the highest open interest to shares outstanding. I used July since it's the next monthly OPEX after inclusion this Friday. Passive funds will typically start buying at **the end of the day / AHs Friday** to track the Russell 2000 per their fund allocations.

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1159Ctd07fKXgAOLeJMZ_xp-XZF5P-pckGHJA2XuNaDQ/edit?usp=sharing) is a spreadsheet with **all 255 new additions to the Russell 2000.** It is ordered by (Open Interest / Shares Outstanding) for those interested in doing DD or developing their own R2K plays. I’m sharing the spreadsheet to help anyone else looking into R2K plays.

&#x200B;

[Ordered by \(Call Open Interest \/ Shares Outstanding\)](https://preview.redd.it/obhuhndiap671.jpg?width=1298&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0112909f084e43bca2487005aa2f9cd48836f4a)

In summary, R2K inclusion should drive up stonk price, which will cause more calls to go ITM, which will create more forced buying as we approach July OPEX.

If you’re playing R2K inclusion, pay attention to call OI as a percentage of total shares outstanding, and in particular July as it’s the closest monthly expiration after the June 25th buy-in date.! Some have an unusually high call open interest.. (Not financial advice!)

**What is SOFI?**

 SoFi provides a suite of financial products that include student loan refinancing, mortgages, personal loans, credit cards, investing, and banking. Not to mention they have their own brokerage platform, with options trading coming soon. And they also have great fucking customer service to keep people coming back time and time again.

**Why is $SOFI being so heavily shorted?**

$SOFI going public through a SPAC deal already made it heavily shorted based on a crackdown by the SEC. With a short volume ratio of 25.32%, it is one of the most shorted stocks on the market right now meaning you can get a great discount.

**Galileo.**

Galileo a company SOFI purchased for $1.2 billion is a payment processor with customers like Robinhood, Chime, Monzo, Revolut, Varo, and TransferWise. Google Cloud executive Derek White is joining the board as CEO with more than 20 years of experience in financial services replacing Clay Wilkes. Galileo in recent news just signed a deal with Verizon to provide a teen card. In a field, with companies like Stripe it's doing quite well with revenue increasing 97% first half of 2020, and their new launch Galileo Instant saw more than 1500 small businesses signup within the first six months.

**Stripe.** 

Stripe has had an amazing year and things are only getting better. Sofi after buying Golden Pacific Bancorp will expedite its process to a bank charter allowing it to take deposits and allowing it to offer lower interest rates on loans. Analyst Sean Horgan said that SoFi possesses ""a powerful cost advantage over incumbents which will lead to dramatic disintermediation over the next 5-10 years, leaving substantial primary bank accounts, revenues, and market value up for grabs."" Not to mention that Rosenblatt gave it a $30 price target for you retards that's $8 a share in gains from current prices. And with SOFI stadium being a new staple in LA it's bound to boost sales, and forgot to mention that Cramer likes the stock and their brokerage directly competes with Robinhood. The stock is very much reminiscent of SQ in its earlier days. Currently, they do $547 million in revenue with member growth in the most recent quarter topping 110%, and with an estimated $2.4 billion in gross proceeds from their merger, they have all the funding they need.

**TLDR**

Cramer likes the stock so you should too. Referring to it as the trifecta of fintech as Square, PayPal, and SoFi.

EDIT: Just in, Cramer hates this stock."

Here's an example of one of the fake media outlets saying ford dropped qnx [ford drops qnx](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ford-sync-google-android-blackberry-qnx-infotainment/)

**The truth is.....NO, Ford did NOTTT drop blackberry QNX!!!!! they switched to QNX Hypervisor**

Each car has 100 Electrical Control Unit (ECU) performing all the smart functions from automatic brake to rear view camera to seat belt checks to acceleration to lane change etc....blah blah blah. **ONE  of hundred ECU runs the infotainment of the car**. The infotainment is the unit used to change your music radio etc...THE NON CRITICAL AND SAFETY FUNCTION OF THE CAR. SO IF INFOTAINMENT CRAPS OUT WHILE DRIVING NO ONE WILL GET HURT OR DIE. Ford essentially is dropping blackberry QNX to go with google android. BUT, remember car companies are consolidating ECU to reduce number of chips they need, so FORD instead is using Blackberry QNX Hypervisor on the chip and running android on top. The hypervisor runs the infotainment(fm/am radio etc) and the instrument cluster(speed gauge....critical stuff). 

Blackberry QNX Hypervisor ([here](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-hypervisor)) lets you run non-critical (google android) and critical (qnx for cluster) on the SAME CHIP!!! 

Essentially Ford is paying more to use Blackberry Hypervisor. They chose this route becuase they don't want to continue developing the infotainment portion in-house due to cost. they're out sourcing it to google...this is a non-critical function inside the car that no one care if it fails. For everything else inside the car QNX is used extensively because it's the only ASIL-D certified software. 

&#x200B;

Google and Blackberry are working together for this infotainment portion. If you read this article it specifically refers to Hypervisor. Basically android will be running on BB QNX Hypervisor!!! You can't run cars on android!!! Every piece of critical ECU inside the car including the modem that connect to the internet is running Blackberry QNX.

**COMPANY OVERVIEW**

**Canoo (NASDAQ:GOEV)** is a $2.4bn market capitalization Los Angeles-based EV subscription start-up which intends to manufacture electric vehicles. The company was co-founded by ex-Faraday Future employee Stefan Krause, who stepped away as CEO in August for [personal reasons](https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/16/20807575/canoo-ceo-leave-temporary-stefan-krause-startup-ev-designs-car-subscription). Mr. Tony Aquila has since taken over as CEO. The primary goal of Canoo’s vehicles is autonomous operation.

[Westworld would be proud](https://preview.redd.it/fj4q9zbby1671.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=531723e556928c68f932cc50a44806bb67679e84)

**SHARE LOCK-UP EXPIRATION**

**On Monday (6/21), insiders will be able to sell 116.2mm shares** in the open market. This lock-up represents **117% of the company’s current float** (99mm share float). Given the significant issues the company faces (incl. the pending SEC investigation), it is **very likely insiders will head for the exits**.

Insiders such as **Chinese-based Pak Tam Li (79.5mm shares)** and **Remarkable Views (39.8mm shares)** will be able to sell their shares in the open market. The management team, including **CEO Tony Aquila (12.4mm)** will also be able to sell. **The 50-day average volume is 4.7mm shares (\~$48mm ADV at current prices), which will make it difficult for the share price to absorb significant insider selling**.

**PENDING SEC INVESTIGATION**

**POTENTIAL RUSSELL 3000 INDEX INCLUSION**

$GOEV could be added to the Russell 3000 next Friday (6/25). The list is preliminary and there is no guarantee it will be added, but could represent forced index buying. **Short sellers will likely cover next week ahead of Russell 3000 inclusion, so degenerates could look to buy the dip next week.**

**TLDR;**

**Insider selling on Monday (6/21) represents significant potential downside risk**. **Strongly recommend buying puts today (expiring on 6/25 @ $10 strike price) or waiting until next week to buy shares (ahead of Russell 3000 inclusion).**

**DISCLAIMER**

No position, but may initiate one today (puts) or next week (buy stock on dip ahead of index inclusion).

**Buy to open** 6/18 SPY 420c at the bottom of the day for 1.2. This contract eventually reached +100% intraday, but youre outta day trades. Obviously selling for 2.4 is ideal, but it cant happen. The alternative?

**Sell to open** 6/18 SPY 421c for 1.6. This move puts your initial investment back into your pocket with an additional 40 dollars. But what about the overall position?

Youre now holding a vertical call spread or what I have self dubbed **ghetto spreads**. Typically a vertical call spread is when both calls are opened at the same time and are referred to as a debit spread when you pay upfront for the position and a credit spread when you get paid upfront. Your current position in this example would be a debit spread, BUT you made 40 dollars by opening the position at different times. Because you took the risk of having naked contracts and the underlying went in your favor, youre now enabled to make plays like mentioned above. Ghetto spreads are a way of capping your risk (loss) however it also caps your gains.

Max Gain

Should SPY remain above 421 on expiry, you can close out both calls for an additional profit of 100 dollars. Meaning your overall gain was 140 bucks on 120 (or 116%).

Max Loss

Should both calls expire worthless, you still made 40 bucks on 120 (or +33%).

&#x200B;

How is this not a daytrade? Because youre opening two different positions. You can close them later, but in this example you at least capped your max Loss to still be a gain.

&#x200B;

This is probably a great idea for a Youtube video, but I dont have the will or resources to do so. Any broker where you are enabled to create spreads should allow the strategy mentioned above. **You must have spreads enabled on your account.**

At present, the traditional way to access credit takes into account several factors, when determining whenever the credit will be released or not.  


These criteria are generally very inefficient for many borrower’s cause it fails into determining the true risk of borrowing and likelyhood of defaulting. 

In reality there is a lot of room for improving the way banks to determine the true risk level of a borrowers, and here’s exactly when Upstart kicks in.

They are aiming to disrupt the industry by giving banks better and more reliable data to determine the true borrower’s risk, so to increase and extend people’s access to credit.

**Upstart** platform is AI-powered and helps to connect consumers with banks, using nearly 15 billion cells of data to determine the true risk of a borrower.

Such a company couldn’t be founded by average guys also. David Girouard and Anna Counselman are both former Google executives. Paul Gu, Upstart’s third co-founder and a visionary for some of the company predictive models, also has a comprehensive background in risk analysis.

They are all still involved in the company owning around 17% stake in Upstart.

Now here are some facts:

* *Upstart has enojyed great growth in 2020*
* *Revenue have increased 42% YoY*
* *300.000+ loans originated from the platform*
* *Upstart has become PROFITABLE in 2020 reporting income of $6 million, over a net loss of 0.5$ the year prior*

Nevertheless, **Upstart has a huge room to grow**, since it is estimated that it makes less than 5% of the 92 billion U.S. Market for unsecured personal loans.

Now what happens? It is also currently one of the most shorted stock on the Nasdaq. **Short interest is around 12,6% of Upstart’s float**, and shorts are down 586$ million YTD already in mark-to-market losses.  
 

**The stock is not only on track for a short squeeze**, but the great thing is, it is actually a great profitable company.  


Ofc all the above are my personal opinion, however I like the stock."

The following is not financial advice.  I just love Daddy Karp, Daddy Thiel, and the PLTR Stock.

We all know **Daddy Karp.**  This is him forcing his employees to engage in combat dancing or some shit...right, lets carry on.

[Daddy Alex Karp is a character, PERFECT for the memes.](https://preview.redd.it/agr1i21kjq571.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7bf213a80de565ca37a90823e90e60d97c61e95b)

**So why does this matter?**  Because Daddy Karp is a founder and one of two influencial arms of Plantir.  He is the negotiator for one side of american politics.

This matters because PLTR relies on large govt. contracts and MUST maintain a neutral political position.

It's other founder is Peter Thiel, or **Daddy Thiel.**  You might say he is a powerful man, and he handles the other side of american politics.

[Thiel is an extremely influential and powerful billionaire contrarian known for playing 3D chess and looking decades out...PLTR is his baby.](https://preview.redd.it/knpdewpcht571.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e83e232d334be4533531385d1ed5fe15e8297495)

&#x200B;

**Why does the govt. buy their software?**

Their software can take unbelievable amounts of video data, and give predictions on where enemies might attack, and various other events on a battlefield like it's a videogame.  The **CIA** helped them create their technology, and **SOCOM** just renewed a $300M a year contract with them.  These orgs. don't buy anything that doesn't work.

&#x200B;

[This shit looks like it's out of the movies, or a real time strategy game.  It works and it forms the backbone of US military operations.  It also transfers very well to the enterprise software space...](https://preview.redd.it/a3kgc5j2pq571.jpg?width=1555&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9680a8142d5345a5b694a4467cb2af3387e20f4)

This is just one use case; their engineers have been refining this tech for 17 years where they could create a secret moat.  In-fact, Peter Thiel himself has a book and has given speeches on the power of moats and ""not competing, but forming a monopoly.""  Zero to One.

**So why all this info?  It's critical to understand the facts I am about to present to you.**

With a ton of hype, and plenty of meme power, PLTR rose to past $40 a share earlier this year.

Most if not all did not truly understand how special the technology was, and it fell on FUD surrounding stock based compensation and Daddy Karp selling shares.  We will get to this FUD at the end.

W**hy it's special:**

**MOAT:  I see people say, ""it's just data analytics, anyone can compete with them."" no.**

This is like people saying, ""it's just an airplane copy it and it should fly great.""  An analytics platform that is able to ""gameify"" real world problems in real time and present solutions using integrated Ai/ML is a MASSIVE engineering problem.  Think, a ton of PHD level skilled engineers making the highest salaries in Tech.  So much, that they can retire after a few years if they want.  Now imagine them working for 17 years on something before any other company even thinks to start competing.  This is a bigger moat than many darlings of the tech world have in their software, such as TSLA, which had google, apple, etc. working on competing solutions for years.  And it has saved it's clients MILLIONS in Skywise.  For anyone in the software space; you know how brutal implementation is for SAP and similar platforms.  Often it's unsuccessful and expensive.  PLTR is already demonstrating PROFITABLE implementations.  This is a sign of a massive moat for anyone who understands the enterprise software world.

[This is just a summary of one application of PLTR's Skywise platform; built on Foundry.  They are going to do this to every industry; true prescriptive analytics with rapid deployment of a custom solution.  If you understand that, it's insane.  If you don't, ask a friend that is intelligent and knows about software.](https://preview.redd.it/eg2qwmim1r571.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=26b9bdc63c34c5ad1b0fab1bfafe473444e34ee6)

**Earnings Expectations:  They are Sandbagging Sons of Bitches**

Right now we are pricing Palantir at about 40X revenue as a SAAS company.  Their margins aren't the best as they continue to invest and maintain future monopoly status, but they are landing $300M govt. deals (SOCOM) and expanding that business which is EXTREMELY STICKY.

Their revenue growth officially is about 30% per year.

However, as all SAAS companies do, internally they have a goal/target of around 50% per year.  That is absolutely achievable, in fact a few large deals can accomplish this, AND MUCH MORE.  I would argue this in itself is sandbagging due to the potential size of their enterprise deals (just ONE big deal would annihilate that number) and they have been offering their product for literally less than a year now...

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[With two Daddy's like this, what could go wrong?  Why is PLTR hated by the media?](https://preview.redd.it/wuid619x4r571.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=998b2feb59674afacc6dad5b7217cbde56e98e0c)

**FUD:  What could go wrong, why has the stock dropped after it's meteoric rise?**

&#x200B;

1. **It's custom software! That's expensive, time consuming, hard to scale!  Companies won't buy it.**

SAP is horrible and it's implemented all the time, takes years to implement, costs HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS to implement, and is often not successful.  It's actually a running joke in the enterprise software world.  Palantir has a history of successful implementations (it's custom but designed so low-code it can be developed and delivered quickly in any enterprise), a testament to the 17 years that Karp and Thiel spent training their team in high gravity (lul).  **This is like a SMART salesforce, which by the way, was the fastest growing software company IN HISTORY and is worth $400B now, and it has competition in the CRM space.  PLTR is the next evolution, and has ZERO competition.**

Salesforce was created to be a single source of truth in an enterprise.  Pltr takes that a step further by allowing you to simply plug in business units and allow it to act as your “sky net” and tell you what to do.  It literally is that incredible.  It’s true mass available prescriptive analytics, sprinkled across an entire company.

**Is it unreasonable to think the mkt cap of pltr could be a multiple of salesforce in the near future when it is the next evolution of data platforms, has no competition, and salesforce previously held the record for fastest growing software company in history?**

&#x200B;

**2.   Daddy Karp made the most of any CEO this year and he sold hundreds of millions of shares!**

The way he is paid, his Stock granted is income.  So he pays TAXES on it.  That means he has to sell shares just to cover the taxes so he doesn't go to federal prison.  The dude can't pay it any other way he doesn't have hundreds of millions of dollars laying around...he's spent 17 years building this as his baby.  This is all stupid media FUD because it makes awesome headlines and scares the shit out of boomers that aren't used to the financing around an insanely fast growing software company.  The numbers look crazy on the surface but make sense once you realize it's all because of the meteoric rise in the stock price.

**3.  They are compensating their employees with Stock! It Dilutes us!**

They are hiring the worlds best software engineer PHD Data Scientists to make sure their moat and monopoly doesn't even come close to being encroached on.  These people are expensive.  They continually train their models in their client's environments, without keeping their clients data, only evolving their own model.  This maintains privacy and creates momentum for their algorithm that makes it impossible to catch up to PLTR's Foundry.  Think google with their threatgraph for search.  They have too much data and too much time refining their algorithms for anyone to catch them in that category.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Price Targets:**

&#x200B;

[Holy Fucking Shit, look at that Q1 rev. growth despite being brand new to enterprise...](https://preview.redd.it/rkgyuszcuq571.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=14ea1be3ff5dbdbadd731a7ae8a69d94fcabe713)

If they grow at the internal, non-sandbagged rate they think they will hit **according to internal docs shared with public (google Q4 2020 PLTR business update, can't link).**

They will have $4B in revenue, in 4 years.  Imagine in 4 years, if a SAAS company was priced at just 10x Revenue with 50% + growth yoy....which will accelerate as proof of concept is demonstrated at large orgs.

**My price target is $80 EOY** because I believe at least one HUGE contract will roll in that will provide further proof of FOUNDRY as a concept and the impact will be undeniable.  Companies will be lining up to get Foundry and projected demand will show implied growth off the charts that no one has accounted for.  The Skywise project finalized my opinion on this, PLTR told them WHEN VALVES IN ENGINES WERE BEHAVING ODDLY AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED PRIOR TO FAILURE, OPTIMALLY, TO SAVE MILLIONS A YEAR PER AIRLINE IN SCHEDULING AND OTHER COSTS you can read about that on another subreddit, the info is out there if you do a google search on skywise.

**Price target in 4 years: $500.**  Because I think revenue growth will be more like salesforce was as a necessary platform to enterprises.  This would give it a larger MKT cap than Salesforce.  **If this becomes a hyped meme to add fueld to the fire, it will accelerate beyond what we can even comprehend, TESLA style.  Just the US GOVT. alone will be TRILLIONS of dollars potentially as they are investing trillions in Ai software solutions over the next 20 years.**   [Forbes GSA Article 2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2020/08/16/how-the-us-government-is-using-ai-to-help-procure-trillions-of-dollars-of-products-and-services-an-interview-with-keith-nakasone-gsa/?sh=22a1193670ac)  [2021 Article about AI spending push..$Trillions with PLTR as the clear leader](https://www.nextgov.com/cio-briefing/2021/04/biden-budget-requests-major-investments-federal-technology-and-cybersecurity/173262/)

**if this happens....then.....**

**Possible Price Target with hype and diamond hands TSLA style = $1000** when everyone figures out this Stock is literally magic because it will be bigger than google.  It's data analytics and threat-graph will be more useful to smart money and BIG money than google and it will rule the world.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Conclusion:** Both Daddy's have spent 17 years using the most advanced govt. resources (U.S. DOD spends the most on R&D of any industry or company in the world...by FAR) to craft a secret Ai/ML platform that allows companies and Govts. to play Starcraft in real-life, with WALLHACKS on that tell them what their opponent is going to do, and what they need to do to stay competitive.  They released  at the perfect time by going public when it was ready to scale and unable to be dethroned.

**This software will be mandatory for most large companies just to be competitive.**

**My positions:** 25x 40C 366 DTE, 762 shares at $24.57.  This is my entire account, i've seen enough to be 100% sure I don't need to day or swing trade anymore.  That $11k avail is just margin, i'm out of cash, this is how it displays in the TDA-TOS app.  I'm all in on this.  I actually want more leaps but I only have $26 dollars left in cash so I will buy 1 more share.

&#x200B;

[Based on my positions and an addiction to optionsprofitcalculator.com, I will make millions if the $500 thesis comes true in the next year.  in fact, at this thesis approx. 25 leaps worth $6k right now would make someone a millionaire.

Here’s what I found out: 

1.) They launched some cute colorful non-smart 4G phones and India is excited. 

https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/news/nokia-110-4g-nokia-105-4g-feature-phones-launched-prices-start-at-around-rs-3-100/ar-AAL5ryi

2.) Said phones are considered super affordable in Europe, and Europe is down for it.

https://www.phonearena.com/news/nokia-105-nokia-110-official_id132878

3.) Georgia has contracted with Nokia to update their infrastructure from 4G to 5G. And they have a bunch of contracts with private entities to do the same.

https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/06/15/Leon-selects-nokia-for-core-network-modernization-in-georgia/

4.) They’re now cash flow positive and this dude did math and says that they should be able to start paying out dividends of 31.5 cents/share. His fancy numbers also say this brings fair value to $6.63/share (why he wouldn’t round to a good sensible 6.66, idk).

TL;DR:

Nokia is low priced + stable + quietly building the freeways of 5G in several pockets of the world = good long term hold with high chance of tendies.

Let me remind you of some of the serious DD I did for WEN back in the day.

McDonalds. Wendys. They're basically the same thing right? Right.

Product? Check. Market Cap? Not checked. They don't have the same market cap. Why's that? I don't know. Let's look at their revenue numbers. 

&#x200B;

Mcdonalds Revenue according to google: 21,000,000,000.

Wendys Revenue according to google: 1,400,000,000.

&#x200B;

That means in ape land, Mcdonalds should be exactly 15 times larger than wendys.

How much larger than wendys is it actually?

175.43B/6.25B = 28.

&#x200B;

McDonalds is 28 times larger than Wendys, when in ape land, it should be only 15 times larger. Ridiculous.

&#x200B;

What does this mean for Wendy's?

It means the stock price at a fair ape value should be a minimum, 28/15 times larger than it is now.

That's 1.86 times larger.

&#x200B;

Quantified?

Wendy's stock price has a fair ape value of $44.38.

Although that is the fair ape value, I have a price target of $75. It's a smaller cap stock, it should grow faster than McDonalds, and should return more to investors relative to capital thrown in.

&#x200B;

This is not a joke. This is also not financial advice. Tendies are not a joke. Do not underestimate the power of Wendy Thomas. Yes, the girl's name is Wendy. No, don't look up a photo of her.

Hey retards, I’ve decided to take a break from posting memes and offer a rebuttal to the Hindenburg’s recent [fud article they](https://hindenburgresearch.com/draftkings/) wrote about [DKNG.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/njaa8g/why_im_large_and_in_charge_for_dick_kings_dkng/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) Before I begin, here’s my track [record](https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:TheHappyItalianMan).

In this post, I will discuss the following: what is Hidenburg Research, who is their CEO, Nathan dick-fuck Anderson, then I'll breakdown the Hidenburg Fud article about DKNG. Their evaluation of DKNG. The connection between DKNG, SBTech and the illegal sportsbook market. Lastly, why Hidenburg wrote this article. And of course- there’s a tl;dr at the bottom. Let’s fucking go nerds.

**What is Hindenburg Research?**

[bad guys](https://preview.redd.it/wx1bmg7btm571.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=33535dfd0e18c69fcf831e66a805ca19720a0d03)

Hindenburg Research does exactly what a lot of us do here, they construct DD's and release them onto the public hoping that others will join in on their idea and together make a lot of money. As of lately they've been kind of right, ex: Nikola (was trash we all knew it), Kandi (again trash), Lordstrom Motors (debatable), Clover too (but this one was a flop). Anyway, so HR (Hindenburg Research) looks for heavily  invested-retail stocks, with heavy-bull $$$$, they enter these massive short positions and then they construct these intricate DDs called ""investigations"" on why you should short with them, then the next day, the stock will drill, HR will take profits and the stock either flops or goes back to business in a few months. The big difference maker between our DDs and their DDs is they have fucking money to distribute their idea. I think they were right about the previous companies, but they're definitely stretching with DKNG.

**Who is Nathan Anderson?**

https://preview.redd.it/r9ocr51dtm571.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=76e824801019de73c2cf2ac9738afdb248d24a0f

Nathan Anderson is an absolute crook.- the CEO of Hindenburg. This guy literally think's he's God's gift, check out his [twitter](https://twitter.com/ClarityToast?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).

EX:

You can check out his [twitter](https://twitter.com/ClarityToast?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) for your own eyes, but this guy is an absolute dick-wad and he really think's he is better than everyone on WSB/retail bros, just because he's had three successful trades, but I think he turned on the wrong stock with DKNG. So we've established that he's a dick head, but what else about him?  He's also been investigated for pump and dump cases before.

[Court Filing Link Here](https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=qgikmggDYAJeNVM1Gkl1UQ==)

Sounds pretty similar to DKNG, doesn't it? Making up information for their own financial gain. You can read more about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/a38lsw/hindenburg_research_listed_in_pump_and_dump_court/). Essentially, Anderson was releasing fake sources and articles through an alias of a company that was linked to [HR.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SOSLimited/comments/lthtry/i_did_investigation_for_hindenburg_report_issuers/) Promoting their idea and trying to profit off false information.

[He's currently being Investigated by the SEC? - Source](https://www.reddit.com/user/Next_Parfait_1885/comments/nuzu66/nate_anderson_of_hindenburg_being_investigated_by/)

Not sure how accurate this is, but supposedly, he's currently being investigated by the SEC for Misconduct. I guess their website keeps getting taken down by the SEC for investigation. To conclude, Nathan Anderson, is an absolute corporate, pump and dump, shill artist. He doesn't like WSB as you can tell from his tweets and he thinks he's God's gift to drop and article and just instantly make money, regardless of whether it's valid or not. Fuck that Dickhead. This guy, his tweets, his actions should be enough alone to fight against this guy and any company he shorts.

**THE ARTICLE**

The article is absolute trash, if you haven't seen it yet- [here it is](https://hindenburgresearch.com/draftkings/).

There's basically two key arguments. The first, DraftKings is tied to illegal revenue streams (poor sources). Second, DraftKings is overvalued (with some weak fundamentals) So I will be discussing these two arguments and talking about why they're dead ass wrong and/or just plain don't matter.

Before we go in, please watch this CNBC segment from yesterday morning. They explain it very well. TL;DR, SBtech has little to no value for DKNG.  [https://streamable.com/ng95ed](https://streamable.com/ng95ed)

**SBTECH - ""the illegal revenue stream""**

SbTech may or may not have been involved in some shady business altercation back in 2014-2017. You can be the judge of that, but I can assure you that as of the DKNG acquisition, they are most likely clean.

What is [SBTech?](https://www.sbtech.com/)

Essentially, SBTech creates the platforms for sportbooks. They are the data analytics. They don't own psychical sportsbooks, rather they create the software for websites to lease out and use for their own branding. HR believe's that SBTech has been leasing their software to illegal sportsbooks in Asian via  a pseudo company, BTI company (kind of ironic right, the man who used pseudo accounts to spew false information- is now accusing another company of using a pseudo name), all because of their locality (their offices are close - they offer a picture of google maps to show this lmao??), they have similar source code (they literally went into google chrome and inspected their website code, you can find similar script comparing source code for ANY website) and their CEO (BTI Company) is friends with the founder of SBTech (people who are in similar business tend to work together). But the factor of the matter is, a quick google search from [Bit Core Tech](http://bitcoretech.com/), and SBTech can tell you that the two companies are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. Lastly, they use hypothetical sources, stating that they talked to prior employees of SBTech, saying everything they do is illegal, are you actually going to trust a Hedgie who's manipulated information before, I Know I'm not. Regardless, does it even matter?

What's kind of crazy, is that they (SBTech) have an exclusive deal with the state of Oregon, yet HR thinks that their research team is able to do a better investigation than the state of Oregon, and the Department of Justice.  Not only that, the laws associated with establishing a mobile sports gambling license are insane, to think that state and federal investigations weren't able to find any illegal activity is down right laughable.

They estimate that roughly half of SBTech's 2020 revenue came from unregulated markets, and about 10% of DKNG's B2B revenue comes from SBTech, so what does that mean? That mean's they're creating fud, this is funny, just wait. Let's say that hypothetically speaking they're right, and DKNG is committing to fraudulent revenue streams, how does this affect their current revenue?

[B2B revenue = $31,429,000 \(SBTech accounts for 10&#37;\) = $3,142,900 total revenue to DKNG](https://preview.redd.it/6hm3rhjbvm571.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=b96263e1539518c0aaa7d08178051e52989815b2)

Yeah, so worst case scenario, HR is right and DKNG has to remove SbTech from their revenue, damn. Looks like they lost a whopping \~1% of their current revenue stream. Not a massive hit considering they only have access to 25% of the current U.S. Population.

[Bullet point 2 - 25&#37; of U.S. Population](https://preview.redd.it/fzn2q88fvm571.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=2513a920a090df8dc4f21da061fb65b5be5dbbc9)

Another big point for HR was that insiders were selling. Who the fuck cares- when has insider selling ever been a clear bearish since, news flash , it hasn't. You don't even know what they're doing with that money. They could be investing BACK into the company for all well know. Plus, this back tests back to JUNE of 2020, literally a few months after they dropped the SPAC. Who knows if any of these sales are due to SPAC merger. What's way more important is institutional purchases

**Closing Statement - Who are you going to trust, a DKNG Investor, User, and Lover, me (and Queen Cathie Woods) or Nathan Anderson the CEO of Hindenburg Research, your corporate crook on steroids, he brags about being better than you're average retail investor/wsb'r on his private twitter, he's been charged in a previous pump and dump scheme for spreading false information under a pseudo name and he may or may not be currently under the investigation by the SEC. His current allegation against DKNG is just another one of his pump and dump's off fake news. DKNG is undervalued, his false accusations of illegal revenue are irrelevant, SBTech only accounts for 1% of DKNG's** ***current*** **total revenue. In the expanding sports-gambling market, their B2B sales will be completely irrelevant as their Sportbook Sales Revenue will \~10x in the next few years as more states legalize sports gambling and DKNG is able to reach the remaining 75% of the U.S. population. Don't listen to the hedgies. Goodluck out there.**

&nbsp;

#Listen up dipshits and sell the lumber from your grandmas porch to get some free cash.

&nbsp;

#ASTS is a satellite company which allows 5G internet/cell phone connectivity anywhere in the world **through your existing cell phone**. In short, ASTS represents an attractive asymmetric bet in the following ways:

* [**Space Launch Market Competition:** It seems every week there is a new article about how cheap launches are becoming due to increased competition. SpaceX, Blue Origin, \(among others\) have brought space into the mainstream and are allowing for repeatable launches. Billionaires are throwing away cash just to win some twitter space race. The question here is; who actually stands to gain from cheaper launches? The International Space Stations 10 Astronauts trying to satisfy their coke addiction and a satellite company like ASTS.](https://i.imgur.com/8QqoIDQ.jpeg) 


* **Customer Acquisition:** ASTS works with existing telecom providers and does not need to acquire customers, pay for marketing, or gain approval for spectrum usage. By signing with existing telcos, all ASTS needs to do is launch a (patent protected) satellite and collect a check.

* **5G Fund:** $9 Billion in government funds are in play for rural 5G expansion. AT&T is working with ASTS to gain access to this money. Microsoft believes ~157m Americans do not have access to broadband internet. ASTS solves this.

* **Sold off:** ASTS has been wrapped up in a space market correction without participants understanding the value this company adds. At current levels “you” are buying in below investors like Vodafone and Rakuten who have all vetted this company and have a vested interest in the company's success. American Tower is invested and is essentially hedging their business against the success of ASTS removing the need for Cell Phone towers. *Take a second to look at their chart (and thereby the proliferation of cell towers) and think of Satellites replacing their entire business structure.*

&nbsp;

**What makes ASTS Different:**

[A comparison chart.](https://i.imgur.com/3jzbOoB.png)

[Something with less words for the High Schoolers who forgot their Ritalin today.](https://i.imgur.com/01RnI87.png)

&nbsp;

Iridium currently sits at a $5B market cap and allows for cell phone calls to be completed via satellite. This company serves maritime and oversees applications, charges customers by the minute (think cell phones circa 1999 or Roblucks(?) if you're the same high schooler) and requires a separate bulky headset. This is the difference maker for $ASTS, anyones existing smart phone can connect to their satellite as they rely on a larger high powered satellite vs IRDM which has a smaller satellite and relies on the headset to make up the difference. This same principle can be transferred to Starlink which has smaller satellite arrays and relies on a dish to connect.

&nbsp;

The average AST SpaceMobile satellite signal is powerful enough to penetrate two walls inside a building, the fuselage of an airplane, or the interior of a car or train. No direct line of sight is needed and the service is similar to that provided by a tower two to five kilometers away from a handset. The satellite architecture is completely different from that used in other systems. With each satellite providing coverage to a large area approximately 2,800km in diameter, a much smaller number of satellites are required to achieve global coverage compared to other systems and the constellation will be capable of supporting 5G speeds as defined by the FCC.

&nbsp;

AST SpaceMobile recently participated in the public comment period regarding the 5G Fund for Rural America. In October, the FCC formally moved to allow mobile-satellite providers that meet specified performance standards and other requirements to apply to participate with its partners in the 5G Fund auction as a 5G broadband provider. The 5G Fund will distribute up to $9 billion for 5G wireless broadband connectivity in rural America to close the digital divide.

&nbsp;


The first phase deployment of 20 satellites is expected in the second half of 2022 with coverage to 49 equatorial countries in 2023. ASTS plans to achieve full global mobile coverage with 110 satellites by the end of 2023 or early in 2024 with a total of 168 satellites by the end of 2024. Commercial service expected to be offered beginning in 2023 across 49 equatorial countries.
If ASTS proves to be successful IRDM would be an easy short ala long GOOG short YHOO.

&nbsp;

**What moat exists:**



[With 836 patent claims and growing](https://i.imgur.com/iTXb4VW.png), the company believes it has a five to seven-year first-mover advantage over competitors. A steep barrier to entry exists in the satellite space which these patents protect. ASTS CEO Abel Avellan has proven another satellite company Emerging Markets Communications which sold to Global Eagle for $550m. 

&nbsp;


Customers have already been established with ASTS. SpaceMobile service will be initially offered to 1.3 billion users. Vodafone has a 50/50 revenue share agreement covering its markets. Millicom, LiLAC, TEF, AT&T (including Mexico) and TEO, among others, already have a memorandum of understanding with ASTS. All of these companies have done their own DD on the technology and have signed off on it. This isn’t a question of if it will work, but when. AT&T has signed on for the exclusive rights in the US. They think of this as a potential difference maker in carrier choice going forward *(think iPhone exclusivity that existed previously).*

&nbsp;



**What need is there:**

Management estimates that 90% of the planet's surface isn't reached by wireless networks. About 5.2 billion people move in and out of coverage as terrestrial towers frequently fail to reach distant areas. There are 3.3 billion people without wireless data connectivity and another 0.7 billion with no cellular coverage whatsoever.

&nbsp;

In middle America broadband speeds are lacking as is cellular connectivity. This is why the government is looking to make advances in 5G quickly. Microsoft believes ~157m Americans do not have access to broadband internet.

&nbsp;


**Addressable Market and Costs:**

Cost of the service estimates for final users living in emerging markets could be as low as $2.06/month. Currently, carriers spend 80% of their capex serving 20% of their traffic in remote areas. ASTS could significantly reduce the amount of capex needed to serve unconnected areas.

&nbsp;


The development efforts to date and the equatorial project should cost $510M and the global constellation a further $1.3B of additional capex. ASTS projects to generate revenues in 2023 and become cash flow positive by 2024.

&nbsp;

With as little as 9 million users in emerging markets SpaceMobile expects to generate $181M in revenues and $130M in EBITDA by 2023E. Once phases 2 and 3 are completed, revenues and EBITDA would shoot up to $1.07B and $1.0B in 2024. At this point the company would generate enough cash flow to pay for its future expansion.

&nbsp;


**This doesn't fit anywhere:**

The Barclays Managing Director who did the due diligence for ASTS merge, Scott Wisniewski, left his job to joins ASTS as their Chief Strategy Officer. This mans job was doing DD on space companies and he left for $ASTS options.


&nbsp;


**Potential Catalysts:**

Research Coverage Initiated: As of now no price targets have been set for ASTS. Research coverage being initiated could result in a positive reaction for the stock. This was what set SPCE on a run (which this sub participated in) in January 2020.


Blue Walker 3: As of now the proof of concept launch used a satellite on the ground connecting to a phone in space. Q4 of this year will be the launch of their test satellite. A successful launch and test would mean the business will be able to go through Phase 1 and become cash flow positive. Someone much smarter than me will tell you what that is worth in terms of stock price. 

&nbsp;

**TL:DR** Max Bid ASTS Walk Away. Space internet on a toilet anywhere in the world.

## Delivery Vans

## “BUILT SPECIFICALLY FOR LAST-MILE DELIVERY”

**""Last mile** is a term used in [supply chain management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_management) and [transportation planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_planning) to describe the last leg of a journey comprising the movement of people and goods from a [transportation hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_hub) to a final destination."" - Wikipedia, baby.

C-Series Vehicles

* C1000 & C650
   * 324” vs 247” length
   * 122” height
   * 75 mph topspeed
   * 100-160 mile range
   * 600 packages vs 450 packages
   * C-Series Vehicles feature a 100% composite monocoque body eliminating 4,000 lbs. of chassis and body weight compared to a conventional, internal combustion vehicle while carrying the same cargo volume and payload
   * 40 MPGe fuel efficiency for C-Series vs. 6 MPG for UPS
   * Reduced operating cost from \~$1.00/mile to \~$0.36/mile(1)
   * Workhorse states based on UPS data, customers would see a positive ROI within just 3 years when factoring in fuel, maintenance, and infrastructure costs.

UPS of course, has been acting as their partner in drone delivery testing for the Horsefly, their custom built, high-efficiency delivery UAV that is fully integrated with their line of electric delivery trucks.

## Horsefly

* Designed with a maximum gross weight of 30 lbs., the Horsefly carries a 10 lb. payload with a maximum air speed of 50 mph, and has the ability to automatically lower packages safely from 50 feet above
* The HorseFly system is designed to conform to the FAA guidelines for UAV operation in the U.S.
* The autonomous system is integrated with the C1000 Electric Delivery Vehicles. The truck is the jumping off point for the drone and then the pair will meet after the delivery is complete. The truck features a control center for the driver and auto-landing HorseFly roof with charging capabilities.
* Recent updates to the drone allow for point-to-point package delivery without the need for a c1000
* Reduces per package last-mile cost by up to 95% (\~$0.04 per mile vs. \~$1.00 for gas vehicle)
* The recently granted HorseFly™ patent covers any drone utilization integrated with conventional vehicle
* COVID-19 accelerated e-commerce experimentation and adoption with contactless drone deliveries

## Additional Projects

* Metron:  cloud-based, remote management system to manage and track the performance of all of the vehicle as a real-time solution for fleet managers

## Comps

It is Workhorse’s expectation that the non-traditional OEMs will compete head-to-head with the likes of GM, Daimler and Ford in the sub 600 cubic feet class, while the 650 - 1200 cubic feet cargo capacity space is left largely ignored. The main reason being that vehicles over 10000 lbs require a Professional driver and costs associated with increase in skill required.

Workhorse is focused in BOTH the 650-1200 cubic feet range AND 10000lb+ gvw class.

I found that information **hidden away in a scroll called a ""10-k""**

&#x200B;

* Traditional OEMs
   * Ford eTransit/GM EV600 both have 600 cubic feet cargo capacity or less. Late 2021 production.
   * Freightliner has both the ECascadia (class 8) and eM2 (class 6-7)
   * Mercedez-Benz ESprinter (Only 96 mile charge; Looking for 100+ in North America. Although Mercedez partnered with Matternet for drone optimization, the WKHS’s US patent should impair operations.)
* Non-Traditional OEMs
   * Rivian (Amazon contract; 10,000 pounds or less)
   * Chanje v8100 (650 cubic feet cargo capacity)
   * Bollinger Deliver-E (Production set to begin 2022; no blue chip names announced)

## SWOT Analysis

* Strengths
   * Patents/Trademarks
   * All electric OEM (made in America)
   * Strong congressional support in OH
   * Already have actual product
* Weaknesses
   * Historically poor production (prior management)
   * Low staff count (during COVID they didn’t have enough staff to assemble vehicles despite backlog of thousands of vehicles)
   * Connection to Steve Burns
* Opportunities
   * Expected CAGR of both EVs and Drones over the next decade
   * 10% equity stake in RIDE (+ royalties on any future sales if they occur)
* Threats
   * Never mass produced all electric C1000 or C650
   * EV market does not rapidly expand
   * Not a cash-positive company from direct operations

## Conclusion + Position

* My Position: 850 shares @ $13.89 average cost per share/$12.30 ""adjusted"" cost basis after selling covered calls Feb-April (message for screenshot if necessary; no problem!)
* I originally discovered Workhorse digging through daily ARK invest movement emails. I found it interesting to see Cathie grabbing extraordinary amounts of shares in the company so I looked further into them. I was disappointed to see them exit their position but I have added an additional 200 shares to my portfolio since I found out.
* Workhorse was probably way ahead of itself when it reached $40. That doesn't make it ""Deadhorse"" just because it missed out on one government contract. The government will need electrified fleets; Workhorse might stand a chance, who knows.
* I miss flying my drone. I crashed it into a darn tree and ever since videos of the Horsefly on youtube have had to fill the void. Not the same, but it's like watching an airplane play Tetris.
* I did not provide a list of catalysts - use the google machine

## Exit Strategy

* No.

## A distressed company: Is the cure worse than the disease?

Oscar Health’s core business is as old as the American Dream itself: deny poor people medical care, and then bill them for the privilege. Oscar adds a fun twist to this winning formula by using technology to deny insurance requests faster and more frequently than traditional companies, which require actual human representatives to decide whether deaf children are allowed to have hearing aids.

Founded in 2012 by current CEO Mario Schlosser, Kevin Nazemi, and Josh Kushner (brother of sentient wax doll Jared Kushner), Oscar Health provides health insurance with a particular technological emphasis. Unlike other providers in the space, OSCR cuts costs by emphasizing telemedicine, automated referrals, and remote prescriptions \[1,2\].

OSCR IPO’d at $39 in March, and almost immediately plummeted to the mid-20’s, where it’s been fluctuating ever since. OSCR’s IPO went so poorly that at least one law firm is considering a class-action suit for securities fraud on behalf of investors \[3\].

## Signs of life

Like many early-stage companies entering an entrenched industry, Oscar initially burned money faster than a secret service agent at a luxury golf course: in 2016 the company lost $204.9 million, while in 2017 the company lost $83 million. However, as the company has expanded its subscriber base and adjusted its risk calculations, it has begun to turn around: in 2018, OSCR posted profits of $1 billion from 400,000 subscribers, and in 2021 it is expected to bring in $2 billion \[4\].

Moreover, OSCR has relatively little competition in its space. Similar startups like Collective Health and WSB’s sweaty dakimakura Clover Health have substantially fewer subscribers and have struggled to turn a profit \[5\]. Meanwhile, larger players in the insurance industry like Anthem are full of polo-shirt thumb-typers, leading to mishaps when they have tried to integrate new technology into their existing offerings \[6\].

Moreover, OSCR has a reputation for poaching top tech talent from companies like Microsoft and Amazon, and Google has even invested in the company.

I am bullish because OSCR has several unique advantages over comparable companies:

## The Bone Saw Gambit

In 2021, companies throughout the world are reckoning with the ethical implications of taking on unscrupulous investment partners. From severing ties to the Chinese government, to removing board members with histories of harassment, corporations worldwide are defining a new approach to vetting investors that will likely restructure the nature of the venture capital space for years to come.

But not Oscar Health. These chads and chadtoinettes will take money from anyone who offers them a nickel and half-kilo of Paradise White. Just last year, OSCR closed a $165 million financing round shortly after co-founder Josh Kushner and Jared Kushner visited Saudi Arabia and met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, everyone’s favorite journalist-murdering oligarch \[7\].

## Daddy’s Money

The renowned Chicago school of economics is a neoclassical school of economic thought based on post-Keynesian monetary theory. Over the decades, one guiding axiomatic principle has emerged from this storied institution:

RICH. KIDS. CAN’T. FAIL.

Due to co-founder Josh Kushner’s involvement, OSCR has its own insurance policy I the form of being intimately intertwined with the Kushner family. Patriarch Charles Kushner alone has an estimated net worth of \~$2 billion, giving him plenty of runway to bail out his son as needed:

* Earnings underwater because we blew all our VC money on coke and legal settlements?Emergency cash injection from Papa.
* Our machine learning algorithm stopped running because our Office 365 free trial expired?Bailout from El Padre.
* Service outages due to buildup of a strange powder in our server’s ventilation ports?Thanks for your credit card info, Mr. K.

Daddy Kush will stake anything and everything to make sure that little Josh’s lemonade stand makes it. Ten years from now when OSCR hits $1600, we can all watch Josh’s TedX Talk on becoming a self-made billionaire.

Allow me to summarize:

1. Workhorse develops electric trucks.
2. We all know where the future is going with electric vehicles. The people want it, the government wants it, and a lot of private and public money is being poured in to make this happen. Legislation is aiming to make and force this to happen.
3. The government wants zero emissions. Workhorse trucks are already zero-emission. Gas and diesel-powered trucks are not. These companies are going to have a tough time catching up.
4. Workhorse has a proprietary system to help manage its fleet and increase its efficiency. This helps increase revenue.
5. Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management, who has been very popular lately (google her), has purchased a few million shares for her fund
6. In April, Workhorse **more than doubled its production** of trucks in comparison to the **combined previous three quarters**. The Pride Group placed an order for 6230 trucks. That's **6230!!! That's an enormous amount of trucks.** They couldn't produce this because of global limitations. There is a bottleneck within the global supply chain in part due to offshore shipping delays of commodity raw materials and components. This has affected the entire industry, including Ford and GM. This is only **TEMPORARY** and will get worked out as it always does because every company wants to sell and make money.
7. Sales for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately $521,000 compared to approximately $84,000 in the first quarter of 2020. That is a significant increase. This number will be nothing compared to the 325 million dollars they will receive from pride group once they produce enough trucks to fill the order. That is just one customer, and remember that once world conditions are back to normal they will be producing trucks at a way faster speed.
8. The Company had approximately $205.1 million in cash in March 2021. This helps limit the need to acquire debt.
9. The stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a $6 billion contract with the USPS. This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company. This one-time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor does it mean Workhorse will lose out on other contracts from the USPS or other companies.
10. 350,00 delivery trucks are sold per year according to the New York Times. This number will most likely increase.
11. Calls with a strike price of $15 for Jun 18, 2021 had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options. This may mean investors may be expecting a big move.
12. You're helping the environment by investing in this company.
13. This stock has already a 51% short of its float. Beeing short on this stock is very risky right now. AMC was shorted about 20% on its float and look what it did. WKHS has a float that is a 4th of AMC’s float and it has double the short interest of the float. This means the chance way less buyers to buy up the float compared to other stocks.
14. Ortex has issued 2 signals for WKHS in just the last week. Remember this is the same website that issued the same signal for AMC at 12 dollars a share. -> Another reason to stay away from shorts.

TLDR

Workhorse (WKHS) is a highly-shorted (51% short interest of float) stock with lucrative future. It is still priced pretty low(also because of the hight SI). There is tremendous potential for gains here.

but the fact that much of the loaned money goes into stocks

which artificially drive up their value. (This is known as “asset inflation”. No wealth is being created here, the numbers are just being unnaturally propped up by the money printing)

So it's imperative that you take profits. I know diamond handers won't ever sell, but if I can reach one poor soul to wake up, and to put their profits into assets that will hold it's value.

And if you just prefer stocks, even putting them in say, companies that will be around 20 years from now would be far less risky, such as Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft ect.

The alternative is to completely chance it and see how long you can ride this bubble, but the odds are totally stacked against you. You will never be rich this way.

C3 is growing rapidly with a total revenue of $156.7M in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2020 compared to $91.6M in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2019 representing a year-over-year growth of 71%. Over the same period, the subscription revenue grew to $135.4M from $77.5M representing a 75% increase.

C3 has high total contract values for software subscriptions. The average total subscription contract values were:

* 2016: $1.2M
* 2017: $11.7M
* 2018: $10.8M
* 2019: $16.2M
* 2020: $12.1M

**BULL ARGUMENT**

C3 has a first-mover advantage in Enterprise AI due to investment into their products and technology over the last decade. They have “Lighthouse Customers”, or large global early adopters, in Europe, Asia, and the United States across a range of industries that serve as proof points for other potential customers. Some customers include:

There is an extensive partner ecosystem that includes strategic relationships with established technology leaders like:

* [Amazon Web Services](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181010005314/en/C3-and-Amazon-Web-Services-Expand-Collaboration-to-Drive-Enterprise-Artificial-Intelligence-Adoption)
* Fidelity National Information Services

* [IBM](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-02-27/correcting-and-replacing-ibm-services-and-c3-ai-announce-strategic-alliance-for-digital-transformation-with-ai)
* [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/09/microsoft-sees-gain-on-c3ai-investment-concurrent-with-ipo.html)

Although the average total subscription value is decreasing and may continue to decrease, C3 has restructured the sales organization and expanded the market-partner ecosystem to address small, medium, and large sales opportunities. The progress is promising as the average total subscription contract value for six months ended October 31, 2020 was $7.7M.

On February 1, 2021, the [launch of the Open AI Energy Initiative](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-c3-ai-baker-hughes-220000073.html) was announced by Shell, C3, Baker Hughes, and Microsoft. The initiative provides a framework for energy operators, service providers, equipment providers, and independent software vendors for energy services to offer interoperable solutions powered by the [BHC3 AI Suite](https://bakerhughesc3.ai/bhc3-ai-suite/model-driven-architecture/) and Microsoft Azure.

**BEAR ARGUMENT**

C3 faces intense competition and which could be an “early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese” type of situation as second movers could develop technology to improve upon any shortfalls. The main sources of potential competition include:

* Greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and larger customer bases
* Larger sales and marketing budgets and resources, and the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing across a broader portfolio
* Wider geographic presence
* Lower labor and research and development costs
* Larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios
* Greater financial, technical, and other resources to provide support, make acquisitions, hire talent, and to develop and introduce new products

The Chief Executive Officer, Tom Siebel has received many [honors and awards](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181112005818/en/EY-Honors-Thomas-M.-Siebel-as-2018-Entrepreneur-Of-The-Year%C2%AE), but if he, or other senior management team members, were to leave the company C3 may not be able to execute their business strategy. Siebel is critical to the overall management and continued development of the AI suite and AI Applications. All of the executive officers are at-will employees and they do not maintain any key person life insurance policies.

C3 has a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future. The sales cycles can be long and unpredictable and the sales efforts require considerable time and expense. This is due to investing into sales to large organizations that typically undertake a significant evaluation and negotiation process due to their leverage, size, organization structure, and approval requirements. A limited number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of C3’s revenue. The top three entities together accounted for 34% and 44% of the revenue for years ended April 30, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The same entities have been with C3 for an average of 3.3 years.

**CONCLUSION**

Given the success of C3’s customers, I feel it will increase penetration of their existing customer base. They are primed to expand the major account sales organization to focus on large enterprise software agreements. Additionally, C3 will continue to develop high volume distribution channels to address the needs of small and medium businesses. I think they will continue to bring new product families to market that will develop into substantial recurring revenue streams. The total addressable market is rapidly growing and estimated to grow to $271B in 2024, a 12% CAGR from 2020's estimate of $174B.  This is a big opportunity for C3.  The lock up period [ended on June 7, 2021](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/ipos/overview?dealId=907559-94759), and earnings happened on June 2, 2021. I believe everyone who wanted to sell has sold at this point. I am bullish and think C3 has great potential for a swing trade, but more so a long-term investment.

**Whether IPOs in general make or lose money for the average investor?**

**Where is the data from:** iposcoop.com

This is the first time in any of the analyses that I have done where the data was accessible directly in a usable format. They have documented almost all of the IPOs from 2000. I have cross verified the data with [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/270290/number-of-ipos-in-the-us-since-1999/) and have observed coverage of more than 90%. This period covers a wide variety of situations such as the dot-com crash, 2008 financial crisis, market rally following the crisis, etc. which implies that our analysis covers both bear and bull market.,

All the IPOs and my analysis have been shared on a Google sheet at the end.

**Analysis**

Before we jump into the analysis, there are some things we need to understand about IPOs (if you know the inner workings of an IPO, please feel free to skip to the results). When a company wants to go public, they hire investment bankers to sell the shares. The investment banks are then responsible for creating interest, choosing the optimum time to go public, and make sure the price is right so that there is enough demand. But the banks offer a large share of the allocated stock to institutional investors such as pensions, endowments, or hedge funds. Retail brokerages can end up getting shares, but they may make up only [10% of the total allotment](https://money.usnews.com/investing/investing-101/articles/how-to-buy-ipo-stock-at-its-offer-price).

Adding to this, additional factors such as your brokerage account, account balance, the historical trading pattern will all contribute to whether you get the IPO shares or not. (i.e., Brokerages tend to allocate IPO shares to their premium clients). For e.g., in the case of [TD Ameritrade](https://www.tdameritrade.com/investment-products/IPOs.html), your account must have a value of at least $250,000 or have completed 30 trades in the last 3 months.

I have factored in the above limitations and have calculated the historical performance of the IPOs in two different ways

a. You get the IPO allocated at the offer price (the price at which institutional investors are buying)

b. You buy the IPO when the market opens on the listing day (opening price)

For the above scenarios, I have analyzed the following

* Listing Change (Difference between Opening price and Offer price)
* One day change - inclusive of listing
* One day change - exclusive of listing

To make it simple, let’s take the example of company X. If the offer price of the IPO is $10, the Opening price on the day of the IPO is $12 and the Closing price is $15 then,

* Listing change is +20%
* One day change inclusive of the listing is +50%
* One day change exclusive of the listing is +25%

**Results**

On average, IPOs did make money for the investor. But the amount is significantly different if you got allocated the IPO at offer price vs you bought the IPO at market open. The average listing change over the last two decades was 12% and the average one-day gain in the market inclusive of the listing was 13.6%. Adding to this more than 68% of the IPOs ended in green on the listing day.

But the story is markedly different if you choose to buy at the market open. Only 48% of the IPOs ended at a price higher than the opening price and the average change was a mere 1.3%. Now that it’s out of the way, diving deeper into the data brings interesting insights.

https://preview.redd.it/7f5sbp547u471.png?width=1033&format=png&auto=webp&s=733dc5a1fb88e6c1d49490c2278c0e17d20913f3

Above is the list of top 10 IPOs having the most amount of gain on listing day. Baidu.com made a whopping 354% on its listing day. Another interesting observation is 6 out of 10 companies in the list were listed in 2000 and were predominantly tech companies (just before the dot com crash). But not all companies had a great experience on the IPO day. Here is a list of the worse performing companies on the day of listing. 

https://preview.redd.it/562w2az57u471.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfeeb4dcd44348538c657d3cfc0fb4a3920e6d59

There are certainly some familiar names on the list. [Funko IPO](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/funko-stock-plunges-in-ipo-shocker/) is considered to have the worst first-day return for an IPO in the last two decades. Sundial Growers also had a rough time in the market on its listing day with the stock losing 35% of the value in one day. 

https://preview.redd.it/c71zm1j77u471.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5b5009abef9c0e0f90c4166767ef878824a730

I also calculated the IPO returns for each year after 2000. As expected, the year 2000 was the most successful year for an IPO with an average return (inclusive of listing gain) of 35%. The worst year was 2008 (after the financial crisis) with only a 2.3% return. This graph also showcases two important things

a. On average the IPOs have made positive returns every year in the last two decades

b. There is a vast difference in your returns based on if you got the stock at offer price vs opening price and the trend holds across the years.

This brings us to our final question of which investment bank made the most number of IPOs and how was their performance on listing day

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/dxy9xq597u471.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc4dbd6096edbb790669325b91cce48759b4f393)

Out of the top 10 list, only 3 Investment banks had below-average returns. We are not going to draw any conclusion from this as an IPO is usually handled by multiple banks in partnership and the above analysis is done using Fuzzy match (its an approximate match)

**Limitations of the Analysis**

There are some limitations to the analysis.

a.  We don’t have 100% coverage for the IPOs done since 2000. From comparing to other sources, I could observe more than 90% coverage and I feel that this should be representative of the whole.

b.  There is no data showcasing what percentage of each IPO was offered to the retail investor.

**Conclusion:** I have some theories to explain the IPO performance. I think it’s driven mainly by two factors. One being the hype/PR generated by the investment bank about the company and the second is that I think the investment banks slightly price the IPO lower than the market value of the company so that the IPO issue is 100% subscribed (their fees are dependent on a successful IPO). Both these factors contribute to the listing as well as the one-day gain that we see across the board.

Overall, this once again seems to a situation where having money makes you more money (institutional investors having easier access to the IPO) but as the analysis shows retail investors can still make significant gains by buying into an IPO!

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. If you are planning to invest in an IPO, make sure your brokerage support purchasing IPOs, minimum criteria to participate, and also the historical track record of your brokerage in issuing IPOs. All of this will significantly improve your chances of getting the IPO issued at the offer price.*"
ny2xt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny2xt2/that_fourletter_word_in_your_vocabulary/,That Four-Letter Word in Your Vocabulary...,56,61,2021-06-12 17:32:37,"Dear Apes and Autists, 

I want to talk about that four-letter word we all know and use frequently, whether it be consciously or subconsciously. RISK <-four letters; not the word you were thinking of right?

Fundamentally, risk is a life philosophy and how we each measure the potential for reward vs penalty. (blah, blah, google stuff, theory on decision analysis, statistics and practical examples)

Here's my simplified version:

**RISK: Four Tenets for A Four Letter Word**

1.  **Live another day**. (Lesson from wreck and cavern diving) Don't go in so deep you can't make it out when everything goes wrong. Same applies to depth and (lack of) diversity of investing plays. Someone asked in r/thetagang about what to do with 100 naked calls they sold that are now ITM. Others YOLO their tuition /rent /mortgage /savings /medicine money. Don't do this.

 [I’m dumb and feel so hopeless. Never SELL NAKED CALLS. My 100k loss turned into over 600K in minutes with AMC. I’m not even sure how I can recover from this. : thetagang (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/nqy5nk/im_dumb_and_feel_so_hopeless_never_sell_naked/) 

2.  **Have a Plan. (aka Exit Strategy)** (military maxims) ""Failure to Plan is to plan to fail."" ""A plan is a baseline for change."" This is about figuring out ahead of time what your personal exit points are. There was a guy one weekend on WSB holding options up 3000% and wondering if he should sell some.

3.  **Call it off when it's going wrong**. (diving, trail riding). This is not a life or death mission. If it's a bad day and things are going screwy, recognize it, and call it early, rather than late. Have a beer and talk about what might have been...Do not ""double down"". (Like I did when CLOV was being suppressed in May, but I was on hopium, so I bought more calls, and they all became worthless.)

4.  **Recognize how little you know.** (every sport, hobby, and pastime) The world is full of excited, happy hobbyists! People who know a lot about subject are experts and usually do it for a living. Experts can recognize the limits of their own knowledge, unusual situations, and unashamedly seek counsel from trusted peers. Hubris is a common character flaw in Greek tragedy plays. Be aware of your own limitations; there's no Deus Ex Machinas out here! Seek advice before you get into trouble!

There a bunch more I could have added, but I know there's some awesome experience and brainpower lurking on various subs (and yes, even here) who can add what the average investing hobbyist should look for under one of these four headings.

Recognize that you WILL make mistakes, and that the market can move in mysterious ways.  Have a plan to get above water.  And may your tendies be hot and crisp.

Cheers!

\- Currently trading at 20X Earnings, Tootsie Roll trades at 40X and other peers in the Food&Bev Trade at 30X. Making TWNK underpriced between 50% - 100%, looking at their current business only

**Growth Prospects:**

**-** Their organic growth remains strong and also have a very diverse acquisition pipeline. They recently acquire Voortman Cookies which positions them to enter the USA $6.9Billion Packaged Cookie Markets.

\-  Voortman cookies are perfectly positions for the demographic and taste shifts happening in America right they. They offer sugar-free and no-sugar added cookies which will be a growing segment as a result of USA.

\- They are launching new platforms in order to attract younger demographics such as their ""crispy minis"". 

\- Expansion into eCommerce onto platforms like Amazon. Given their shelf-stable products they are well positions to thrive on Amazon

\- They have many legacy brands which is on-trend to capture recent popularity of Nostalgia Brands.

\- Convenience & Boutique Grocery have recently hit all-time high market shares. This is important as the economy reopening people will be going to gas stations more, be out of their home more, giving them a great opportunity for continued growth. They are doing so well during the year of ""stay-at-home"" and ""work-from-home"" and has people get back to the office and back on the road this market share will perfectly suit them for growth.

**Leadership:**

CEO Andy Callahan was at Tyson Foods when stock went from $39 - $75 and he’s Former US Navy so he DEF. KNOWS about rocket ships.

They recently hired a very experience Head of Growth names Andy Callahan. Google him and you'll see he is the perfect guy for the job

TL:DR: $TWNK has a short interest of 20%, is trading at 2x REVENUE with healthy 25% margins. They are well position for growth and I believe they are relatively undervalued. At a $2B market-cap this is an amazing deal and their portfolio of sweet treats and market share is perfectly primed to catapult this company.

Vuzix is engaged in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of augmented reality display devices also referred to as head mounted displays (HMDs, but also known as video eyewear or near-eye displays), in the form of Smart Glasses, and Augmented Reality glasses. Their Augmented Reality wearable display devices are worn like eyeglasses or attach to a head worn mount. These devices typically include cameras, sensors, and a computer that enable the user to view, record and interact with video and digital content, such as computer data, the Internet, social media or entertainment applications. Their wearable display products integrate micro-display technology with advanced optics to produce compact high-resolution display engines, which when viewed through their smart glasses’ products create virtual images that appear comparable in size to that of a computer monitor or a large-screen television. Vuzix's offered products are M series Smart Glasses, Blade Smart Glasses and other Augmented Reality Products.

Sales of Smart Glasses products for the year ended December 31, 2020 rose by 107% over the same period in 2019, primarily the result of stronger customer demand for the new M-Series models, which were not available for sale for the entire comparable period in 2019. Sales revenues from the M-Series Smart Glasses were $8,406,623, a 112% increase of $4,432,628 over the prior year’s comparable period. Total M-Series unit sales increased by 109% for the year ended December 31, 2020 versus the same period in 2019. Revenues of Blade Smart Glasses decreased by $240,747 or 14%, primarily driven by lower average sales price as compared to 2019.

Sales of OEM Products, and Standalone Waveguides and Display Engines were nil for the year ended December 31, 2020 versus $951,570 and $152,499, respectively, in the 2019 period primarily due to not receiving new orders.

Sales of Engineering Services for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1,500,287 as compared to $673,151 in the 2019 comparable period. The revenue recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020 for engineering services was primarily a result of several waveguide and display engine development projects which commenced in the first and second quarters of 2020. The majority, all but two, of these projects were completed and delivered in 2020. 

**BULL ARGUMENT**

Augmented Reality Smart Glasses enable the wearer to see computer-generated information, graphics or images projected into the real-world environment or upon an object that the user is observing. Thus, whether in the warehouse, on the factory floor, or in the field, users wearing Augmented Reality Smart Glasses may access a manual, tutorial, or image that is connected to the task at hand which will assist them in completing that task, while also viewing their current surroundings and nearby objects. Additional possible applications of AR-enabled Smart Glasses include hands-free alerts, messaging, location and context aware information and social interaction.

Vuzix has developed their own intellectual property portfolio that includes [patents](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/vuzix-corporation), over 22 years of manufacturing know-how, software, proprietary processes, materials and equipment to create high performance waveguides, and near-eye display products. It can be argued their waveguides and compact display engine technologies are a key differentiator for enabling next generation Augmented Reality and Smart Glasses hardware for the enterprise and consumer segments because they will ultimately allow Vuzix to make HMDs nearly indistinguishable from regular eyeglasses.

Key growth areas for Vuzix are the enterprise, medical, consumer electronics, OEM, defense and security markets. They are addressing most of these markets by developing and selling their own finished products and building a growing eco-system of software and services internally and with their value added resellers, developers and end customers. Another potential channel to these markets they are developing includes supplying mass production of waveguide optics and display engines to select third parties to use in their products. Vuzix recently announced they will expand their Augmented Reality surgical product presence to [support shoulder, knee, and spinal surgeries](https://ir.vuzix.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1895/vuzix-smart-glasses-expand-ar-surgical-product-presence-to). 

**BEAR ARGUMENT**

Vuzix has incurred net losses since inception and may continue to incur losses. They reported a net loss of $17,952,172 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a net loss of $26,476,370 for the year ended December 31, 2019, and a net loss of $21,875,713 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Vuzix has an accumulated deficit of $162,694,983 as of December 31, 2020.

They operate in a highly competitive market and the size, resources, and brand name of some of their competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than Vuzix. Some competitors include: 

* Samsung Electronics Co.
* LG Electronics 
* Epson
* Sony Corporation
* Microsoft Corporation
* Oculus/Facebook
* HTC Corporation
* Snap
* Lenovo
* Google
* Magic Leap

Many of their competitors have substantial market share, diversified product lines, well-established supply and distribution systems, strong worldwide brand recognition, and greater financial, marketing, research and development resources. Additionally, many of these competitors also have substantial competitive advantages such as: 

* longer operating histories
* the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products
* broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners
* access to larger established customer bases and known branding
* greater resources to fund research and development and to make acquisitions
* larger intellectual property portfolios
* the ability to bundle competitive offerings with other products and services

**CONCLUSION**

I have a hard time pulling the trigger on a long-term investment with Vuzix. With their current financials and competitors, I feel this is a better day/swing trade opportunity if played correctly. The volatility is where I like it for those types of trades. It will be interesting to see how Vuzix develops over the next 1-3 years, but I won’t have positions longer than a couple weeks during that time span.

So this infrastructure bill will be spent on buy American initiatives to help with American jobs. It will also focus on going from gas to electric vehicles due to concerns of climate change. Back in January, when Joe Biden addressed the American people for the first time as our President, he announced plans to replace government fleets with all-electric vehicles. He signed an executive order that he says closes loopholes in ""Buy American"" policies for the federal government, which would promote the purchase of electric vehicles for government use. The government alone will need to replace about 650,000. Not sure on the numbers for commercial fleet but I’m sure there’s plenty. 

Lordstown Motors was made just for this! Their Endurance electric pickup trucks are for commercial fleet. They are not just a small player in this space, thanks to gm. They have a special, probably more like strategic partnership, relationship with gm. In fact, gm and LG Chem are currently building a battery plant right next door to Lordstown Motors. If that’s not strategic, I don’t know what is?? I do think Lordstown Motors will win government contracts, military contracts, private sector as well. 

*Don’t forget, ‘LORDSTOWN WEEK’ is June 21-25.

So at this G7 summit, our 7 leader countries will talk about a bunch of stuff. One of the topics of conversation; reaching net-zero emissions and limiting the earth’s temperature. You know? Clean technology and eliminating fossil fuel. How do we get there? It’s pretty much what part of this infrastructure bill address…billions of dollars that’ll go to Lordstown Motors. Long story short. 

They’ll probably get the government contracts. That’ll spill over to lots of other contracts in the private sector. Mahoning Valley will be thriving again. You see, gm left Ohio high and dry when they closed down that same plant in Lordstown. That 6.2m square foot assembly plant used to employ about 5,000 gm skilled laborers. After gm closed up shop, it decimated the local economy - Black Monday. Google it! Believe it or not, President Trump came to the rescue. Now, we’re back in business! Long story….I think Ohio will be the heart of President Biden’s Build Back Better plan. While you’re googling ‘Black Monday’, google Voltage Valley. I’m betting there will be a lot of lithium ion batteries, semiconductors, electric vehicles (trucks) and jobs out of there. 

Lordstown Motors will be playing a huge role in Ohio and going electric in America."

Warning extreme DD, requires wrinkled brain.",577,245,2021-06-11 05:54:31,"Senseonics Holdings, Inc., is a medical technology company, that develops and manufactures a unique implantable continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. Its products include Eversense and Eversense XL, which are implantable CGM systems to measure glucose levels in people with diabetes for a period of up to 90 and 180 days. The Eversense (90 days) has FDA approval since 2018 and the Eversense XL (180 days) is already approved in Europe and FDA approval is expected by the end of the third quarter. A CGM system provides glucose measurements regularly and gives the user an alarm when sugar levels drop too low or go too high, it can also be used in connection with an insulin pump to automatically deliver insulin when needed.

Eversense technology is unique as it is a long-term CGM system that can last up to 180 days, versus 7 to 14 days from the competition, and it is the only one implantable under the skin and works with a removable transmitter (in competing products you cannot remove the transmitter; otherwise, you have to replace the whole device). It is a CGM system that allows for freedom of movement and the user can decide when to use it and all this with even better accuracy than all other CGM systems in the market.

The almost demise of Senseonics in 2020 was due to some self inflicted errors and bad luck. The company tried to commercialize Eversense on its own in the USA and that consumed much of its economic resources without much success and then, when COVID hit, the company stopped commercializing Eversense as it couldn't get physicians to perform the sensor implant procedure. In March 2020, Senseonics was forced to make a $48.5 MM repayment to one of its lenders that panicked and that pushed the company into the limits of insolvency and forced it to look for a partner or outright sale.

Enter Ascensia Diabetes

On August 10th, 2020, the company announced a strategic collaboration with Ascensia Diabetes Care. This is a transformational alliance for Senseonics, as Ascensia is a dedicated diabetes company with a presence in 125 countries and 10 MM customers. It has the trust and reliability of being in this business for over 70 years. Ascensia is the market leader in the Blood Glucose Monitoring (BGM) market with its COUNTOUR portfolio of devices and it is the combination of several important companies with interests in the Diabetes market. Ascensia is based in Switzerland and it was established in 2016 through the acquisition of Bayer Diabetes Care by PHC Holdings (formerly known as Panasonic Healthcare Holdings), which is a KKR portfolio company.

Ascensia Diabetes Care is betting big on Senseonics. Not only are they providing 35 MM in convertible debt financing but will also invest an approximate $250 MM over the next five years to commercialize and market Eversense in exclusivity all over the world. So why would such a company with approximately $1 Billion in annual sales is interested in a $4 MM revenue company?

I believe Ascensia recognizes the enormous potential of this technology, which could eventually make redundant even their current business. Ascensia business is CONTOUR, a razor/razor blade business model in which the company sells blood glucose measuring devices for a low price and makes money selling the small lancets that are replaceable. Make a tour through Amazon or simply Google ""Blood glucose monitoring"" and you will find that this market is over saturated with dozens of suppliers competing in price. Ascensia prices its wares at a premium over competitors but the technology is mature so I am not so sure if new diabetes clients will be choosing Contour going forward. Basically, they need a new product that can reinvigorate the brand and put them once again at the leading edge of the diabetes market.

Currently the Senseonics Eversense device requires calibration twice a day, that could be done using a Contour device to measure the glucose level and input the result in the Eversense device via an iPhone or Android Phone. But as the following slide shows, the company has a product pipeline with next generation devices that will require increasingly less calibration. The Eversense XL submitted for approval to the FDA requires only one calibration a day and the Eversense 365 will require only one rebalancing a week reducing considerably the use of lancets for blood monitoring systems.

The technology has huge potential to disrupt the current CGM market, which is a $5-plus billion market today growing at about a 35% CAGR (according to SENS management) and dominated by three large companies: DexCom (DXCM), Abbott Labs (ABT) and Medtronic (MDT). This market is exclusively focused on the Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes patients which are intensively managed, that means they need insulin shots and many even use insulin pumps as they cannot produce any insulin themselves. The number of people with diagnosed diabetes in the USA in 2020 was 34.2 of which 1.6 MM have Type I Diabetes, unfortunately the number of people with Diabetes is growing very rapidly as can be seen from this National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2020.

With FDA approval for the Eversense XL expected by the end of the third quarter, Senseonics will start to eat at the market share of the incumbent companies in the industry, but the real game changer will come with the Eversense 365, as it will open up the Type II market to this new type of CGM devices. Here the opportunity is really huge and they face no competition and none is expected anytime soon either.

Currently, people with Type II diabetes have only BGM devices like CONTOUR to help them monitor their blood levels, but that requires pricking a finger to get blood and only provides a measurement at that particular moment. The 365 device will require only a 5 minute intervention every year to remove and replace the sensor and if the company gets to the point that won't need a transmitter, as you scan your smartphone over the sensor, then I believe the sky is the limit for Senseonics as there are 420 MM people with diabetes in the world.

The company is providing the current guidance as to future revenues, I believe these numbers to be conservative once the Eversense XL gets approval in the USA. I am confident it will be approved, it has already been approved in Europe and the 90 days device was unanimously approved in 2018 by the FDA's Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Toxicology Devices Panel of independent medical experts that voted, 8 to 0, that the system not only was safe and effective, but also that its benefits outweighed the risks.

Senseonics is a high risk/high reward type of investment, but the type of risk I like, basically there is a small chance that the company will file for insolvency anytime soon and with the Ascencia alliance it stands a very good shot at disrupting the diabetes market. In my opinion, Senseonics has the makings of a potential multi-bagger from here and aggressive investors would be advised to initiate a position at the current levels. Next catalysts for the company will be information of progress in the commercialization in Europe and from April 1st in the USA, then it will be the Eversense XL approval by the end of September."

As well as let you know that this auto maker is primed for a decent run in the mid-to-long-term. I've been playing them since their IPO. I hope these links are acceptable and can remove as needed.

One quick note I like to repeat to others is NIO has first place wins in the EV F-1 racing scene having the fastest times in the opening seasons. 

This means to me:
1)  They know how to build and manage power supplies.
2)They know how to build high performance EV drive trains
3) They know how to build high performance EV engines.

Now on to the discussion

Back in November 2019 NIO had reached a government backed deal to provide them with 2-5 billions in savings to manufacture at a factory in their Heife region. 

While NIO was managing the build of a new factory equipment they were able to ramp up production of their current model vehicle the ES6. Continuously hitting their production guidance released in their earnings calls. 

NIO then announced in January 2021 that they wanted to produce a more affordable sedan to compete with Tesla. In comes the ET7 this vehicle is slated to be produced at their new factory. To date I haven't seen any news that indicates they've hit a snag (5 day halt did occur) in building out the production capacity at the new facility. They released deal in May 2021 to produce 240,000 per year. 

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-extends-joint-manufacturing-agreement-090009258.html

This model vehicle will be their mainstream vehicle and it's planned to hit the road in the coming year. 

They've already expanded into the hottest market in EU for EVs Norway.

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/nio-plans-to-start-delivering-cars-to-norway-in-september.html

https://www.nio.com/news/nio-announces-norway-strategy

Now that's all production and management of their vehicles. 

But what about the interior and software?!?!? 

Well they've done something a little out there but apparently the consumers are enjoying it they integrated an automotive assistant which is AI driven. This might be something that changes the relationship with owners and the vehicle causing them to hold the vehicle longer instead of reselling on secondary markets. Which drives the demand for new vehicles that they produce.

https://twitter.com/NIOGlobal/status/1394334686025961477?s=19

They also have NIO Navigate on Pilot 1.0 this is the same as Tesla Autopilot with the same suite of features. There's plenty of videos showing that this AI driven software is functioning as designed. This also indicates they aren't behind Tesla but right in step with them.

https://youtu.be/1UaGjztOi94

ONE NOTE about NIO Navigate on Pilot. They said they'd be working on an update but it has not hit the road. So this indicates to me that they're struggling with something to make it to the next phase. Once they release an update they'll be a leader in self driving vehicles in the largest EV market. 

Now just wait THERE'S MOAR! Geez... I'm running out of breath 🫁💨

They have a battery swap service that solves one issue that other EVs have. Super long lines and long charge times. They can swap your battery in their vehicle in 3minutes. 3min and you're back in the road that's as good as gas station times. 

They also released news on a solid state battery which has it's own combustion suppression properties that existing battery technologies suffer from. Google battery fires for four hours on Tesla. 

Some fundamentals:

They've reduced operating costs significantly last quarter.

They've increased margin on their existing vehicle
 https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-reports-unaudited-third-quarter-2020

They've increased sales month to month and year over year.

They've increased their revenue. 

So what say you? Is this a dieing company? NO

Is this company primed for success, yes! Will they keep up with the major autonomous vehicle players absolutely. Yes!


Two Last points 

1)They are listed on the Chinese companies in Congress for delisting THEY absolutely plan to stay in compliance to stay on the US exchange.

2) they are very active with news, and guidance so it's easy to stay up to date and allow you to reanalyze frequently what's good for your play."

But unlike Momma Cathy, who is betting ARK on it to happen in the next three years, let me tell you what reality  looks like.

This is going to be a LONG DD. But you can learn a lot about why machine learning is actually pretty difficult, and why Tesla is not worth as much as some people might think.

Let me start with my self and why I think I know stuff here that you might not:

I have a major in mathematics with a focus on statistics, game theory and probability theory. I work at one of the largest, top tech companies in the world. I have done multiple ML projects in my work, currently I am driving a project that is responsible for the newest edition of my company's Data Lake as a foundation of all our ML endeavors. I have contact and access to people from all the top IT companies (who we partner with e.g. for infrastructure, platform services and data science tools). 

I would be happy for anyone with else with deep knowledge to chime in here. People who know that Jupyter is not a planet and that you cant hide a Python in a wall made out of Databricks.

So with that out of the way, here are 4 reasons, why there wont be any (level 4) FSD cars in the next 5 years, not from Tesla, and not from anyone else. Let me start with the non - technical ones.

# 1.) Tesla does not fully believe in it themselves

As  stated in this [last 10Q](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017021000046/tsla-20210331.htm#risk_factors) and referenced e.g. in this [news article](https://www.fastcompany.com/90630440/tesla-admits-it-may-never-achieve-full-self-driving-cars#:~:text=The%20disclosure%20comes%20after%20a,Tesla%20ran%20off%20the%20road.&text=A%20recent%20filing%20with%20the,great%20white%20whale%20for%20years), Tesla is well aware of the risk that they may ""later"" or ""never"" achieve fully self driving (FSD) cars.

&#x200B;

# 2.) But... Tesla's cars are already driving better than humans, as can be seen by their accident numbers per mile??

Well, this heavily depends on how you look at the numbers. [Pappa Elon's Tweets](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1383548841438236674) have shown pretty great numbers (10x more safe with auto pilot), a recent [forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2020/10/28/new-tesla-autopilot-statistics-show-its-almost-as-safe-driving-with-it-as-without/?sh=5b11f0ea1794) paints a picture that is more 50/50. So what is the truth? It is hard to tell. I have done plenty of KPI Reporting for board members of my company, I can tell you how KPIs like these typically are reported:

Firstly: Think about this: Where will the autopilot be activated mostly? Freeways, Highways... but not in cities, difficult traffic situations etc, right? Where do most accidents happen? Right. So Tesla's cars are accumulating miles and miles without accidents, driving in a straight line on a highway (something that btw almost ANY car from ANY brand can do - even 5-10 years ago). If you just report those numbers, of course you will get to a statistic like the one Elon posted. If you compare freeway numbers with freeway numbers, it is a wash (as it seems the forbes article has tried to do).

Secondly: In the foot note of the tesla report, they state that they count all accidents where the autopilot was active 5 seconds before the accident. Why 5 seconds though? Why not 10? why not 30? What would YOU do, if you were the one who has to create this report? Exactly.

Thirdly: Is # of accidents even the best thing to measure? Having less accidents obviously is important for the ADOPTION of FSD cars, but is it a good measure of how CLOSE we are to actually achieving FSD cars? Think about this: Most accidents happen (especially on freeways), when people are speeding, using their mobile phone or breaking the law in some other way. Of course the car never does this. So, shouldn't we compare the Tesla numbers to just the accidents where noone was speeding etc? Couldn't we achieve ""less # of accidents"" also by restricting cars with technology (e.g. mobiles are always deactivated near the driver seat, speeding is technically restricted)? Of course we could, but who wants that?

**Summary**: Measuring security of FSD Cars (# of accidents per mile) is a bullshit KPI to start with. It can help with adoption, but the reporting of it is very likely skewed or plain out wrong. I am not saying it is done in a fraudulent way, but I think it is not a fair comparison as it is done today. And any report can be tweaked a bit, to look better - just a tiny bit here and there. And this is done ALL THE TIME by all the big companies and players, because their bonuses and salaries depend on it.

# 3.) The data treasure of Tesla

So after some more high level and less technical arguments, lets dig into the matter itself. If you don't know much about how ML works, I would invite you to watch a movie that everyone can enjoy and understand. It is about AlphaGo, the engine that beat the game of GO. It is a great movie in itself, and it gives you quite some insight that you can leverage to understand this DD thread [AlphaGo Movie on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y). You might like it a bit more if you either played Starcraft in your life, or you are a nerd like me.

One reason, why many investors give Tesla an edge over their competitors, is the fact that Tesla has the most miles driven with full sensor cars, and they supposedly have that data available to build their ML models on. The whole thesis is based on the fact that Tesla can achieve FSD within 2-3 years, because all the other competitors are catching up here, and fast. The problem is, what do you actually do with this data? What data can Tesla realistically save?

Do they save ALL the data from all sensors including driver input, video, radar, ultra sound?

I have done a project once, where we saved just very basic sensor data of trucks from a customer. This thing produced 2 Gigabytes of data per hour driven (with sensors picking up one data point every second). There was no video or anything in there, just GPS data, velocity, stuff like that. So a Tesla would probably need much much more, right? It also cant be satisfied with a data point per second, it would need a proper data stream (video of at least 10 fps, same for radar) and have a multitude of sensors (according to google, something like 10 cameras, 12 ultrasound and one radar)

I don't even want to start guesstimating how much raw data a Tesla car produces, but I have seen numbers thrown around from 100 GB per hour to 3 TB per hour, which seems realistic given my own experience in the super simple use case I mentioned and the number of sensors in a Tesla car.

So what can Tesla do with this data? You certainly can not store all of the data from all the cars for longer periods of time. Anything above a few Terabytes (>100) will be very cumbersome to use, will take ages to compute anything on, and will cost a shit ton of money to keep and maintain.

If you take just the 500.000 Tesla cars sold in 2020, and assume they only drive 1 hour per day on average and in that hour they only produce 10 GB (10% of estimated low), this would already be around 1 Exabyte of data per year (1700 Terabyte). Training any layer of a model (e.g. the layer that can find road markings) on such a data set is an insanely difficult and expensive task already. Nevermind the fact you probably need tens of thousands of them.

What I am saying is this: Even with their own data centers, and some great processing powers - it is impossible for Tesla to actually store and use all the data that they could collect. Today's storage and computing standards simply aren't big enough (yet).  I have some good insight into AWS and Azure and a few of the bigger university computing initiatives. Maybe Tesla has something that NONE of those have in their data centers. But I doubt it. It is general consensus, that AWS is by far the best here in terms of cost efficiency per computing power or storage size, since they basically practiced it for 10 years now AT SCALE.

They can collect a lot of data. But they can not keep it, and it is not the big competitive edge that some think it may be.  

And we haven't even started on data that is flawed (rain versus sunny weather), skewed (left driving countries versus right side driving countries) or simply bad quality (dirt on the camera). Anyone who has done ML projects knows that this is one of the biggest issues. I have done projects where we used satellite images on certain locations. 15 GB per picture of a 10x10 mile square location. Half of them had clouds, and you could not see shit (thankfully, modern services let you filter for pictures without clouds or only partly clouded). Then try to compute your 15 GB picture, even on modern infrastructure without taking ages, and THEN find out that the resolution is still way too fucking low for what you wanted to do. SIZE IS A PROBLEM.

# 4.) Complexity of Machine Learning

&#x200B;

Anyone who has done any ML in their life, knows how difficult ML is, when it comes to real problems. Maybe you have now watched the AlphaGo Video. 

You might have noticed, that the example there is a very simple game with 361 squares, each of which can only be empty, black or white. This means, the input data structure is extremely simple. There are no flaws in the data, no artifacts and it was still a huge fucking deal when they ""won"".

You might have noticed, that the number of possible moves that the engine can do are even more simple than the board, as some fields will already be occupied.

You might have noticed, that there were **still** 50+ people working on building that engine, and it took them months/years. How many of Tesla's employees are working on this FSD, which is orders or magnitudes more complex?

You might have noticed, that even with all the simplicity, the engine still flunked at least once.

&#x200B;

Now think of driving a car like a game with a multitude of players, non binary options (instead of steer left, steer right, it is more like a 120 degree field of steering from which you select exactly one, per (milli?)second). Data is skewed, flawed or in bad quality. Decisions can not be ""computed"" for minutes (even AlphaGo takes this long), they have to be made instantaneously. And they can't miss. It has to be 100% % correct. 

People who have done ML in the real world, will know that even relatively simple problems require quite complex models. These take hours to train and inference times are not always optimal, even on expensive state-of-the-art infrastructure.

Another, much more simple example for this is Google Translate. The smartest people, with almost infinite money took one of the biggest, if not THE biggest data set in the world (all written text ever produced) and tried to build a translation engine. Heck, this thing is great! But does it work perfectly? Of course not. Would you trust it with your life?

Someone smart once said, Machine Learning is good for problems where you need to be 51% right, like the stock market e.g.. A 1% edge is all you need. Driving a car, you can not afford to be wrong 49% of the time and ML is bad in those 99,99% problems.

&#x200B;

# Conclusions:

The hype around Machine Learning is huge. And progress has been made. But the problems that autonomous driving needs to tackle are insanely complex. The technology is not there yet, and it is not going to be there in the foreseeable future. The human brain is still far smarter than any data center in existence. Probably even ML as it exists today needs a complete revolution in order to be able to solve some of the things that our brain can do, and driving cars seems to be one of those problems that needs to wait for that.

&#x200B;

How to use this for investing?

I don't go short or buy puts anymore after **$SPY 180P 4/16** last year. But I think there is a big opportunity for other automakers. My favorite currently is $VW, and people have been catching up to it. They will be building the most EV cars very soon, and they can put in.

As usual here, none of this is investment advice.

# TL/DR:

Tesla wont get autonomous driving (L4) within the next years.

# Positions:

100 commons for $VW (cost basis around $25k)

Small position in $NIO, $F ord

Sorry, no options for this one, I am not crazy enough to short $TSLA, and the timing of this can take for however long people still believe in the FSD story."

It is going public via SPAC namely dMY Technology III. 

In it’s latest fundraising it secured a further $82m funding from: Google Ventures, AWS, Samsung, Airbus, Lockheed Martin and Bosch. The funding is being used to develop ‘trapped ion computing technology’ which is able to operate at room temperature and has the longest lifetime of any qubit. 

IonQ’s founders wanted to build the most powerful quantum computer using trapped ytterbium atoms. This method, whilst not the most common has unique advantages including low error correction, high gate fidelity, scalability, noise reduction, less space required and lower costs to operate, as it requires no refrigeration and minimal electrical costs. 

The founders Jungsang Kim and Christopher Monroe both bring formidable technical credentials. Jungsang Kim leads the multifunctional integrated systems tech group at Duke University, where his lab leads the world in miniaturisation of quantum systems. Christopher Monroe has been working on quantum computing for 25 years and demonstrated the first ever quantum logic gate. Between them they have secured over $160m in grants. 

Despite quantum computing being in its infancy they expect to earn $5m of revenues in 2021, with the long term business model being Quantum computing as a service (QcAAS) possible due to increased scalability being an advantage of the trapped ion method. 

To summarise quantum computing is one of the next big technological advancements, they have attracted the best business and technical minds of any quantum computing business to date.  If you factor in the increased scalability and how much backing/pipe investment (Silver Lake, Fidelity, Hyundai, Time Ventures, Breakthrough Energy) they’ve secured it looks like they are financially secure, have first mover advantage and are in pole position to capitalise on the future shift to quantum computing."

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

# Why?

$CLF AKA Cleveland Cliffs is one of the **largest producers of steel in america.**

Have you tried building a house? Getting gym gear? Did you try to get a huge infrastructure plan going for the US which includes streets, bridges, buildings and what not all built with steel? anything to do with steel **GOT FUCKING EXPENSIVE.**

**Because Steel is in huge demand, because now that covid is falling back, people want to buy stuff, build stuff and all needs steel. Steel prices went to the moon! THEY FUCKING TRIPLED!**

🌏 🚀 🌕

&#x200B;

[In a matter of months prices for steel TRIPLED](https://preview.redd.it/bir35uvtt7471.jpg?width=653&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aecc3e0e75d8551b90c57135f81c186c0ecc152b)

&#x200B;

# WHY $CLF?

# Because $CLF is a big fucking steel producer, profitable, undervalued as fuck, forecast EBIDTA of $5.6B at a share price of 20$! RIGHT NOW $CLF should be worth at LEAST 35$, and that's not even counting in that HRC prices are over 1600$

🚀

# SHORTS TRYING TO BEAT DOWN $CLF! 🚀

# Look at the chart:

**Price of steel increases over 50% in the same time, but CLF just trades 2$ higher than it did nearly 6 months ago? HOW is that possible?!**

&#x200B;

[2$ in nearly 6 months while the product increases over 50&#37; in price in the same time?!](https://preview.redd.it/uztdva1yt7471.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c97042edaaa86ab560ecb5b3df38357913928cd5)

&#x200B;

How do you explain, that a company that is this big, produces steel for whole america and where the **product price was raised by 50% and PEOPLE ARE STILL GRABBING IT LIKE ITS BLACK FRIDAY**.

&#x200B;

Waiting times on steel orders for big companies are as **over 3 MONTHS** and more with the buyers paying any price the company wants. **That means with the same steel output the company now EARNS 50% MORE per ton of steel than it did in january!**

But the share price only rose 2$ since january, just about 10%? Do you see the problem?? CLF should AT LEAST be trading at 50% more than in january, but obviously, because a company has basic costs (running a furnace, personnel et cetera) - but at some point, with EVERY DOLLAR MORE THE PRODUCT COSTS, THE COMPANY WILL EARN DIRECTLY.

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

Let's say producing a ton of steel costs 500$ in total. If the price of a ton goes to 750, to company makes 250$ profit. If the price goes to 1000$, the company instantly **doubles** it profit, with the steel price just increasing by 50%. Now if the steel price goes to 1500!, the company could make 1000$ profit. **Price doubled from 750$ per tonne, but PROFIT QUADRUPLED!**

Obviously there's a bit more to that, but that's the gist.

# WHY CLF - A CHAD CEO 🚀 🚀 :

# CEO LOURENCO GONCALVES is a fucking stud. HE knows the analysts are wrong and he KNOWS that people are shorting his company. And he WANTS TO FUCKING FUCK EM.

google CLF earnings call transcript

Read what he tells to journalists and analysts:

""**And then you say, well, Lourenco, the clients are complaining that they are not receiving steel. Yes**\[...\]. So they are basically collecting what they pointed for and we are taking good care of some of them, **some others we are not taking care** because I don't believe that they don't, they really even belong.""

**THEY JUST FUCKING DONT CARE about people complaining the prices are too high.**

""**Because we don't need all of this ""opportunistic"" players in the marketplace. They just destroy, complicate, gossip, talk on the phone, send fake information, do everything that we only done in the marketplace.** \[...\]. **So that's what we were working for. We are doing our mandate. We are doing our job. We are working on behalf of the shareholders of the company.**

I won't bore you with a ton of numbers that shows that **CLF is profitable** as FUCK, **undervalued** AS FUCK, have a ton of **CASH** and **shorts fucking with them** all the time. Look at the chart and tell me there is no reason with INSANE steel prices the **stock trades at JANUARY levels.**

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

# TLDR: 🚀

# $CLF is an american company that makes BANK, earns tons of money because steel prices went through the roof and are still trading at levels they were in january, but the product costs 50% more than it did in january. Their CEO is HELLBENT on crushing shortsellers and bad analysts.

# Fair price of $CLF should be at least 35$-40$.

Positions: tons of german call warrants, a load of July 20c calls, Oct 22c calls. About to add more. Obviously no financial advice, I just like the stock.

The DD here is purely looking at WISH as a pure value play and doesn't include any short-squeeze related information.

# Business

To keep it simple,

1. Wish is a global e-commerce platform that facilitates transactions between buyers and sellers.
2. It allows sellers to list their products on Wish and sell directly to consumers.
3. The merchants on the platform primarily offer ***unbranded products that are deeply discounted compared to the alternatives. Most of the merchants/products are from china.***
4. They target customers looking for value goods people with annual income < 75,000 USD, plenty in US and Europe regions accounting for 90% of customers.
5. Wish does not stock the products themselves or manage returns.

# The Team

1. *CEO* [*Piotr Szulczewski*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piotr_Szulczewski) *a former Google Engineer*
2. *Exec chair - Jacky Reses (known for Square and works with Bill Ackman at Pershing square)*
3. *CTO - DannyZhang (Ex- Yahoo, ATT)*
4. *Best in class Technology team of engineers mostly from Facebook and Google*

Hunky dory there are so many e-commerce platforms why is WISH special ?

# Value Proposition

Looks at some of the stats here

[Activity Snapshot](https://preview.redd.it/hp99fuab85471.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&s=14a48935ccd3b4142a9070ac354568d30eab0c10)

WISH platform connects over ***100 million monthly active users in over 100 countries to over 550k global merchants***. Their main motto is to give users an affordable, personalized, and entertaining shopping experience leveraging their in house data science and marketing technologies.

# Value Proposition to Wish Users

The platform excels from the rest by making e-commerce

**Affordable -** Offer unbranded products to value conscious customers at deep discounts

1. **Accessible -**  built as a Mobile first platform for access across the world in 40 different languages
2. **WISH Local -** Partner with 50,000 brick and mortar stores, use them as pick up facilities and also allowing the stores to list their products on the platform

The standout features of the shopping experience

1. **90% of user activity occurs through Mobile App**
2. ***Discovery Based***  **- 70% of the sales on the platform do not come from a search query, meaning the user doesn't come to the platform to buy something that's on his mind but rather ends up buying a product browsing through the platform liking a deal**
3. Their marketing programs are top notch and they use big data technologies and AI in their approach to make it highly personalized. They look at facebook, instagaram, emails and messages to customize their recommendations. ***ok most of you that have seen The social Dilemma on NFLX. you got it.***
4. user experience is engaging and entertaining by having highly personalized feeds. on an ***average users spent over \~ 9 minutes a day*** on their platform in 2020

# What's in for the merchants in addition to being able to sell their products ?

1. access to 100 mil monthly users across 100 countries, digital presence for their stores
2. Through **ProductBoost,** they are able to market their products by paying WISH as ad revenue. **This is very similar to a TinderBoost feature. 30% of merchants use this feature**
3. WISH charges and offers logistics ensuring consistent delivery experience boosting their sales.

# Revenue sources

1. **Core Marketplace** \~ commission on the products being sold on the platform
2. **ProductBoost** \~ marketing ad dollars coming from the merchants
3. **Logistics** \~ providing logistics support to the merchants and getting paid

# Cost and Expenses

They are spending truck loads of money on user acquisition and marketing costs juts like any other early stage e-commerce player. In the long term they expect to spend 40%\~45% of their revenue in this area

&#x200B;

[Expected to be 40&#37;\~45&#37; going forward](https://preview.redd.it/vdxe4acke5471.png?width=393&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5dcbbfe8af527a2dc171ef2febb2a126481c6e9)

# Oppurtunitues Ahead

1. 43% of headcount involved in R&D related activities. Huge opp to drive efficiencies at scale
2. 10,800 wish power users and influencers to market the platform, selected based on their social following, this would heavily propel the customers and merchants growth
3. with covid-19 easing across the world, logistical nightmares would be eased
4. Further scaling of Wish local to bring in more brick and mortar stores on the platform
5. Adding new product categories and higher value products as needed by customers
6. increased spending domestically in US due to monetary easing and stimulus
7. Very solid base of long term customers, look at the chart showing the life time value of the users  from the time they started engaging

https://preview.redd.it/02p5clfaf5471.png?width=458&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d21e4c0151bb62c784714e92477f7fb7a88133a

# Valuation

WISH , still not profitable with an EBITDA loss for Q1 2020 in the range of -60 million equals \~7% sales.

The company doesn not have any financial debt, has \~ $1.5 to$ 2.0 B in cash.

**Looking at their price to sales multiple, the stock is at a heavy discount compared to its peers**

**As of close today,**

|Platform|Price to sales ratio|
|:-|:-|
|ETSY|11.6|
|SHOP|44.44|
|SFIX (stitchfix)|3.844|
|BABA|5.579|
|Avg. Price to sales of 75 Retail (online) sales, data from A.Damodaran from NYU stern|4.52|
|WISH|**2.861**|

with a modest price to sales multiple of 5x, the stock should be trading at \~$24 to be modestly valued compared to other E-Commerce firms.

***TLDR***

*WISH is an undervalued stock play, heavilty discounted compared to its peers. Any price below \~$15 is a joke.*

*I do not care about short interest, Gamma Squeeze but if it helps then bring it on. There were multiple rumors in the past that it's being acquired by Amazon, e-bay. I see institutional intrest to be coming back into the stock.*

*Not selling a single share (1,000 shares at $10.56 avg) until it hits \~45. Might as well hit 60 if there are more WISHes from here.*

**Positions or ban**

&#x200B;

1. Workhorse develops electric trucks and delivery drones.
2. We all know where the future is going with electric vehicles (EV). The people want it, the government wants it, and a lot of private and public money is being poured in to make this happen. Legislation is aiming to make and FORCE this to happen.
3. The government wants zero emissions. Workhorse trucks are already zero-emission. Gas and diesel-powered trucks are not. These petroleum-based vehicles are going to have a tough time catching up.
4. Workhorse has a proprietary system called Metron to help manage its fleet and increase its efficiency. This helps to save costs and increases revenue for companies.
5. Workhorse has developed its integrated drone named Horsefly which works with their trucks (see pictures). The trucks have a control center and charging capabilities. No one can deny that this is the future of commerce and there's no going back. Zero-emissions electric delivery step trucks traveling to a center point and launching their drones to deliver products to customers. Delivery should occur within 30 minutes after being ordered and Workhorse is set up to do this. Is there any retail company that will not benefit from this delivery structure? Think about it, Walmart, Fed Ex, Amazon, UPS, Postal Services, Supermarkets for food delivery, etc?
6. 350,000 delivery trucks are already sold per year according to the New York Times. This number is projected to increase.
7. Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management, who has been very popular lately (google her), had purchased a few million shares for her fund. She has since sold. This may be due to not wanting to hold on to something that is being heavily shorted (more on that below). Her funds have gotten beaten up a bit after hitting their 52-week highs a few weeks ago. Her funds may also be on the receiving end of a process called Organizational Shorting. It's a complex process where market makers unpack and manipulate the positions within her funds and essentially short them. I'm not sure if this adversely affected her funds as I couldn't find any literature on a correlation but something to consider nonetheless.
8. In April, Workhorse more than doubled its production of trucks in comparison to the combined previous three quarters. The Pride Group placed an order for 6230 trucks. That's 6230 trucks equating to several hundreds of millions of dollars!!! That's an enormous number of trucks and that's only from one wholesaler.
9. Workhorse's main problems are with manufacturing and delivery. The reasons why:
10. They're limited in part due to supply chain constraints. There are bottlenecks within the global supply chain and offshore shipping delays of commodity raw materials and components. This has impacted the entire industry, including Ford and GM. This is only TEMPORARY and will get worked out as it always does because every company wants to increase their sales. In addition, Workhorse now has a supply agreement with Coulomb Solutions, Inc. to supply their batteries. This company distributes for the largest EV battery manufacturer in the world.
11. Electric trucks are a relatively new industry. Demand has skyrocketed so Workhorse's capacity to meet this demand has been limited. Recognizing that this will be something difficult for them to achieve, they teamed up with someone who can. They're now partnered with J.B. Poindexter & Co., a leading provider of commercial vehicle bodies. Poindexter has decades of experience with vehicle body engineering, construction, and assembly.
12. There are several EV players. Most only have concepts and prototypes and we know from history that most will likely fail. Workhorse already has actual vehicles and these vehicles have driven millions of miles.
13. Sales for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately $521,000 compared to approximately $84,000 in the first quarter of 2020. That is a significant increase and they are growing rapidly.
14. Recent losses were mainly due to a decrease in the stock price of RIDE, which Workhorse was invested in.
15. The Company had approximately $205.1 million in cash in March 2021. This helps limit the need to acquire debt.
16. The stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a $6 billion contract with the USPS last February. It's now June and the stock price reflects this as the market has already factored this in. This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company. This one-time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor does it mean Workhorse will lose out on other contracts from the USPS or other companies. Furthermore, Workhorse may still win this $6 billion contract as they are fighting it on the legal front. In addition, the USPS Postmaster, Louis DeJoy, who influences the direction of the contract, is being investigated by the FBI for possible fraudulent activity. There is concern that he may have made the decision based on political contributions. Several Ohio Congress members are also requesting a halt on the contract until it's assured that no political influence was asserted in Mr. DeJoy's decision of granting it to Workhorse's competitor. If this contract once again becomes up for grabs, there's a good chance Workhorse will win it. If that happens, watch out because the loss of this contract is what put downward pressure on its stock. Forget the moon, I'm talking about GN-z11, the furthest galaxy from us.
17. Implied volatility has significantly increased resulting in the expensive option pricing you're seeing. This may indicate investors are expecting a big move and this risk is getting priced in.
18. There are 8\* analysts who have recently ranked WKHS. Five recommend a hold and three recommend a buy. NONE recommend a sell. It's unanimous, NONE recommend selling. Some of the analysts' recommend price targets are even $24, $20, $20, and $17. \*Cowen & Co, Colliers Securities, Oppenheimer, Roth Capital, R.F. Lafferty, BTIG, B. Riley Financial, and Wolfe Research.
19. You're helping the environment by investing in this company and you are becoming a part of the future.
20. The stock price is about 30% of its 52-week high.
21. This stock has an AMAZING SHORT SQUEEZE POTENTIAL. It's shorted about 40% of its float. It is one of the most, if not THE MOST, shorted stock out there.

It's very important to understand how a short squeeze works and you can't expect it to happen overnight. It takes discipline as no hedge fund manager is going to capitulate and hand money to you, especially now. The short sellers have borrowed shares to sell which drives the stock price down and they know you get fearful when this happens. They're accustomed to feeling fear because they deal with it every day. They've learned to process this emotion and not act upon it. However, they count on you not having the experience to deal with fear. They're counting on you selling out of fear (the bottom) and buying out of greed (the top). If you wait them out, they will eventually give in because every day you hold they lose money on the interest that they pay when borrowing their short shares. Also, the people lending them shares will not want to assume the risk indefinitely. The bottom line is that you have to hold and buy and not sell. Buying out of the money calls also helps because the market makers who sold you the naked calls need to cover by buying shares to protect themselves as the stock price rises.

So, how to deal with fear?

1. Accept and expect fear to happen because it will. Anticipate it and do not act upon it.
2. Do not invest money that you can't afford to lose. This way you can let it ride.
3. Remember the ups and downs with GME and AMC. AMC was shorted about 20% on its float, it took a while and a lot of ups and downs but look what it eventually did. WKHS is shorted about double the amount of AMC!!!

Also, understand that hedge fund managers DO KNOW MORE about finance than you or I do but they are NO BETTER AT INVESTING than we are. They don't make their money from making good stock picks. They make their money from taking a cut of the money they're investing for other people. They make up fancy words, algorithms, and models to convince their customers to invest with them but overall they can't even beat the Dow. Numerous studies have shown this to be the case and a monkey throwing darts randomly at stock picks is able to beat them. The few that do outperform the market can be explained by the normal outliers of a bell curve distribution. The same distribution happens with us in WSB as it is the natural order of things. Look it up if you don't believe it.

TLDR

1. WKHS is prime for a short squeeze. It is one of the most, if not the most, shorted stock out there.
2. WKHS fundamentals do not look as bad as it is priced. Out of 8 research analysts who follow it, all recommend either a buy or hold and NONE recommend a sell. Price targets for several were at or above $20.
3. Most of the negative aspects of the company have been addressed.
4. Demand for their products has skyrocketed.
5. Don't be lazy, don't TLDR this one, ready the whole thing.

On average, larger fast food franchises have similar costs and similar expenses. They thus also would have similar cash flows. Companies are valued on their future expected cash flows. Let's just not think about anything else.

Here's the deal.

Wendy's Revenue is around 1.4B (according to google and not looking at 10Ks)

McDonald's Revenue is around 21B (same source).

If we take our first assumption into play, then we will think that McDonald's market cap should be 21/1.4 times larger than Wendy's. Simplified, McDonalds should be 15 times larger than Wendys.

&#x200B;

Mcdonald's current market cap: 174B

Wendy's current market cap even after today: 6.2B

&#x200B;

Mcdonalds is currently 28 times larger than Wendys.

&#x200B;

WENDYS IS UNDERVALUED! At a minimum according to this post, Wendy's should have a 28/15 (1.86) times larger market cap than it currently is. That means according to this post, Wendy's fair price is $52.26 AT A MINIMUM!

&#x200B;

This isn't even considering the fact that larger companies are harder to grow, so their future expected cash flows are probably growing at a slower rate than smaller companies. If anything, Wendy's should be HIGHER than $52.26 right now!

&#x200B;

TLDR: $100 WEN IS NOT A JOKE!

&#x200B;

[This. This right here.](https://preview.redd.it/t07yqthg62471.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d07846874e24257fc3b591d94069104f5f3f2ea)

Yes yes, I have a position in this now. It's because it makes perfect sense and it is this point in time where this is ***yet another perfect stock for this sub. Let me explain.***

&#x200B;

**First of all**, Dave & Busters. What does the image above entice? You look at it and you feel an entanglement of nostalgia, taking you back to when you were young. The smell of a large retails space mixed with loud music from hundreds of different arcade games with a little ""credit card"" in your hands. It was essential that you spent your credits efficiently so that you would get the highest ratio of fun per credit. 

&#x200B;

[A future look at Dave & Buster's stock price, circa the future](https://preview.redd.it/10k3mhqg82471.png?width=225&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3f29ab38ab54e9230d8c0540772f1b622cadd16)

**Second, something of more substance,** the pandemic is slowly subsiding and people are generally wanting to get out and get more entertainment. Dave & Busters has survived the pandemic and is slowly emerging as a top candidate for a great runup in the upcoming years. If you think about it, most people are wanting to get out more and have more fun - whether this be people who never cared about the pandemic or people who want to safely (in regards to Coronavirus) have fun. Regardless, Dave & Busters starting to open up more gives value to people by giving them this opportunity and place to gather and enjoy good times again.

&#x200B;

**To build off of the second point with more proof that this is a real trend,** take a look at what I found on google trends. Dave & Busters has slowly been creeping up in % searched relative to other times. Need I say more?

&#x200B;

[A real snippet of \\""dave and busters\\"" search term on Google Trends](https://preview.redd.it/s4voavgq82471.png?width=1594&format=png&auto=webp&s=381089dbd88ef9bf4febe0bebea5f757ca779297)

&#x200B;

**Lastly**, take a look at the market cap. It's only 2 billion dollars. It's a perfect range for the small investor who doesn't want something too small but also doesn't want anything too big. Sure the price is around $44, but what really matters is the market cap. If we compared $PLAY's market cap to something like $BB, $PLAY would only be $3.23!

&#x200B;

As a disclaimer, I'm in at $44 with calls.

&#x200B;

This is not financial advice. I'm not a financial advisor. I just really like this stock and going to Dave & Busters with my friends. ***Do your own research before making any decisions!***"

Here's why.",23,12,2021-06-08 03:46:36,"A couple months ago I cross-posted what I thought was a [neat illustration](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/mco57x/how_much_gains_it_takes_to_recover_from_market/) (below) showing why drawdowns matter sometimes, and thus why a 100% TQQQ (3x QQQ) portfolio is probably not optimal.

Then I've also seen a few posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/modli5/tqqq_is_an_excellent_long_term_investment_even/) recently praising a 100% TQQQ position.

Many incorrectly posit that TQQQ's massive drawdowns simply don't matter because it will always recover. And I even realize why this idea seems intuitive because its leverage would allow it to climb out of the hole faster.

As usual, recency bias is rearing its ugly head.

First, this post has nothing to do with the oft-cited boogeyman of LETFs known as *volatility decay* or *beta slippage* of the fund itself. In short, [it's not as big of a deal as it's made out to be](http://www.ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php). I'm a fan of LETFs. I use them myself and I *do* ""hold them for more than a day.""

Secondly, this is also ignoring the fact that QQQ is basically a tech fund at this point. The market is already over 1/4 tech, and [Growth is looking expensive](https://www.reddit.com/r/M1Finance/comments/ixpset/great_video_for_those_who_like_to_bet_on_large/). I neither own nor recommend owning QQQ or TQQQ. TQQQ just seems to be very popular and is the subject of most of these LETF posts, but this concept could obviously apply to 100% UPRO as well (which I do own).

Drawdowns are the kryptonite here. Here's that graph I mentioned:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p2vt2i2vcw371.png?width=529&format=png&auto=webp&s=f60ac73b94453fac27093d50a3c313bb4f1ea9ca

As a simplistic example using dollars, suppose your $100 portfolio drops by 10% ($10) to $90. You now require an 11% gain to get back to $100.

The stellar soaring of Big Tech over the past decade has resulted in huge inflows into the fund, and its performance during that time looks fantastic. Here's TQQQ's inception in 2010 through 2020, over which time it's up over 5,000%:

&#x200B;

[Source: PortfolioVisualizer.com](https://preview.redd.it/m0jf7h4ydw371.png?width=1798&format=png&auto=webp&s=6dcd0f2ec88933b0e49ce75bb6fa9cadc5c63112)

Looks great, right? But as we know, past performance does not indicate future performance. Moreover, a decade – especially one without a major crash – is a terribly short amount of time from which to draw any sort of meaningful conclusions.

So we need to go back further to get a better idea of how TQQQ performs (or *would have* performed, at least) through major stock market crashes. I created some simulation data so that we can do just that by simulating returns going back further than the fund’s inception. Going back to 1987 - when the NASDAQ 100 started - for TQQQ vs. QQQ tells a somewhat different story:

&#x200B;

[Source: PortfolioVisualizer.com](https://preview.redd.it/2hq53oizcw371.png?width=1788&format=png&auto=webp&s=c264a2ad929157c9036ebae2bc4924f4af780f34)

Notice how buying TQQQ alone is basically a timing gamble that depends heavily on your entry and exit points. Basically, it can take too long for the leveraged ETF to recover after a major crash. After the Dotcom crash of 2000, TQQQ didn’t catch up to QQQ until late 2007 right before it crashed again in the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. Had you bought in January 2000 right before the Dotcom crash, you’d still be in the red today:

&#x200B;

So how can we make it work? We need to mitigate those harmful drawdowns. As usual, diversification is your friend, especially with LETFs. As with the famous Hedgefundie Adventure (Google it), TMF (3x long treasuries) should probably be the primary hedge of choice. (Yes, interest rates falling for the past 40 years has resulted in great performance for long bonds. Whether or not long treasuries will provide the same protection in the future that they have in the past is another conversation, but here we're just looking for an insurance policy for crashes via uncorrelation and hopefully *negative* correlation, even in a low/zero/rising rate environment.)

You can extend this idea with other assets like gold, too, obviously, to further lower volatility and mitigate drawdowns, which is what Bridgewater's All Weather Fund attempts to do.

60/40 TQQQ/TMF for effective 180/120 exposure looks the best historically and dominated the funds held in isolation:

&#x200B;

# What about regular deposits?

The backtests above use a starting balance of $10,000 and no additional deposits. Some will reflexively point out that an investor will usually be regularly depositing into the portfolio and that this would change the results because you can ""bUy ThE dIpS."" Since the market tends to go up (it spends most of its time at all-time highs) and since major crashes are typically infrequent, regular deposits of $1,000/month actually don't change the end result:

I want to start off by saying this is not a post comparing CLOV to GME or AMC. While these stocks have some similarities, particularly being targeted by hedge funds for short squeezes, I’m not going to get into that.

You can also think of this post as a Part 2 to [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/ngesez/this_is_the_bottom_and_youll_be_top_of_the_world/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Brief description of my last post - it was about the stock reaching its bottom at $6.80 and only going up from there (which was correct).

**TL;DR - Currently, the highest number of options purchased have a strike price between $7-18 for every single month. The goal is to stay above $12 to create a snowball of options being executed, thereby causing a gamma squeeze - the higher the strike price, the higher the limit to execute and the hedges are worse off.**

**What Is Clover Health?**

Clover Health is not just another insurance company. They have combined Medicare insurance services with new patient-centered technology aimed at facilitating the ease and effectiveness of diagnosis, treatment, and most importantly, prevention. This company should not be classified as a health insurance company, but a tech company. Their AI learning and database, Clover Assistant, make it easier for providers to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive lab testing, repetitive diagnoses, and it consolidates a patient’s medical history into one platform. This not only saves the patient headaches from navigating our decentralized healthcare system, but it also saves both patients and insurance companies an enormous amount of money by avoiding duplicated efforts. 

Currently, CLOV covers 66,300 customers across 8 states out of the 61,212,247 Medicare beneficiaries nationwide, which equates to .0011% of the beneficiary population. As you can tell, this number is extremely low, which makes sense since they are a brand new company. When they reach even 1% of the beneficiaries, this company’s stock price would be $100+ based on fundamentals alone. But I expect these numbers to skyrocket as they gain more members and their AI learning database improves more and more.

CLOV has huge long-term growth potential, so the risk to reward is extremely favorable towards getting into the squeeze. Let me explain why.

**Positive Catalysts**

All the negative catalysts are out of the way and everything is priced in. Here are some positives I’m keeping an eye on: 

* DOJ/SEC case dropping or settling (even if CLOV is found guilty of taking advantage of Medicare, it will still be positive because at max they’ll pay a fine and that’ll be over with). I highly doubt CLOV will be found guilty though because the Hindenburg claims are rather baseless and the DOJ were forced to inquire about this only because it’s related to Medicare. 
* Biden’s health care proposal reducing the Medicare qualifying age below 65 would create millions of new beneficiaries. The hype around the proposal alone will create a huge stock price increase in all healthcare-related stocks, so CLOV will definitely benefit.
* CLOV is officially added to the Russell 3000, who will have to purchase a ton of CLOV shares.
* PR of any new partnership, expanding to further states, and increasing current partnerships. They’re growing rapidly as is, so news like this is bound to come out in the near future.

**The Dark Clouds Surrounding CLOV**

* As previously mentioned, the DOJ inquiry is still lingering and it’s unclear when it will be settled. Although it’s priced in, it is still something to watch out for.
* Hindenturd’s constant attacks despite insisting they don’t have any positions. Why would Hindenburg attack Chamath Palihapitiya even though they aren’t benefiting from it, according to themselves? This relates to the GME/AMC squeeze; Chamath was a big proponent of the push against the hedges. He was outspoken about the squeeze on several occasions and gave GME his validation, which in turn hurt Citadel and other hedges shorting GME immensely. Hindenburg’s report was created to hurt all of Chamath’s IPOs, especially CLOV. Basically, this is retaliation against Chamath for standing with the retail investors, and if I had to take a wild guess, Citadel has paid Hindenburg to write this baseless report. I’ve added a link at the bottom of this post about the Hindenburg allegations and the counter from CLOV for those who were not aware of all the allegations. (PS - Despite all the negative press surrounding Chamath, his track record is stellar.)
* The constant manipulation by short sellers to create negative incentive. For instance, the fake lawsuits by Lifshitz that are shady at best; if you go to their website, you’ll find the phone number listed goes straight to voicemail. All their social media lead to Wix.com platforms instead of their own. And, **THEIR PHYSICAL LOCATION DOES NOT EXIST** as shown in Google Maps. Lots of red flags.

**Let’s get down to the nitty gritty - The Daddy of all Short Squeezes**

CLOV is currently over 42.58% as of Friday, making it the highest shorted stock on paper (and it’s unclear how many naked shorts there are, which could easily be 70-100%+; it’s impossible to know since those shares are shorted illegally). THE SQUEEZE IS INEVITABLE, it’s just a matter of how much more the short interest increases, which will correlate to a bigger squeeze. Furthermore, the borrowed interest on CLOV stock has more than doubled to 3.7%, meaning those who are shorting have to pay much higher interest on borrowing the stocks, and that number will only continue to increase as demand increases. Soon, they won’t be able to borrow anymore stocks and will have to short it naked in order to suppress the price further, essentially digging a gargantuan hole in which to bury themselves.

[CLOV S\/I&#37; as reported by Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/yem0laz57q371.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0602994d6bc0ddc1305c2737a8b1d70de3f7c58)

No need to fear the company dumping their shares or diluting it because the Class B shares are locked up - the directors aren’t able to sell any shares until the stock price stays above $30 for 90 consecutive days or more. The company is $700 million cash flow positive and no debt, therefore there won’t be any dilution.

The P/S ratio is considered a particularly good metric for evaluating young, potentially high growth companies or companies in cyclical industries that may not show an actual net profit every year. Let’s talk about CLOV’s P/S ratio for a moment. 

CLOV’s 2020 revenue was $672.9 million compared to $462.3 million in 2019, which puts it at 45.6% increase in growth. They beat their own expectations and those of analysts by a wide margin. In 2018 and 2019, the market valued tech companies with IPOs at an average of 11.7 and 10.4 times (respectively) their previous 12 month earnings. Conservatively, that would put CLOV at $7 billion market cap, which is around $20+ fair value. But in 2020, that number doubled, which would increase CLOV’s market cap significantly. However, for this consideration, I’m using the 2018/19 valuation to be conservative.

**Bottom Line**

The fair value of CLOV is anywhere from $20-30 fundamentally, which makes it a very risk-free, undervalued stock that has been suppressed by short sellers. But this post is not about the fundamentals - this is about exposing the short sellers’ manipulation of CLOV. On paper, this company is shorted 42.58% (though this is MUCH higher when you include the illegal naked shorts that aren’t reported), making it the highest shorted stock as of Friday. This number could go much higher as short sellers continue to borrow stocks and suppress the price further, which only hurts them more the longer this is shorted. As is common knowledge from previous squeezes, hedge funds are not going to cover anytime soon; they have to be forced by triggering their margins. As the Fed hinted recently, hedge funds are the most leveraged they’ve ever been in the last 20 years, which means retail investors can take advantage of them just like they’ve been taking advantage of retail investors for 100s of years.

I don’t know how much it could squeeze, from $50-150 or much higher, and there’s no telling where the ceiling will end up. The squeeze is inevitable, whether you or I buy it or not, but the process of how long it will take is up to the retail investing community.

This stock could be your ride or die, and TELL is the kind of partner that will have hot 🍗tendies on the table when you get 🏡 .

🐒Fun Fact: Did you know Liquid Natural Gas is used as Rocket Fuel? Well it is, and that is super neat!!!


 A quick re-cap on 🚀TELL
———————————-
“Tellurian Inc (TELL) is a liquefied natural gas (LNG) development company headquartered in Houston, TX. TELL plans to develop a 27.6 mtpa LNG terminal with five plants near Lake Charles, LA, as well as upstream assets and pipeline infrastructure. The initial stage will likely include 3 plants (16.6 mtpa capacity). The Driftwood project will be financed by equity customers/partners as well as project debt financing. Tellurian will own 28%-42% of Driftwood Holdings and 100% of Tellurian Marketing.""

Tellurian is a market disruptor with their proposed Driftwood Project, which will make them the first end-to-end (well for the production company, pipeline network for transportation, terminal LNG for exporting) exporter with an at-cost LNG acquisition independent of domestic Henry Hub (HH) as they'll be selling primarily on Japanese Korean Marker (JKM) at this time. 
——U/V3capitol

 🤔What is this 🪵Driftwood🪵???

Essentially it is a pipeline, some of you may have heard of the Deals that have been signed recently(I will get back to these later) the Driftwood Pipeline is the vehicle that supplies these deals. The Driftwood Dream has been going since 2016, it would seem we are on the cusp of making that dream a reality. 
This summer we should be seeing some press release on infrastructure build out related to the actual pipeline 🏗 construction 🚧🦺 . Q1 2022 is the projected date for FID and when the pipes might be laid😉

Driftwood has permits, the company(Betchel) to build it, and a team that has done it before. Shovel Ready is the term here

When the construction starts the floodgates will be open and this stock will 🚀🌙. Reference a stock like Cheniere(trading @ 87.35), a company Charif Souki used to work for, so you can get an idea. Speaking of Charif Souki let’s take a peak at the team.

———————————

🌟🌟**All-Star Management**🌟🌟

Tellurian has 2 of 3  pioneer LNG founders that developed the largest Natural Gas companies.

Charif Souki - Chairman - LNG Godfather and Legend, who was the founder of Cheniere Energy in 1996. If they can do it once, they can do it again.

Octávio M.C Simoes - CEO - ""Previously, he was President and CEO of Sempra LNG &amp; Midstream where he was responsible for all LNG and natural gas midstream activities in Sempra’s efforts to develop, build and operate liquefied natural gas (LNG) receipt terminals, liquefaction facilities, natural gas pipelines and storage facilities.""

This team can and will get it ✅

 
🐒Fun Fact # 2 : So you don’t think LNG is cool? 

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas that has been cooled to a liquid state, at about -260° Fahrenheit( now that is pretty cool❄️if you ask me)for shipping and storage. The volume of natural gas in its liquid state is about 600 times smaller than its volume in its gaseous state. This process makes it possible to transport natural gas to places pipelines do not reach.




The Deals📑💸

Right now TELL💥 has  2 👬of them Vitol and Guvnor, each worth 12 Billion💵 over the next 10 years. So 2.4 Billion per year in revenue with these alone. We can expect to hear a couple more deals announced in the next month. 

These deals are what have people so excited for this stock as of late, and rightly so!

I know what your 🤔 thinking, so what!?!🤷🏽‍♀️ “Without that pipeline they will not get any of that money. “

Well to the skeptics🛸🗿🔦 I would ask this: Why would these companies be signing deals without doing their due dilligence? I mean here I am doling out info, and my opinions on this company, but don’t take my word for it. Take the word of the not 1 but 2 companies that are going to dish out billions. 💵💴
 

Something I am sure many people are thinking....🥱🤔

🦕🦖Fossil Fuels are so last century! Why would I invest in LNG🌋? I should invest in 🌞solar and 🌪wind and blah blah blah.

Well you are not wrong if your talking about coal and oil⛽️.

Natural Gas is going to stay relevant though. Here are some reasons why:

*$* Developing countries can not afford solar and all the fancy smancy tech energy. They will continue to be buyers for a long time to come. Remember 🚀TELL exports🚢⚓️ LNG, “Global Basis”🌎

*$* Demand continues to increase on a “Global Basis” https://www.forbes.com/sites/judeclemente/2021/06/04/the-worlds-liquefied-natural-gas-market-is-roaring-back/

*$*Carbon capture for this industryis set to play a significant role in how countries view LNG. https://www.worldoil.com/news/2021/5/6/us-lng-players-tout-carbon-capture-in-bid-to-boost-green-image

*$* LNG is being used in 🛳cruise ships and 🚀🛸space ships🛰.  Most restaurants use it to cook as well, if you ate food cooked outside your house there is a strong chance it was cooked with LNG. That is just so neat!

*$* 🍸Warren Buffet🍸 bet 9.7 Billion on the long future of LNG. https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/19/why-warren-buffett-is-betting-on-pipelines-evern-as-climate-fears-rise.html

*$* Google future of LNG, check out the demand for it. LNG is getting real, really fast.


Some Price 🎯 
—————
$1 just in asset valuation - Acquisition of Magellan Petroleum Corporation (Haynesville Gas Production Well) is valued $400M.

2021 - March/July = $4-$10 - Deals announced gap-up (3B valuation / 409M shares). $7.34

2021 - September or FID announced = $12 - 5B in capital in (5B valuation / 409M shares) $12.22

2024 = $37 at Stage 1 Project completion (15B in valuation / 409M shares).

2025/2026/Mid-decade will see a peak in Demand/Supply pricing where LNG company's valuations could get frothy.

Future: 40% capacity equals $70 a share

Future: 100% capacity equals $120 a share

Max would be 100B valuation / 409M shares at $245. Equity partners could comprise 60% of equity that would eat into total available shares.

🐒Fun Fact #3 : LNG from landfill gas.   LNG can also be derived from landfill gas. At a landfill near Livermore, California, landfill gas converted into LNG is being used as fuel to power trash collection vehicles. The plant can produce up to 13,000 gallons of LNG per day from landfill gas, enough fuel for 300 LNG powered collection trucks across 20 California communities. This technology not only turns waste into a renewable energy source, but it also benefits the environment due to the significant reduction in fuel emissions produced by the garbage truck fleet. (Source: http://EarthandIndustry.com: Article: Developing Clean Fuels from Landfill Gas, Wes Muir, 11/23/10)

So here we are. I hope you enjoyed the read. Maybe you decide to invest in some shares or makes some plays, that would be swell. Tellurian 🚀is great for both!

ntc52w,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntc52w/zip_dd/,ZIP DD,0,22,2021-06-06 11:05:48,"First off this is not financial advice; just my personal opinion on a recent IPO that has a lot of room to run. ZIPRecruiter (ZIP) is undervalued and in the sweet spot of a massive secular trend; my DD has me convinced that this stock could break out.
 
First off, it’s important to realize that pretty much every employed person in America is considering a job change now that the pandemic is easing up. For the past year and a half, people have stuck it out in terrible jobs mostly because they were happy to have stable employment at the time, and also nobody was hiring. Now that the economy is taking off and companies are trying to hire again, most workers are going to test the waters. Recent estimates from Microsoft are that 40% of US employees will switch companies this year, and other surveys found that at least 26% of workers leave their companies will find new work. Experts are calling it the “Great Resignation of 2021”. The numbers are impossible to predict, but just think about all the people in your own friend groups that have been complaining about their jobs for months and are trying to make a change.
https://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-great-resignation-of-2021-are-30-of-workers-really-going-to-quit/ 
 
So if you agree that the labor markets are unfrozen and people will be taking advantage of it, how can you make money off it? Look at the software companies that will power/enable this big trend. Staffing / recruiting companies that offer this as a service will benefit, but they don’t scale well. If Manpower Group or Kelley Services has an extra 10 job applicants, they may need to hire an extra recruiter (costs go up as revenues go up). With software platforms, the new job applicants add volume with no incremental costs. 

The biggest recruiting tool of all is LinkedIn, but that’s owned by MSFT and is just a sideshow to their main business. Other large software players in the HR Tech space have recruiting tools, such as GOOG, SAP, WDAY, ADP, CDAY, etc – but again the recruiting platform is on the periphery of what they do... so not a core competency of any big players. Besides these guys, the market is fragmented. There are thousands of job boards, recruiting firms, talent agencies and staffing companies that will help match applicants to companies, but there is only one standalone software company that focuses on recruiting that is publicly traded: ZIP.
https://ideal.com/top-recruiting-software/
 
How does ZIP make money and why do they stand out? The platform is free for individual people to look for jobs, but companies will sign up for recurring accounts where they create jobs and post them into the platform. ZIP is a job aggregator, meaning it takes the job posting and replicates this on thousands of job boards across the world, and then brings back quality candidates to the companies. For employees, it will match you with dozens of roles based on what you are looking for. And because most jobs are virtual/remote now, this software opens up new roles and opportunities that previously a person wouldn’t have considered.
 
Now here’s where it really gets interesting. ZIP went public a few weeks through a direct listing, with no fanfare or hype. Unless you really follow the HR software IPO market, you wouldn’t even know that this happened. Shares currently trade around $24 and the company has a market cap of $2.5B.

ZIP has an EV/Rev ratio of ~9x, which is under the big players above: MSFT = 10x, CDAY = 14x, WDAY = 11x, etc… meaning it’s cheaper to buy a share of ZIP than a fully diversified software company that has products in multiple categories. If recruiting is going to grow gangbusters this year as the economy rebounds, how come ZIP is trading at a discount to larger companies that have smaller expected growth rates?
 
I’m not a professional stock picker, so this is just my speculation, but I think there are 4 reasons why ZIP isn’t getting any love (yet)

1. They are too small. $2.5B market cap is a rounding error to a company like MSFT, GOOG, or WDAY.
2. In 2020, ZIP had a negative growth year (2019 revenues of $430M went down (3%) in 2020 to $418M). Professional investors don’t like that, especially when every other software company went gangbusters in 2020. Well let’s dig into that… why did ZIP’s revenue decrease in 2020? BECAUSE NOBODY WAS LOOKING FOR JOBS AND COMPANIES WEREN’T HIRING NEW PEOPLE. It was a pandemic and nobody was doing anything except watching netflix. 
3. The company had a Q1 earnings call in between filing the IPO paperwork but before the stock was trading. Management had a lot of great things to say (they basically argued that this is an unprecedented time in the recruiting market and they are well poised to capture it), but I honestly don’t think anyone was paying attention
4. On the earnings call, the management said that Q2 is going to be huge (80% growth when compared to Q2 2020) but then the second half of the year could ramp down if people stop switching jobs. Perhaps analysts didn’t like that, but isn’t that obvious? As long as the economy keeps picking up steam, ZIP is going to do well.
 
TL/DR – ZIP is a stock worth taking a look at; I feel they will fly under the radar until Q2 earnings when they will explode. I’m not a financial advisor, so do you your own research too. I LIKE THE STOCK!! I picked up 1200 shares last week."

This report is purely for entertainment purposes and should not be considered investment advice. Do your own research and due diligence.**

Hello again, everyone.

After my [analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/nhhov7/cruise_ship_stocks_fundamental_comps_analysis/) of cruise ship stocks, it was refreshing to pour through companies with such strong financials. However, with healthy income statements and balance sheets come high, perhaps overly optimistic valuations. I expected that the stock price of most of these companies would be completely divorced from their near-future expected financials, and I was mostly correct, but there are still a couple of buying opportunities I am excited to share.

After analyzing a list of some of the strongest e-commerce players in the world, I found 2 companies where I believed there is a value opportunity: Alibaba and eBay.

I had expected any Alibaba buying opportunity to have been completely swallowed given that every analysis, comment, and post I see about the stock is centered around how now is a great time to buy and how many institutions are buying, but the stock is still at a level where I would consider buying.

The opportunity which suits me and my portfolio better, and the one which I have provided some additional DD on is, eBay. I won't spoil too much, but I was really excited to dive into this company, and everything I found made me lean more into buying. I was able to discover what I consider to be compelling evidence that the company is undervalued, why the stock is undervalued, and reason to believe that the price will rise to fair value in the near-term. I made a purchase of eBay stock after my research, and I do not own any of the other companies listed. I purchased the stock at the beginning of the week, and it has had a fortunate run-up since then, but the difference between the price today and my fair value estimate, $65 -> $71 does not hit as hard as $60 ->71.

A quick note on my DD. I don't often put this sort of research down on paper, so this is halfway (at most) between a competent report and stream-of-consciousness research. If I wanted to look into something, I went and did it, then took down the notes and worried about formatting almost not at all. If anything is unclear, spelled wrong, or doesn't make sense, let me know and I'll go edit. I did some editing of course, but I might've missed something!

**My Due Diligence on eBay**

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S8SRRHtQ4HTdZydy83yYbz-b1CqNUeqiVJObXIawIKQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S8SRRHtQ4HTdZydy83yYbz-b1CqNUeqiVJObXIawIKQ/edit?usp=sharing)

**Methodology**:

* Created a three-statement model for Alibaba Group Holding Limited, Shopify Inc., Amazon. com Inc., JD .com Inc., Sea Limited, MercadoLibre Inc., eBay Inc., and Walmart Inc.,
* Combined these with a WACC build-up to create an unlevered DCF and derived a fair-value-per-share estimate using a growth in perpetuity and an exit EBITDA multiple approach
* Spread comparable companies (the companies listeD)
* Combined results from DCF and select comps valuations to arrive at fair value estimates

**How to use the model**

* Anywhere you see blue text is OK to edit, and should not result in breaking anything. Green text = taken from another worksheet, so if you want to change one of those cells I recommend following the trail first
* To make meaningful changes to the 3-statement-model, scroll to the bottom of each ""Financials"" page to tweak assumptions about revenue growth, GPM, and other assumptions. You can also adjust the specifics for each case scenario from here
* I have tried to supply useful assumptions about terminal growth rates and exit EBITDA multiples in the DCF models. Feel free to adjust as needed, keeping in mind the model is very sensitive to these inputs
* WACC buildup can be done however you want. If you have access to a Bloomberg terminal you can get a better adjusted beta than I used, and a more precise cost of debt (more on that below), or you can just use the override cell to put in a WACC% directly
* Trading Comps Input essentially works to arrive at normalized multiples before converting to an output. Do not be intimidated by non-Gaap disclosures. Everything here is available on annual reports, quarterly reports, and press releases.
* For trading comps outputs, simply toggle the companies in column B until you have the company you wish to analyze in the first position, and the other comps below it, then head to Valuation Matrix to see the results.
* Feel free to adjust the assumptions, there are a lot of them
* If you can think of an assumption better than something I have here, or if you spot a mistake let me know!

**Other Notes:**

* Some of these companies have assumptions that I have baked in which should be scrutinized. I would highly recommend against jumping straight to the DCF/val matrix and instead take some time to adjust the assumptions. You may not agree with my findings and theses (plural for thesis?) so play safe!
* The 2 irl people I showed my work to asked me to rank the companies in order of which stocks I like the most. For me, the value-based & forward-looking rankings are 1. EBAY 2. BABA 3.AMZN 4. WMT 5. SHOP 6. JD 7. SE 8. MELI
* JMIA was considered for the list, but the financials the company publishes are lacking in depth, and I get a little squeamish when a company has ""technologies"" in its name, so I let it go. Jumia is a very interesting company though, worth looking into if you're not afraid of some sovereign/political risk.
* MELI appears to have a shorter payables turnover than receivables. Thumbs down.
* I Imported the model from excel to Google Sheets before sharing, so if something is broken, let me know so I can go in and fix it ASAP
* Used 10Y YTM bond data on FINRA when possible to arrive at assumptions for cost-of-debt used in WACC build-up. If you have access to a bloomberg terminal you can grab the bond with the best volume and use that.
* I apologize for ambiguity (especially on the non-gaap stuff) but I couldn't figure out how to remove my name from the comments quickly (if you know how to do this, other than going one-by-one through each comment, let me know and I'll reupload). Most comments were simply memos to myself to remember what each cell consists of beyond the label (i.e., components of ""other current assets"")
* A thousand more things. If you want to know just ask.

**I own EBAY stock. This report is purely for entertainment purposes and should not be considered investment advice. Do your own research and due diligence.**

Allow me to introduce you to a company with boomer level fundamentals that took a haircut during the pandemic and is set to fucking explode. 


The company name is Tellurian, ticker is $TELL.


--------MY KNOWLEDGE AND BACKGROUND----------

Even though I have a double digit IQ, I am in charge of keeping energy producers from blowing up, spilling fuck loads of oil, catching shit on fire, and/or keeping seafood fresh and hydrocarbon free. I've been in the business for many moons. I have dealt with MANY companies. I’ve seen MANY business types, I have seen transitions in business models as producers have dealt with energy price crashes. I work directly with company executives all the way down to operators and hands. I like talking to everyone and absorbing as much knowledge as I can, even though I’m mentally retarded.

Even though you morons can’t read, have your wife’s/gf’s boyfriend read this to you and DRILL it in your fucking smooth brain: LIQUID NATURAL GAS (LNG) DEMAND IS RISING AND WILL CONTINUE TO RISE FOR THE NEXT DECADE (“dEcAde” is a period of ten years for you single digit IQ fucks) AND BEYOND. LNG will be the “transition” fuel between dirtier energy sources and ""green"" energy. This transition is coming sooner than we think. 


Are you following?


What's this LNG, you might ask. You need to liquefy gas (basically “concentrating” it) so that it becomes economical to ship overseas. Overseas markets for LNG is massive and growing. Seriously look it up, EU, China, and others are increasingly relying on the stuff. It’s much more expensive for them to produce than the US.

When a producer (the company that puts together millions of dollars to drill a well) drills for oil, if your drill and zone prediction (a “zone” is the area that a geologist, paid for by the producer, finds to contain oil) is correct, 99% of the time, three products will flow to the earth’s surface in your process. These three are water, oil, and NATURAL GAS. Producers will separate oil and water dispose of this waste water into a disposal well thousands and thousands of feet deep. Producers will then sell the oil.… What happens to the gas?? Well, if the producer is lucky, there will be a pipeline within a mile or two of their well. They will have to pay WAY over 200K to 500K just welding a mile of gas pipeline to tie into this sales line then pay 100 to 250K for a LACT unit. This is why oilfield welders have fewer IQs than I do but make $150/hr, depending upon pipeline wall thickness (dependent upon flowing pressures and how safe the producer wants to be if not bound by DOT regulations)

If these costs aren’t too high, and the well is producing as much product as expected, then great, they sell gas. However, if they're producing less oil than predicted, or they're producing thousand of barrels of water per day, their disposal costs will be so high, they can’t afford to build the pipeline, they will just burn the stuff. Seriously, I can not tell you HOW MUCH GAS IS JUST BURNED. The VAST majority of producers just “flare” the gas. Just the “flare” vessel is like $30K. Imaging paying $30K to burn LNG that's worth 100s of thousands of dollars. I worked in the Permian basin in West Texas. Anyone here with this experience can vouch for me. At night, in the Permian, the sky is literally lit up with these flares. It’s like you're a goddamn ant on a fucking birthday cake that’s for both for your great great great mothers and her boyfriend’s birthday (basically a shit load of candles). It’s an amazing sight.

­---------wWhY dO tHeY DoO WasTE gAAS??------------------

You’re in the middle of fucking NOWHERE. You’d have to run hundreds of miles of pipeline to sell the gas. This would cost more than drilling the well. No company in their right mind would do this. The only options is to flare it. This one company I was working for was burning over 100K worth of natural gas per MONTH PER WELL, they had FIVE wells. The US just burns the crap, we can produce it so cheap, it just makes more sense to burn it rather than bothering to sell it. Gas is a nuisance to us. Other countries would die for it. There is actually new technologies that converts LNG into GASOLINE for cars. If you’re a stupid brain dead fuck who doesn't believe me, fucking Google it. 



-------So what about this TeLlUriAn coMpaNIee?-----------

Charif Souki started Tellurian. If you don’t know who he is, he is a LNG god. He was a banker on Wall St, highest paid CEO years ago, pioneered the LNG industry. He and his team are impeccable. If you want to build a LNG empire, you hire Souki, if you want to know the future of hydrocarbon energy, you hire Souki, if you want a new boyfriend for your wife, you hire Souki. He built Cheniere Enerny (about 2 hours from my house), a company with $10billion in revenue and is trading $80/share. 
He was fired because Carl Ichan was a complete bully. The business was not being built to Soukies vision. Soukie took the best staff members along with him and started Tellurian. Can you imagine their trust in this guy? Leaving an established company to start a new one... LNG business model is requiring a change and Soukie realizes this. It will need to be produced at less cost, current business models aren’t sustainable. Cheniere Energy is over 20 BILLION dollars in debt. Yes, $20 BILLIOOONNNNNNNN. Guess how much debt Tellurian has? ZERO, NONE, $0.00. This is UNHEARD of in a new company in this industry. 

Tellurian just signed a 10 BILLION dollar purchase agreement from ONE company. TELL is currently talking deals with at least 4 other companies. This 10 billion dollar deal is a 10 year agreement. This is 1 billion per year. Their current market cap is just over 1 billion. Do you realize yet how undervalued this company is?? It’s mind blowing. They begin their Driftwood facility construction in Louisiana this summer. This will be the terminal to export LNG, 32 billion dollar project.

Do you know whats even better?? They wont completely rely on third party producers selling them gas to liquefy, BECAUSE THEY DRILL AND PRODUCE THEIR OWN GAS. They started drilling again after a brief pause due to covid-19. We pay for monthly reports of all producers who receive state permits for drilling. Just this month Tellurian has TWO permits.

Souki uploads regularly to YouTube (seriously what other major high level executive does this??), he was on Jim Cramers show multiple times, Jim Cramer was always contrary to Souki’s predictions, and SOUKI ALWAYS turned out RIGHT. Look it up, these are Jim Crammer’s words, NOT mine. Just a day or two ago, Souki said in his YouTube video “we are preparing for the ride of a lifetime.” I assume this is his way of telling us “buy in now you fucking retards” without being fined by the SEC.

------------HOW is ThiS LIKE GME, AMC, BB?-----------------

THE SHORT POSITIONS OMG YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS BY NOW. IT’S 17%!! Most of these positions were taken out at pandemic start. The joke is on them, Tellurian paid off their debts during their worst time HAHAHAHAHA. There WILL be a short squeeze. These shorts have no fucking clue about this dream team, the true depth of industry, and future of LNG production. 


---------------------hOw MuchH CanI MAKe?---------------------

At the VERY VERY least, I’m betting we run to pandemic level of $10-11/share (REMEMBER THIS WAS BEFORE THEY EVEN SIGNED ANY PURCHASE AGREEMENTS!!!). Calls are still cheap.



------------------------------PROOFS----------------------------------lll--------

Tl;dr - undervalued company with no debt and unlimited potential in energy industry with a middleman position to the transition to clean energy WITH SHORT POSITIONS about to lift off. Will double in price AT LEAST if not liftoff exponentially to the goddamn moon.

So here are some Google Trends comparison examples with companies offering similar services, to show that SoFi could easily be considered undervalued at 25$:

&#x200B;

**SoFi vs. Sallie Mae**

[5.3x the interest](https://preview.redd.it/30vimog901371.png?width=1663&format=png&auto=webp&s=031a801e278694e5af103d6c827b9700ff8995de)

Sallie Mae's valuation is 6.5B, so by this metric SoFi should be valued at \~34.5B.

&#x200B;

**SoFi vs. Charles Schwab**

[0.74x the interest](https://preview.redd.it/ae6l7x5x11371.png?width=1661&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4bbef09bb686395ade59047a7d957aa4ea0269c)

Charles Schwab's valuation is 141B, so by this metric SoFi should be valued at \~104B.

&#x200B;

**SoFi vs. Citibank**

[0.25x the interest](https://preview.redd.it/d1vhkxyo21371.png?width=1659&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1467c5ab3fd0377cb44315cf37ea68a4c52c607)

Citibank's valuation is 165B, so by this metric SoFi should be valued at \~41B.

&#x200B;

**SoFi vs. Progressive Insurance**

[1.1x the interest](https://preview.redd.it/0cickod561371.png?width=1659&format=png&auto=webp&s=aafd3c4e9286dd8139a8c48cff3725c5abf79b73)

Progressive's valuation is 59B, so by this metric SoFi should be valued at \~65B.

&#x200B;

**SoFi vs. MasterCard**

[0.24x the interest](https://preview.redd.it/fqbvt2po61371.png?width=1659&format=png&auto=webp&s=87449d63732db30773a0f30c2e0f221c7ac92816)

MasterCard's valuation is 364B, so by this metric SoFi should be valued at \~87B.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Of course since SoFi offers all of the services which those comparison companies only offer collectively, it's hard to say what portion of the search interest comes from people going to SoFi for insurance, student loans, credit cards, or other specific products. With that in mind I think the best estimate would be to just average these five valuations, which is \~66B. That would be well over triple the current valuation.

Allow me to summarize:

1. Workhorse develops electric trucks.
2. We all know where the future is going with electric vehicles. The people want it, the government wants it, and a lot of private and public money is being poured in to make this happen. Legislation is aiming to make and force this to happen.
3. The government wants zero emissions. Workhorse trucks are already zero-emission. Gas and diesel-powered trucks are not. These companies are going to have a tough time catching up.
4. Workhorse has a proprietary system to help manage its fleet and increase its efficiency. This helps increase revenue.
5. Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management, who has been very popular lately (google her), has purchased a few million shares for her fund
6. In April, Workhorse **more than doubled its production** of trucks in comparison to the **combined previous three quarters**. The Pride Group placed an order for 6230 trucks. That's **6230!!! That's an enormous amount of trucks.** They couldn't produce this because of global limitations. There is a bottleneck within the global supply chain in part due to offshore shipping delays of commodity raw materials and components. This has affected the entire industry, including Ford and GM. This is only **TEMPORARY** and will get worked out as it always does because every company wants to sell and make money.
7. Sales for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately $521,000 compared to approximately $84,000 in the first quarter of 2020. That is a significant increase.
8. The Company had approximately $205.1 million in cash in March 2021. This helps limit the need to acquire debt.
9. The stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a $6 billion contract with the USPS. This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company. This one-time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor does it mean Workhorse will lose out on other contracts from the USPS or other companies.
10. 350,00 delivery trucks are sold per year according to the New York Times. This number will most likely increase.
11. Calls with a strike price of $15 for Jun 18, 2021 had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options. This may mean investors may be expecting a big move.
12. You're helping the environment by investing in this company.
13. **MOST IMPORTANTLY, this stock has about a 40% short of its float.** You want to give it to the hedge funds and the short sellers? You want to get in early on a short squeeze? This is the opportunity to make it happen. AMC was shorted about 20% on its float and look what it did. **WKHS is shorted about doubled that!!!**

TLDR

Workhorse (WKHS) is a highly-shorted (nearly 40%) stock with the potential for a very lucrative future. It is still priced pretty low. There is tremendous potential for gains here. Someone please try and prove me wrong. I beg you to try and prove me wrong.

npdb1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/npdb1j/z_will_disrupt_most_aspects_of_the_industry_that/,$Z will disrupt most aspects of the industry that has one of the biggest addressable markets (TAM),151,80,2021-06-01 05:02:59,"I am in the daily thread way too much and I have heard many times that many folks would like to see more quality DD on non-MEME stonks.  I stated a couple weeks ago that I was going to do one on Zillow.  I was able to stop shit posting just long enough to give this a try.

I will include some numbers and links to most everything I lay out in this post, but much of will be anecdotal along with just how much I personally think of the company overall and how I use it. I am not a TA guy personally but do like trends.  

$Z is ubiquitous to real estate (RE) as is $GOOG to search and $ZM for video conferencing.  It has grown and become a part of pop culture https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEfsaXDX0UQ I am also in the insurance business and the top search result anytime you enter a physical address in Google the $Z listing for the property is the top result and we can glean any information needed to be3 able to do an accurate home insurance quote.  With the shortage in the housing market, people and families moving more, and the work from home trend continuing, $Z will be at the forefront of the change and disruption that I believe will only accelerate at a pace that will surprise many in my opinion.  

The first disruption I will cover is $Z Property Manager.  From my own personal experience, it is the greatest thing to come along.  I have moved houses in the same city 6 times in 10 years, was in the lake cabin market for many of those years along w having 5 rental properties.  First, the marketing alone from $Z has provided the best and most quality applicants for the rental units.  $Z simultaneously puts your property on $Z, Trulia, and Hot Spots.  Craigslist is nonexistent in this space now (at least in my area) and while $FB marketplace is decent; it does not come close to competing w $Z.  Last 8 tenants have all come from $Z marketing.  It does not stop there either.  Once you get an applicant $Z rental manager allows you take applications, accept applications, and once accepted set up all payments electronically – all online and seamlessly.  They will even screen applicants for public records, credit, and criminal history.  The lease process is so simple using your own documents and easily insert data, initials, and signatures wherever needed.  $Z is now charging (monetizing) the marketing of rentals and I have no doubt they will be able to do so more for all facets of the rental process and I would not blink an eye as long as it is reasonable.  Mobile app is easy to use for all parties from my experience.  Customer service has been top notch on the 3 occasions I have had any questions. https://www.zillow.com/rental-manager/

The numbers have been fantastic.  $Z acquired it’s closest competitor Trulia in 2015 https://www.inman.com/2015/02/17/zillow-trulia-merger-closes/ $Z is coming out of the hyper growth at all costs phase of their business and is now actually making revenue while at the same time still plowing billions back into their business and growing sectors and disruptors at an alarming rate.  $Z current share prices is $117.32, off 43.6% its 52 week high of $208.11.

$Z reported 4th Q 2/10/21 and absolute blew past any and all expectations.  My rough research had $Z moving from about $164 to $194 on this report and it had ran up nicely up to earnings.  In my opinion, it then sold off after this in the general tech sell off that started very close to this reporting date.  I wont list all the numbers here, but here they are for you to peruse https://investors.zillowgroup.com/investors/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/Zillow-Group-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results/default.aspx

$Z Q1 2021 earnings report was another beast of a report in my opinion, especially the EPS of $.44 beating expectations by 83% https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/zillow-group-zg-q1-earnings-revenues-beat-estimates-2021-05-05

I believe in addition to what is laid out here, that $Z will disrupt how RE is transacted in the future w iBuying division https://blog.qualia.com/spencer-rascoff-zillow/ , but not only that $Z could disrupt the appraisal industry and mortgage industry in the future as well.  I believe all these sectors need to change and that $Z will be the lead agent to do so.

$Z share price has not been this low since Dec 2020, it looks like it has consolidated to me and ready to run and never look back.  TipRanks has an analyst price target of $172.62, an increase of 46% from current share price https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/zg/earnings-calendar YahooFinance! has a 2.2 buy rating and a price target of $184.56, representing an increase of 57.3% over current share price  https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/Z?p=Z&.tsrc=fin-srch

Obviously, there is way more information out there and analysis then provided for in here, but I wanted to do a DD on something I believe in that isn’t mentioned on WSB much that I have seen and I believe has tremendous long term viability and growth ahead of it.
Don’t ever invest based on what some dude on the internet says and I have been long in $Z for a long time and plan to only grow that position:
Sold some shares over a week ago to buy a LEAPS Jan 2023 $100 strike and have 50 shares.  Plan is to sell CCs over the LEAPS at some point and to pick up more shares/LEAPS.

I have been compiling this long enough and time to go grill some steaks.  Good luck!

Edit 6/1 just sold a $110 CSP 6/18 for $3.50 on margin. I really believe my DD 😉"

Every single article is about how he tweeted at papa Musk and how he thinks that the company is the worst thing since he dropped his glass eye into his cat's litter box.

He doesn't think that Tesla will implode. He doesn't think it's a failing company. He just sees the reality, which is that all of their profits/revenues are way in the future.

Let's just say you win a time-delayed lottery and get $1,000,000 in 15 years. Not bad! Now let's say you won the same lottery in Venezuela in 2005. It's not even worth cashing the ticket.

It's the same deal with companies. Growth companies, however promising, have most of their expected profits in the future. Those profits have to be discounted by the **interest rate** to be turned into todays dollars. In other words, it doesn't matter how much money Tesla is going to make in the future if interest rates surge today. Well... it does matter... it's just worth a lot less.

So how does this relate to the Burry bet? You just have to scroll down a few lines on his 13F filing.

Burry has almost as many GOOG/FB calls as he does TSLA puts. Around \~$330MM of them. Why does this matter? These are big tech companies that are actually printing out metric shit-tons of profit today.

Interest rates stay the same but big tech goes up? Break even. Big tech goes down? Break even. Interest rates rise? Burry makes more money in a year than all of your wives boyfriends combined.

TL;DR:

The Burry TSLA short isn't a bet against Tesla, it's a bet on interest rates rising (AKA inflation)."

nmdjep,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nmdjep/my_thoughts_about_all_the_stories_published_on/,My thoughts about all the stories published on SHOP Stock recently,4,8,2021-05-28 02:06:29,"Clearly, the company Shopify {SHOP} is in a market that is growing as it was showing before the beginning of the pandemic already -when the stock rose up to $500. I mean who doesn't believe in the internet here :-\]

During the pandemic, this SOFTWARE company helped a lot of smaller and midsize businesses as they were easily able to set up an e-commerce presence with Shopify's help. As a result, SHOP revenue increased a lot and the stock got propelled up to a crazy over 200 times forward earnings and a still to high current $$ 1240 price tag today. Yeah, that is my opinion only but Note: At the last press conference they said that operating cost will increase \[and by revenue increase will slow down\], THEY SAID IT - but nobody wants to hear it. 

You may wonder why to believe me if everybody can see that the stock price didn't fall back to a quite logic 60 times earnings \[like FANG Stocks for example\] ... meaning about 7-800 Dollars ...  

Well, SHOP was falling but then ...   
I can only assume that the three leaving executives teamed up with some other people who are interested in bumping the stock up again. Together they started an extensive press campaign, the one that we see even today: ""Shopify poised to go up"" I read today? Is it not that always when another one of these messages comes out A LOT OF stocks are suddenly traded? And that when the price goes up \[and even down\] it is often a very controlled 40bucks a day?    


IF you still want to read more, let's look up that complete marketing campaign to bring the SHOP stock up again:   
First Shopify was compared with Amazon itself - which is laughable. Even Karl Marx knew already that capitalism tends to create a monopoly. Shopify ... by helping all the little and medium companies with their software is the exact opposite of Amazon. Not to mention that the malls are full again ... meaning fewer people will buy online than during the pandemic. Which at least in the short and midterm will bring online revenues down a bit.

Then Google mentioned some Google button that makes it easier to find Shopify customers. Well yes but that doesn't help Shopify results at all. AND it makes clear that Shopify customers severely lack visibility compared with an omnipotent Amazon.   
   
Then the Shopify payment system was hyped. Buy now pay later? REALLY? The """"have's"""" have credit cards and pay with them as they even get perks/payback and points for it. So who uses the buy now pay later system? The ""DO NOT HAVE's with only a half-decent credit score of course.

Sorry but when I read about this I was only able to imagine the Shopify payment system as a """"buy now pay NEVER"""" system and I certainly had no idea how this helps the Shopify stock in the long run. Do the revenue numbers go up in the quarterly results? What about liabilities? 

Then SHOP was mentioned as the ""stock to have"" in 2021 ?? Not even worth a comment. 

For me, the only thing that is ""poised to happen"" is that the pockets of the three leaving former executives of Shopify are filled and that the buying retail investors are screwed over in about 2 months' time with a two-digit percentage loss. 

And I write all this while I actually like the Shopify story, as I like Tesla and so many things that are happening with all these wonderful tech companies ...  
But IMO the SHOP stock goes back to $800 exactly as Tesla went down from 900\[intraday\] to now 600...

Well, Good luck, give me your thoughts and I hope the bots even allow a huge and way too long posting like this."

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.geekwire.com/2015/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ebay-and-paypals-split-and-how-it-impacts-amazon/amp/

If i am Carl Ican, i will buy tons to shopify and force a sale to Google. That would be a quick and easy way to make a few billion. 

What do you guys think? Makes sense or am i retarded?"

Ford’s plan to invest in EVs and self-driving cars rose to $29 billion, including $22 billion for EVs through 2025. 

Ford and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL are entering a six-year deal that will make the tech giant responsible for much of Ford’s growing in-vehicle connectivity. This partnership is designed to streamline Ford’s operations and accelerate an ongoing $11 billion restructuring plan. 

General Motors:

General Motors announced that it plans to invest $27 billion in EV and autonomous vehicles through 2025. The company also mentioned that it plans to release 30 EV models globally by 2025.

The company has partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT in leading a $2 billion investment round in self-driving car startup Cruise LLC.

Difference:
Ford is going with Google and General Motors is going with Microsoft. 

Google has 14 Automotive startup investments and Acquisitions.

Microsoft only has investments in 4 automotive startups.

This will help Ford and General Motors in the following areas:

- Autonomous driving technology.
- Connected car tech & fleet management.
- Electric vehicle technology.
- Automotive retail.
- Mobility-as-a-service & shared mobility.

Who wins?
In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars.

I will keep buying Ford, because of the potential technology integration.

While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ ."

Can't believe I'm gonna throw shade on a firm I used to love but they have REALLY gone down hill.  Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.  Basically the OG pioneered the discount brokerage business.  You should read about his life, such a cool mfer.  Anyways, the firm it is today is totally different and basically a scummy imposter just using the name, if you're thinking about joining.  DON'T.

Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy."

Now to some of you it may not be a big deal but the public may feel different about that. You see, these reports we’ve seen that the government has been releasing “confirming” is just the tip of the iceberg. Now you may not believe aliens are real and that’s fine that you’re that ignorant. We don’t judge. However, the US has been conducting recon missions observing these aerial phenomenons. They know they exist. They know they are here. They do not know their intentions or capabilities. Which is scary to think. 

So how does this relate to stonks? How do you deal with a possible threat that has way better technology than you? You build and invest in better aerospace defensive technology. “Space Defense stocks” more or so space stocks “Trimble, Boeing, Lockheed, or even ETF stocks like ARKX” and others i can’t name off the top of my head.

Hi everyone, I’m here with another DD, but this time it’ll be a little different than my usual options-exclusive DD. Today, IQ has just released its 2021 Q1 result. I’ve seen a couple posts on iQIYI two years before and it seems to be the time to short squeeze it again. It has reached its historical low at servals data before, but it soon rebound for 5% after the financial statement is released. However, me and my team did a deep dive into IQ and I wanted to share this stock with you

&#x200B;

What is IQ?

iQIYI Inc is an online entertainment service provider in China and it is known as the ""Netflix of China"". It is valued at around 10 billion dollars currently. It is primarily engaged in providing a variety of services encompassing internet video, live broadcasting, online games, online literature, animations, e-commerce and social media platform. The company produces original video content and distributes appealing professionally-produced content, partner-generated content, and user-generated content. It also offers a diverse collection of internet video content that appeals to users from broad demographics. The company's revenue is generated from membership services and online advertising services. The company earns the majority of its revenue from China. The company is based in Beijing and is partly owned by Baidu, the ""Google of China"". It had its IPO in 2018 and is currently sitting at around $13.3 per share.

&#x200B;

How is IQ 2021 Q1 financial report?

Total revenues reached RMB8.0 billion (US$1.2 billion), representing a 4% increase from the same period in 2020 and beat the estimate of $1,180,000,000.

Membership services revenue was RMB4.3 billion (US$658.1 million), representing a 7% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the decline of our subscribing members from 118.9 million as of March 31, 2020, which was a high base due to the impact of Covid-19, to 105.3 million as of March 31, 2021. Our subscribing members grew 3.6 million quarter-on-quarter due to the strong content launch coupled with the holidays in the first quarter, during which people spent more time viewing content.

Online advertising services revenue was RMB1.9 billion (US$292.5 million), representing a 25% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the rebound of both brand-advertising budgets and the number of brand advertisers amid the macroeconomy recovery.

Content distribution revenue was RMB779.1 million (US$118.9 million), representing a 29% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by more content titles we distributed to other platforms during the quarter.

Other revenues were RMB961.0 million (US$146.7 million), representing a 10% increase from the same period in 2020, primarily due to the growth of certain business lines.

Cost of revenues was RMB7.1 billion (US$1.1 billion), representing a 10% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to less content costs and bandwidth cost during the quarter. Content costs as a component of cost of revenues were RMB5.4 billion (US$829.6 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to decline of licensed content cost.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB1.2 billion (US$183.3 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. This was primarily attribute to less provision for credit losses, which was a result of improved macroeconomic environment versus the same period last year.

Research and development expenses were RMB672.3 million (US$102.6 million), representing a 1% decrease from the same period in 2020.

Operating loss was RMB1.0 billion (US$154.8 million), compared to operating loss of RMB2.2 billion in the same period in 2020. Operating loss margin was 13%, compared to operating loss margin of 29% in the same period in 2020.

Total other expense was RMB222.4 million (US$34.0 million), compared to total other expense of RMB628.5 million during the same period of 2020. The year-over-year variance was mainly due to less foreign exchange loss.

Loss before income taxes was RMB1.2 billion (US$188.7 million), compared to loss before income taxes of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020.

Income tax expense was RMB20.6 million (US$3.1 million), compared to income tax expense of RMB4.8 million in the same period in 2020.

Net loss attributable to iQIYI was RMB1.3 billion (US$193.4 million), compared to net loss attributable to iQIYI of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020. Diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS was RMB1.61 (US$0.25) for the first quarter of 2021, compared to diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS of RMB3.92 in the same period of 2020.

As of March 31, 2021, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of RMB13.3 billion (US$2.0 billion).

&#x200B;

Financial Guidance

For the second quarter of 2021, iQIYI expects total net revenues to be between RMB7.21 billion (US$1.10 billion) and RMB7.65 billion (US$1.17 billion), representing a 3% decrease to a 3% increase year over year. This forecast reflects iQIYI's current and preliminary view, which may be subject to change.

Price Target

If we use Netflix valuation as a benchmark. We can estimate the fair market value of IQ being at least equivalent to NFLX at 216B ($480/share). However, I personally think IQ should garner less since it main business is in China while Netflix is in America, Canada, Europe, you name it. Also, the subscription member of Netflix is about 207 million while IQ has only half of it, which is 105 million. Also, the member revenues of Netflix is about 24.7 billion, while that of IQ is only 4.3 billion. IQ has only about 18% of revenues of Netflix and so give IQ an $86/share target price. But my price target for the entire company is at least $200/share as it has half of the membership service of Netflix and it is still growing for IQ. Also, there is a large room of growth for IQ as it mainly focus on mainland nowadays but it will sure expand its business overseas"

What is Huya? 

Huya is the largest game streaming platform in all of China, it’s basically the Chinese equivalent of Twitch. 

Esports is absolutely huge in China, bigger than in the west, it’s like a real sport over there. They hold tourneys in giant $900m stadiums and offer substantial cash prizes to winners. This is an industry with strong tailwinds and we know there will only be massive growth for the foreseeable future.

The majority shareholder of Huya is Tencent, which is great news for Huya because they can buy exclusive streaming rights for all Tencent games like League of Legends and Dota2 as well as exclusive broadcast rights for tournaments, which is creating a very nice moat. Add the network effect and you can forget about anyone ever challenging Huya’s dominance in the industry. We all know Google and Microsoft could never even compete with Twitch despite sniping the largest streamers Ninja and Shroud, because the network effect for game streaming is just that strong.

So what makes Huya so undervalued?

Well, just look at these goddamn numbers:

Market Cap: $4b

Sales: $1.67b

P/S: 2.4

PE ratio: 28

PEG ratio: 0.3

2020 Revenue growth: 30%

2020 Earnings growth: 89%

5 yr revenue cagr: 20-30%

Cash: $1.6b

Debt: $0

Compare these with a somewhat similar company, Bilibili, the Youtube of China.

Market cap: $37b

Sales: $1.8b

P/S: 20.5

PE ratio: 0

PEG ratio: 0

2020 revenue growth: 50%

2020 earnings growth: -118%

5 yr revenue cagr: 35-45%

Cash: $2b

Debt: $1.29b

But why?

Huya has been hit with the perfect storm of bullshit. We all know tech and growth stocks are crashing right now because of inflation, add the fact that Chinese stocks are getting hammered right now because of the new regulations that threaten to delist some of the shadier Chinese companies out there. But that’s not all, there is something else holding this stock down, a pending merger with their largest competitor Douyu.

This potential merger would basically double Huya revenue instantly, double the cash on the balance sheet, while giving them a new market cap of roughly $7b, and they would instantly capture 80% of all game streaming market share in China. Basically a monopoly in a hyper growth industry. They could also increase margins substantially with no competition and no need to outbid competitors with large contracts to their streamers to keep them on the platform.

Under normal circumstances this potential merger would be the most bullish development of all time, but not today. The CCP really doesn’t like it. They don’t like Tencent buying up smaller companies within an industry, merging them together, and creating a monopoly. These days it seems like there is an article every day about how the Chinese government is really starting to crack down on Tencent and Alibaba. The Huya Douyu deal is at the center of all of that China stock FUD, and there is a real good chance that this merger gets blocked outright within the next month or two.

Then Huya is screwed? 

Not really. Whatever happens, it’s good for Huya share price. Right now Huya is one of the most shorted stocks in the market. There are a large number of shorts looking to take advantage of the price difference between Huya and Douyu shares, Arbitrage shorts. They will have to cover either way once the merger decision is reached, leaving Huya to run higher once the merger FUD is over. Over time, Huya will rise to reflect the strong fundaments and growth of the company. 

This stock should be 5x the price it is today at a bare minimum.

What am I doing?

I’m buying LEAPs all the way down, averaging in from the start of this week. I’m up to 90 already and buying many more hopefully before it shoots up.

Positions: HUYA $20 calls 01/2023."

There is an aspect to all this that I have not yet seen discussed anywhere, and as soon as people figure it out, I suspect Palantir will see activity beyond anything anyone right now has predicted. 

Lets start by asking a question. If you had to create a company that was perfect in every way, that was untouchable by competition and greater than any company before it, one that would make google or amazon look like AMC by comparison, what would you need to do?

first it would need to be a monopoly. no question there right? but a monopoly of what? There are currently 2 options that fit best and are also realistically achievable. those to things are information and energy. both will always exist, they will always be in high demand, they will never go out of style, and whoever finds a way to gain absolute control over one or both will effectively become the most wealthy person ever. 100 thousand years from now when humanity has transcended existence and all material wants we will still need information and energy. Palantir is attempting to monopolize information and to better understand why this is such a big deal, lets see what it would take to monopolize energy. 

the first and surprisingly easiest step, would be to create a viable source of free or almost free energy that you would then sell, probably through monthly payments, to the entire world. miniature thorium reactors, or breakthroughs in fusion technology could potentially do this. There is more to be done however...

1. In order for your business to last for centuries, your device needs to be impossible to recreate by anybody except your business and those associated with it. 
2. it needs to be cheap, very cheap, and yet generate revenue regularly no matter the conditions or state of the world.
3. It needs to be constantly improved, or somehow protected from the possibility of someone creating an even better idea and putting your company out of business. 

assuming all these goals are met, you would now be the owner of a business that will always generate profit, that will always exist and bring value to customers, and that exists in a market that grows as humanity grows, meaning your potential is linked to the success and proliferation of humanity.  With no possible competition, you would be the creator of the most successful company to ever exist. 

How now,  could this be accomplished with information, and how far is Palantir from achieving these same goals? is their product impossible to recreate? is it cheap and consistent with revenue? Is it immune to any possibility of anyone catching up with something even better? 

Almost. not quite yet, but they are surprisingly close.

&#x200B;

1. can their product be recreated?

technically yes, but both Gotham and Foundry are seeing adoption by some very important organizations. Gotham is already joined at the hip with the United States government, and with continued proven effectiveness and Palantir's willingness to make deals with other countries, its pretty much guaranteed that Gotham will be seeing mass adoption into other countries as well. Like a really nice disease, eventually everyone aligned with the United States will use it. 

Foundry's the big fish here though. The real deal and the reason Palantir is on track with their goal of becoming the biggest software company in the world. That's not me saying that, they literally make that claim in their most recent earnings report. 

All businesses and people essentially have the same problem. Data is very valuable, probably one of the most inherently valuable things in existence. Don't believe me? take a look at your computer. data is just the transfer of information and a computer is simply a really big bundle of information and tricks to measure that information.  A whole bunch of transistors turn on and off and through a massive amount of clever engineering and abstraction, all that data of whether or not something's on or off, 1 or 0, gets turned into your afternoon midget porn.  this is an extreme example of how much value can be pulled from data no matter  how  unimportant or useless it may seem. 100 years ago nobody would have ever guessed that stringing a bunch of lights together and having them interact through rules determined by whether they are on or off would possibly lead to what we have today but here we are. 

Data has value. The problem that every business has is that they have all this data, but how exactly do you extract value from that? how do you extract the most value possible? everyone has their own solutions to these problems, but there is no unification to any of it. This is where Foundry comes in.

Data that the Country or Business or person owns gets fed into Foundry, and everyone using it can assign specific rules to this data. This is a drastic oversimplification, but you frankly don't need to know the gritty details because they don't really matter here.  All you need to know is that  this oversimplification applies to computers as well. Computers are a massive collection of data, governed by rules where the result and potential uses are completely controlled by the person using the computer. 

There are plenty of questions here, how it works exactly, how private it is, what the use cases look like, and you can do this research on your own. What's interesting here is that while this product can definitely be recreated, its much much harder then it sounds and the fact that IBM and AWS have already given up and simply partnered with Palantir rather than try and recreate this technology just goes to show just how hard it would be to make a better Foundry or Gotham.  However, assuming that everyone eventually starts using this tech, what would happen if something better came along? 

2. Is Palantir's product immune to new and disruptive competition? 

The answer here is yes and absolutely. the REALLY neat thing about Foundry is that it essentially creates a perpetually self improving system. People input data and assign rules, but that data never disappears and those rules never change or are forgotten unless overruled by other more complex rules. this means that ANY new data added to the system is used to further improve the system.  Again if you  want more details do the research because I'm trying to talk to children here. 

I've been talking about data a lot but I feel I should stress the fact that your idea of what data is or can be is likely underdeveloped. did you poo today? what color was it? how soft was it?  was it chunkey or smooth?  how long were you on the toilet?  can any of this info be used to determine what you ate? how healthy you are?  what time did you poo?  do you poo in cycles or does it come randomly? can any of this information help predict when you will poo again?  maybe knowing these things can help you poo even better and more comfortably? 

This is all Data.  All of it can be used, and all of it has value to be found.  everything you see, do, feel, and think is data.  The number of ways this data can be connected and utilized to better understand the world and yourself is potentially infinite.  Therefore, a company that is able to create a product that can monopolize this potential could possibly grow even larger then one based on energy.  a product that is perpetually self improving will never be outpaced by anything else ESPECUALLY if they get a head start which is exactly what Palantir has spent 17 years and billions of dollars of R&D on. 

3. Is Palantir's product cheap and guaranteed to be profitably no matter the state of the world? 

I think it goes without saying that Software is the best business to be successful in. This is Unfortunately where Palantir is at their weakest currently, but as stated in their earnings report, they are hell bent on focusing on growth over everything else.  First they bag huge companies with lotsa money, then medium ones, then small businesses, and finally everyday average people.  Assuming company's continue to sign contracts, there will one day be a turning point where Palantir goes from a WSB name to a household one.  you wont even notice it happen, it will just happen. As for profitability regardless of the state of the world, Covid has already proven that Palantir's services are in very high demand. 

&#x200B;

On top of ALL this, Palantir is exclusively aligned with United States interests. Imagine if every country in the world used Palantir to some extent, and all that added value and power was exclusively controlled by the United States. There is an even bigger discussion to be had on the current technological race between the USA and China over who will perfect AI first, and the role Palantir will play in all this. The conclusion here is that whoever does win in the end, they will essentially decide the direction the world takes and how people in that world will live. This situation is very similar to the race between the U.S and Germany over who could invent the atomic bomb. luckily for us there's a lot less hot fiery death and a lot more new world order overshadowing the old one through the always watchful eyes of artificial intelligence. Elon musk is damn right to be afraid of AI, and If I had to pick one country to take it all I would like it to be the USA. This means that investing in Palantir is almost like betting on the United states in this all for one game. Make no mistake there is a very very good chance that whether or not you care about Palantir, your life is going to be affected by them one way or another. 

The moral of the story is buy the fucking dip and don't be a pussy about it. when you believe in a company enough it doesn't matter how much it dips because unless Karp and friends die in a fireball of death after boarding a small private jet to their mansions in Hawaii for a night of  drug fueled indulgences, the future will always be bright. If you're unsure about Palantir still don't worry.  They aren't going anywhere and there will be many many many more catalysts to fomo into and lose 50% of your portfolio on.

Among the top 5 is $CLOV andHere is the thing about $CLOV:

**Clover Health** (NASDAQ:**CLOV**) started  trading on the Nasdaq Exchange back in January after completing its merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings (NYSE:IPOC).

Hindenburg Hedge fund had taken a large position against spacs in general [(Google: Hindenburg vs spacs)](https://www.google.com/search?q=hindenburg+hedge+fund+vs+spacs&bih=698&biw=1280&hl=en&ei=xi2bYJL5MdfY-gSE86a4Cw&oq=hindenburg+hedge+fund+vs+spacs&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAM6BQghEKABOggIIRCgARCLAzoICCEQqwIQiwM6BQghEKsCOggIIRAWEB0QHlC3KFjPNWDINmgBcAB4AIABY4gBpQaSAQE5mAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpergBAsABAQ&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwiS9Pu5_cLwAhVXrJ4KHYS5CbcQ4dUDCA4&uact=5), and thus $CLOV merger with a SPAC had become one of their targets: [Hindenburg CLOV report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/clover/).

Hindenburg has been shorting $CLOV since FEBRUARY 4, 2021, and then a law suit against $CLOV appeared by Robbins LLP (lawyers), and guess who hired them: Hindenburg Hedge Fund [Hindenburg Robbins LLP](https://www.google.com/search?q=hindenburg+robbins+LLP&hl=en&biw=1280&bih=698&ei=bDCbYK36Dt-90PEP5quV8A8&oq=hindenburg+robbins+LLP&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAM6BwgAEEcQsAM6CggAEJECEEYQ-QE6CwguEMcBEK8BEJECOggILhDHARCjAjoCCAA6BAgAEEM6BQgAEJECOgQILhBDOgIILjoGCAAQFhAeOgUIIRCgAToICCEQoAEQiwM6BQghEKsCOgcIIRAKEKABUMZTWLmtAWCvsAFoBHACeACAAZwBiAHPE5IBBDE2LjmYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6sAEAyAEIuAECwAEB&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwit4P78_8LwAhXfHjQIHeZVBf4Q4dUDCA4&uact=5)

Since then they have been bombarding with press releases of $CLOV being under investigation (misleading title as if the FBI or SEC is investigating).

If you read about the lawsuit, it's all about the SPAC merger, because as far as it comes to CLOV, there are no problems. 

The fundamentals are strong with CLOV still growing in the hundreds of millions per quarter (not $500,000 like MVIS) and the technicals show that it can't get any lower.

Hindenburg taking a large stance against spacs, had made them overlook $CLOV  as an actual success, and they are spending a lot of money to try and cover their shorts,

CLOV is the real deal when in comes to a squeeze because it actually has value. If there is no unity behind this, it means that the whole movement stopped with GME and AMC and that is all for stonks (at least for me). 

I myself am invested with 1200 shares at  an average of $9.20  and it is currently at $7.95, so i am feeling the shit, but we shall see on this Monday's earning call who actually won?"

n9c48p,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9c48p/the_nokia_renaissance_nok_how_the_finnish_telecom/,The Nokia Renaissance (NOK): How the Finnish telecom giant will flourish in the era of 5G,114,24,2021-05-11 02:20:43,"Last Friday, Morgan Stanley analyst, Dominik Olszewski, upgraded Finnish telecom company Nokia to Overweight from Equal Weight. Commenting, “improvements at Nokia are coming faster than we had expected.” AKA, it’s a Buy. The upgrade comes as one of many in a recent positive shift in the stocks rating across the board, including “Buy” ratings issued by SEB Equity Research and UBS Group.

Just like their infamously durable 3310 mobile phone released at the turn of the century in 2000, Nokia’s success in telecommunications remains invincible even in the 5G era. With cutting-edge patents and new contracts with tech giants including Amazon, Microsoft and Google, Nokia is set up for continued strength and relevance in their respective markets.

Although less famous for their mobile devices nowadays, Nokia still crushes earnings expectations with telecom sales due to new remote labor models born from the pandemic. First quarter EPS in 2021 were reported at .08¢, beating the .01¢ forecast eight-fold.

In one year, Q1 ’20 to Q1 ’21, net sales have grown 3%. Adjusted for currency fluctuations, net sales have actually grown 9% on a constant currency basis — an extremely compelling figure. Gross margins climbing to 37.9% from 35.3% in the same period, indicating refined operations and a positive reflection of new leadership.

Pekka Lundmark took over as Nokia’s CEO and President in September 2020, saying he’ll do “whatever it takes” to win the 5G race. Other competitors to look out for are Swedish multinational Ericsson and China-based Huawei. Chinese telecom giant Huawei, however, faces widespread suspicion over state surveillance concerns.

The US has pressured allied nations to avoid collaboration with the Chinese firm, and many countries — such as the UK and Sweden — have placed bans on their technology. Although bad news for China, this opens up greater market share potential for Nokia. This coincides with a year-over-year change of 13% net sales gain in the North American region alone. Possibly indicating the geopolitical tensions are working in Nokia’s favor. As of now, there seems to be no winding down of strained US-China relations.

Nokia appears to be in great health, boasting a D/E ratio of 0.37 as of 03/31/2021. Even more alluring are the four consecutive quarters of positive free cash flow. Nokia netted EUR 1.2 billion in Q1 ’21 alone, with an end-of-quarter net cash balance of EUR 3.7 billion, allowing for aggressive re-investment, particularly in 5G tech. As the decade of 5G ramps up, Nokia is financially positioned to take full advantage of cutting-edge research and development.

Nokia’s existing arsenal of 5G tech is teaming up with behemoths like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft, Google and the US Federal Government. AWS has expanded their existing partnership with Nokia to include cloud-native convergent charging solutions for CSPs (communication service providers). Google, like AWS, is also collaborating with Nokia to enhance cloud services. US Federal Government’s National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) 5G Cybersecurity Project has tapped Nokia to provide a secure transition to 5G networks.

The company’s Q1 ’21 interim report paints a positive picture through 2023, anticipating faster growth than the market. Similar to previous quarters, Nokia is expecting a “clearly positive” cash flow over the next couple years. Optimistic comparable operating margins predict 7–10% through ’21, increasing to 10–13% in ’23. Conservatively managed, Nokia’s guidance appears to deliver from previous quarters. All in all, this optimistic outlook could very well be outperformed in the near future — which is great news for investors.

As the petals of 5G technology unfold across the world, Nokia is in full bloom with it. Strong demand, fresh leadership, top-of-the-line tech and a solid balance sheet are the seeds of a new renaissance in telecommunications. Nokia will once again be reinstated as the best of the best, and prove to be one of the decades most advanced leaders in 5G technology.

Paysafe is one hell of a company. They are a fin-tech like PayPal and Squares, thus should be given a higher multiple for valuation. They got a lot of exciting and growth customers/partners like Barstool (PENN), YouTube (Google), Twitch (AMZN), FanDuel (PDYPY), Roblox (RBLX), CoinBase (COIN), Visa (V), ApplePay (APPL), BetMGM (MGM), Spotify (SPOT), Microsoft/Xbox etc., and on top of that they got a huge digital wallet (#2 in market share) where you can trade/buy the fast-growing e-currencies which is growing in popularity. I truly believed this Paysafe is undervalued compared to its peers. You can read a very good Paysafe DD below on reddit and it gives a lot of insight of Paysafe valuation and bear cases:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mysz54/reviewing\_the\_bear\_case\_on\_paysafe\_psfe/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mysz54/reviewing_the_bear_case_on_paysafe_psfe/)

(the link above is a really really good read with lots of info about Paysafe valuation in-depth and discussion of bear cases, so I’m not going to repeat most of the good points the author mentioned in that sub.)

Most of the time analysis use assumptions to make predictions on future growth. As an example, EV-related stocks (PLUG, BLNK, QS, LAZR, NKLA, BLDP, etc) get higher or ridiculous valuation based on assumption that gasoline cars will eventually be phased out. As you can see most if not all of these companies are unprofitable and some don’t even have revenue, yet worth billions. While this assumption may be accurate, it is extremely hard to know when will growth begin to accelerate. Because of this predictive nature, it’s really hard to know how long you will have to hold onto the stocks before they pop. When or if it will pop is anyone's guess. So while holding onto these stocks will likely result in wild price swings thus high risk / high rewards.

But what if you have the data before you showing the financial growth of your customers or partners? If your customers/partners' revenue grows, it’s more likely than not they are using more of your products or services. Paysafe is one such company where you can actually look at their customers/partners' financial reports to predict where the company will go in the future and when growth will start. For this reason, Paysafe is more of a lower risk but still has high reward potential.

Paysafe will be reporting earning for the very first time as a public company again on May 11. The good news is we already have their customers results in and here are some breakdown of their 1st QTR results showing huge growth:

1. PENN (Reported May 7, 2021) - “Penn National’s income from operations rose to $216.5 million in the first quarter against ($560.6) million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDAR jumped 77.2% from the year-ago quarter to $447 million. Moreover, adjusted EBITDAR margin expanded to 35.1% from 22.6% a year ago.” ( source: [https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1515673/penn-national-penn-q1-earnings-revenues-beat-estimates](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1515673/penn-national-penn-q1-earnings-revenues-beat-estimates) )
2. DraftKing ( Reported May 7, 2021) - “DraftKings is raising its fiscal year 2021 revenue guidance from a range of $900 million to $1 billion to a range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, which equates to year-over-year growth of 63% to 79% and a 16% increase compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance” Source: [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/07/2225374/0/en/DraftKings-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results-and-Raises-2021-Revenue-Guidance.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/07/2225374/0/en/DraftKings-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results-and-Raises-2021-Revenue-Guidance.html) )
3. Spotify (April 28th, 2021)- “Revenue increased 16% to €2.15 billion ($2.6 billion) from €1.85 billion ($2.22 billion) in the same period last year….” (source: [https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9564180/spotify-q1-2021-earnings-report/](https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9564180/spotify-q1-2021-earnings-report/))
4. Youtube/Google ( April 27th, 2021 ) - “ In its first-quarter earnings report Tuesday, Google parent company [Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL) said YouTube [brought in](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/alphabet-goog-earnings-q1-2021.html) revenue of $6.01 billion in advertising revenue during the quarter — up from $4 billion from a year ago, for a growth rate of 49%. That’s an acceleration over its 46% growth in Q4. It’s also nearly twice the growth rate of Netflix, which reported 24% revenue growth [in Q1](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/20/netflix-nflx-q1-2021-earnings.html), and [expects](https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/FINAL-Q1-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf) growth to slow to 19% next quarter.” (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/youtube-could-soon-equal-netflix-in-revenue.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/youtube-could-soon-equal-netflix-in-revenue.html) )
5. Skillz ( May 4, 2021 ) - “Revenue grew to $83.7 million during the first quarter of 2021, up 92% over the prior year. Gross profit grew to $79.4 million during the first quarter of 2021, up 95% over the prior year.” (source: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504006307/en/CORRECTING-and-REPLACING-Skillz-Reports-Record-Q1-Revenue-and-Raises-2021-Guidance](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504006307/en/CORRECTING-and-REPLACING-Skillz-Reports-Record-Q1-Revenue-and-Raises-2021-Guidance) )

As you can see these Paysafe’s customers/partners are reporting explosive growth. While some of these companies may report an earning loss it may be due to higher expenses such as customers acquisition cost (i.e. Draftking). However, here we are more focused on their revenue as the more transactions they do the more likely all or part of that transaction is done by Paysafe. These companies reported earnings before Paysafe, so it can be highly expected Paysafe will report a very good earning and future growth projection tomorrow ( May 11).

Several things to note about Paysafe besides their customer’s earning growth. These factors will also influence Paysafe’s future growth:

1. They are a monopoly when it comes to iGaming/Sport Betting as you can see the explosive growth by DKNG, MGM, PENN, SKLZ, etc.
2. Paysafe took a hit during the pandemic because they also do offline transaction processing, but now things are opening up we can expect going forward these offline transactions will grow again. Also, when re-opening occur, more sport events will occur thus more betting means more transactions for Paysafe.
3. They are #2 in digital wallets and you can buy digital ""stuff"" with the wallet. These currencies has been generating huge revenue for PayPal and SQ  on their 1st qtr report (more on this below)

Finally, both PayPal and SQ reported earning before Paysafe and their results beat estimation:

Paypal earning ( May 5, 2021) “ Revenue: $6.03 billion vs. $5.90 billion expected by Refinitiv” (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/paypal-pypl-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/paypal-pypl-earnings-q1-2021.html) )

Square earning ( May 6, 2021 ) “Square reported a profit of 41 cents per share vs. 16 cents per share expected in a Refinitiv survey of analysts. It also brought in $5.06 billion of revenue vs. $3.36 billion expected by Refinitiv.” ( source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/square-sq-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/square-sq-earnings-q1-2021.html))

So I can say with confidence Paysafe will likely beat their own guidance for Q1 on May 11th. For those of you who don’t know Paysafe, they are not a small player. Their transaction volume is about that of SQ \~$100 Billion. I get it, people will say look man their CAGR is way too small compare to PayPal or SQ. I'm not looking at the past. I'm looking at the future. Their CAGR estimate did not include the sportbetting/igaming growth. Remember that Sportbetting was banned in the USA but has been overturned by the SCOTUS recently. Right now less than 1/2 the population can bet online, and the 4 largest states haven't yet legalized online gaming. This is why I post the results from their customers like DKNG and PENN which is showing high growth rate. And best of all? They own this space in online gambling as they are a monopoly. So we'll see what their new CAGR will be going forward once they reported earning tomorrow (May 11). If Paysafe is able to show growth on par with PayPal and SQ they should be trading at a much higher multiple. See the reddit link above for DD on valuation.

Paysafe involved with Gaming, Sports, e-wallet/currencies which I find very exciting and feel that if I own the stock I’ll be part of the journey of growth with these sectors. Roaring Kitty/ DeepFuckingValue simply invested in GME because he liked the stock. I’m investing in Paysafe simply because it's cool and sexy, regardless of its growth potential.

Summary: Paysafe I believed is a lower risk and high reward stock, since their growth is easier to predict as we can rely on their publicly traded customers data which is showing high growth going forward. They got the 2nd largest digital wallet. I believe as a monopoly in iGaming/Sport Betting their growth will be massive when 20+ states including the 4 largest states: CA, TX, NY, FL begin to allow online sport betting. This is something about Paysafe that I like so much because no other fintech has this space. This is a massive high growth (as seen with DKNG, PENN, MGM 1st qtr report) area and they owns it. For these reason, I am extremely bullish and I like Paysafe for both short and longer term play.

Fair value estimates included.",42,34,2021-05-10 05:52:32,"**Model**: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mf3adRWo5YyW5l56TLDG0ZvZ7GfEeNv7oGc3kG50JAk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mf3adRWo5YyW5l56TLDG0ZvZ7GfEeNv7oGc3kG50JAk/edit?usp=sharing)

**Methodology**:

* Created a three-statement model for Verizon Communications., AT&T., and T-mobile US
* Combined this model with a WACC build-up to create an unlevered DCF and derived a fair-value-per-share estimate using a growth in perpetuity and an exit EBITDA multiple approach
* Spread comparable companies (these 3 + CHTR, T.TO, and BCE.TO)
* Combined results from DCF and select comps valuations to arrive at final estimates

**How to use the model**

* Anywhere you see blue text is OK to edit, and should not result in breaking anything. Green text = taken from another worksheet, so if you want to change one of those cells I recommend following the trail first
* To make meaningful changes to the 3-statement-model, scroll to the bottom of each ""Financials"" page to tweak assumptions about revenue growth, GPM, and other assumptions. You can also adjust the specifics for each case scenario from here
* I have tried to supply pessimistic assumptions about terminal growth rates and exit EBITDA multiples in the DCF models. Feel free to adjust C43 and H43 as needed, keeping in mind the model is very sensitive to these inputs
* WACC buildup can be done however you want. If you have access to a Bloomberg terminal you can get a better adjusted beta than I used, and a more precise cost of debt (more on that below), or you can just use the override cell to put in a WACC% directly
* Trading Comps Input essentially works to arrive at normalized multiples before converting to an output. Do not be intimidated by non-Gaap disclosures. Everything here is available on annual reports, quarterly reports, and press releases.
* For trading comps outputs, simply toggle the companies in column B until you have the company you wish to analyze in the first position, and the other comps below it, then head to Valuation Matrix to see the results.
* Feel free to adjust the assumptions, there are a lot of them
* If you can think of an assumption better than something I have here, or if you spot a mistake let me know!

**Other Notes:**

* I Imported the model from excel to Google Sheets before sharing --> if something is broken, let me know so I can go in and fix it
* Of particular note in the comps spread is Charter Communications options outstanding. They provide a dollar figure, so I worked backwards to arrive at the correct value for Gross proceeds from exercise of options
* Rogers Communications would have been included in the comps analysis, but I felt the pending merger would skew multiples beyond what could realistically be compared with the US big 3. I should probably include Vodafone but I was so excited to share! Maybe if you check back in I'll have added it :)
* Used 10Y YTM bond data on FINRA to arrive at assumptions for cost-of-debt used in WACC build-up. If you have access to a bloomberg terminal you can grab the bond with the best volume and use that.
* I have my own opinions about the intangibles of these companies (management, forward looking results of the recent spectrum auction etc.) but I feel that if people want to chat about those things the comment section would be a better place to do it!
* I apologize for ambiguity (especially on the non-gaap stuff) but I couldn't figure out how to remove my name from the comments quickly (if you know how to do this, other than going one-by-one through each comment, let me know and I'll reupload). Most comments were simply memos to myself to remember what each cell consists of beyond the label (i.e., components of ""other current assets"")
* A thousand more things. If you want to know just ask.

A) Care about reputation

B) Deliver

C) Contain economic consequences and economic challenges

I'm extremely engaged by developing and improving my portfolio and I strongly believe that investors should go big and stay mentally tough through the good times and bad. In other words, the advice that I value most is by Charlie Munger:  


>“If you’re not willing to react with equanimity to a market price decline of 50% two or three times a century you’re not fit to be a common shareholder and you deserve the mediocre result you’re going to get compared to the people who do have the temperament, who can be more philosophical about these market fluctuations.”

 I actually hate posting in r/stocks and r/investing because posts l feel that the culture in that forum is the opposite of this advice and seems to value cowardice more than conviction. I find it incredibly annoying and sheepish. 

These are my picks, that I've researched obsessively and believe will result in substantial wealth building over time.

**In short, they are still growing on most segments, the CEO does smart acquisitions (usually at a bit of a premium).**

\--The Business--

Microsoft is a technology titan focused on commercial and industrial applications with software and solutions such as Office 365, Azure, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, Linkedin, Windows 10. They also provide platforms for developers via Visual Studio Code and Github. A smaller segment of Microsoft are their devices and their games division powered by Xbox.

**--Next Moves: Healthcare Applications--**

The healthcare sector is characterized by massive bureaucracy and opportunities for growth. It is one of the rare sectors where real future growth is possible by innovation. Microsoft has established itself as a corporate and industry suite, but now it seems that they are taking their whole Eco-system and moving on the healthcare industry.

This is pure speculation, but it can be one of the boldest moves yet, as healthcare facilities, operations, education, training, quality control are large complex systems that can benefit from the tools and services that the company offers.

We have seen Microsoft positioning for a certain client type and taking over most of their business. As the opportunities for growth in the corporate sector decrease, Microsoft might just turn to one of the most complex industries with high barriers to entry and large upfront investment costs.

On 11 April 2021 they entered into an agreement to acquire Nuance Communications for $ 56 per share, or $19.7 Billion. Nuance is a cloud and artificial intelligence (“AI”) software provider with healthcare and enterprise AI experience, and the acquisition will build on our industry-specific cloud offerings. This is effectively their foot in the door to the healthcare industry.

**--Value--**

I think that the company is trading around its intrinsic value, with potential for growth in the future. There is inflation related market risk that can push down value, but with proper management and pricing flexibility they can at least sustain current value levels.

Microsoft solidified the cloud for the corporate & business sector, and decreased the risk of their sales by adopting a continuous subscription model for most of their services.

Their business model seems to be growth trough innovation as they are positioning themselves precisely in segments where innovation is lacking and are integrating those segments within their high-barrier to entry, complex systems.

\--**Product Breakdown--**

AZURE:  The backbone of the productivity suite for most of the western corporations 

Office:  Stabilized revenues for essential business tools

Windows 10:  Declining bloatware built upon old architecture 

LinkedIn:  Well positioned, profitable social network with long-term commuted users 

Dynamics/Viva:  A major competitor for CRM/ERP market-share with potential for innovation 

PowerApps:  The future tool for cutting operating expenses and bureaucracy for companies 

Devices: Uncertain potential for a better experience for Windows users. Augmented reality done right with industry application

GitHub, VS Code:  The platforms that will keep MSFT on the cutting edge of development tech

Gaming/Xbox: Large but risky potential for growth if the devices and games are improved

Microsoft has a wide and complex set of products and services which can be understood as cost cutting tools for businesses, system architecture utilities, productivity and effectiveness tools. 

They have created a well-thought off interconnected Eco-system that is nothing like the company was even five years ago.

It is now apparent that they are well positioned as a market leader for industrial and business applications and will further solidify their position in the future.

\--Competition--

We are already witnessing the convergence of competitive advantages between the technology titans of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and it is clear that all of them are fighting for market share in similar technologies and industries. 

It seems that every company is fighting for their specific industry positioning within technology. For example, Facebook, Microsoft and Google all experiment with Virtual Reality tools such as Google Glass, Oculus Rift and the HoloLens Headset from Microsoft. However MSFT seems to be the most successful as it is positioning for industrial, military and hybrid workspace applications for the headset - the others had less luck in the consumer/gaming sector application of VR.

Google, Amazon and Microsoft are likewise competing for cloud dominance, where Amazon AWS is positioning as a cost effective player for developers, MSFT is positioning as a stable and secure platform for companies and Google is positioning as an advanced cutting edge option for new technologies and companies that are able to scale.

The last example is between MSFT and GOOGL where they competed for the use of virtual conference apps driven by the new hybrid work culture from the pandemic. Both of the competitors had a variant starting off, MSFT had Skype/Teams, and Google had Hangouts/Meet. It is evident that Microsoft had the right approach with Teams and took over the commercial sector for online communication. Side note, Skype is a drain on the Microsoft brand since the appearance of the pretend close feature. It is irredeemable and should be retired.

DISCLAIMER: I do not own a MSFT position, I am planning to go long on MSFT next week.

What I am is a physician with at least some literacy, though not expertise, in oncology. In fact I am hoping to become an oncologist once I'm done with all my training. Without further ado...I present my first DD:

I was working the overnight shift at my hospital last night and was doing some late night reddit browsing when I saw someone post about INO filing a new patent and potential for a buyout from Regeneron ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6q9v0/regeneron\_rgen\_is\_rumored\_to\_be\_buying\_out\_ino/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6q9v0/regeneron_rgen_is_rumored_to_be_buying_out_ino/)). The guy who posted it is a 5 year user and his name had ""MD"" in it so it caught my attention...but he has almost no post history other than asking 4 years ago about making a career out of consulting for EPIC (epic is the #1 electronic medical chart for those of you unfamiliar) and anyone asking that probably 1) is actually a doctor and 2) doesn't want to work in medicine because it's toxic af and I can totally relate...the sort of person who would have interest in using their knowledge and training for picking stocks instead of being a clinician...not much unlike the famous Dr. Burry

That said his post just looked weird and sus af so I decided to ""do my own DD"" as they say. Now I am not 100% sure OP above is a real doctor but I do know that  I'm a doctor so I should be able to interpret this ish pretty well (ok just a little well), right?

Background

I open the patent application and read up on it. My first impression? Lol you can't treat GBM. For those of you unaware GBM is a horrible horrible brain cancer (read more here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma)) that is one of the few ""death sentences"" that exist in medicine. I had the unfortunate experience of having not just one but two of my friends in medical school have a parent die from GBM and it was absolutely devastating to watch. Because of the nature of brain cancer there's basically nothing that can be done to treat this. Currently patients undergo radiation which is horribly morbid and doesn't help much. Patients die within a year basically 100% of the time even with advances such as ""gamma knife"" radiation. I have personally witnessed the treatment of GBM as a medical student and the prevailing sentiment is that it's basically untreatable. But then I read more about their tech and the patent and....wait a second this actually sounds legit. So now to break down some of the science behind this....

Methods

INO's patented tech is that they use a unique delivery system to basically deliver their drugs through impermeable membranes. To put it in non-doctor terms they trojan horse medicine into the walled off city of your brain. Your brain is particularly difficult to treat with chemotherapy and immunotherapy (two of the main methods of medical cancer treatment) due to what is called the blood brain barrier. Your brain is (reasonably so) walled off from the rest of your body to avoid bad shit getting up in there. Unfortunately that means we can't get medicine up in there either. In particular the medicine they have developed (INO 5401) is a PD-1 inhibitor, but delivered into the brain. As soon as I saw PD-1 this peaked my interest hard. anti PD-1 drugs are immunotherapy medications that ""uncloak"" cancer from hiding from your immune system. The same mechanism of action is used in the very successful drug Keytruda aka Pembrolizumab (read more here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrolizumab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrolizumab)) which has been used in other very deadly cancers like Sarcoma and Melanoma. The idea of being able to use this same class of drug on a brain cancer is crazy smart and the problem until now has been delivery of that drug. That's where INO comes in with their patented tech.

Results

Go to the patent link above and click ""images"". This is the money shot. MRI on left = v bad cancer. MRI on the right = cancer is dead. What. Yep. Their patent describes necrosis of the tissue with complete resolution. Mind blowing. Now I'm sure this doesn't work that well in EVERY patient because response to PD-1 inhibitors is varied. Most of the time it's a long shot but when it works IT FUCKING WORKS. I have literally seen melanoma and sarcoma MELT away...but only in some patients. I have seen patients with Stage IV terminal cancer be literally cured. Every GBM patient in the world should have access to this treatment. Oh and did I mention the lead inventor on the patent is a pediatric neuro-oncologist that worked at a very prestigious hospital in NY previously? Google her.

Conclusion

Ok so I'm now convinced of the science side but how does this all equal money? I go look up the study. This is a phase 2 trial meaning that they are looking to see if the drug is effective (phase 1 = is the drug safe, phase 2 = does the drug work...did I mention that before I was a doctor I ran clinical research studies?). I saunter over to clinical[trials.gov](https://trials.gov) (the federal website where all clinical trials are listed) and notice that the trial for this drug is set to be complete June 2021. The completion date is when the final patient has completed study protocol...meaning they have 99% of their data and the study is essentially complete. I then saunter over to [google.com](https://google.com) (the worlds largest search engine) and look for other data they have. Turns out they have ALREADY PUBLISHED EXTREMELY PROMISING INTERIM DATA ([https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/inovio-demonstrates-80-6-month-progression-free-survival-in-phase-2-glioblastoma-multiforme-gbm-study-with-ino-5401-in-combination-with-pd-1-inhibitor-libtayo-cemiplimab-300951433.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/inovio-demonstrates-80-6-month-progression-free-survival-in-phase-2-glioblastoma-multiforme-gbm-study-with-ino-5401-in-combination-with-pd-1-inhibitor-libtayo-cemiplimab-300951433.html)). ""Overall survival"" and ""Progression free survival"" are the holy grails of results in cancer research. The fact that they have 80% progression free survival less than halfway through this study is mind blowing. I can only imagine what sort of data they have now considering they included an image of complete resolution of a GBM tumor on their patent. But again ... how is it that this is gonna moon soon? Well because $INO just signed up to present their findings at not one but two upcoming conferences. [https://s23.q4cdn.com/479936946/files/doc\_news/INOVIO-to-Present-at-Upcoming-Investor-Conferences-in-May-2021.pdf](https://s23.q4cdn.com/479936946/files/doc_news/INOVIO-to-Present-at-Upcoming-Investor-Conferences-in-May-2021.pdf). Dates: May 12, May 18. Not just a one tiered moon shot, but a two tiered moon shot! 

Discussion

In conclusion: their study showing the delivery of a highly effective drug, to a cancer that is otherwise a death sentence and currently has NO EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS is coming to an end and results are imminent. Two upcoming conferences to disclose their findings. I don't know what I'm more excited about...a potential game changing treatment for a devastating disease that has personally touched people I love or this rocket ride to the moon. I like the stock. I like the tech. I like the implications to cancer treatment.

Disclosures: No affiliation with any of the above companies. I bought lots calls as well as stock this morning. I have no idea what I'm doing. In fact if anyone wants to tell me how to make money from this information please let me know."

This material is for educational purposes only.

**TL;DR:** Civilians can trade with high leverage (over 6x) in risk-based portfolios (or portfolio margin accounts). There is no magic to it, and the risk can be LOWER than trading at 4-6x using directional leverage (CFDs or Total Return Swaps). Using net credit option trades to do it increases the difficulty and requires time spent actively in the account every day the market is open. The charts show you how bumpy it can be day to day. More on this below.

**Introduction**

Three weeks ago I posted something similar about chasing convexity and using risk management (specifically, hedging) to increase leverage in a portfolio margin account. I did not expect the smart questions and comments I got then, so this is Part Three (these posts started over a year ago). I will provide a summary of pros and cons from trading using this approach as I am moving to new things. It is unlikely to post about it anymore, the topic is exhausted as far as I am concerned.

**Prerequisites**

This is a list of phrases to research, the best I can come up with while writing this post:

option pricing

option strategies

dynamic hedging

portfolio margin

TIMS margin

margin stress test

risk convexity

weighted vega

option market makers strategies

long term short term capital gains tax

You also need to be comfortable with macro economics, financial analysis and valuation methods, monetary and fiscal policy, SEC/FINRA/exchange rules and goes without saying, you need to use portfolio margin.

**Core trade concept**

You need to think of cash and volatility as assets. When you make a trade, you swap assets (stocks, options, futures, FOPs, indexes, cash). You can be long or short assets.

Your portfolio has to be designed in such a way it is ""balanced"" at spot. Search ""delta neutral"" as a proxy to grasp the concept.

Research ""long short strategy"". That should give you examples of balancing a portfolio.

A lot of hedging strategies (and a market maker specifically, delta hedging) are about protecting the PnL.

I look at my account from three angles:

1. PnL
2. Risk (margin requirements)
3. Tax liability

There is no freely available opportunity to structure a trade in the public markets where all three are protected from downside risk aka ""free lunch"". In order to get value from this post you need to accept that first.

You can however focus on two out of the three above, and disregard or postpone dealing with the third.

My personal priority order has always been Risk, Tax Liability, PnL. As long as you don't need to realize losses or are forced into liquidation, PnL volatility can be ignored. This is easier said than done - you need mental game and conviction to handle the drawdowns.

In summary, to achieve high leverage and low risk while chasing convex returns you will experience stress and delayed gratification. This is the price.

**Application**

You must do fundamental research (analysis) and identify assets that have relatively high share price, are marginable, experience high volatility and have a deep, liquid option chain available for you to trade. It is essential that you choose something with a hard floor on value (NAV > zero from an accounting point of view).

Examples: $SPY, $TSLA, $SQ, $GOOG, $FB, $MRNA etc.

An options straddle (buy a call and a put contract with the same strike and expiration) is the simplest example of a positive convexity risk profile. You can use the put/call parity formula C - P = S - K to define a convex trade including long and short options across the term plus a position in the underlying. For extra benefit, you can try to define the options structure in such a way it's net credit (you collect more premium from short legs expiring worthless than you pay for the long legs).

The long/short aspect of the portfolio comes from exploring the concept of being long the underlying and short the same using options (synthetic short, risk reversal, ratios etc). Since you are not focused on delta hedging (being market neutral) at all times, the profit comes from having a view on the underlying direction (for example delta positive for a bull view).

The leverage is the result of managing risk. Think of finance as the ""art of pricing risk"". When you add a position to your portfolio margin, it will increase you collateral requirements if you take on more risk or decrease them if you achieve the opposite. Leverage is just a number - the ratio between the gross position value and the net liquidation value in mark-to-market terms of your positions. One dollar of liquidation value in assets can in my case controls almost 30 dollars of market exposure (long+short).

If you got this far you should have understood already that this leverage is not linear. Nor are your potential returns if the position has positive convexity like I am showing you below from my account (screenshots from my Interactive Brokers TWS interface and the FundSeeder connected account).

**Pros**

You can use this approach to build a bigger position that you would normally control in the market. The dynamic adjustment (hedging), cost of transactions and time commitment plus the margin cost (I am paying approximately 22bps above the 10Y treasury note rate at the time of writing) must be factored in.

You have a certain amount of delta hedging around spot...but as the account becomes larger and more complex, the tradeoff between the three components mentioned above is more obvious. There will be move volatility in your PnL than in your underlyings, at times. This is actually a **con**.

If any of the underlyings you have exposure to moves aggressively up or down, you profit from it more than 1% for each 100bps move (convexity). If it trades sideway, you should be able to get a some net credit from your premium writing.

**Cons**

Any trading strategy works until it doesn't. For example if rates go up, or volatility across the market goes down, this loses its effectiveness and operators have to adapt or experience low performance or losses.

A position using both stock and options which capture different levels of implied volatility across the term has to be entered over time. Liquidating the account, extricating yourself from the daily management can be a complex project with unmitigated risks (if market moves aggressively while unwinding positions).

Same applies to margin calls - while the broker usually does a stellar job trimming down your positions to bring the risk down, it does not have the mandate to open new contracts. Letting them run unsupervised in a high leverage setup can mean dealing with a small crisis now in the wrong way can set the scene for a massive blowout at the next one, maybe in the next minute.

The skill, time and mental game requirements make any succession planning difficult. Finding a buddy to take over for you can lead some to posting at length on public forums.

**Conclusion**

The charts are speaking for themselves. High NLV volatility, massive recent drawdown (but no realized losses). If trading tech (I call them controversial) stocks like me, it's worth putting the past couple of weeks in context. The broad index is fine. All the high beta tech stuff that has no multiple support is getting wrecked. Hedge Funds long, retail long, ARKK long. Mix of unwinds and shorts pressing coupled with exogenous factors like Prime Brokers tightening control after the Archegos disaster are just amplifying the noise. Fiscal and monetary policy is accommodating, but the new tax policy will have an impact on high risk assets even if not enacted. Fed and Treasury working well, pay attention to what they do not what they say (Daily Treasury Statement, FRED, H.8).

Reopening the economy is the current theme. The supply chain disruption playing on the front month of commodity futures prices is expected, but you want to apply critical thinking when you hear the argument for ""inflation"". Another phrase to google and do deep research on. Mainstream media is not the ideal place to get financial education.

This is it.. written in a single go... I'm not selling a strategy, I am not an educator, I am sharing because explaining things, scrutinizing the HOW and WHY are the best ways I know to invite critical thinking and overcome your blind spots.

Massively thankful to WSB and Reddit for giving me the chance to meet some amazing people and learn so much along the way.

There are also options on corn. I'm sorry if you can't trade futures. The next contract in September would not be preferred since that's the start of the harvest which usually runs into November.

If you have been watching the news, expensive agriculture has been nothing new in the past month. That shouldn't be too worrying, since the May Corn which set a high at $7.40/bsh was due to lack of old-stored stock because no one planted that much or thought to store that much during the recession. This is kinda like the opposite of the negative oil prices last year when there was 0 demand and full storage, because right not there is quite brisk demand (not from food, but ethanol producers) and rapidly decreasing grain stores. July corn should also face the exact same problem, possibly worse as fertilizer prices are climbing and a few other factors detailed below.

**Ethanol Demand**: Who uses the most corn? Nope, not farmers for feed or your fat wife but ethanol producers. What happens to all that ethanol? Except for some good ol' states like Oklahoma which sells mostly 100% pure American anticommunist gasoline, the ethanol is used for fuel. A quick google search will yield [articles reporting that fuel demand for end of March has surpassed levels set during 2020](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-products-gasoline/u-s-gasoline-demand-exceeds-2020-levels-for-first-time-in-2021-opis-idUSKBN2BM1UR). Americans are driving/traveling again as more and more of us are getting vaccinated, simply don't care, or are forced to commute back to the office. This will result in continued high demand for gasoline, and thus ethanol.

**Lack of Supply**: This is the critical part that resulted in May Corn's sharp rise. Supply as of right now might not be getting better, and thus should also play into July Corn's pricing. These are largely weather based, but starting with...

**Corn Stocks are still trending down**: If you've ever watched Trading Places and wondered if you can make a killing on the [crop report](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/), here's your chance. This is the March 2021 grains report, and the headline is that [Corn stocks are -3% from 2020](https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/xg94hp534/db78v700p/7p88db273/grst0321.pdf).

Essentially all the 2020 harvest should be accounted for in December 2020 (harvest for corn is usually Sept - Nov). The demand is almost 250 million bushels more than the similar timeframe from last year. Also remember when looking at the March 2020 data below, that is when gasoline demand and food demand dropped through the floor. We're not going to get any new corn until September, so this summer of relying on what we have still in storage is going to get tight.

**Weather pt1 Droughts**: Even though weather this summer won't affect July corn which should already be in storage, inclement weather might force users to bring forward their deliveries, because they won't be sure if their September/December stocks will even be there. Right now, the midwest is starting to see[signs of a drought](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/) (if you're going to trade this, this site has to become your new bookmarked page). A look at the historical patterns, and you can see more and more of the midwest is [facing inclement drought conditions](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?Midwest).

**Weather pt2 Odd Weather Patterns**: Now I haven't read any scholarly articles for this, but doesn't it seem weather is odd this year for most of the country? First the [big winds from last year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_2020_Midwest_derecho), then the early 2021 [big polar vortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2021_North_American_cold_wave) that made a big V shape, and then sudden warming we're seeing now. I won't be so shocked if some big storm happens this summer to affect the heartland. Corn is very susceptible to storms because the roots are really shallow.

**Weather pt3 Stress**: In any case, the weather so far might be leading to stressed corn. I have some BS11 planted in the middle of Texas, and it's already tasseling without any ears. This may be due to heat and drought conditions, but in any case I've heard farmers' horror stories of having their entire acreage sold for sileage because not one ear grew. Here's a pic of mine. The corn is about 4ft tall right now.

https://preview.redd.it/g9sgyn7bbzw61.jpg?width=2976&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=476caf52a3d8542e8e2048d5e456102d12f9a80d

&#x200B;

**High input costs**: This shouldn't color you shocked, but there's a [fertilizer shortage](https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/planting/fertilizer-shortage-ken-ferrie-weighs-fertilizer-issues-spring) going on too. You gotta use that and pesticides. I'm not sure if farmers have calculated this, but there's about at 20% increase in prices. Naturally I hope this means they're not willing to hedge their prices at a lower level (selling into the market), further helping prices go higher.

&#x200B;

**Other considerations**: Corn is an international crop, but most of it is in the US. Brazil and Ukraine should have good planting, but once again that shouldn't affect July because of the supply/demand imbalance. There's also something about a locust infestation in Indiana. But, [plantings are increasing at a brisk pace](https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/planting/corn-planting-progress-leaps-29-points-beats-2020s-historic-jump). That might be why prices dropped today which I bought into.

These are my positions. I look forward to keep buying 2-5 contracts at a time and holding towards expiration in 57 days.

I didn't know that it would garner that much of positive feedbacks and I'm excited to write my TA posts as a series if time allows me to.

With that being said, I do not plan to write these kind of posts for every trading session days since I would run out of things to say at one point. My intention is to write these kind of posts for days where we see a significant gap-up or gap-down that reinforces the Elliott Wave Theory speculation. I also want to remind you that if the closing price goes below the speculated ""bottom"", the entire theory will be invalidated. I hope you all join me in this bumpy ride and enjoy it together. Anyways, let's get right to what I think about Friday's (4/30/21) price action.

# Brief Summary:

As of 4/30/21, CLOV opened at $9.89 and closed at $9.85 with a previous closing price of $10.17 (-3.15%). To simply put it, today was a consolidation day based on the opening price and the closing price. The volume didn't help with the stock's bullish sentiment either as Friday's volume was at 17.38 mil in contrast to Thursday's volume at 68.33 mil. This means Friday's volume was cut down by more than -74.5%; that's 3/4 of Thursday's total volume, gone for today. Now, I have a few speculations as to why we experienced one of the lowest volumes on Friday ever since the CLOV hype began:

* Continual market beatdown against smaller market caps causing a FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) against retail investors which discouraged investors from purchasing stocks due to the fear of further market beatdown.
* CLOV's chart on Friday EXACTLY mirrored the NASDAQ 100 chart and NASDAQ's relative volume was the LOWEST out of all three major stock market indices (DOW, NASDAQ, and S&P 500). Don't believe it? Check out the images below.
   * Based on the images below, it's clear to me that there is a positive correlation to the performance of market index versus CLOV (individual stock) on Friday. This leads to a reasonable assumption that CLOV had a disappointing day NOT because of CLOV's getting ""dumped on"" per se, but rather because the entire market (especially NASDAQ) performed poorly on Friday.

**Fibonacci retracements:**

With Friday's bearish price action, it's good to see that we've respected the 23.6% level as a major support rather than letting it become the new resistance level. However, Friday's price action doesn't **necessarily** indicate that Thursday's (4/29/21) price action was a bear trap. Depending on the next Monday's overall market performance, volume level, and buying pressure, I think we will be able to get a clearer picture as to whether we are going to use 23.6% level as a support to bounce off from or continue the downward trend. Overall, I do think that we will see 23.6% level being used as a support for CLOV to bounce off on as long as the overall market shows a reversal pattern on Monday.

**Elliott Wave Theory:**

Friday's price action, although it was a minimal dip in the grand scheme of things, does confirm that we are in wave 2 which is a corrective wave. I originally speculated that we will see a healthy pullback to around $8.52 range but since the chart respected the 23.6% level as a support, we may see a bounce earlier and perhaps move on to wave 3. That's a very good thing for all of us who want to see CLOV explode off to Mars. But, of course, this is all contingent upon high volume level and high buying pressure. We will have to continue to observe the price action and the daily chart to find further confirmations that indicate to wave 3 speculation.

**VWAP:**

Today, I wanted to focus more on the VWAP which is an acronym for 'volume weighted average price'. Simply put, it's a metric used for intraday charts to determine the buying pressure and selling pressure based on that day's volume and share price. The rule of this metric is: **If the candle sticks are above the VWAP line, it's a bullish sentiment and vice versa.**

Based on that rule, we can now look at the 5 min chart and see what's going on with the VWAP line which is colored blue. Looking at the chart, we can see that during the market opening, we stayed **above** the VWAP line with a great start to the volume level. This means that the buying pressure was greater than the selling pressure based on the volume. However, as the trading session went on, the explanation provided from the brief summary section caused the volume level to dry up and die off. And as the volume level went down, you can see how the candle sticks moved **below** the VWAP line which means that the selling pressure was greater than the buying pressure.

**RSI:**

This is further reinforced by looking at Friday's RSI chart. You can see that during the market opening, RSI trended towards an overbought territory, but as volume level died off RSI eventually corrected itself down to a neutral level, consolidated a bit, and headed over to an oversold level which is correlated to the 5 min price chart above. Based on VWAP and RSI analysis, it is reasonable to assume that CLOV will show a reversal as long as the volume level is high.

**Short Volume:**

Let's take a look at CLOV's short volume as a bonus since people believe there's a potential for short squeeze. According to a quick Google search, it is widely accepted as a fact that 10% short interest ratio is considered 'high' while 20% short interest ratio is considered 'extremely high'. Now take a look at all three of the short volume data on popular stocks like AMC, GME, and then CLOV. And now, take a look at CLOV's stock price history chart with its volume for each trading session days, what do you see?

It's clear to me as day that shorts are shorting in PROPORTION to the amount of volume level for each trading session day. Whether that day's volume level is extremely high or not, they are shorting CLOV with an average shorting ratio percentage of 23.1% which is considered EXTREMELY HIGH from 4/19 to 4/30. To further add, we can see that short volume ratio is pretty much similar across all three stocks. Based on that analysis, I will let you be the judge on whether we have a potential for short squeeze or not.

&#x200B;

# Conclusion:

In conclusion, CLOV's share price did NOT necessarily drop on Friday because people are ""dumping"" their shares. We rather saw a slight drop in CLOV's share price on Friday because of market's poor overall performance that led to an extremely low volume level. This led to shorts having a field day by shorting the stock even more as the short volume ratio is consistently at around 20%. **But,** we shouldn't invest in the stock based on the short squeeze potential alone. We should invest in the stock because we believe in the company and the company's management.

That being said, with 2 days of bearish days for the overall market, I hope to see a green day for the market on Monday and see CLOV bounce off from the $9.66 support. Thank you for reading and I look forward to throwing a champagne party with you all once we are at the moon!

**Tl;dr:** **Today's low volume can be explained by the overall market performance, so don't worry too much about the price action today. BUY and HODL and watch this four petal leaf company go off to the moon with me.**

**Disclaimer:** This is not a financial advice. I'm simply a fellow ape who just likes the company. Invest at your own risk and most importantly, do your own personal due diligence to ensure that the facts are true.

But more importantly, CLOV is currently priced under $10. I'm hearing many people claim it will be more than double this come the next earnings report on May 17th.

For some quick background - CLOV, or Clover Health Investments, is a healthcare technology company that has been on the rise for quite some time now. They've been increasing their member count substantially and each member has pulled in more profit for the company as time moves forward.

Right now I think that the company is OVERWHELMINGLY UNDERVALUED.

This is not just a 'potential meme' stock, but it is definitely a long-term growth stock with investors in mind.

Right now the company is approaching $10 per share with a prior peak at ~$17.07 back in December, and a low of around ~$7.29 in March (for reference).

The stock appears to hang around the $10 mark generally, but search traffic has been increasing (checked using google trends) and I'm hearing a lot of talk with the next earnings report. Combine this with a higher volatility, this leads me to believe CLOV might be my lucky stock of choice that will bring me to paradise 🏖️

I'm trying to start a mini-discussion here of the potential of CLOV as both a long-term and short-term investment. I think I like the stonk 🍀🍀🍀🍀

Again this is not investing advice, just things I've picked up on in the last few days.

# TL;DR

**Expectation: Acquisition by Google.**

I discuss how to think about Fastly as an investment to folks who have reasoned that investing in cloud compute and networking is a good idea but may not necessarily understand how or why it’s a good idea. We focus on basic networking and the consequences of “serverless” computing; an architecture that has gained popularity in recent years.

I’ve written about Cloudflare before in May 2020, on an account called u/codingprofessor, before taking DD writing more seriously. I claimed that Cloudflare would blow past $60 dollars and was critically undervalued due to COVID economics, their current position in web security, and serverless computing. I still view that Cloudflare and Fastly can both reach 40B+ marketcaps by 2023.

&#x200B;

[Don't doubt your vibe](https://preview.redd.it/bgr8i8qmmjw61.png?width=1148&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bf7e7d98c3282535be6240c354322969fdd4bb1)

# Purpose

To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here. WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts can outpace Wall Street analysts at places like Morningstar or The Motley Fool. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that often gets filtered out.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation or cooperation. Here are some recent DDs:

# Cloudflare vs. Fastly

**- TL;DR Fastly makes stuff faster, Cloudflare is more general purpose. They can be used together.**

[Support](https://preview.redd.it/8nw4s6mlojw61.png?width=1220&format=png&auto=webp&s=0060e02dd4363ce7e7cc4cf3b59b3438603b9bc7)

This is a common question that is asked by investors interested in the cloud computing space from both novices and experts alike. In my view, the comparison isn’t very useful and usually illustrates some misunderstanding between the two product spaces. Fastly is focused on real-time services and acts as an optimizing layer for existing network providers. Cloudflare is a general network competitor. You can use both, and most do.

&#x200B;

[General purpose needs](https://preview.redd.it/8g9lk7uhwjw61.png?width=2314&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdaadd144aa9a0b64a37a3c05a6f236c965fefb6)

In a crude sense, Fastly focuses on convenience akin to the services provided by Costco, while players like Akamai or Cloudflare focus on the convenience brought to you by gas stations or companies like Walmart. It’s not to say that one is better than the other, because it's not. They just solve different problems with completely different approaches. You may not go to Costco as often as you do Walmart, but when you go to Costco, you're picking up and utilizing a lot more.

This explains why Fastly takes the approach to generally co-operate with other service providers and is able to provide a range of services for things like Snapchat storage, Spotify network meshes, Google Cloud services, and other real-time demands from the tech industry.

&#x200B;

>""While a convenience store is generally closer to a person's home, it has a limited set of items for sale. If the person drives a few more miles to the supermarket, they could get all of their groceries in one trip. In this case, convenience stores represent the approach taken by the legacy CDN's with many local POPs and the supermarkets represent Fastly's approach with fewer, larger ones.""

&#x200B;

Cloudflare has ambitions to compete with the likes of companies like Amazon and attempts to be a general purpose solution for networking on the internet - it wants to make the internet more accessible, safer, and fair. Fastly seeks to solve specific problems on the internet. So in a nutshell, one is a general solution and the other is a specialized solution.

An example of specialized needs provided by Fastly is like Reddit’s execution of the r/place experiment in 2017 - which allowed millions of users to collaborate and draw an image together pixel by pixel with rules and regulations in real-time.

[Real-time collaboration services meets art and communtiy.](https://i.redd.it/2kf4qnoorjw61.gif)

This is only one example of many. The way I like to frame it is by viewing real-time and collaborative services as a relatively new economic need, and thus a product like Fastly has a high demand from organizations that excel with these kinds of services. You may see associations with Fastly from places like Spotify, Ticketmaster, or The New York Times - all of which have specific needs or demands when it comes to content delivery and network management.

[world-class research](https://preview.redd.it/m9muspwsrjw61.png?width=1594&format=png&auto=webp&s=72b18b1b49ed8aed906a2b9936beb1e29a5479a1)

A big advantage that Fastly has in this regard is the fact that they often build their network with the intention of being world-class from top to bottom, from the code they write to the metals that build their points of presence. They are effectively able to choose their destiny as a product versus having to race the horses in competition. They research, experiment, and execute on the boundary of networking, making it a superb way to play the serverless and networking industry from a long point of view.

The result of this approach means higher quality servers and less need to rely on the number of PoPs used.  This ultimately means that Fastly spends less on building and maintaining servers while being an order of magnitude faster at the same time. They are efficient and provide value per the dollar spent on their network from customers and internal alike.

&#x200B;

[the capex equation](https://preview.redd.it/s9n1xm5zrjw61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=65e97432b694a884e1445db1793377e0f3eefa8c)

Cloudflare's team of course counters this by saying that speed is not nearly as important as Cloudflare's ability to be compliant to global requirements. This is completely nonsense if you consider that in the long-term, Fastly's general approach is to solve specific problems rather than to function as a general purpose network.

The compliance debate is a bogus marketing attempt when Fastly's speeds, in the microseconds, is exponentially faster than Cloudflare's serverless implementation that sits in the milliseconds range. This is frankly an example of how Matt Prince is warmer to investors and plays a stronger marketing game than Artur Bergman, who seemingly could not care to impress Wall Street funds and plays for the long-term.

[Matt Prince's Hierarchy of Developer's Needs](https://preview.redd.it/9afefjyasjw61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=af129b27bf734c74c0d8a039341ff03b126af5c1)

Why does this distinction matter? Well what of the requirements where networking speed and response times are critical, like hospital communications, stock market crashes, wildfires, or other problems unique to the challenges of running a network?

&#x200B;

>The way to think about this is, what do you pay for, right? I mean if you -- and where are these moments that are valuable. When Tiger Wood walks down with the 18th green the Masters and God willing he is able to do that again, that matters, that moment matters. Everyone is going to tweet about it, and everyone wants to see it, the company that is in charge of that cares desperately about that content. When you send a gift across the Internet, like it's not monetized in the same way, it's not as valued.. So where we have seen the value is in content that is highly valuable to customers and their end consumer, where they're willing to pay for it and the quality, and the security and the scale of that deeply matters. And we have always focused our work on that type of content. There's plenty of content that just scrapes by and is low commodity. Every month, they want a lower price. That's a different market from our perspective, and we're not in it."" - Fastly CEO

# Understanding Content Delivery

**- TL;DR You have data, you cut the data into smaller pieces, send it across a network, and rebuild those pieces somewhere else.**

[The global cache](https://preview.redd.it/a92mp9wesjw61.png?width=951&format=png&auto=webp&s=c98e66b61a7b13f89a4556399c8264a038bb16ac)

It’s helpful to understand the 7  steps that protocols take as they travel across and through a network around the world. This model is known as the OSI model and it’s not necessarily the end-all-be-all model that governs the internet; but it is a useful framework to understand at a glance.

There are many complexities that go behind these protocols and they are the subject of intense debate or research. At the same time, many of these steps follow a similar process - translate or transform the data that’s received and sent.

&#x200B;

[Edge computing, an extension of the cloud.](https://preview.redd.it/r5k1yknbyjw61.png?width=472&format=png&auto=webp&s=60bbe4420f4025c8c791d62c569453ce82a8a8b0)

For example, the web browser translates the data into machine bytecode in a similar way that a networking router will need to translate information into a stream of 0 and 1 signals. This may not make too much sense yet, but just remember that it’s just a series of translations and preparations of data into different segments so that it could be read and understood by other pieces of hardware.

&#x200B;

[Email, zoom calls, pins, streams, different network flavors.](https://preview.redd.it/kvhajfjtujw61.png?width=1762&format=png&auto=webp&s=2570ebd03b9fd5c08989b0b5551d9eea2c5c3c44)

&#x200B;

1. **Application Layer:** You initiate a Zoom call. It has passed through the application layer using an real-time messaging protocol. It sends the video to the presentation layer.
2. **Presentation Layer:** The video data is received and compressed. It gets sent to the session layer.
3. **Session Layer:** A communication session is initiated. A network communication is initiated, with various receivers at some set of defined internet address routes.
4. **Transportation Layer:** The data is further segmented and prepared for transportation.
5. **Network Layer:** Once the data has reached this stage, the segments are converted to packets.
6. **Data Link Layer:** The data is sliced into frames and delivered to the physical layer.
7. **Physical Layer:** The frames are converted into a bitstream of 0s and 1s as a way to represent that final stage of data representation, which are signals that along a physical medium like a cable.

&#x200B;

[OSI Model](https://preview.redd.it/68fe020vsjw61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f4ae86782c3c87978af6e4a9bf46d1b0f695347)

As the data reaches its destination, it goes through the 7 layer process again in the opposite direction, where the data is received at the physical layer and concludes at the application layer (the person who you sent an Zoom call to). There’s a reason that the network use trucks or mail deliveries as ways to compare the process as it can be strikingly similar at times.

What are the complexities related to delivering a letter, a box of clothes, or a Home Depot truck full of metals and wood? So that’s the essence behind content-delivery networks - preparing information and delivering it with optimal paths.

It’s worth taking some time to ponder and think about this. They may be words or ideas that you’ve heard - routers, bitstreams, addresses, and so on. What is the difference between collecting a Pinterest pin, playing a Spotify stream, or setting up a Zoom call without a video? How do we utilize location data when it comes to COVID containment efforts? What are the consequences of correcting a news article, fact checking a social media post, or reconciling the differences in video game connections in a game like Call of Duty?

&#x200B;

[Networking meets human experiences](https://preview.redd.it/d5nbigz1tjw61.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=d39cdad6269f4b7d224fff12e6c39adc60584d60)

With this developing model in mind, consider again how Cloudflare is particularly invested in the overall health of a network, while Fastly is primarily concerned with pushing the network further. They seek to solve different platforms, while having obvious overlaps at the same time.

# Serverless Compute - The Event Driven Network

**TL;DR Serverless allows software engineers to spend more time building products.**

[The event driven network](https://preview.redd.it/lhez9rq6tjw61.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb377d7a5f2c3d3995c4c56ec0a5b925a860e0f7)

What serverless architecture accomplishes is that it adds programmability and portability to the cloud clusters and the network. There are two major benefits to serverless computing:

1. It grants developers access to complex functions out of the box.

For example, if a developer wants to create a lightning fast application where taking an image of a crop plant returns some analysis about the health of the crop or warning signs that the crop image is showing, a serverless ""function-as-a-service"" can provide that capacity for a developer.

https://preview.redd.it/bm6jwodptjw61.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=29a9e9552a1f3874b8932e5baaabe5bf91c8fccd

That image is stored with the provider to improve the quality of future recommendations and output as well. Given that the image taker is likely situated in a rural area, edge computing like this allows the application to complete this process much faster than communicating to a central server that is in a much farther location.

&#x200B;

[Functions as a service](https://preview.redd.it/1trzui6ctjw61.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=5501fee8d2a9a8e2e5bce681a6b86d6f48e69da3)

2. It allows developers to spend more time working on application code rather than infrastructure tosupport it.

Imagine that a product that benefits off real-time services and events has particular problems handling the amount of traffic that reaches their servers. A perfect example of this are the server failures of Rob-in-the-hood during spikes of activity or Reddit's own ability to handle surges of logins, registrations, and activity after events like GME's stock market explosion. Other historical problems were things like World of Warcraft's expansion releases, where servers were effectively ""on fire"" and required round-the-clock support.

Edge computing effectively offloads some of these problems from central servers by making the network more programmable and effective. If an application I wrote suddenly has to manage 1,000,000 users, a serverless architecture allows for intelligent ""autoscaling"" - which means that services like Fastly will handle those problems for me. This ultimately results in a metered pay-as-you-go system.

&#x200B;

[The network as a utility](https://preview.redd.it/hq7l51wwtjw61.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1f88e8d28b452a5bf0a7d0c560e22e8b2ba0f7a)

The combination of these two benefits is pretty powerful, allowing a developer to essentially start up an idea from application to deployment at a much faster pace. I believe this should equip a reader with the ability to imagine the opportunity behind edge and serverless computing. Here are some simple questions I like to think about:

&#x200B;

[we've all been there.](https://preview.redd.it/ydk0hfx7ujw61.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c506b4d99dfd7e7f512f9d304f5c1e8f53e52e9)

\- Can we improve the customer experience of swiping a card in a store or other network based currencies?

\- How do we improve the security of individual network-connected devices?

\- Are we able to improve the response times of emergency technologies like hospital or firefight dispatching?

\- Are we able to better measure online engagement and create new interactive experiences?

\- Will online video games require servers bounded by location?

\- Would we be able to change camera angles when watching a sports stream?

\- Can we improve the quality of industrial automation or logistics?

\- Are we able to extend programmability to ""node"" based products like windmill farms or electric vehicle charging stations?

&#x200B;

[ 🚀](https://preview.redd.it/5otn5vekvjw61.png?width=2230&format=png&auto=webp&s=14201da0292e3f895dc829239999889d0af43add)

Some of these questions are asked by Fastly themselves, as they list the following subjects of interest in their S-1:

1. **API acceleration**. Accelerate and secure critical API responses at the edge for delightful application experiences, such as instant hotel lookup based on location and real-time inventory updates between retail stores and their online storefronts;
2. **IoT**. Process and secure data from connected devices at the edge for instant results for time-sensitive applications;
3. **Cloud migration**. Seamlessly migrate from data center to cloud, hybrid or multi-cloud environments, enabling the customer to take advantage of the functionality and cost savings of one or more cloud providers
4. **Enabling redactedchain (block)**. Cache and accelerate individual transactions on the redactedchain (block) in real time.

# Conclusion

TL;DR Investing in some form of serverless computing is a good idea.

You may have noticed that I did not discuss financials. This is mostly because these details do not nearly weigh as much as the general understanding of the product, which is content-delivery and serverless computing. In my view, the economic consequence of these architectures far outweighs any other metric that could measure the future value of a company like Fastly. Most of my DD writing follows this principal; I'm far more focused on economic consequences and incentives of an industry player rather than data-points that can be fixed in time like a recent earnings or financial report.

Nothing to panic over but a solidly red day following an all time high.  Previously I have focused by DD efforts into research on Boomer Stocks.   Great stocks with real products, strong histories of growth, objectively clear market conditions (e.g. steel is up bigly US Steel will likely have a great Q2)

This week I need to focus on the other side of my portfolio - Becky Stocks.   My fat ex-wife always makes me add some Becky to our portfolio so I looked into the Becky index and found ETSY.  It looked like a solid option at first with earnings still approaching and other similar stocks gaining post earnings (Amazon, Shopify), but then to top it off it dumped 5% today.  A $25 billion dollar company lost over a $1 billion in value in a single day.  Not because of any particular negative news or anything, it appears to just be a general sell-off.

**Does Becky still like Etsy? - Yes**

Etsy has grown revenue and profits by margins ranging from 100 to 500% YoY growth in all the key financial metrics.  Etsy is more popular than ever and Google Trends data/Alexa rankings don't show a noteworthy slowdown.  ([https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fm%2F0byvh\_&geo=US](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fm%2F0byvh_&geo=US))

**Does Becky have incentive to buy cute Etsy items as things slowly open up? - Yes**

Responsible Becky hasn't had the ability to host house parties or show off newest 'Live, Laugh, Love' decor.  Everyone wants to get out and see friends/family and Becky knows that theme parties and custom theme'd decor is he best way to prepare for these parties.   Just as a general rule there is suddenly a lot more incentive to make your house more guest friendly moving forward.  

**Was Etsy just over-valued and dumping?**  

While the P/E for Etsy is high at 76 that is comparable to Amazon (who is going to rate lower partially because they just had great earnings while Etsy hasn't reported yet to clear out Q1 2020 from it's ratings) and less than companies like Square and Shopify.  Obviously growth is assumed, but Etsy clearly has room to grow so it should not be a problem.  Etsy is currently trading almost $50 below it ATH from March 1st and while having wild swings over the past months it has been generally stable as a stock and there isn't any reason to suspect another major shift downward.

**TL D/R What does it all Mean?**

Etsy is a solid growth stock that appears to be at or near bottom with an earnings report coming up that will likely be favorable.  Other companies in online retail have seen boosts from good earnings so why not Etsy?  

&#x200B;

**Boomer Thoughts**

Etsy may be 'Tech' but it is harnessing the ingenuity of the American people to create new and unique products.  They have already shown that they have strong management by using their early pandemic mask sales jump to gain, retain, and boost their customer base.   Hard workers making physical goods with solid leadership makes for a good company.  They don't have a dividend yet but they are new and need to reinvest in the company.  Considering their primarily female audience making efforts to reach out to men would be a great next step.  Improving the search function could certainly help.

**Fat Ex-Wife Thoughts**

There is no way Etsy is going to stay down this low.  Everyone I know is using Etsy for personal products and gifts.  Amazon is great for generic products but it has become absolute trash when you want to find something meaningful due to the way generic products flood the market for just about anything you want.  Etsy makes online shopping fun again while Amazon shopping is about as fun as running any errand.  It is going back up to its 250 ATH and beyond.   Just hold on for a while!  My Ex-husband wants to buy US steel instead.  They already had earnings and already went up.  He has all quarter to rotate what's left of his losses into X.  I want my part of the portfolio in something happy!

**Positions**

None, plan to buy calls for the end of May either ITM or slightly OTM Monday

I don't usually like writing up about companies with  more than half-trillion dollar market caps, but I'll make an exception  just this once because it doesn't get any easier than this trade,  especially with our newfound policy of kissing China's feet rather than  trying to piss them off.  So let's talk about Alibaba ($BABA)

# Who they are, in case you've been living under a rock

$BABA  is basically the result of if you combined $AMZN, $JPM, $SHOP, $PYPL,  and $GOOG (not $GOOGL, no voting rights in China).  Over 90% of China's  online shopping goes through one of their portals, mostly Taobao on the  consumer side and the flagship Alibaba site for B2B.  Oh, and they've  even started building out their own cloud platform, because China can  never just come up with an idea on their own, they have to copy a  competitor (i.e. Amazon).  If you think Amazon is pervasive, they're  bush league compared to this company.  In short, the only thing bigger  than China's $BABA is deceased WWF pornstar Chyna's clit (still too  soon?).

Anecdotally,  they're also where savvy US consumers go to buy $1500 DJI Phantom 4  drones for like 400 bucks (and no, they're not knockoffs).

&#x200B;

# Peering over the Great Wall:

&#x200B;

Their over 600 billion dollar market  cap makes them the 7th largest company on the exchange, just behind  $TSLA and just above Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger.  Unlike the  company just ahead of them, they actually make money, though.  They do  about 72 billion dollars in revenue annually and, when they're not  pissing off the communist party and being handed down massive fines as  an alternative to their founder being disappeared to go hang out with  the Uyghurs in a slave camp making textiles, they pocket about 12  billion of that 72 as net revenue.  They make their money by selling ad  space to merchants as opposed to $AMZN's method of ""taking 1/3 of all  the money you make for giving you a buy button on the site"" and, as  recently as 2019, had grand designs about moving in to the US space and  taking on $AMZN head-on with a merchant agreement of a one-time  admission fee in exchange for commission free commerce.  I could write  an entire thesis just on their various revenue streams.  Everything from  ecommerce to a search engine to their own fucking (**DUMB FILTER ALERT:**  automod doesn't like the 4 letter word for a place you go to deposit your money and get checks so we'll call them) tanking ecosystem  (which they unsuccessfully tried to spin off into its own entity last  year, thoroughly pissing off Winnie the Pooh and momentarily distracting  him from peaceably seizing Hong Kong by killing all the citizens there.

Interestingly,  as a result of their mini argument with the technocommunist leadership  over a failed attempt to IPO the Ant Financial Group, which $BABA owns  1/3 of, $BABA represents one of the few large cap stocks you can trade  in the US that isn't presently sitting near an all-time high (20% off,  in fact), as people - including myself - avoided the company while  waiting to see what China was going to do with them.  Then others have  been apprehensive to jump back into because, apparently, it's more fun  to lose all your money betting on a shitty Chamath scam that rips off  Medicare or a LIDAR company down 97% from its ATH and who makes less  gross revenue in a quarter than I paid for my last car (tragically, I'm  not even joking).

As  a result of this depressed price action, $BABA represents something of a  unique animal on Wall Street:  An ultra cap growth stock that is also  technically a value stock.  Just don't tell them they're a unique animal  or else the citizenry will storm their headquarters looking to kill  everyone and eat them because they think it'll bring them luck or make  their dicks bigger.  I usually stay away from this statistic, but for  once it's actually worthwhile to mention:  They only trade at 26 times  forward earnings.  In case you were wondering, $AMZN is more than 3  times that.

&#x200B;

# So what's their problem?

&#x200B;

 

I've already said:  It's China as a  whole.  All Chinese companies trade at a discount in America for a  number of reasons.  The primary reason is because you can never tell if a  company is actually being honest about its books, its revenues, or if  it's even a company.  For example, longtime followers will know that I  have maintained for quite some time that I'm not positive that the  company ""Same Ole Shit"" is even a real company.  Why?  Because there's  no oversight.  Also, there's no shorting over there, so everybody gets  away with making shit up.  One of the largest companies on their  exchange was found to be 2 guys in a van that parked behind a  hand-pulled noodle shop and who's sum assets were 2 laptops and some web  development software.  This is why, in general, I don't fuck with any  Chinese stocks and only make exceptions for $BABA, $BIDU, and $NIO (and  I'd do $YUMC if not for the fact I ignore that whole sector).   But  mostly, it's because if the regulators across the pond took aim at $BABA  once, there's always a chance they could do it again if Jack Ma forgets  his place.  The 2.8 billion dollar fine they got handed down sounds  really heavy, but it was really a best case scenario for this company.   Had that fine been handed down during any other time than now when the  market is in hard mode, $BABA likely would already be sitting in the  280's right now.

# So how does the Tendieman come?

Expected  47% YOY growth, with strong forward guidance going in to 2022.  Also,  now that President Harris is making nice nice simping for China again,  as soon as we re-open, expect them to start the process of moving in to  the US market, which will both simultaneously decimate Amazon's 3rd  party network while bolstering $BABA's own.  Oh, and they're encroaching  upon Lazada's turf throughout the rest of SE Asia, as well.

But  there's a catch:  Because Jack had to go to a re-education camp for a  few months and the company was forced to lay low waiting for Poohbear to  finish throwing his temper tantrum, there's still a bit of a fog into  the company right now that is not likely to be cleared up until they  report their next earnings late May.   Don't worry, I have it on good  authority that $BABA's network of merchants has been able to secure a  reliable supply of child labor to continue making all the goods they  sell.

&#x200B;

#  Some basic TravelCenters of America just because (even though it's not terribly important for the thesis)

So  this one is going to look a little different than what I usually put  up, cause I figure some of you are ready for some more advanced  concepts.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pz1r53hj9bw61.jpg?width=1388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=631e23902505c2d7cf90f7e03e806067307c08f1

As  always, nude line is a 200 day SMA, dark blue is a 50 day SMA, and cyan  is a 20 day EMA.  Red lines represent the wedge that's important for  all of you for the purposes of understanding that it's approaching a  breakout point that is almost 100% to the upside, green represents some  channels that we'll talk about some other time, and the lavender is a  bastard fib fan of strike points based on the action (typically you use  those in a slightly different manner, but that's for another day and  another time.  I'm going to start gradually adding Travelcenters of  America markers in an effort to grow your little minds a bit.  So  consider this a level up.

&#x200B;

TL:DR:  Look in the red wedge.  We're  coming up to a head in that pattern, and it will be right around the  time they report earnings.  Look at all the other pretty colors and see  if a wrinkle doesn't develop.

One other thing we can look at is price to fair value.  This is a Morningstar chart, I didn't make it myself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/igrlkysl9bw61.jpg?width=918&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3350b76b9dbc752c0f24d6e410df5f14291dab98

&#x200B;

So there are a couple of things I  want to call out here.  One is, obviously, the fact that this stock is  wildly undervalued according to every reasonable metric.  The other one  is a term that I want you guys to start learning called ***""Economic Moat""***.   The smoothbrain definition of that is basically a company's ability to  lie, cheat, sabotage, or buy out any competition in order to ensure  that they maintain a competitive advantage, no matter what.  Wide moats  are good but rather rare.  Obviously, if you read the ""who are these  people"" section, you know that $BABA has perhaps the widest moat of any  company on earth, because not only are they alone, but the barrier of  entry to challenge them is enormous.  Just ask their main competition,  $JD, who takes 1 step forward and 8 steps back every time they try.

# So, to summarize:

* Absolute  monster of a company 20% off its highs because of a combination of  government interference, continued concern over regulatory fuckery, and  the fact that nobody trusts the books of a Chinese company
* Over 90% of their market is penetrated, and they have aggressive expansion plans abroad
* Presently at a value level ***today*** as a result of them still being fairly fresh out of their hand slap for the shit they pulled
* I expect some DJI drones sent to my PO box after you make tendies on this
* Reports  late May; is very much a 2nd half of the year play - don't expect a ton  of movement in May up until earnings.  But volatility is already low.

# Price Targets:

For  once, I actually agree with pretty much every analyst out there.  This  company should be in the 320-330 range, and I think as we enter the 2nd  half of the year, you'll see a strong climb toward that.

&#x200B;

#  How do you play it?

**LEAPS ONLY!**  If you look at the daily chart, it had a bit of a pop after they got  fined, but has been largely flat money lately as nobody has wanted to  exit out of their positions due to it being undervalued, but not a lot  of demand to get IN to the position due to the overall market conditions  as a whole.  July at the earliest, August if you have the powder to pay  the extra premium.  If you look back up at my chart, I've gone with a  peanut butter spread strategy with this one, buying calls at $260, $270,  $280, and $310 (now do those lines make sense?) one month apart from  one another starting in August and running through November, along with  some existing June 18 240's just because I felt like it.

Remember,  it's perfectly fine to let this one sit a bit before entering into a  position, but your cost basis will be roughly the same, regardless.  At  the time of this writing, it's sitting at 235.  If you look at the chart  above, there's a real good chance you can creep in some positions after  it hits 230, because at some point I think it will come in to that  number.  However, if it drives to 230 hard, I want you to let it  consolidate and see if you can't get it even lower - maybe even 224 if  you can catch it on a really bloody red day.  But don't fuck around too  much, this isn't a lot of slippage given the equity price.

One  thing people have been asking me periodically is how I would rank the  companies I've talked about thus far on the premise that they don't have  enough powder to be in all the plays and were looking to see if I would  abandon one play for another.  I don't want to encourage that overall  (I don't want to encourage messaging me at all, really), but this once  I'll say that I would definitely not give up my $CLNE or $BE trades for  this one yet, as I don't expect this one to move for a while and those  green plays represent significantly more upside.  I wouldn't give up the  $NVTA trade if I was way underwater on it.  If I wasn't, I might  consider it.  I'd definitely give up cruise ships and plane engines.   Semis in June would be a personal choice.  I'd bail on the Devil's Gold  companies I talk about, I'd bail  on $BB, and the other trades are kind  of dead, anyways.

&#x200B;

#  Position Disclaimers:

Some  of you may have seen me talking about how I'm rebalancing my portfolio  for May and exiting out of all but 15 of my long positions in  preparation to enter into 35 short positions due to market conditions  and timing.  $BABA is one of the 15 stocks I do plan on holding my longs  on.  Liquidity in August has been difficult for me to get, so I'm only  sitting on 200 of those, the September 270 is really where I think the  sweet spot is and I've presently got 1900 of them and will be looking to  expand that, I have 2500 October 280's and the November 310 is a long  term FD that I'm sitting on 700 of.  I also have a significant amount of  shares in the company, but I've had them since their IPO and they are  sitting in managed assets, so not relevant to this trade.

There you have it, kids.  Go forth, and tendie-ize.

All my love

\-Chad Dickens

I was looking at VERBUND AG these past few days and think that there is a potential play here as sector and currency risk diversification.

In a nutshell they are Austria's largest hydro producer and also engage in electricity trading. They have also partnered with Google and are trying out AI systems for machinery maintenance and better electricity trading.

The firm is profitable with a high margin (EBIT margin 28%), very stable with a bottom up beta of 0.43, has long term prospects, and is flexible as they can expand the grid vs production in the event of the appearance of external cheap energy sources.

The company is also reinvesting in capital projects which will fuel growth in the future. These projects are backed by research for quality control, digitization, artificial intelligence systems, trading and supply.

Future investment plans include new renewable energy generation which will amount to a profitable development of approx. **20–25%** of Verbund’s total electricity generated from onshore **wind power plants and solar power.** 

They are also engaging R&D projects for **green hydrogen produced from renewable energy sources**.

The company seems to be trading around its intrinsic value based on my DCF valuation.

* HBO estimated 67-70 Million subscribers worldwide by the EOY while considering that they go international this June. If they got another 8 million domestically this April they would be at 70 Million today before the international push. They might not have.

**HBO vs Netflix, Past 90 Days:**

HBO closer in the month of April regardless of upticks than any previous month.

* HBO has previously beaten estimates by alot and it did not really affect share price. However it now will make a bigger difference in terms of ARPU then it did in the past.
* Graph/Link (below) by an author who a couple days earlier was negative towards HBO. Stating that it was not sticking. He rechecked his numbers.
* Warner Bro's/HBO is not the main part of AT&T's business. They are a big company with a lot of debt. This is just a look at the movies/streaming services this quarter.

**Kong might make $1 Billion in profit this quarter alone, not counting HBO subscriber gain.**

Another point for movies this year is  online rentals for Godzilla vs Kong might have been close to box office  revenues due to covid-19. Only the U.S. gets it for free on HBO. International rollout for HBO set for this June.

In other countries you could rent Kong for 48 hours for $20-25.  More theaters were closed outside the U.S leading to higher likelihood of renting the movie.  It was $25 to see the Box Office hit of the spring. Not bad for you or your kids to see the epic monster mash.  Probably hadn't been to theaters or rented/paid for a movie in a while.

&#x200B;

* Only U.S. gets it for free on HBO + Theaters were more likely closed in other countries.
* Worldwide ticket sales are roughly $70 million U.S.  and $500 Million International.
* Kong made $500 million in ticket sales and may have made close to another $500 million renting online.
* That's only 25 million people @ $25.00.
* If 10 million people worldwide rented it that is $200 million + no splitting ticket sales with theaters + HBO subscribers.

&#x200B;

* Godzilla  movies generally net like $100 million in ticket sales in Japan alone and is generally one of the highest grossing films of the year for them. Mugen Train just made over $350 Million in ticket sales in Japan alone.
* Kong has yet to be released in Japan and has the potential for alot more money. It is being released late there on May 14th.
* Been delayed again since due to covid-19, maybe they'll just make everyone rent it... or try a Japan HBO rollout.
* Potentially 1/2 - 1 billion dollars of profit from one movie is nothing to sneeze at for a single quarter (150 Million budget).
* No real idea of how many people rented it.

I  do however know people who rented Mortal Kombat and bought the game as well this  quarter (another AT&T). Don't know anyone who rented Kong but I have not asked so...

Warner Bro's/HBO is not the main part of AT&T's business. They are a big company with a lot of debt. This is just a look at the movies/streaming services this quarter.

Hey guys,

I thought I’d post about my thoughts on MNMD. First of all, please do your own due diligence and do not fall victim to the pump, hype and euphoria. These are highly speculative investments and have significant risk associated. All that said, there have been many requests for fundamental analysis and MNMD projections so I wanted to provide my thoughts.

\*All figures in USD (market cap, sales) except for my investment holdings. I purchased MMED.NE shares. Source data available as well, but got messy with all the 10-k filings and links in the table.

# Entry Point

First and foremost, I want to address the most commonly raised question on this thread: “Is it too late to buy MNMD?” Any investment is subject to the risk / reward paradigm. Those that got in at $0.3 deserve every penny they earned as MNMD was by definition a penny stock and one of the most risky investments you could own. Since then, it has grown tremendously due to scientific milestones which have pointed to significant progress in the industry.

The milestones MNMD has achieved have DERISKED MNMD from a penny stock to a small cap biotech company with a very large drug portfolio and numerous future catalysts. I do not expect to make 10x my investment in a week, nor should you. Is there still tremendous upside even at the current valuation of \~$1.5bn? I strongly believe so and will let my position reinforce that.

I entered this space with an average cost of \~$4.9 CAD, holding 311,206 shares, and a book value of \~1.5MM. Yes you read that correctly. Do I panic every day and check the ticker? No. Does my heart beat thinking of the time I evaporated \~$500,000 in unrealized loss when the stock was at $3.4? No. In fact, I continue to pick up shares at what I believe is a discounted valuation. There will be many that look at $4.9 entry point and think that even I got in at the bottom. It’s all relative.

[OPs original YOLO \(Not a YOLO\)](https://preview.redd.it/m5g55vw3dxv61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=463e90c35b488f6a370a63769daece2d5a07f5d8)

I only invested what I could afford to lose and although $1.5MM is a large sum of money, it is not my entire portfolio, nor would it impact my daily life. If I lost it all it would not impact my ability to service my mortgage, pay my bills, impact my other investments, nor prohibit me from doing the things I love. I continue to hold dry powder and monitor my investment on a monthly basis, while continuing to buy following successful milestones.

This is a very long term play that could fundamentally change the way we treat the body’s most important organ. We are just getting started. I have a very strong conviction on the future outcome of this industry and that is the reason I couldn’t be bothered about short term fluctuations. An important question to ask yourself is whether you believe MNMD can reach its next scientific milestone. Take things one step at a time and is there a probability the next scientific update will be positive? Emphasis on science, ignoring NASDAQ, candlesticks, and capital structure (for now).

# Institutional Capital

I work in finance (albeit project finance / private equity, and don’t value stocks for a living, so don’t consider me an expert here) but already know of a few moderately capitalized asset managers that are now participating in MNMD. The recent bought deals are evidence of sophisticated capital flowing into this industry. I personally qualify as an ‘accredited investor’ and am having conversations constantly with folks in my circles who are investing heavily into these stocks. As more institutional capital flows in, the more stable these stocks become. Of course, this is all relative.

# Access to liquidity

As with all brand new industries, the capital requirement is immense in order to bring products to market. What drew me into the space was the fact that MNMD did raise capital. Biotech stocks do not have cashflow, thus their only path to fund operations is through equity raises. The fact that MNMD was able to raise over $237MM CAD since May 2019 is a positive for this company. Yes it is dilutive, and good job for paying attention in finance 101 class, but bootstrapping a biotech company is not possible, nor is servicing debt.

The path to commercialization of will be full of obstacles, however a strong balance sheet with sufficient capital gives MNMD the resources to get there. The current valuation has tremendous upside following scientific milestones and future equity raises and dilutions are a good thing, as it will be at an increased valuation.

There are definitely smaller cap companies out there that may double overnight, however for the risk / reward, I do not feel comfortable owning companies that don’t have a large balance sheet, nor a diversified drug portfolio.

# Believe in the Science

I do not feel I am in a position to write original content on the efficacy of these drugs. I have done my research and read a fair number of published studies but anything that I write would simply be regurgitating what others have said.

The biggest investors in this space are those with personal experiences with psychedelics because you have first-hand experience of the profound meaning extracted from one treatment. The ability to dissolve your ego enables you to deal with the root cause of so many problems ranging from depression, PTSD and addition, without approaching the problem by numbing symptoms. Herein lies the inherent value of this industry and will simply take time to prove it through trails. I have the conviction to continue to invest because I believe in the science. The data to reinforce this is on its way, and I personally want to invest now, knowing that the likelihood of very significant catalysts are probable.

# Forecasts

This of course is the elephant in the room for early investors, later\[er\] investors and bears alike. Is a $1.5bn market cap pricing in all of the upside already? Is this a $100bn stock? This company has zero revenues, shouldn’t it be worth zero?

The truth is, no one knows. There is tremendous risk with this company. However, I will not be selling unless we see some significant negative scientific outcomes. Again, less emphasis on stock price, NASDAQ, more emphasis on the science. Everything else will follow.

The various ways to value a company (DCF, sales / earnings multiples, liquidation value etc) all have their issues with an early stage company of this nature. Any sort of bottoms up DCF analysis is just guessing because variables such as patient count, dosage, pricing, market share, market penetration, amongst other have far too much variation to come up with a reliable figure. Discount rates and time horizon can favour your outcome depending on how aggressive / conservative you are.

Thus, the way I like to look at this market is a best case scenario for a single drug, based off historical sales data from one company and one drug. This implicitly takes into account patient dosage, competition, market share, market penetration etc, because one drug from one company has already proven its ability to capture such sales data.

[Letters and Numbers](https://preview.redd.it/37z2u5a9dxv61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a0b8a6b8643b49666b9eef994eb70c4984f64dd)

I have broken out annual sales data for various comparable drugs according to MNMD’s current pipeline offering. This is the inherent benefit of MNMD, is that it has a diverse portfolio covering many underserved issues. Like many of you, I believe MNMD’s biggest blockbuster will be Layla, given the problem of Opioid addition plus MNMD’s IP rights on 18-MC to corner sales. Suboxone is the current drug on the market due to delayed onset effects ranging from 24-36 hours, compared to someone in withdrawal uses fast acting opioids 3-4 times a day. Suboxone itself however is still addictive and has a long list of negative side effects. Furthermore, it does not correct dopamine dysregulation in patients.

The sales of Suboxone alone are growing at an \~9% CAGR, with sales expected to reach \~$4bn in 2028.

The use case for 18-MC however, does not stop at Opioid addiction, and can be applied to alcohol dependency and smoking dependency among others. This means the TAM for 18-MC could be significantly larger than the existing market captured by Suboxone given its smaller demographics relative to 18-MC. Could Layla exhibit sales greater than Suboxone one day? Who knows. Sticking with comp sales for the analysis for now.

Various anxiety, depression and ADHD medication is also shown in the table to show sales potential of Lucy, Albert and the micro dose programmes.

Is there a possibility of a LSD, 18-MC, or LSD compound or derivative achieving blockbuster drug status? Do you think there is an inherent benefit to a psychedelic compared to an antidepressant sedative with side effects such as nausea, weight gain etc?

Your perceived probability and sales outcomes depends on whether you believe in the science. Those that don’t can easily be skeptical of a $1.5bn market cap many years away from profitability.

Those that do, look at the next half a dozen clinical trial outcomes as very probable and thus have applied a less punitive discount to the stock valuation. I have rationalized my decision to invest at $1.5MM because of my own perceived discount rate and confidence in the next 12 months of positive catalysts.

# Valuation Multiples

Now, as many of you know, investors pay a multiple for the future earnings of a company, today. If a drug makes $1bn annually, investors will pay a multiple of future earnings expected over the drugs lifetime, discounted by various factors.

There are various metrics to use here, ranging from Enterprise Value / Sales or various types of earnings metrics. MNMD is years away from having a real operating company, anything to sell, or even the corporate infrastructure to get it to market. However, the question has always been, how big do you think this company could get?

This is where things can get tricky. We used peak annual sales in the last section to forecast comparable estimates for MNMD revenues. Thus, I believe it is appropriate to use mature, large cap trading multiples instead of early stage bio techs, as our revenue estimates were mature figures with stabilized growth. If we were to use companies / drugs earlier in their lifecycle or clinical phases, the trading multiples would be much higher because the market is buying potential future sales. Can’t have it both ways.

[An ugly rainbow](https://preview.redd.it/farn3m3gdxv61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0abe00f3b8456574265f74a0c54fab49a5fe60e1)

All of the chart data in the graph is specific to the pharma industry. However, there are various subsectors to the industry such as Contract Development Manufacturing and Contract Research Organization. MNMD would likely have to partner with each of these types of firms to scale its business, better assess market size etc, but wouldn’t trade at similar multiples given a different business model. Same goes for Packaging and Distribution.

The graph also shows S&P average which is a good rule of thumb.

&#x200B;

[More letters and numbers](https://preview.redd.it/1iybej4kdxv61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=88ee491b4a27ba8467d27b863f001fc9ba5ecceb)

Although the chart gives a good reference point for pharma multiples, I wanted to look at valuation from a more company specific perspective. The chart above shows large cap specialty pharma companies that are publicly traded. This will give you an approximate median value of what the market is willing to pay for a company that has a certain amount of sales. As you can see in the green box, industry multiples of EV/EBIITDA or EV/Sales will basically get you to the same place. Median pharma industry EBITDA margins are in the 40% range with EV/Sales at \~4x vs EV/EBITDA of 10x.

Note that the above list of trading comps is stale data, as of Sept ’19. I only want to use public data and have refrained from using Bloomberg, Cap IQ etc. Thus the information I’m posting is merely reposts of info available on Google. As you can see, Allergan is listed in this table as a live trading comp, and has since been acquired by AbbVie. Accordingly, I want to highlight some notable M+A activity:

Amgen acquires Celgne’s plaque psoriasis drug, Otezla $13.4bn: EV / LTM Sales = 7.6x Thermo Fisher acquires Qiagen for $11.5bn: EV / LTM Sales = 7.3x Abbvie acquires Allergan for $84.2bn: EV / LTM Sales = 5.4x Elanco acquires Bayer’s animal health unit for $7.6bn: EV / LTM Sales = 4.5x As you can see, companies are willing to pay a premium in M&A to acquire competitors and drugs, due to synergies, reduction in SG&A etc.

This is a very long winded way of showing that if one of MNMD’s compounds hits, and exhibits sales in line with any sort of comparable drug from the table above, this could be a $20-30 billion dollar company (\~4bn\*5-7x). If several of these drugs reach commercialization, this is potentially a $100 billion dollar company.

Now I agree that these projections are completely outlandish right now. I’m simply doing the exercise you all wanted.

Feel free to guess at your own forecast sales and multiply out enterprise value using the above metrics. Before you rip me apart for the extreme optimism, I understand that I’m using multiples for stable, reputable, large cap pharma. I understand that there is an extreme amount of stigma attached to psychedelics and achieving ubiquity for these treatments is a large uphill battle. There is an enormous amount of work, luck and time from now until sales and this is not to be under estimated.

**Do I think MNMD is worth $30-$100bn today? No.**

**Do I think MNMD is worth somewhere in between today’s valuation and $30-$100bn?**

Depends **whether you believe in the science.** If you’re reading this, odds are you do. I invested because I believe it too.

So instead, let’s take a lazy man’s approach to valuation and take things one step at a time.

# Simpler Approach to Valuation

The exercise above is to show you all the immense potential of MMED’Fs drug portfolio. Do I think MNMD is the next Pfizer, Abbie Vie or Eli Lilly? No. This is not a $500bn dollar company. However, I do genuinely think there is tremendous upside not factored into the pricing for this stock.

Fundamental analysis aside, I think the simplest way to approach valuation is from a catalyst + efficient market hypothesis perspective. Markets are not fully efficient, nor even semi-efficient, but there is some sort of reasoning in believing what the market is willing to pay. The obvious flaws in this are that the market right is riddled with irrational investors and a market of 300m financially illiterate traders isn’t more efficient than an illiquid market of 10 rational ones. As of today’s post there is a discount to the $4.40 price. To me, that’s just more opportunity to continue to scoop up more shares.

I have stayed out of the industry in the early days because truthfully I did not know which stocks to pick. Since then, much smarter people than me have done their diligence and allocated their capital to the companies that they believe are winners. This is part of an efficient market hypothesis.

Sophisticated capital flowed into MNMD @ 4.40 / share, with the expectation to make a profit. I also, invested in this company at $4.9/share, with the expectation to make a profit. If we establish this as a baseline, do we believe there will be more positive than negative catalysts in the next year and in the future, such that we will see accretion in the share price? Conversely, if we see negative outcomes in future catalysts, it will cause erosion in the stock valuation. Below are near term events which should have a significant impact on share price:

· Phase 2 readout– Q1 2021 Open IND w/ FDA for Phase 2b – Q3 2021 Project Layla

· Phase 2a study– Second half of 2021 Strategic Pharma Partner Potential – Late 2021 Various

· Combined MDMA LSD Phase 1 trail – Q1 2021 IV DMT Phase 1 trail – Q1 2021 First ever Phase 2a clinical trial Microdose LSD – Q3 2021 Patent filed for neutralizer technology for LSD to shorter/stop hallucinogenic effects Game changer for safe, regulated environment for clinical administration Given that Phase 1 studies are focused on safety, what are the odds clinically developed LSD / MDMA fails a safety test?

Given that Phase 2 studies are focused on proof of concept and method, what are the odds the clinically designed process fails the test?

# Believe in the science.

Each one of these incremental catalysts derisks MNMD, and will bring the valuation closer to ‘blockbuster drug’ status, albeit inches at a time. Just as the bought deal derisked this company for me to participate, achievements in clinical trials will be evidence for more investors to jump in as well. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves and guess at how large this company can get. Just think of what is the next step and do your own evaluation as to whether achieving it is realistic. Once we get through the above list, there will be more milestones to pass such as Phase 2bs and 3s. If we establish $4.40 as the baseline currently and MNMD has a successful outcome in any of the previously listed catalysts, there should be a significant accretion in valuation.

There is a noticeable omission for most of you, in that I’ve left out the NASDAQ up listing, future dilutions and general capital structuring events. To me, a NASDAQ uplisting is irrelevant. This will add liquidity, although probably more volatility, but changes zero fundamentals about the stock. It should however, add more weight to the efficient market hypothesis and erase the discount I believe this stock is trading at. We’ll see some analyst coverage with price targets that will attract more investors, but the fundamentals of the stock do not change.

With respect to stock price, it is impossible to forecast this because the capital structure of this company is completely unknown. IF we can even get to revenue generation, and this becomes a $30-100bn company, how much dilution will there be from now until then to back out a share price? The point is that there is so much runway in share price accretion from now until then, that I’m not bothered with anything finance related for this company. **There is potential for 50-70x accretion in the value of this company.** The focus needs to be on the science. MNMD has raised enough money to get though its next set of obstacles and fund operations, thus insolvency risk has fallen away for now which is really the only important financial point for early stage biotech.

Let’s take things one step at a time, believe in the science and be patient.

# Cash position & Expenditures

As you can see below, the quarterly burn payroll burn rate is quite low for MNMD relative to its cash position. It’s hard to discern which items under their historical expenditures are one off versus recurring, thus difficult to calculate their exact run rate. However, the huge positive here the low ratio of payroll relative to its cash.

[Tendies at Wendy's: Already in our bellies](https://preview.redd.it/ici10ntodxv61.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fde7f60fd7e2f8bdef405f6e5b022acf9e322a1)

Next up we have the projected use of proceeds from their latest raise, net of underwriter expenses. Now that the Over-Allotment has been exercised, MNMD has additional capital that it has further allocated to Albert, Lucy, Layla and the Microdose LSD program.

[Tendies at Wendy's: Soon to be in our bellies](https://preview.redd.it/8gozyududxv61.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&s=2dd203b18101c760f03790f8a700171a80995299)

General takeaway is that MNMD is well enough capitalized to get through its next phase of milestones. I will be keeping an eye on news surrounding the Microdose LSD program. Estimates at this stage for Phase 2a are $3-4m and the results of which will inform capital expenditures required for future phases. A positive milestone in Q3 ’21 should be an incredibly positive catalyst for this company.

Proving that you’ve raised capital and have enough cashflow to get to the next step doesn’t guarantee we’ve picked the winner in the industry. It does however give me confidence that MNMD will continue to be a going concern for at least the short term and get to a point when new investors can come in at a much higher valuation. This is a real risk for the penny stocks out there without capital or IP, and that is the reason I chose MNMD.

Edit: Did some re-formatting to make it easier to read cause it's pretty lengthy and there's a lot of details. Hopefully it helps.

Edit #2: I went back into the trash compacter and salvaged the original data and charts since some people were asking. The resolution may be questionable, so apologies for that, you might have to zoom in.

In addition, I also analyzed the website’s traffic and the popularity of the company's website search request in Google to see if followers on social networks are converting into leads and to take a more comprehensive look at this situation.

I don’t have statistical confirmation of the connection between the number of followers of the brand in social networks and a positive effect on the stock price, but according to the simple logic - this definitely can affect it. If people are interested in a product and what the company does, they will follow it in the media and become its customers. Sooner or later, this will be reflected in the company's profits and quarterly reports, so do not underrate this data.

You can find the resulting list below, hope you’ll find this information useful:  


**1. XPENG INC. ($XPEV)** \- Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer. The most dynamic growth of followers in Twitter and Facebook.

By the way, they are quite active in hiring new people - 700 open job positions with 24K employees - an indicator of the company's healthy growth.

FuboTV is a live TV streaming company focused primarily on sports which offers subscribers access to thousands of live sporting events, news, and entertainment content. The FuboTV platform allows users to have access to their content through streaming devices such as SmartTV's, mobile phones, computers, and tablets. This company gives the option to purchase additional features/packages that include more DVR cloud storage, number of simultaneous streams, international sports, adventure channels, etc. The base package provides a mixture of channels which includes the top 50 Nielson-ranked networks that span across sports, news, and entertainment. In the summer of 2020, they enhanced their sports offerings with the addition of ESPN and ABC as well as programming from Disney. In addition, FuboTV supports 4K streaming, although much of its content is streamed at 720p and 60 frames-per-second video quality. Since live TV requires a sophisticated technology infrastructure, Fubo utilizes industry standard digital Rights Management Technology and geographical rights requirements which enables them to meet blackouts if they were to occur. With all that content, FuboTV is one of the most expensive live tv packages that you can buy. Their competitors include the likes of YouTube TV ($64.99), Sling TV ($35.00), Hulu Live TV ($65), and more. Fubo's growth strategy is focused on acquiring new subscribers who are attracted to the sports and entertainment offerings that they provide. They monetize their subscriber base through subscription fees and digital advertising and in 2020 the majority of their revenue came from monthly subscriptions. Furthermore, in January of 2021 Fubo announced that they plan on acquiring sports betting and interactive gaming company Vigtory (see recent acquisition section) and they expect to launch a sportsbook before the end of the year.

# Total Addressable Market (TAM)

Live TV streaming is changing the way people watch their favorite sports, shows, and other entertainment content. As a result, more people are deciding to stop paying for traditional TV. Due to this disruption, billions of dollars in subscription and advertising revenue has shifted to streaming platforms. The global video streaming market size was valued at $50.11 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of roughly 21% from 2021 to 2028. In addition to the streaming market which Fubo currently operates in, their commitment to providing sports betting has expanded their total addressable market. The global sports betting industry reached a market size of $203 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow by $144.4 billion from 2020-2024 (11% CAGR). What hinders the growth of this industry is the fact that sports betting is still illegal in many parts of the world. Sports betting is currently legal in a number of states in the US and in countries such as the UK, Denmark, Italy, China, and a few others. While sports betting is legal in a number of countries, often times people have limited access. For example, in Costa Rica you can only bet online and in India only a few states allow sports betting.

If we add together the total addressable markets for live TV streaming and sports betting in the year of 2020 we get $253.11 billion. Compare that number to Fubo's revenue of $268.8 million in 2020 and we see that Fubo has a huge opportunity ahead of itself. As Fubo scales their new sports betting business and more countries and states make sports betting legal, we should see Fubo ramping up revenue growth significantly. Of course their is a risk to all this as it is very costly to scale both businesses that Fubo operates. Thus, their financial results will give us an idea of how they've been growing and if they can maintain the level of growth they've seen in the past.

Note - main points are bolded

# Important Points to Address

* Revenue was up 83% YoY as advertising revenue grew to $29 million (up 133% YoY) and subscription revenue increased 73% to $230.7 million. As we can see from the numbers, this company is growing at a fast clip. Although the revenue growth they reported is impressive, when looking at their balance sheet they still reported an operating loss of roughly $480 million which was a drastic increase from the prior year which came in at $39 million. Additionally, as this business has scaled they saw their operating expenses jump from $43 million in 2019 to $698 million in 2020 and their goodwill reach $478 million. What these numbers show me is that while this company is growing fast, much of that growth isn't necessarily organic. They spent $63 million on advertising in 2020, while only spending $491,000 in 2019. Also, their general and administrative expenses jumped from $13 million in 2019 to $78 million in 2020. While some investors may argue that this business is taking on significant costs short-term so they can succeed in the long-term, I'm worried that heavy competition will slow down their growth. One final thing to note about their expenses is that currently they're losing money on the subscription plans that they offer as their subscriptions revenue was $184 million for 2020, while their subscriber related expenses totaled $204 million. Fubo is up against some strong competitors such as Google with their YouTube TV platform, Sling, Roku, and other streaming services. In the future, we'll see how those expenses change in relation to their revenue as they scale their new sports gambling business.
* Fubo reported reaching 547,880 subscribers in 2020 which was a result of them growing their subscriber base by 261,754 subscribers. As they scaled their subscriber base, average revenue per paying user increased by 17% YoY to $62.84 and total content hours streamed grew 82% YoY to 544.9 million hours. These numbers are impressive as well, but I question how much of that growth was a result of the Covid lockdowns. 2021 is the important year we're going to have to pay attention to in order to get an idea of how this company operates in more 'normal' times.
* The final things I want to mention about Fubo's finances has to do with their current ratio and goodwill. Fubo reported current asset and liabilities of $156 and $227 million respectively, which puts their current ratio at 0.6. For any company to have a current ratio of 0.6 is worrisome in my eyes. Additionally, if you go a bit down their balance sheet you will notice that their goodwill is $478 million. Goodwill arises when one company purchases another. Goodwill is an intangible asset that is calculated by subtracting the fair market value of one company's liabilities from the amount the acquiring company pays for it. The amount of goodwill we're seeing with Fubo is quite high considering their total assets would drop by 50% if they didn't measure it.

# Recent Developments/Acquisitions

* In January of 2021, Fubo announced that they will be acquiring the sports betting and iGaming company Vigtory. The CEO David Gandler stated that, ""We don't see wagering as simply an add-on product to fuboTV. Instead, we believe there is a real flywheel opportunity with streaming video content and interactivity."" I agree with this move made by the CEO as betting is a great compliment to their sports-first TV streaming platform. Fubo's sportsbook is expected to be released sometime mid 2021 and they could see adoption in three states by the end of the year. It'll be interesting to see how this all plays out considering the heavy competition in the sports betting market. Some of the biggest names in the sports betting market include DraftKings Inc (DKNG), Penn National Gaming (PENN), Bragg Gaming Group (BRGGF), and more.
* In April of 2021, Fubo announced they were acquiring the exclusive live streaming rights to the South American Qatar World Cup 2022 Qualifying Matches. CEO David Gandler said, ""By offering the best of South American soccer in advance of Qatar 2022, we are further differentiating FuboTV’s sports-first content portfolio enabling us to engage with more consumers than ever before.” Once again, I agree with the CEO and this move highlighted his dedication to making Fubo a sports streaming giant. This deal will help Fubo's brand name as this company will be advertising to millions of viewers. David is coming into the sports streaming market aggressively and investors will be awaiting to see how this acquisition will play out financially.
* In December of 2020, Fubo announced that they acquired Balto Sports. This deal marked Fubo's first move into the online wagering market. At the time the CEO was quoted saying, ""We believe there are significant synergies between consumers who enjoy wagering and our subscribers who enjoy streaming live sports, creating a flywheel opportunity. As we’ve previously expressed, one of our goals with wagering is to expand our total available market (TAM) by developing another important revenue stream for fuboTV, as we are doing with our growing ad sales business."" While I don't doubt the strong connection between sports wagering and Fubo's subscribers that enjoy streaming live sports, I question if the ad revenue investors are expecting will come to fruition.
* In April of 2020, Fubo announced the closing of their merger with the sports focused virtual entertainment company FaceBank Group. The CEO of Fubo had said, ""With today’s closing, fuboTV is well-positioned to redefine the virtual MVPD space. Technology-driven cable TV replacement services are more important than ever, especially at this time when people are staying safe at home watching television for needed information, entertainment and escape.” FaceBank is quite an interesting company and developed some unique projects such as the virtual Michael Jackson show at the 2014 Billboard Music Awards. This deal not only marked an interesting point in the development of Fubo, but gave the company access to $100 million in funding in the form of a revolving line of credit. I wonder as to how Fubo will leverage the virtual reality and live-entertainment technology that they now control.

# Management

CEO - **David Gandler**

David was appointed as the CEO and director of Fubo in April 2020. He has been part of the team since 2015 when Fubo was simply a streaming soccer service. Prior to his role at Fubo, Gandler worked in the advertising industry for over 15 years at companies such as Scripps Networks Interactive, Time Warner Cable Media Sales, and NBCUniversal's Telemundo Media. David has won a number of awards which includes *Goldman Sachs' 100 Most Intriguing Entrepreneurs* (2019), *Variety's Dealmakers* (2020,2019), and *Broadcasting & Cable's Power 100* (2017). David's vision for what Fubo could become is interesting and the first of its kind. Looking forward I hope to see Gandler scale this company and integrate their acquisitions successfully. Undoubtedly, David has a grand vision for what could become one of the largest sports betting and streaming companies.

Co-Founder/CMO - **Alberto Horihuela**

Alberto is the co-founder and chief marketing officer at FuboTV and is in charge of their branding, user engagement and retention, and overall marketing vision. Prior to his co-founding of FuboTV, Alberto was head of Latin America at DramaFever (a video streaming provider). Alberto has an entrepreneurial spirit as he also co-founded Primerad Network, a digital video advertising company that connected brand marketers to Latin American audiences. In addition to his experience in marketing and entrepreneurship, Horihuela worked as an economist and analyst at Morgan Stanley and DeMatteo Monness. Both Gandler and Horihuela have extensive experience in marketing, entrepreneurship, and media to which should serve this company well going forward.

Management not mentioned: Simone Nardi (CFO), Mike Berkley (CPO), and Gina Sheldon (general counsel).

# What could go wrong

**Fubo can't keep up with the competition** \- As previously stated, Fubo is up against some heavy competition. AT&T TV provides more channels at the highest subscription level, but Fubo still offers more sports. Also , FuboTV's DVR only lets you record 250 hours of content while AT&T TV lets you record 500 hours of content. YouTube TV and Sling TV are two other competitors that are well equipped to steal market share from Fubo. The main differences I see between Fubo and the rest of the pact have to do with cost and product focus. Sling provides the cheapest plan which starts at $35 and is compatible with many of the existing streaming devices such as Apple TV, Xbox One, etc. In terms of the rest of the cohort, they all provide plans that are priced similarly. In terms of the products they offer, Sling, YouTube TV, and AT&T TV haven't differentiated themselves like Fubo. When it comes down to it, sports fans should gravitate to FuboTV as they provide the largest sports network. We'll have to see how this all plays out in the coming years to get to know which companies emerge as the leaders.

**Fubo fails to turn a profit** \- While this risk factor applies to any company that isn't profitable, it's important to highlight how early this company is to having a profitable business model. In their last earnings for the twelve months ended December 31st, Fubo posted $184 million of subscription revenue and $204 million in subscriber related expenses. Thus, this company is not making money on their services and I can't quite predict when or if this company will be profitable any time soon. That's not to say Fubo is a terrible service, but rather their financial standing isn't one that currently strikes me as sustainable.

# What we want to see in the future

**Contribution margin increasing** \- As noted in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 financial results, this company's contribution margin for 2020 was 10.1%. The contribution margin is the difference between subscriber revenue and what it costs Fubo to provide subscribers their service (ARPU - ACPU). While the contribution margin for this company sounds reasonable, the problem comes in when you factor expenses. Expenses such as sales and marketing, depreciation, technology and development, and a few others are hindering this company substantially from making a profit. Once you factor all the expenses of Fubo, they came in at an operating loss of $479 million. What we need to see from Fubo these next five years as they scale is them being able to at-least report a positive income from operations. Let's also remember that Fubo has a recurring revenue business model which means it is predictable and reliable.

**Fubo scales their sports gambling business** \- While this point is rather obvious, I wanted to note a few things about this side of Fubo's business so we can better understand it. Fubo has yet to roll out their sports betting business but they, ""expect to launch a sportsbook before the end of the year."" Certainly this is an exciting direction that this company is headed in. Although, we have no sort of guidance as to how this sports betting business will perform. CEO David Gandler was quoted saying, “We not only expect sports wagering to become a new line of business and source of revenue, but we also expect that it will increase user engagement on fuboTV resulting in higher ad monetization, better subscriber retention and reduced subscriber acquisition costs.” I like the way that David is thinking, but simply liking the idea doesn't make it a success. I can imagine investors will be eagerly watching how this venture performs in the first year of its integration. As for now, we don't really know what to expect.

# Analyst expectations

1. Predicted revenue range for 2021: $465.03 – 480.44 million (growth of roughly 110%)
2. Predicted earnings per share range for 2021 (EPS): $(2.5) – (0.82)

# TLDR

Fubo's vision to be a digital entertainment giant primarily focused on sports is innovative and unheard of. Their recent acquisitions of Vigtory and Balto Sports shows their commitment to making their goal a reality. While the CEO is thinking big, his ideas aren't translating well onto Fubo's financial statements. Their expenses have gone up at the same rate as their revenue has and that worries me. Additionally, this company isn't in the best cash position with $134 million. It's important to note that this company is still early in the process of what they're trying to accomplish and **I'll be keeping a close eye on how they perform this next yea**r. Their recurring revenue business model will surely serve them well in the future as it is predictable and reliable. You'll notice that the discounted cash flow is missing from this post and that is because forecasting this company's future growth is extremely difficult without some sort of idea as to what we can expect. As of right now, to put a price on this company is quite difficult.   


**In conclusion, I'll be watching Fubo's earnings this next year to get an idea of where this company is headed and if it's worth starting a position.**

AMD   sells chips to a variety of sectors but you can mainly categorize it  into to two categories: Computing&Graphics and Enterprise ( Embedded   and Semi-Custom). Basically if there is a need for calculations they   make the chips.  As you might have noticed there has been a supply  shortage lately causing semi conductors prices to sky rocket- if you  have been trying to buy one lately you will know. So AMD is a part of a  mega trend and there is a clip of the psycho CEO mama who has been on Sir shithouse aka Cramer telling him it is good for business ( cant post the video but you can google ""AMD CEO gives update on Xilinx acquisition and talks chip shortage impact"")

The CEO mama Su is nothing short of a genius. PhD in electro engineering from MIT she has been running the show since 2014 where AMD was a mess. I shall not go into the accounting details but basically she knows her   stuff and the development of the stock price reflects just that

From 4 dlls a share to now be around 80

Intel  came out yesterday with a great earnings report but more or less  explicitly saying they are losing market share despite the market is hit  by a supply shock. AMD will report on Tuesday and if you fancy a bet  you can buy calls for that or you can just like the stock, or if you feel adventurous buy LEAPS.

Whatever the case AMD looks to be a long term winner with the best products,   best management in a sector that will thrive going forward. I dont   really consider it a long term risk and i hold it and have done so for   quite sometime"

Track 3 - **Concrete Goonies** \- Invest in infrastructure.

Track 5 - **G.I. Joe** \- Long RTX, LTM, BA, DFEN, NOC. This is an obvious play you shouldn't need Yachty to elucidate for you.

Track 6 - **Never Did Coke** \- This is a short play on KO. Yachty thinks kids are more health conscious now, but his bearish sentiment on Coke long-term confuses me. I think they're well positioned for some CBD beverages and healthy drinks.

Track 8 - **Plastic** \- Long oil. This is a recovery play.

Track 12 - **SB5** \- If you google SB5 you get PROFUTURA. This is a bullish Latina futures play. GPROFUT

Track 13 - **Hybrid** \- He's saying short Tesla, as he prefers a hybrid to a full electric. Yachty is bullish on Detroit automakers. He seems to suggest he's made quite the bag off GM and FORD this year while fucking your little sister.

Overall, Yachty invests like a boomer, which is telling. I agree with some of his observations and will be adjusting my portfolio as needed. I give it a Strong 7 weak 8."

A few bullet points for all y'all apes

* Cheapest e-commerce American platform on the market (accounting for market cap/sales)
* Americans in general more prone to spend money on frivolities given low interest rates and stimmy checks
* Huge demand of goods from China almost collapsed the supply chain. $WISH ships directly from China
* Rumor has it that Amazon offered 10B for WISH back in 2015 and CEO wouldn't sell (mkt cap is around 7B currently).
* CEO is an ex-Google employee
* Most downloaded play store app of 2018
* centralized hub for buying random/wacky shit
* Gamification of the buying experience makes users spend more on the platform
* The absolute apes at Loop capital have a $40 price target. The more trustworthy people over at evercore initiated recently with a price target of $22
* Exposure to international markets, not just the US
* You'd literally be buying @ an all time low valuation

An exciting week ahead of us, here is my weekly newsletter which I share every Monday to help prepare you for the week! Feel free to DM me and happy trades!

**Week of 4/19/21**

The S&P500 opened Monday 4/19/21 at 4179.80, just below the previous close of 4185.67 on Friday  
4/16/21.

Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) prepare to square up over the social media platforms controversial  
tracking of consumer data. Facebook, which generates a large portion of its profits from targeted advertising, is known to collect consumer data to deliver the ads it believes will be the most successful. Apple has been in the process of developing what it calls “App Tracking Transparency,” for its devices and announced in January that the feature will be included and enabled by default on all new Apple operating systems. The technology, which was tested publicly in summer of 2020, will prevent applications like Facebook and Instagram from being able to collect user data. Facebook has begun preparations to sue Apple, who is currently in the midst of a lawsuit over App Store payments for the popular online game, Fortnite.

Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke on the issue following statements from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg citing Apple as their, “biggest competitor.” Tim appeared committed to continuing to roll out the technology, saying, “Technology does not need vast troves of personal data, stitched together across dozens of websites and apps, in order to succeed. Advertising existed and thrived for decades without it. And we’re here today because the path of least resistance is rarely the path of wisdom. If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform.”

Apple will hold its first product showcase of the year tomorrow, 4/20/21. The technology frontrunner is suspected to unveil our first glimpses of consumer-grade Augmented Reality technologies. The product showcase comes on the heels of a great month for the emerging AR industry, which was just the subject of a $20 Billion military contract with Microsoft. Apple is up 0.86% on the market open.

Emerging fitness company Peloton (PTON) traded down 5% on the open following federal regulators warnings against treadmills sold by the company. The Consumer Product Safety Commission released statements April 17th warning parents of children and pet owners to exercise caution after the death of a child who became wedged underneath the machine. At least 40 incidents of injury related to the machine have been recorded since its release.

Reports of Google (GOOG) using foreign tax loopholes to evade taxes have emerged. The company reportedly used the “double-Irish,” loophole to funnel over 100 Billion in profits through Ireland and into Bermuda in 2018 & 2019, allowing the company to collect the profits free of U.S. taxation. The loophole was addressed and abolished by the U.K. in 2015, however the nature of the change to legislation still allows companies established before it’s passing to exploit the loophole. A spokeswoman for Google indicated that the loophole is no longer being used by the company, and that the U.S. taxes avoided by using the loophole would have amounted to approximately 80% of all taxes levied against the profits.

The September 2020 agreement to merge NVIDIA (NVDA) and ARM Ltd. is currently in limbo as U.K. regulators have released statements intervening in the acquisition. The merger, which was negotiated by NVIDIA and SoftBank, is worth approximately $40 Billion. The intervention was released this morning, 4/19/21, and carries with it the stipulation that a full federal investigation be conducted and completed by the end of July 30th, 2021. The state of the deal is uncertain as markets await a press release from NVIDIA.

JP Morgan (JPM) has displayed considerable interest in funding a new professional soccer league in Europe. The European Super League, which was announced on Sunday by a dozen of the world’s largest football clubs, will be established to rival the current European Champions League, and will consist of 12 of Europe’s leading clubs, mostly from Spain and the U.K. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan confirmed in an email that it would be involved in funding the league, but the amount in which JP Morgan will be contributing is still unknown. JP Morgan posted earnings of 12.61 last week and was up 0.5% on the market open.

A relatively low amount of major economic numbers will be released this week. Reporting starts with Jobless Claims at 8:30AM on Thursday, April 22nd. Instead expect a busy week for earnings reports, with many major companies reporting earnings throughout the week.

Some of the larger players releasing earnings include Coca-Cola, on Monday, Johnson and Johnson on Tuesday, Intel on Thursday, and American Express on Friday.

# TL;DR

`Heutagogy - self-determined learning, is a student-centered instructional strategy that emphasizes the development of autonomy, capacity, and capability`

`Pedagogy - the method and practice of teaching, especially as an academic subject or theoretical concept.`

Roblox is fundamentally an education company that encourages students to learn modern-day equivalents of typing on a computer. These skills involve things like learning how to code, develop art, or strong communication skills. =

# Purpose

To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here. WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts can crush Wall Street analysts at places like Morningstar or M-Fool. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation or cooperation.

* Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**
* How do we compare social media incentives? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**
* What really is customer service? **(GameStop DD Complete)**
* Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(Kansas City Southern Rail DD Complete)**
* What are elements behind US lagging industrial sector? **(Autodesk DD Complete)**
* Do we understand the consequences of STEAM education (Science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics)? **(YOU ARE HERE)**
* Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? **(Cloud Compute DD in Progress)**
* How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that’s why I’m sharing my writing. I’m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.

# Video Games & Heutagogic Learning

It appears clear these days that video games are the most dominant form of media. This is because the video game industry can better access and more aggressively capture our high-barrier entry need for adventure and journey. Other industries compete with this element but ultimately place their customers in the spectator's seat. For example:

1. The short stories on social media like Snapchat, Instagram, Youtube, or Twitter.
2. The hero tales created by Disney or Netflix.

&#x200B;

[Gaming as the leader in entertainment or media](https://preview.redd.it/xms6g6ksvpt61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=e84e0655c99280e464931f3da513e33404fbdee6)

One must remember that the attention-economy fundamentally depends on on key metric: **engagement**. It is no secret why organizations like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, or even Tesla have further intersected with gaming in aggressive maneuvers in recent years as a result of this economic condition. Gaming is a big winner of the attention-economy and often sits at the frontier of new economies.  When looking at age, gaming or other medias can be the shortest path to reaching new or lifelong customers. It is a lucrative and difficult position to acquire or maintain.

&#x200B;

Think of it historically; during the first iterations of the web, many customers were fearful of putting credit-card information online while online gaming companies have ventured into selling branded debit cards that sold to children and youth that otherwise did not have access to banking. Roblox takes this nature a step further by effectively defining and supporting Robux-to-fiat economy as the lifeblood of the company.

&#x200B;

[First generation fintech and banking services](https://preview.redd.it/72qme0crxpt61.png?width=353&format=png&auto=webp&s=cadb26b801c61afe73a8a96cb16a0024c66e316b)

I’ve discussed internet media, user incentives, and their distinctions in a previous DD involving Pinterest. To highlight one of main ideas:

>""An internet forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. In my view, it ranks like the following list, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:

1. Google is fueled by customer’s need for answered information.
2. Online video games are fueled by a customer’s need for adventure.
3. Reddit is fueled by a customer’s need for community.
4. Pinterest is fueled by a customer’s need for ideas.
5. Facebook is fueled by a customer’s need to connect.""

In this DD, I would argue that gaming is one of the most comprehensive applications of internet forums that can encapsulate all of the needs above and dig deeper into the ideas that drive it.

&#x200B;

[The investment incentive: low barrier to entry & decentralized game development](https://preview.redd.it/hmibns2pzpt61.png?width=1303&format=png&auto=webp&s=a08c1a1680665d6f9272f3cff8ab19bb68f3f3ed)

I typically do not like to assert authority on a subject when I write DD, but I feel that in this case it is necessary due to an enormous complexities behind education technology, what's wrong with it, and what needs to be corrected.  In short, my view is that video games are one of the most powerful ways to engage students in a meaningful and long-lasting education, ranging from social to reading skills.

&#x200B;

[Heutagogic learning](https://preview.redd.it/rq9dxj9yzpt61.png?width=591&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4fbe53adde74b85313ca4dca53077e14de64983)

Online games fulfill a similar shortcoming that traditional medias fail in regards to adventure or journey.  In the same fashion, education and the art of teaching generally stutters when the student remains a spectator for too long.  What gaming achieves as an education service are all the critical requirements of a healthy STEM education:

&#x200B;

1. The ability to inspire curiosity and confidence.
2. The ability to deeply engage.
3. The ability to produce imagination or creativity.

Some of us may scoff about this, but there is a lot of truth to this sentiment that I believe many would agree with. For many early online child gamers, skills like typing quickly, bartering, multiplying, reading comprehension, or the desire to pursue arts originates from our time spent engaged by video games.

This is the goal and nature of heutagogic learning. This nature extends to adulthood, as many of us experienced this phenomenon while learning about advanced financial instruments for the sake of ""learning the game""  of stock market investing. We spend time scowering through forums and generating a community no different than that of popular online games.  Many of us have even acquired generational knowledge as a result of this media condition. We have met the proper requirements and incentives for a STEM education at scale.

[Andragogic\/Heutagogic learning at scale](https://preview.redd.it/gplo1bx41qt61.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=715bae2a0ff447bd5d21569bcac401c636c69dae)

I could talk length about this subject alone, but simply put, the world is not quite ready to accept such an idea. Games are still seen as entertainment, but it typically evolves each generation. In my generation, three societal transformations occurred:

1. It stopped being weird to purchase in-game cosmetics.
2. The idea of watching others play video games was normalized.
3. E-Sports became popular and inspired a new economy.

&#x200B;

[Second generation online gaming](https://preview.redd.it/4bt555i62qt61.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c281084802f3ff72cb8143b40761bde4fa9e5ed)

Some of these resistances are interesting when you look at it from a simpler lens. Why was it weird to watch others play video games online, when it was seemingly normal to watch someone play Dance Dance Revolution in an arcade or an older sibling progress through a game? Why was it strange to purchase cosmetic goods where we spend a large percentage of our time in digital worlds? Why was it bizarre to see dedicated players compete at global levels when gaming and online access became a worldwide normalcy? Usually there is no good reason for the psychological resistance to change.

Yet here we are, playing and learning effectively one of the most popular mobile games in the US.

&#x200B;

# STEAM Pedagogy - Arts in STEM

&#x200B;

[STEAM pedagogy for architecture, engineering, or construction](https://preview.redd.it/b57peu7j2qt61.png?width=2782&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e6ce51e01691091ff6dbeee88ff1dad985a2ff7)

With that idea covered, I want to transition to examine one of the leading pedagogies in US education, which is the inclusion of arts in STEM, known as a STEAM pedagogy.  It may not be immediately clear why the inclusion is such a drastic change to STEM, but one should consider several factors:

1. STEM education standards are poor with low engagement (a societal problem)
2. Good science and engineering requires confident students (resisting imposter syndrome)
3. STEM requires creativity and imagination (critical thinking requisites)

&#x200B;

[Game development, code, or design](https://preview.redd.it/556dqhnp3qt61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6b4a2ac6c89a435890fcd01210026208aae9337)

What an arts education does is fundamentally produce new language and learning skills that are actively applied in a STEM education. Typically speaking, arts is also far more engaging to youth while traditional STEM learning models can carry less obvious inherent incentives.

However, slowly but surely, we are beginning to see students who seek to learn digital art, coding, investing and other STEAM-derived interests that can transition into other branches of STEM as a result of incentivizing the desire to learn these skills.

A young Roblox game developer is only a short path away from finding a passion in architecture or cloud computing. This strategy is not new and has had success for organizations like Adobe, Microsoft, Autodesk, and other technical skills. These are largely andragogic forms of learning, or adult-centered educations.

&#x200B;

One of the most significant accomplishments of the inclusion of Arts in a STEM-centered education is the inversion of a question that afflicted many classrooms for generations:

>“Why do I need to learn this?”

It turns out, the answer is not

>“so you can become a scientist!”

but to provide an environment that encourages and incentivizes a proper learner's mentality

>“I need to learn this, so that I can create that.”

&#x200B;

Engineers and scientists are simply disciplined creators no different than an artist or performer. However, there are significant and clear barriers to entry to STEM-based and Arts-based learning. It is far more pragmatic for a child to inspire creative behaviors with a canvas, skateboard, or instrument while the barrier to entry for engineering practices may be far less accessible.

Some of this is partially a consequence of time, where there has been less knowledge transfer on writing software vs. writing prose and some of these barriers have compounding consequences at the socioeconomic level.  For example, there is a large disparity in big tech hirings, and such consequences can carry over to other multi-trillion dollar industries driven by infrastructure and Green New Deal policies.

&#x200B;

[Socioeconomic consequences in education support](https://preview.redd.it/t2mh2ikz3qt61.png?width=987&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ed2aadf47bb21e36d44864efe58303c20119d74)

Another huge barrier to entry to STEM is simply the fact that many students do not believe in themselves or have not been encouraged to imagine that they are capable of achieving success in subjects like mathematics and science, so there is an enormous amount of undue self-filtering in the field. Learning how to dance is a far more engaging practice to a child, while learning how to code in some developer environment without the proper incentive may seem pointless. Organizations like Roblox can and are changing the equation for some students.

You may be at a loss at this point, but it's worth taking the time to simply ponder on this and what it means economically for Roblox. The language used here is directly aligned with the language used in the Roblox S-1 registration document:

1. Inspiration mentioned 9 times.
2. Create and inspiration mentioned 75 times.
3. Engagement mentioned 160 times.

This language is particular due to the game identifying with its original iteration, Interactive Physics, an education game that launched in 1989.

>""The story of Roblox began in 1989 when our founders, David Baszucki and Erik Cassel, programmed a 2D simulated physics lab called Interactive Physics, which would later go on to influence our approach to building the groundwork for Roblox. Students across the world used Interactive Physics to see how two cars would crash, or how they could build destructible houses. In starting Roblox in 2004, we wanted to replicate the inspiration of imagination and creativity we saw in Interactive Physics on a much grander scale by ushering in a new category of human interaction that did not exist at the time.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# The Roblox Vision

>""We focus our business on our developers, creators, and users, and acting in their interests in the long-term may conflict with the short-term expectations of analysts and investors.""

&#x200B;

[EBP - Engagement Based Payouts started in 2020](https://preview.redd.it/z63prfzr6qt61.png?width=467&format=png&auto=webp&s=faad3efe3a156c1f26e4adadefb20346466bb37e)

Understanding the nature of modern-day cloud computing and its future direction will allow investors to understand the paths that Roblox will take. The fundamental theory of this economy is that a customer's data is an increasingly tangible asset. The way that I like to examine the economic output of this industry is by two core economic elements.

1. The value of work generated by machine-to-machine transactions (network output).
2. The value of data and services generated by human experiences (customer input).

[Serverless computing - network service architecture for real-time and powerful apps.](https://preview.redd.it/wl88yq547qt61.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&s=618f6be99e0b7cc157065b4505cb82d7f89d5e36)

There are many organizations that capture the essence of this industry. Organizations like Square and Zoom will provide services that we're all familiar with, but we often forget the under-hood-details that exist and govern the infrastructure of these companies. What cloud computing organizations have realized is that as our engagement with platforms increases, the value of our data and needs becomes increasingly tangible. Our needs for financial technology or property rentals have resulted in regulatory or social challenges, which we typically refer to as ""disruption"". The disruption is rooted in the fact that our data is an authentically tangible good.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vpzpov6deqt61.png?width=845&format=png&auto=webp&s=0128b3dd2ee4912161dbfc99c9d312b8f57f9b6c

&#x200B;

This idea that our data and time spent on digital platforms is the central hypothesis behind creation of the robux system that Roblox lives on. There are many things that Roblox needs to accomplish in the near to short term to achieve long-term profitability and the leadership seems to have a clear vision on how to achieve that:

1. The company will continue to redistribute its wealth back toward its developers.
2. The company will aggressively invest in education sectors to incentivize students to learn valuable skills.
3. The company will support wildly successful games as a way to create a long-term identity for Roblox (like popular Nintendo games)
4. The company will continue to invest in its cloud platform and eventually develop its own hardware platform to reduce its expenses.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jr21jf1b8qt61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8175cc302d2be55fe0e446f0b78dc71d6f1d4956

The reason that I'm certain of this is because the organization needs to accomplish the following incentives and financial feats:

1. Reached a large enough audience in order to maintain long-term relevancy.
2. Produced and support games that create enough incentive to join the platform.
3. Created enough incentives for developers to produce quality experiences.

&#x200B;

>""Roblox has a vibrant economy built on a currency called Robux, which can be purchased through the Roblox Client and website. Users can also acquire Robux through a monthly subscription to Roblox  
>  
>Premium. Developers and creators earn Robux by selling access to virtual content. Developers can also earn Robux by driving engagement of Premium subscribers through an engagement-based payout system. When Premium subscribers spend time in a developer’s experience, that developer earns a prorated share of the user’s monthly subscription fee. Engagement-based payouts incentivize developers to invest in the engagement of their experiences. Roblox allows developers and creators to convert earned Robux into the real-world currency of their choice through our Developer Exchange Program.""

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h95ts6pt8qt61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0406e17772f8f302bfdc4beb4eee288509e07440

In my view, Roblox's 2020 premium payout system will be one the biggest shifts in media as it has many potential outcomes that we aren't fully implemented yet. This is the nature of certain powerful architectures like computing more data at the edge or leaning on services like Fastly, Amazon Fargate, or other serverless/back-end platforms. Roblox is no such stranger to this and I would say that they certaintly have a vested interest in pushing these kinds of interactions.

Some uses cases of engagement-based payouts are repeatable to other platforms, where organizations like Reddit could easily implement similar financial logic if they discover that Reddit Subscribers spend the majority of their time to a small concentration of subreddits. This already exists to an extent, where users represent engagement through coin-sharing and reddit emoji placements.

Another example, if a high-quality education game were to be released on Roblox, where the developer agrees to redistribute their earned Robux to schools in need, then Roblox has achieved an economy where a student who is spending time learning has resulted in the improvement or construction of other learning facilities. This is also reflective of the idea that data is increasingly tangible.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bb9j3yj7aqt61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=8308e21dd05757fa74928a26560f665d0d61bf12

The possibilities with an engagement-based payout system are enormous for Roblox and produces added value to the ideas behind things like virtual concerts, streams, or other experiences that aren't fully realized in the gaming sector. For example, what is the economic consequence of children having a safe environment to attend concerts of their favorite artists? At the same time, the Robux payout system is a non-trivial distance away from creating applications of other alternative currencies like exchanging Robux with other digital assets like VBucks, tickets, or block-you-know-what-based applications.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1g33ivkwaqt61.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6ff4e2b37801f0ee02fa70d46b8fa636bc5455b

Another core element to Roblox's financial future is to ultimately secure its means of distribution. As it currently stands, the biggest expense to the Roblox platform is the fee processing it must agree to when it comes to doing business with organizations like Apple, Microsoft, Google, and other payment processors like Visa and Paypal. One way to reduce these costs and increase profitability is to develop products akin to the Nintendo Switch or Oculus platform. This idea is not too far away given the nature of Roblox's business, which has an enormous amount of various types of games that would be well-suited by Roblox partnerships. Overtime, the value of Apple or Google's distribution power weakens as the company cements itself into public consciousness.

&#x200B;

The company has alluded to this idea with an April fool's joke in 2019, with a console known as the imagination-powered Robox:

>"" At Roblox, we’re continuously exploring new and innovative ways to bring our platform to millions of people across the world. Just as we’ve expanded onto phones, tablets, the Xbox One, and virtual reality, we believe that there’s an even greater potential just waiting to be unlocked. A new way to experience all your favorite Roblox games. A new way to connect with your friends. A new way to make your dreams a reality in stunning, 8K ultra-high definition graphics and at greater than 120 frames per second.  
>  
>Welcome to a new era of interactive entertainment. This is **Robox**.""

&#x200B;

# Conclusion

There was a lot of ground to cover here so let's briefly review. Gaming is arguably the best form of media in the attention-economy where Roblox identifies itself at the intersection of education and digital media development.

A significant portion of the education sector is focused on STEAM pedagogy which aligned with and supported by Roblox goals long-term. Roblox is able to leverage cloud computing to disrupt traditional models in gaming, education, financial technology, and imagination markets.

This stock dropped 15% today but it is for one of the worlds greatest proprietary products with a well loved company.

The reason for the dip is because their earnings call had two negative points.

https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/08/wd-40-co-wdfc-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/

1.  Their supply chain is disrupted and they have already lost or delayed sales in the US market because of it.  The North America market was the only region they saw any losses in sales (1% ) while every other market had gains of 9%+ with the company showing 12% growth overall.   

This supply chain issue is global and impacting every manufacturing company.  It's a nonsense driver and WDFC just happens to be one of the first major manufacturing earnings reports to land since heavy supply chain issues have hit.  Google the term ""Force Majeure"" and you will find that everyone has been running out of raw material and shipping is backed up.   WDFC has better recovery plans than most (have a whole new supplier almost ready to launch in full and added shifts at some suppliers) and their market shares aren't at risk because no one in the market has capacity to steal it from them.

2. They missed projected earnings.  

Earnings were still great.  They have gone up and profits are solid.  This just falls back to supply chain issues.  There wasn't enough product to sell and their warehouses are near empty.

You need to buy this now.  Even the millennial obsession with quick return options is probably fine as long as you buy the stock at the end so you can get their sweet dividends! 🛢️🦅🛢️

I don't have time to put in extra quality data like my normal boomer DD release because it is already climbing again past it's 15% dip today.   Any time before it gets to 5% drop from yesterdays close is a good buy.  After that it might take a little longer to recover but this is a super strong stock."

At first the market didn't like it and on the next trading day the stock lost 10% (panic mode, loss porn and so on). However within the next 2 trading days BB has regained all its $ in a quick reversal. I'm here to tell you why.

This is a followup to [my OP.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/mhi3ev/blackberry_earningscall_were_actually_bullish/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) 

^(Quick note to the Mods: I believe my OP is about to bring new original content to the discussion and hopefully will be eligible to live its life as a post.)

**Portfolio Patent Sale (big $$$)**

Quick refresh: the stock fell because the revenue came below expectations but straightaway the company said it happened because they are currently negotiating the sale of a portion of their patents specifically related to ***mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking.*** Consequently they had to voluntarily limit the monetisation of these patents during Q4.

The points I would like to investigate are: for how much $$ this sale could go, how likely this sale is to happen, who could be the buyer and when could it be completed?

***First the money.*** CEO Chen during the call: *we will report a one-time gain of a reasonably big number, followed by a tail of up to seven years.* He also confirmed the yearly revenues for Licensing are around $250m. And that BB owns 38,000 patents. I will simply use these numbers with a DCF to estimate what that ""big number"" could be. Before I proceed I would like to emphasise that CEO also said: *we believe that the completion of the transaction will be beneficial to our shareholders* (if it happens).

Assuming a 10% discount rate and 7 years of revenue life, we have $250m current year, $227m next year, $207m (...) to $141m for the final year. For a total of **$1,339bn.** That's quite a pleasing big number but let's be careful nonetheless: we don't know the size of the portfolio being negotiated and the payment is expected to be initially a lump sum  + 7years of tail royalties. So they could tweak it a bit.

With a 15% discount rate we get **$1,196bn** and at 20% **$1,081bn.** Another way to look at it: if we consider that they would sell only 75% of that side business and we discount it at 10% we still get a number north of a billion $ (consistent with CEO comment: *it's a major portion of our portfolio*). So money wise should the sale indeed happen we are looking at an one time cash flow of $1bn to $1.3bn. Not too shabby for a $5bn market cap company with already $800m cash in its hands (yes they could have momentarily circa 40% cash to mkt cap ratio).

***Is this really happening?*** There is a high probability it would maybe 80% but it's not cleared yet. To get to this conclusion I listened twice to the conf call to try to decipher the clues. Whenever CEO was talking about the amount he sounded as if that part was near completion (*will be a big number* and *the majority of the deal will come in one-time early, but there is a tail that goes on*). Although he also stated that *the company has not yet reached a definitive binding agreement and negotiations are ongoing.*

The main hurdle might be the regulatory review of the transaction as the big boss mentioned that in the most conservative scenario: *we assume that negotiation and regulatory review continue for the first half* (of FY). A sentence that directly leads me to believe that the buyer could be a major company.

***Big money buyer:*** if there is a lengthy regulatory review it might be because the potential purchaser could be in a position to infringe antitrust laws (NB: antitrust laws were created by Congress to preserve competition among businesses and prevent any one business from dominating a single industry and building a monopoly). 

Speculations are ongoing that the buyer could be Facebook. It's honestly hard to say but that's the name with the higher odds at the moment. Just to recall BB sued FB in 2018, claiming the social media giant was using BlackBerry inventions in its messaging applications. Then they settled the dispute in January 2021 over patent royalties for terms that weren’t disclosed. You see the analogy here. By the way during the conf call this settlement was never mentioned and we still didn't see the financial repercussions in BB accountancy.

That said it could very well be someone else from North America, which leads us to the when.

***The timing of the sale*** is honestly hard to guess but again let's refer to the CEO comment that in their most conservative scenario the discussions could continue during H1. Subjectively I tend to believe that it would happen sooner rather than later because 1. they are losing money by restricting their Licensing every day that goes by and 2. it was *the* major statement in their whole conference call. You can arguably think that you would release this kind of communication when negotiations are very advanced. If I had to bet I would say it's a matter of a few weeks obviously subject to the regulatory approval.

**The Transformation**

By now unless if you've been living on Mars because that game rocket took you too far, you must know that BlackBerry is no longer an handset company. They excel at cybersecurity, they are deeply involved in the automotive industry including EV thanks to QNX and they are coming big hand in hand with Amazon to bring IVY to the world (October early release and Feb22 full product).

If and when they sell that side portfolio to a potentially big name you can expect all financial and traditional media to report the transaction and to emphasise the renewal, the rebirth of BlackBerry as an Internet of Things, Cybersecurity high-margins long-duration Tech company.

In terms of communication they have just started and they are about to splash the cash to continue on. John Chen is quite excited about it: *you will see us being more aggressive, in fact we ran an ad today Intelligent Security everywhere, an ad today. I just saw it on the New York Times and so we're just going to step-up in both people and spending and resources to go after the market and it is a huge, as you know very well, it is a huge market and no clear winner at this point.*

He later added that: *we have a reasonably large number of hires mostly in sales and marketing.*

***IVY is not priced in at all:*** there is no other way to say it. At the current BB valuation investors are totally ignoring the potential of IVY, probably because they don't understand it. Let me go straight to the point.

*BB and AWS said the new intelligent vehicle data platform, called IVY, will compress the time to build, deploy and monetize in-vehicle applications and connected services across multiple brands and models, making it easier for automakers to collaborate with a wider pool of developers to accelerate development of apps and services.*

The goal is to establish IVY as a standard platform across the auto industry, as Apple and Google have done in mobile phones through their iOS and Android platforms. This way IVY could be the equivalent of the App Store but for all mobility platforms whether EV, autonomous driving EV, air drones, rockets (SpaceX already using QNX) etc. The end uses are potentially limitless and most of the current discussed applications are under NDAs. Once they start to pop out, the picture will get clearer and clearer.

Similarly to what Apple did back in the days, BB has started an IVY Fund with $50m in it + $100K AWS credit for new startups willing to develop a product on IVY. Let's also not forget that the deal was approved by Andy Jassy in December who later got upgraded from AWS big boss to Amazon CEO. We can reasonably imagine that he values IVY as a potential disruptor and Chen sees it as a *significant growth opportunity.* Initially thought to hit the market in 2023, the early release will be available as soon as October 2021 (again the market is sleeping on this advancement).

One quick word on the cybersecurity part of the business: BB and CRWD have roughly the same yearly revenue (I will leave it to the experts to discuss how comparable they are). One company has $5bn market cap and the other $44bn.

**The Bear Case**

If the sale doesn't happen at all that's gonna look bad and hurt financially. Still according to the call, *full year licensing revenue will be in the region of $100 million* (if the sale fail) vs an usual $250m per year. As mentioned throughout that's because they are limiting the Licensing revenue while negotiating. Cybersecurity growth, QNX and IVY will still remain in play but more as mid and long term catalysts. They would still push for sales and marketing but the blue sky scenario obviously implies the receipt of a billion $ in cash in exchange of their accessory patents.

*Definitely not a recommendation to buy, hold, sell any security. Besides I have no knowledge in IoT, programming, software etc. I can only read.*

*Disclosure: long BB shares and June 20C and 15C (in that order).*

**TLDR:** BB is selling their old business patents probably for more than $1bn to a big player in order to focus on their new business model - cybersecurity, IoT, QNX, IVY - and come back like what's up."

DD:

----

- The 5.5% TSLA equity short interest of 44m shares [1] is only part of the ""true"", effective TSLA short interest: there's 2.6 million put option contracts open right now [2], a significant part of which are in the money, which, on a ~20% rally due to record Q1 results, combined with 2.6 million open calls, have the delta hedging effect equivalent to another ~100m shares short covered ...
- The pro-forma float of TSLA is 771m shares [2] - but at least ~130m of that is locked up by S&P 500 index funds, ~90m by options market makers for current delta hedging requirements: 220m shares or 28% of the float is already locked up today - effective float is 551m shares or lower.
- Due to TSLA's +1,000% rally in 2020 options market makers are net long TSLA by tens of millions of shares - so the delta hedging effect of put contracts doesn't show up in the regular short interest as it normally does for other names. Much of the effective short interest is ""hidden"" by this temporary artifact.
- So if we plug these numbers in: with TSLA starting at $661 if we have a major rally due to the Q1 results (TSLA already up +7% today) then we have 44m shares equity short and market makers lock up another ~100m shares during the rally just to delta-hedge the millions of puts and millions of calls.
- The delta hedging by market makers is anti-dilutive, just like short covering: it removes shares from the effective float. Anti-dilutive buy-to-cover is much stronger buying pressure than the typical trader-to-trader buying, because it contracts the float. 
- So should most Tesla shorts want to cover (not all: some are price insensitive hedges), they have to compete with the delta hedging of market makers (and regular bullish buyers): there's a combined buying of 144m shares on a 20% move, against an effective float of 551m shares. **That's an effective short interest of 26%.**
- A short interest of 26% for a low-float megacap like TSLA is excessively high compared to other megacaps: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and GOOG short interest is all below 1%, and their options open interests are an order of magnitude smaller than that of TSLA. [4]  [5]


I.e. the Tesla shorting that drive the price down from the $900 ATH to the current $661 is an ***excessively*** overcrowded short trade, with over $30b value at risk - which they'd want to cover much faster than any GME short position.

So a significant TSLA ""synthetic short squeeze"" is possible IMO, driven in part by excessive short options bets.

Should after the record quarter TSLA rally beyond $900 price levels to new ATHs, then all bets are off.

Disclaimer: I am not a financial or investment advisor.

Disclaimer: This is a monster stock.

Note: I have attempted to pull together the business case and investment thesis and summary of recent compelling events based on the work of many in the MicroVision community r/MVIS, including u/S2upid and u/BigBlackWifey to name a few, with the intent of spreading the word about this great company with massive potential.

Many of you may have first heard about MicroVision due to the recent news of the $21.9B US Army contract awarded to Microsoft for over 120,000 IVAS/HoloLens 2 headsets over the next 10 years. This contract is only for the US Army, imagine once the other US Military branches decide they need IVAS as well...

This is significant for MicroVision because their tech is in these headsets. We know this because the now legendary Hololens 2 tear down by u/S2upid:[S2upid Hololens 2 Teardown](https://tinyurl.com/S2upidHololens2Teardown)

This is why MVIS spiked 50% following the news.

Full article: [Microsoft Wins US Army Contract](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html) 

This deal will surely lead to an significant increase in MicroVision’s AR vertical revenue, however, the military contract is just the tip of the iceberg...

The big PR that everyone has been waiting for has yet to drop... MicroVision has best-in-class 4D LiDAR with technical specs and price per unit meeting or exceeding OEM autonomous driving requirements.
The company has announced at the last EC that the LiDAR A-Sample will be complete in April 21, and all signs point to a buyout already being negotiated with Google for the Auto Lidar vertical and possibly Microsoft for the AR divisions... there could be a bidding war soon unless a deal has already been inked.

Nobody is defending the price. (Sign #1)

Wild fluctuations in the stock price (Sign #3)

Large amounts of phantom premium on the table (Sign #4)

Unusual Options activity (Sign #5)

More and MORE FUD across all platforms. (Sign #6)

The only real argument is that we don’t have a working product that anyone has seen and very little revenue.

That’s about to change... (See $22B Microsoft US Military IVAS contract and upcoming auto LiDAR A-Sample)

Naked shorts and MM’s are driving the pps down. Bizarre price action prior to upcoming milestones.  (Sign #7)

Several BoD’s have stepped down in recent months (to make room for the new appointees) and have not sold their stock. (Sign #8)

Let’s connect some dots...

Summary of the recent compelling events:

Note: Some of the below DD based on summary from u/t-jameson-corazon 

Feb, 2020 - CEO Sumit Sharma takes the reins. Sumit used to be Director of Google Glass. 

June, 2020 - Dr Mark Spitzer joins the BoD. Spitzer has ties to Google.  Dr Spitzer is the leading AR expert in the world and came out of retirement to be a part of MicroVision’s journey.

Q3 2020 - Ford announced a stake in Velodyne (VLDR), a competitor in automotive LiDAR.

Dec, 2020 - Judy Curran (Ford) joins the Microvision BoD.

Judy Curran previously held executive positions at Ford Motor Co. She has more than 30 years of experience in vehicle program, engineering, and technology leadership. Judy Curran is very pragmatic and would not join the board of a failing company. Curran currently serves as Head of Global Automotive Strategy at ANSYS, a developer of multiphysics engineering simulation software. ANSYS could conduct testing for interested parties to have benchmark data.

Ford and Google have a strategic partnership.

2/1/21 - State of Michigan has purchased 1 Million shares of MVIS (not $1 million worth of MVIS, 1 Million SHARES).

Ford is based in Michigan.

2/5/21 - Blackrock buys 2.4 million SHARES.

Mid-Feb 21 - Ford sold its position in VLDR.

Feb 16th 21, MVIS announces a $50M ATM offering agreement with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. This ATM gave MicroVision the Net Working Capital (NWC) needed to facilitate a Merger and Acquision. This was filed with the SEC in a way that allows MVIS to pay fees based on the current share price and not disclose the future share price (Sign of incoming buyout - This is BAFF (Bullish as Fucking Fuck).

March 2nd, 21’ - BoD Bernee D. L. Strom steps down to make room for the newest board member, Seval Oz. (Sign #8)

Seval Oz, the newest BoD, is a recognized global business and marketing leader in mobility, autonomous vehicle technology and intelligent transportation systems. 

Oz was a Founder and CEO of Aurima, Inc, a multi-sensor awareness platform powered by AI deep learning for autonomous vehicles. She was previously CEO of Continental Intelligent Transportation Systems, a division of Continental AG Interiors Division. She has served as Head of Global Strategic Partnerships for Google[x]'s Self Driving Cars Program (Waymo) where she supported global business and marketing efforts for Google’s self-driving technology commercial launch. In addition, she is an executive board advisor to automotive industry leaders and an investment advisor to several investment funds and holds 10 patents in vehicular technology software.  

Seval Oz - “I am thrilled to join the MicroVision board of directors at this opportune time. I am excited to bring my expertise and experience in autonomous vehicle technology and mobility to the Company as it develops its automotive LiDAR technology and explores strategic alternatives.”

Seval Oz has been on the board for the last month and has not filed a Form 4 with the SEC yet. Seval Oz would not just join the board of a failing company, and she certainly would not join the board without compensation. The only logical reason for her not filing a Form 3 or 4 with the SEC already is if she is being compensated by the acquiring company (Google). This is BAFF.

Sumit has repeatedly stated he is interested in exploring strategic alternatives including the sale of a vertical or multiple verticals. 

Direct quotes from the earnings call on March 11 with [transcript](https://tinyurl.com/ECTranscript):

“The ability to deliver a high performing long range Lidar sensor that is designed to meet or exceed current OEM requirements.”

“The scalability of our sensor to meet future price targets.”

“I believe that adding these new expertise and insight to our current board, to augment existing expertise in business, including expertise in mergers and acquisition, strengthens our ability to create value for our shareholders.”

“We’ve pioneered scalable solutions that we believe are far ahead of global competitors.”

“The impact and value of what we’ve achieved was hard to measure (insert SS chuckle) since there were no competitive solutions for these verticals.”

“Our automotive Lidar product addresses an emerging market segment that has the potential to impact millions of lives, in mobility and safety, with potentially billions of dollars in sensor and sales for OEM’s, and multi national technology companies over coming decades.”

“With such capabilities, in our first potential product, we believe a future product could then include a Lidar, and a camera module, combined in a single sensor.”

“As I mentioned in our call last October, regarding our A sample timing, we expect the hardware for demonstration, along with select benchmark data from our development platform, will be available to interested parties, in our April timeframe, followed by complete benchmarking and testing. I also expect that a version of our solid state long range Lidar sensor could be available for sale, in small quantities, in Q3 or Q4 this year.”

“Our solid state long range Lidar sensor could enable any interested parties to perform testing, with our sensor, on their platforms, such as cars, and long haul trucks.”

“We expect to establish a pilot line with appropriate capacity to demonstrate scalability as we have done over the last decade for multi technology national partners. Let me be specific on this. Our capabilities include delivering maps, control plans, supply chain partnerships, automation, and product integrity qualification, for high yield design, that can ramp.”

“In conclusion, we remain committed to exploring strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the company, in part or whole, to maximize value for our shareholders.”

“I am profoundly optimistic.”

“During the year ending Dec 21st 2020 we applied a total of 2 million dollars against the prepayment.”

“We anticipate the financial statements that we will be releasing shortly, will no longer have a going concern opinion.” (have since been released)

“On our April 2017 customer, we are expecting that royalties in 2021 will increase over 2020, and we’re rooting for that product to do well.” (note April 2017 customer is Microsoft, $22 Billion US Army IVAS contract awarded last week)

“We are a stand alone company right now, but we’re up for sale.”

“I’m always optimistic about the company. A year ago, where we were, people asked, what do you think, you know (insert SS chuckle) MicroVision, you know, even back then, I think it’s worth billions.”

“I’m trying to draw the bigger picture of how important it is to actually solve these problems in these segments.”

“I want to be very crystal about what we’re working on, and our commitment to strategic alternatives.”

“If you solve a key problem, and your extremely valuable, of course I’m optimistic about the company. Hugely optimistic about what it can enable.”

“The demonstration would be for potential customers or other interested parties. It’s not a public demonstration per se, but for folks that were in conversation with.”

“This is a fight for the future. The last time I remember feeling this kind of excitement was what we call the internet age in the late 90’s, mid 90’s, where we knew that there was a big revolution that would impact everyone’s life, so I’m excited. All of us are.”

“This is benchmarking data that is provided for interested parties.”

“Everybody’s thirst for data, will be done, who is working with us under NDA.”

“...we need to give confidence to customers, people, you know, perhaps in a strategic transaction.”

“Save millions of lives, and make billions of dollars over decades.”

“The process continues, but we will not be commenting on any specifics.”

More dots...
No fireside chat after Q4 2020 earnings call (They typically have had these but it seems they are trying to say as little as possible, a sign of a buyout being negotiated).

David Allen/Investor Relations, has not been able to answer most questions over email or the phone.

Yalon Farhi - BoD who’s funds kept MVIS alive steps down and retires. (Sign #8)

Yalon Farhi hasn’t sold.

David Westgor stepping down as VP General Counsel. He is staying on in a consulting role until June. (Sign #8)

From the Press Release: “I will be stepping back from my current role but will continue to provide support to the Company on a consulting basis through June as the Company transitions to a new general counsel.” (Presumably the new general counsel from the acquiring company - This is BAFF).

David Westgor hasn’t sold.

The CFO is Steve Holt (STEVE HOLT!!!)

Seval Oz still hasn’t filed a Form 4.

Not even counting patent filings for lasers and scanning devices from MANY interested parties ranging from US to a GLOBAL scale.

Short Squeeze coming...
There is significant short interest against MVIS, in fact several short firms have been very vocal about being short on MVIS. Based purely on the P/E ratio, it would seem that shorting would be a good strategy, however, MVIS value is not in the current earnings, it is in the IP of the LiDAR and AR tech, and upcoming buyout.

Look at the short interest, borrowed shares and float. The shorts are all-in and there is about to be a massive short squeeze...

Tesla crashing causing increase in liability and eyes pushing for regulation.

Samuel Kang, head of total solutions North America for BYD says last week, “we believe in mvis” and comments after, “they have better tech then Luminar.”

MVIS is considered a Mid-Cap stock since its market cap is over $2B. This has let to a further increase in institutional ownership.

Russell indices reconstitution coming up in May. Today MVIS isn't in any Russell indices since it was below the min $1/share cutoff last year. This year, MVIS should land in several.

Competitors:
(Detailed competitive analysis located in Deep Dive link below)

AEVA 
The new kid on the block, AEVA recently went public via SPAC. Founded by ex-Apple guys, so they have generated some buzz snd have a current market cap of $2.6B. AEVA also has 4D LiDAR, their tech is based on a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) system that integrates onto a chip. Our key advantage over AEVA is timing and speed to market. AEVA has announced they will not be ready for production until late 2023/early 2024. MVIS has comparable if not superior technical specs and has a 3 year head start on AEVA... 3 years...

Luminar (LAZR) 
LiDAR is currently valued at $8B, they were $10B prior to the tech correction, and MVIS LiDAR is superior in terms is specs, size, and scalability (See the Deep Dive link for detailed competitor analysis). 

Velodyne (VLDR)
Inferior 3D LiDAR, does not track velocity (4D), inferior resolution specs. Ford had a significant stake in Velodyne and sold it shortly after Judy Curran joined the board of MVIS.

Price Target:

If we use Luminar’s (LAZR) valuation as a benchmark, we can estimate the fair market value of MVIS auto LiDAR vertical being at least equivalent to LAZR at $8-10B ($51-$63.50/share). I personally think MVIS LiDAR should garner more since it is superior to LAZR, so I am estimating $63.5-100/share for the Auto LiDAR vertical. More conservatively, we can assume that the Auto LiDAR vertical should be worth at least as much as the LAZR valuation of $8B (~$50/share), and I would expect MVIS should be worth more given our LiDAR is superior to LAZR. That is not even mentioning the value of the Consumer LiDAR and AR verticals. While we don’t know how much these are worth, we know the AR verticals just got much more valuable with the $22B contract. MVIS has a portfolio of over 460 patents. My price target for the entire company is at least $150/share.

MicroVision regarding their LiDAR:
“We expect our 1st generation LRL Sensor to have a range of at least 250 meters and the highest resolution at range of any LiDAR with 340 vertical lines up to 250 meters, 568 vertical lines up to 120 meters, and 944 vertical lines up to 60 meters. This equates to 520 points per square degree.”

I have been holding and accumulating since May 2020.

I emptied my bank account (again) last week.

I currently hold 10,000 shares in my ROTH and 3,300 shares in brokerage along with 93 calls/LEAPS.

This is a YOLO for me as I have 95% of my folio in MVIS.

I don’t want to regret not buying more pre-buyout.

A more robust universally-accessible EV charging infrastructure will accelerate the growth of the entire EV industry and help level the playing field for non-Tesla EVs (Tesla's supercharger network has been a key selling point for Tesla). Being the software provider for 23 out of 25 top EV automakers, Blackberry will also experience the same explosive growth soon.

Upgrading train and road infrastructure might imply the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) and Vehicle to Infrastructure communication (V2X) to enhance logistical/traffic management for better energy efficiency, productivity and public safety. As major infrastructure becomes connected to the internet, security will be a major requirement because these infrastructure will become hackable surfaces that can cause serious damage. Blackberry is the leading software provider for mission critical applications, IoT cybersecurity and Unified Endpoints Management (UEM) that has a great track record working closely with governments across the world. The [US military](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/the-united-states-air-force-chooses-blackberry-spark-for-secure-productivity-802136475.html) and [NASA](https://www.militaryaerospace.com/computers/article/16707929/space-shuttle-uses-qnx-software-for-camera) have been Blackberry/QNX's major customers for a long time.

It is very likely that Blackberry will win major government contracts soon in this space given its technical expertise in the IoT space and huge engineering workforce in the US.

I thought I would share some tools with the community to help traders out  - starting with this simple ATR calculator

This will be helpful for any Apes that use stop losses as you can quickly calculate the average monthly range expected in a given stock, ensuring you don't set stop losses too tight and giving your ideas chance to play out

It's also helpful to anticipate expected gains. If the monthly ATR is 3% it would be unreasonable to expect the stock to move 20% over a 1 month period

This hopefully will help you to stay patient with your ideas and give you realistic expectations

Save a copy to your google drive and then there is only 2 inputs - Simply change the date (UK Format) to the 1st of what ever month we are in and change the Ticker (yellow boxes) everything else is auto

The stock soared to $29.20 (from 13ish) before coming back to earth and settled at $21.61 at market close (on 88.56m volume vs. 32.15m float). This is still a GREAT entry point imo and still below the February high of $23.83 when the market dipped and the shorts increased... I expect the price to rise a lot this week.

The next step for $HGEN is EUA application and (hopefully) approval. This is the big ticket and when the stock will really 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Other updates worth noting today - Humanigen announced that they drew the $25m loan from Hercules Capital and suspended their ATM agreement w/ Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. ([Source](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-humanigen-inc-8k-2021-march-29-18715-40)). They also announced an offering of 5m shares ([Source](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-humanigen-inc-424b5-2021-march-29-18715-832)). $HGEN is gearing up for Lenz production.

Things to look out for in the coming days/weeks are the full results of the P3 study, chatter re: FDA/EUA application and approval, ACTIV-5 trial update, talks with governments, partnerships. I expect to see a lot of positive news in the future...

Originally posted Thursday on r/stocks:

Humanigen ($HGEN), led by CEO Cameron Durant and CSO Dale Chappell, is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company currently trading at $13.76 (market cap approx $740 million) that most notably makes the Anti-GM-CSF drug \*\*Lenzilumab. It's phase 3 study for severe COVID has been completed and results will be out by end of march. With a successful phase 3 trial, Humanigen will apply and likely be granted Emergency Use authorization (EUA) for production and use of Lenzilumab

**What is it?**

Lenzilumab is a proprietary ( +100 Patents in GM-CSF, CAR-T, CRS, GvHD) Humaneered® anti-human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) monoclonal antibody that is designed to prevent and treat an immune hyper-response called cytokine storm, a complication considered to be a leading cause of COVID-19 death. Lenzilumab targets severe COVID – patients hospitalized w/ COVID and O2 saturation <94% on room air (90% of hospitalized patients).

**How does it work?**

GM-CSF is an inflammatory signaling protein that causes a multitude of downstream effects. Blah blah blah, the details don’t matter, but what does matter is that this shit kills people with COVID. Here’s a recent bombshell article from [Science Immunology](https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/6/57/eabg9873) that shows the distinct role of GM-CSF in severe COVID-19. What’s also very important is that this is produced by OUR BODIES. Not the virus. Lenzilumab doesn’t target the virus – it is not susceptible to resistance from mutant strains (\\#variantagnostic)

From the article: “GM-CSF is elevated early, scaled with severity, and is central to the inflammatory response in COVID-19.”… “Our findings support therapeutic targeting of GM-CSF, as previously suggested on theoretical grounds”

Here’s another recent study that further implicated GM-CSF in COVID: [Journal of Leukocyte Biology](https://jlb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/JLB.3COVCRA0920-628RR)

From the article: ""Our findings fully support the emerging notion that GM‐CSF might be a key feature of SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced cytokine storm in COVID‐19 patients""

**Does it work?**

We will find out soon. The company consistently stated Phase 3 results will be released by end of March. 60 days from last date of patient enrollment will be Mar. 29, and with some secondary endpoints being at the 60 day mark, I would not be surprised if data is released on the Monday. Until that day comes, there has been a lot of evidence suggesting that it will be successful. I’ve already talked about GM-CSF and studies implicating it's involvement and role in severe COVID lung pathology, and here's more

1. [Open-label study published by the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(20)30989-7/fulltext) \--> Study showed Clinical Improvement (defined as improvement of at least 2 points on the 8-point ordinal clinical endpoints scale) in 11 of 12 (91.7%) patients treated with lenzilumab and 22 of 27 (81.5%) untreated patients. The time to clinical improvement was significantly shorter for the lenzilumab-treated group compared with the untreated cohort with a median of 5 days versus 11 days (*P*=.006)
2. An interim analysis of HGEN’s Phase 3 RCT ([NCT04351152](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04351152)) showed promising results – with a 37% increase in recovery rate at Day 28 vs. Standard of care treatment. Study size (small sizes being an issue w/ many COVID therapeutics thus far) was increased to help maintain power of the study at 90% based on these results. [Source](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/humanigen-announces-positive-interim-phase-3-data-of-lenzilumab-in-patients-hospitalized-with-covid-19/).
3. Otilimab – a drug from $GSK that also targets GM-CSF – recently failed their Phase 3 study. How is that good? Well, despite it being severely underdosed (single 90mg dose w/ shorter half life vs. 1800mg total dose of lenzilumab w/ longer half life) and including patients already on mechanical ventilation (further in disease course), they STILL proved statistical significance in their age 70+ group of patients. Lenzliumab has approx.. 45% of their patients age 65+ (which have a 35-80x risk of hospitalization and 1100-7900x risk of death compared to adolescents as per CDC) as per their interim phase 3 report as compared to 22% in the otilimab trial. The increased dose, greater drug half-life, and better patient population bodes very well for Lenzilumab’s chance of success
4. Here’s a recent bullish letter to the editor from \[[Mayo Clinic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7833532/?fbclid=IwAR3RqXf3i6T9xPnFja_mb5b6p86rLF51SyOXOGimPD5Kgoij0QpBJW87tBs)\]: “Aware of the good safety profile of lenzilumab in this current study and previous analysis, the treatment is feasible and safe and the ongoing randomized phase III trial will extensively confirm the lymphocyte recovery in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of the drug on coronavirus disease 2019 clinical improvement”
5. ACTIV-5 / Big Effect Trial (BET-B) for the Treatment of COVID (NCT04583969)

Funded and selected by the NIH – this studies Lenzilumab combined with Remdesvir for the treatment of COVID. Not hard evidence of lenzilumab’s efficacy, but evidence that Lenzilumab has showed enough promise to warrant being chosen for such a trial

**Competition**

\- There is none right now. All COVID therapeutics that target severe COVID have been dropping like flies. It’s all for the taking if this phase 3 study succeeds and Emergency Use approval Is granted

**COVID – getting worse**

As many of you might’ve heard, COVID isn’t going away. In fact, there are multiple new variants that are more infectious, more deadly, and more resistant to current vaccinations. Across the globe, COVID cases are rising again and certain areas are being hit especially hard. [CTV news article re: India w/ it’s new double mutant variant](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/india-detects-double-mutant-coronavirus-variant-1.5360271), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/19/europe/coronavirus-europe-third-wave-intl/index.html) re: Europe dealing with a surge in cases, and [global news](https://globalnews.ca/news/7720211/brazil-record-cases-covid-19/) re: Brazil hitting record number COVID cases, to name a few. New COVID cases in the US remain pretty low, but between lax restriction and the rise of variant strains [as this nature article shows](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00564-4), we could be seeing another wave in the US as well.

How deadly are these new strains? Still much to be learned, but it’s looking like current vaccines leave a lot to be desired. [Here’s a study from the New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2100362), which studied viral neutralization of some new variants w/ our current vaccines (refer to Table 1). $PFE has decreased (in vitro) efficacy by 2x, 6.7x, <6.5x vs. B117, P1, 501YV2 variants. $MRNA vaccine has decreased efficacy by 1.8x, 4.5x, <8.6x

Google cases worldwide and you will see the # of new COVID cases/day have started to rise after hitting a trough in mid-Feb. Between COVID fatigue and places easing restrictions and the new variants mentioned above, COVID is here to stay and will be for years to come. [Here’s an article from nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00396-2), which talks about COVID being a endemic virus that we will be dealing with on a year to year basis. Unfortunately, the market is huge for #lenzilumab

**Partnerships**

1. Humanigen was the only micro cap company chosen for **Operation Warp Speed** (an initiative to facilitate and accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics) -> [Source](https://ir.humanigen.com/news/news-details/2020/Humanigen-Announces-Cooperative-Research-and-Development-Agreement-with-the-US-government-to-Develop-Lenzilumab-for-COVID-19/default.aspx). Humanigen in collaboration with BARDA to increase manufacturing capacity
2. License agreement with KPM Tech/Telcon RF Pharamceutical company for Lenzilumab production in South Korea and the Phillipines. \[[Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201103005167/en/Humanigen-Executes-Licensing-Agreement-for-Lenzilumab%E2%84%A2-in-COVID-19-with-KPM-TechTelcon-RF-Pharmaceutical-for-South-Korea-and-the-Philippines)\]
3. Partnership with Thermo Fisher to scale up manufacturing. \[[Source](https://www.fiercepharma.com/manufacturing/humanigen-thermo-fisher-reach-agreement-to-scale-up-manufacturing-monoclonal-antibody)\]
4. Partnership with Emergent Biosolutions for development and manufacturing. \[[Source](https://investors.emergentbiosolutions.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humanigen-and-emergent-biosolutions-announce-contract-0)\]
5. Partnership w/ Avid Bioservices for manufacturing agreement. \[[Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210203005204/en/Humanigen-and-Avid-Bioservices-Enter-Into-cGMP-Manufacturing-Agreement-for-COVID-19-Therapeutic-Candidate-Lenzilumab-in-Support-of-Potential-EUA-Filing)\]
6. Not a partnership, but $HGEN recently announced an $80million loan w/ Hercules Capital on Mar. 10 to support manufacturing and commercialization. Bullish move close to P3 data release imo. \[[Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210310005879/en/Humanigen-Announces-80-Million-Loan-Facility-from-Hercules-Capital)\]

**TL;DR - lots of partnerships and agreements in place for manufacturing if EUA approval granted**

**The Market**

Here’s a PDF PowerPoint of $HGEN corporate presentation: [Humanigen](https://ir.humanigen.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx). The whole presentation gives a great overview of the company and I recommend a look through, but skip to slide 18 and you can get a rough sense of the market potential. There are 3 sources of incomes:

1. Stockpiling – US and ex-US
2. US market
3. Outside the US market

US market: Conservative estimates from the company believes there will be 1,000,000+ hospitalizations in the US this year, with approximately 100,000 patients as a market for Lenzilumab treatment. At 10k per dose, an approximate 1bil of revenue is up for the taking

Outside the US market:

1. The market is there with cases numbers rising across the globe
2. Humanigen has been in discussion with ex-US governments already about production of lenzilumab (skip to 24:00 on the [Mar 16 fireside chat webcast](https://ir.humanigen.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx))

**Price forecasting:**

Conservative estimates from the company project 100k doses for the US alone in 2021 if given EUA approval. This gives approximate revenue of 1bil. This doesn’t include any non-US sales or stockpiling.

With positive phase 3 trial data, I see the price share easily shooting up to 50-60+. The next step would be applying for Emergency Use Approval, with acceptance likely if P3 study is successful. If granted, and going by the very conservative estimate of $1billion in revenue, I think $HGEN’s market cap will easily be $5bil+, giving it a PPS of roughly $100+.

**BONUS -> HIGH SHORT INTEREST**

$HGEN short interest has almost doubled from Feb 26->Mar 15!!!. Yahoo finance estimates a 26% short interest as of Mar 15 w/ a Short ratio of 4.12 given the stock’s low trading volume. With the recent drop in price the past couple days, I would not be surprised if this number was higher. TL;DR -> more fuel for the rocket ships

**BONUS BONUS – CAR-T implications and more**

Lenzilumab is a cytokine storm drug, not a COVID drug. It is also in a phase 1b/2 study (ZUMA-19) where it is paired w/ a CAR-T drug Yescarta (by $GILD) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory Large B-Cell lymphoma. Car-T therapy is basically genetically engineered T-cells that can target a specific protein, or cancer. The main issue with CAR-T therapy is that it has significant side effects via cytokine storm and neurologic toxicity. Early studies have already shown that Lenzilumab significantly reduces cytokine storm side effects in CAR-T and actually IMPROVES overall efficacy. The readout for this study is planned for this year and there is precedent for CAR-T FDA approval based on phase 2 studies. I don’t have the energy to go into detail so I will leave it at that, but this has HUGE long term possibilities and gives $HGEN significant long term value outside of COVID

\*\*Edit to expand on CAR-T a bit more: I don’t want to downplay this, I think it’s very promising and I’m very bullish on it, but I’m admittedly not as researched on the minutia and writing up covid stuff tired me out XD. There’s 3 main players in the Car-T space and Lenzilumab (which has the patent for preventing Cytokine storm and neurotoxicity related to T cell therapy) could be the missing piece to make this therapy safer. $GILD had dropped another anti-GM-CSF drug from $KNSA and decided to go ahead with just lenzilumab, as well.

Lenzilumab also is in a phase 2/3 study for preventing/treating acute GvHD and also CMML phase 2.

$HGEN also has ifabotuzumab, a drug for treating solid tumors, which is currently in phase 1

**TL;DR: Short term covid play w/ ++high upside (potential 5-10x ROI) and high short-interest w/ long term CAR-T potential.**

Imo, $HGEN is a very appealing short term, high risk phase 3 COVID trial play with extremely high reward. With successful P3 studies, I see the PPS skyrocketing to 60+ and w/ EUA to 100+ (5bil+ market cap) as a conservative estimate. With stockpiling and ex-USA partnerships, the PPS will soar past 100 and w/ CAR-T the potential is even greater. Of course, the downside is a failed trial and price plummets to around $6 I think. Given the stocks low float and low trading volume, it is very volatile and subject to easy price manipulation. It has dropped approx. 25% the past month down to $13.76 and is extremely appealing at this price range. There is downside, but the upside is much much greater.

mfwa9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfwa9n/arkx_holdings_early_thoughts/,ARKX Holdings Early Thoughts 🚀🛰🛸,99,46,2021-03-30 02:38:39,"ARKX Launches on March 30th, 2021 and the first 39 holdings have been unveiled today (Monday 29th).

At first glance many investors will be surprised and maybe even disappointed not to see more Pure Space companies. Let’s do some digging. 

From their [website:](https://ark-funds.com/arkx)

*Why invest in ARKX*

*Exposure to space exploration, including orbital and sub-orbital aerospace, enabling technologies, and beneficiaries of aerospace activities, such as agriculture, Internet access, global positioning system (GPS), construction, and imaging.*

*The Adviser defines “Space Exploration” as leading, enabling, or benefitting from technologically enabled products and/or services that occur beyond the surface of the Earth.*

**why big caps?** such as Amazon, Baba, Google and even Netflix? while one could argue that being big tech companies they would benefit from increased business activity due to a wider broadband coverage through future space constellations (such as Starlink or Space Mobile) it seems that these holdings could actually serve as “cash-like” for a potential future rotation into long-duration space companies. 

Cathie Wood has explained this process in a video that they sometimes treat FAANGS as cash-like instruments as they are less volatile (per the sub rules I can not link the video so you will have to search the keywords). 

The presence of US dollar as holding #26 could also be consistent with this idea (keeping cash and liquid lower beta stocks to deploy later when opportunities arise). 

Note also that Amazon and Baba would profit from an increased use of air drones for last mile delivery (which falls into one of the 4 themes of ARKX specifically Aerospace Beneficiary Companies).

**39 holdings so far but aims for 40 to 55**: that’s actually the first thing I’ve noticed. In the Fund Details they write that the typical # of holdings will be 40 to 55. So up to 17 more names could be added assuming USD could be liquidated at some point. 

**only 2 special pur-pose acqui-sition so far** namely Arch-er and Jo-by which are both very forward-looking air drones companies **and** trading very near their redemption price of $10. This last point seems to me to be the reason why only 2 specials are included so far. Companies like Momen-tus, Space Phones, Black Sky, 🚀 Lab, Astra, Spi-re, could still be in at some point whether before or after their respective business combinations. I believe the safety net of near NAV trading was prioritized given the current increased volatility and risks on growth names (moreover on space tech). 

**their own 3D Printing ETF** as holding #2. I guess why making it complicated when you can make it simple. ARK said 3D printing is one of the highest growth potential industries in the economy and is set to transform the manufacturing landscape. And it’s absolutely needed for space tech whether it’s printed on earth or beyond. Instead of going for individual names they went for their own ETF. Kind of smart and self-glorifying at the same time. 

**actual revenue vs future projections**: as value stocks and reopening trade control the narrative right now I also notice that their 36 top holdings (excluding USD) have current revenue and financial stability as opposed to negative FCF for the next few years to come (last 2 holdings). Again a sign of lowered risks taken given the current equities market. 

**TLDR**: while initially underwhelming ARKX composition could very well be increased and even reshuffled as market conditions normalize (and/or market crash). Doesn’t look like very spacey nor ultra innovative right now but it feels like Cathie Wood hasn’t shown her hand yet. 

Not a recommendation to buy, hold nor sell any securities. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 because it’s space + WSB."
mfuvgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfuvgh/canadian_lps_will_be_allowed_in_the_us_markets/,Canadian LPs WILL be allowed in the US markets *WHEN* MSOs are allowed to uplist. $APHA/TLRY 🚀🚀🚀,85,48,2021-03-30 01:36:34,"I **truly** don't understand how this concept is so difficult for most investors (""MSO gAnG"" in particular) to understand, but I'll make this nice and easy for you. 

Although the SAFE banking bill does **not** have specific language to allow MSOs to uplist, it *is* expected to happen. No one really expects to see ""pot stonks uplist allowed"" in the bill, it's more of an expectation with being allowed access to financial institutions. Cannabis investors on both sides would be appalled (investing in $ROPE) if uplisting wasn't allowed, so let's just assume it will be from here on out. 

 Currently the only thing stopping canadian LP's such as TilAphria or Canopy from purchasing MSOs is the threat of being delisted. That's *literally* it. If uplisting is allowed for MSOs, then LPs can own them and not be delisted. Simple concept, simple path into the US. 

There **is** a magical wall stopping LP's from sending their weed across the border, but **there is no magical wall stopping their money from purchasing portions or entire publicly listed companies.** 

Also, it would make next to no sense for LPs to purchase any of the ""big"" MSOs. Those companies have had to pay millions and millions to expand State by State and vertically integrate. It will make much more sense for LPs to purchase companies based on location and build them out to meet demand for the surrounding states, in the near future. Most likely southern States, since they can just wait on the northern border to open to their existing facilities. I say *mostly* because I expect some NY news from TilAphria shortly after uplisting for MSOs is a reality. Considering they set the TilAphria merger for 4/20, I'd imagine them announcing a merger that closes the day after the SAFE bill passes. They're cheeky like that, I like it.  

For example, Aphria owns Sweetwater. Sweetwater just so happens to own a 50m+ [distribution center in Indiana](https://www.wane.com/top-stories/sweetwater-unveils-new-52-5m-warehouse/) . I imagine one of their first purchases will be a MSO with large operations in Illinois to capture the current market there while waiting on Indiana to pull the red outta their ass. It wouldn't really benefit them much to pay a massive premium for someone like Trulieve who is a glorified SSO (Single State Operator) and doesn't really bring anything to the table for them. Trulieve just sells weed in a massive market. TilAphria can grow their own weed, they just want the market. Lol

Most MSOs are just being propped up by the **markets** they are in. Markets like Florida are massive, yet controlled by a handful of companies due to their laws. Same with PA, just a smaller market. Markets like California are bigger than entire countries. Regardless, the one thing that's definitely going to get bigger is the market size in US states as more people use and accept legal marijuana, and the one thing that's definitely going to get smaller is market share for companies who currently don't really have any competition yet. 

The hilarious part of this is: ""Trulievers"" still somehow see a path to continuing to be ""the most profitable"" company once they lose their monopoly on the 3rd most populous state in the US. Considering NY's clear signal **against** oligarchy type markets, I'd be very concerned as a Trulieve investor. Also, save the ""New York is just one State"" bullshit. Schumer is in the driver's seat for Marijuana reform and there's no reason to expect him to introduce a bill that doesn't resemble his States bill, and there's **no reason** to expect one that contradicts his State's bill. 

Also, while I'm shitting on Trulieve, I just want to mention that the **only** thing that could save them will be a national market. If they get State level legalization years before a national market, then they're **fucked.** They currently operate over 1 **million** square feet worth of grow space in Florida. That's easy to sell when you have 50% market share due to being 1 of 5 companies who control over 80% of the marijuana businesses in Florida. That's going to be a lot harder to do once there's **hundreds** of new growers and **hundreds/thousands** of new stores. Sure, booming demand from the switch from medical to legal should help, but it won't be long until they are a US version of an LP the last couple years. Just sitting on a big ol mountain of weed waiting on a bigger market to open. If they can keep up with quality in a highly competitive legal market, that is.  As I've said before, the numbers don't lie. Florida's medical marijuana market currently has a dispensary to 100k people ratio of 1.1, while legal marijuana states like Oregon have well over 10 to 100k ratio. 10x the current ratio, 10x the amount of competition on price, 10x the amount of competition on quality..etc. Trulieve will have a lot to prove in a legal market, and legalization isn't always amazing for everything weed related. 

Weedmaps for example: they're just a complicated google search. For online menus and traceability software, that's gonna be Dutchie. For strain info, that's Leafly. Weedmaps doesn't really bring anything to the table after Apple/Google stop blocking pot stores on their maps. 🤷 

Anyway, $APHA/$TLRY 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀, eventually."
mfsgf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfsgf7/transoceans_hedge_fund_historical_manipulation/,Transocean's Hedge Fund Historical Manipulation and What is in Progress,300,71,2021-03-29 23:48:00,"A couple of weeks ago I started to notice something suspicious for Transocean (RIG) in terms of spikes in certain options volume as well as spikes in volume in its bond pricing along with its bond swaps (Put Options for Bonds). As the weeks go by my suspicion came to fruition so I'd like to take this opportunity to share my observations with everyone and at the same time show a good example of a breakdown of how a typical hedge fund employs their shorting strategy against a traditional company, in this case Transocean (RIG).

I will do my best to dumb everything down since I know some of our audience are still eating crayons and sniffing glue.

**The Hedge Fund Play:**

In the middle of 2020, when oil was still trading relatively low, I noticed a large rise in volume of a series of Transocean Debt (Bonds) and also a spike in the volume of bond swaps which I assume was used by hedge funds to hedge their bets. At the same time, I noticed a steady and large rise in shorted Transocean stock, which means a hedge fund or hedge funds were hoping the company would go into bankruptcy like almost all of Transocean's peers in the industry. I know it was hedge funds because most institutional investment funds are not allowed to short due to how they are regulated.

Based on the volume movement and price action of trading of Transocean debt and its swaps, it looks like a hedge fund was primarily concentrated in a strategy of bankruptcy restructure arbitrage which means if Transocean does go into bankruptcy they can make more money in the bankruptcy restructure since Transocean's secondary offerings were at the time, traded well under their true book value (Sort of like Gordon Gekko with Blue Star Airlines in the movie Wallstreet). The problem with this was Transocean's extremely competent management choosing to put up a fight.

To take advantage of market conditions, Transocean hires Lazard Freres & Co. to help them restructure a good amount of their debt without going into bankruptcy which they did. As a result, a Hedge Fund called White Box Advisors (WBA) revealed itself and rallied a couple of other bond holders and took Transocean to court claiming that Transocean technically went into default when it proceeded with the debt restructure. Lazard backed up Transocean to reassure that Transocean did not go into default and everything Transocean did was legal and well within the requirements for its shareholders.

I was actually able to go over court transcripts and from the looks of it, it was primarily Transocean's lawyers arguing and going into details in court. WBA's lawyers were relatively quiet in comparison and from the outside, it is just too obvious that they didn't really have a real case. So this just looks like it was put on just for a show for the investors.

Over the next few months, numerous short ladder attacks were conducted on Transocean stock back up by coordinated continuous random spike in numerous bear articles focusing on the lawsuit and repetitive same bear information from a number of freelance writers primarily on Seeking Alpha and others doing everything they can to drive the price of Transocean's stocks down.

Keep in mind that whoever bought those bond swaps earlier essentially bought put options on Transocean's bonds. Most Bond prices do correlate well to the direction of its stock's prices, so whoever owned them was winning on the front of bearish investor sentiment with the lowest being October. Finally, market forces prevailed overlooking the BS and in December, the court officially ruled against WBA and then threw the case out of court. Astonishly the bearish articles on Seeking Alpha and other sites just suddenly disappeared as well which looked like the shorters exited their bear positions and stopped paying for the bear promotions.

In the months that followed, Transocean stock has consistently been going up just following its natural course since the company is doing so well and the price of oil has been going up as well. What a way to end 2020 and start 2021.

[RIG](https://preview.redd.it/eghbkjl3nzp61.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=e84565866abc86314337836e1206d4000161a934)

**Industry and Company Background:**

Without going into too much detail on who Transocean is and how they do business since most of that you can find that yourself on Google, but the abstract is Transocean is in the business of providing offshore oil drilling services for oil companies. Like most energy companies, they got hit pretty hard during the pandemic with oil falling to new lows due to Covid-19 lockdown measures and general overall fall in demand.

As a result, almost all of Transocean's direct competitors have filed for bankruptcy so Transocean remains the 800 pound gorilla with currently the largest, newest, and most efficient fleet to service the offshore oil drilling industry. But unlike their competitors, Transocean's territory exposure is global so they are not concentrated on only one geographic location (eg. Gulf coast) and most importantly RIG has a $7.8 Billion work backlog with a 75% penalty for any cancellations (none of their competitors are in the same position). What this means is that RIG has currently more work then they can handle if any of their oil clients were to cancel their contract, the client would have to pay Transocean the cash penalty of 75% of the project's value to Transocean. This is why even with very little new contracts in middle 2020, the company still had a steady revenue stream until more new contracts showed up and were added into their backlog later in the year.

Of course in early 2021 the demand for oil accelerated and Transocean is winning more new contracts around the world. Some analysts argue that some of the new contract day rates were lower as compared to before but if you look more closely at the trend of their day rates of the contracts, they are consistently rising over the past few months. So they probably gave some discounts in the initial recovery to build up their contract momentum which is expected and seems to be working.

With the up-trending price recovery of oil for the past months due to Biden's tough stance on American oil companies affecting supply, OPEC+ continuing tightening of supply, and a continuous rise in demand for oil due to economies reopening around the world results in continuous price increases with many high profile analysts even expecting $100 a barrel by the end of the year.

Out of that rise, offshore oil is still heavily demanded by oil companies. The reason for this is that offshore oil is extremely predictable as compared to other drilling methods when it comes to how much oil is in the well, the price to pull it out, and volumes on how much the company can consistently pull out. Like every major corporation, large oil corporations have to diversify their oil portfolios so that is why there will always be new contracts for offshore drilling of oil.

Compared to shale fracking which is what most oil companies employ in the US, offshore oil is significantly cheaper and less volatile in cost and is less affected by regulations since there are offshore wells around the world with the most increase in South America and Norway in the past couple of months. The biggest problem with offshore oil drilling is that offshore wells take years to develop, this is why oil companies were still signing new contracts with Transocean in 2020 when oil prices were relatively low since they know it would pay off in the long run and who knows what the price of oil will be when the well is operational in 1-3 years.

From a fundamental standpoint, Transocean is in a good position. It has enough cash to last years on top of their loan revolvers which they have not tapped. As per Yahoo finance, RIG's Book Value per share is $18.58 per share, well above the current stock price. Competitively, they are also in a great position as some of their competitors coming out of bankruptcy have low cash balances and lack of loan revolvers available to expand or develop their fleets.

The biggest problem with the competitors coming out of bankruptcy which Transocean highlighted in one of their recent earnings calls is that it scares the clients, since the clients will be signing contracts that would last years, they would prefer to work with companies that offer more reliability and stability, and as mentioned Transocean is the only one. RIG's management is second to none, they kept their shareholders' interests a priority and even refused to do a reverse split when their stock was under $1 and consistently focused on reducing their debt levels and to take advantage of market opportunities. New contracts are consistently flowing in, business is getting better and that is why RIG has been gradually going back up over the past couple of months and supported as well by the continuous rise of oil.

**Recently - New Play:**

A couple of weeks ago ago, I started to notice a steady climb in shorted shares and also spikes in volume of bond swaps as per my Bloomberg terminal. There were also large spikes of large batches of Put options contracts purchased at mid day (They didn't even try to hide it). At first I thought it was because of the price of oil going back down due to lockdown measures which part of it was but after building several models analyzing and comparing past oil price decline, the results didn't match up. When oil pricing started to go back last week due to the Suez Canal being blocked, it confirmed my theory as there was a rise in bear positions but it wasn't primarily because of the fall in oil prices.

My research did conclude that someone big was starting to short the stock again. And then late last week, I discovered that White Box Advisors just refiled their suit against Transocean again in Appeals Court claiming this time that the Judge who ruled against them ""used a legal standard that wasn't applicable."" Some legal and industry analysts have already examined the appeal and agree the appeal is BS. Could it be a coincidence that spiking short positions on Transocean and WBA's involvement conveniently looked like the appeal was announced after a hedge fund secured those bear positions and it worked because when the news came out Transocean stock started to go down again. What a play.

The goal of this post is to create awareness and showcase the manipulation by hedge funds. Time and time again hedge funds have employed the same strategies to try to beat good companies down for their own profit and there is no indication that their practice is pulling back. If the hedge fund who shorted Transocean is the same one from back in 2020 and attempts to use the same strategy to try to push Transocean stock down, we should start to see an uprising in bear articles against Transocean soon especially highlighting the appeal and different bear articles especially from Seeking Alpha repeating the same bear content from different third-tier writers since this as we know is in the hedgies arsenal even against GME and AMC stock.

This time around it is going to be harder for that hedge fund to do it on RIG for the simple fact that oil prices will start to go up since economies are opening around that world and systematic risk is now playing against them. Only time will tell what happens next, all I know is I can't wait to see the next official Short interest report for Transocean and perhaps a good bullish opportunity is in sights.

**EDIT: TLDR of TDLR:**

Huge near-term catalysts for $AMRS. Large deals getting announced this week. Stock going to the moon. **Buying the stock and April 16 calls is the play.**

**TLDR:**

Amyris ($AMRS) is a synthetic biotechnology company that engineers, manufactures, and sells sustainably created ingredients and products. $AMRS’s proprietary technology has a near-endless number of applications and a staggering total addressable market potentially in the trillions of dollars. After a decade of heavily investing in R&D to advance their platform, both the company’s technology and business model recently turned the corner, laying the foundation for incredible value creation over near and long-term horizons. ***Within the next three trading days,*** ***$AMRS will announce the completion of two strategic transactions worth more than $500 million, sending the stock to the fucking moon.*** This is a deep value play, but for all you short squeeze junkies, $AMRS does happen to have relatively significant short interest at 16% of the float. I expect that the jump in price from $AMRS’s upcoming transaction announcements to dump gasoline onto a raging fire, sending the shorts to an early grave while raining tendies from the sky for the longs

***The play – buying shares of the $AMRS stock or April 16 calls with strikes above $20***

**MY POSITIONS:**

I believe in this company over both long and short time horizons. See below for current positions.

[Positions](https://preview.redd.it/b7u4okrgfup61.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d13644c0e3bae68378c1e440dc6fdcaaf5f412e)

**BACKGROUND:**

I was a relatively early investor in $ENPH, and after the success of that investment (sub $2 share price in 2018, now trading above $150 a share), I was looking to invest in a company with a similarly checkered past with a catalyst to turn the corner quickly. As with $ENPH, the company needed to have invaluable technology with the potential for huge near-term gains to compensate for the risk. I couldn’t have been more elated discovering $AMRS, which checked all the boxes. $AMRS has performed well this year so far, but we are light-years away from the company’s potential both over the short and long term

**$AMRS BUSINESS:**

This business is complicated, but I’ll do my best to summarize some key points. Founded by a group of Berkley scientists, $AMRS is a synthetic biotechnology company that engineers, manufactures, and sells sustainably created ingredients and products into several markets, including Health & Wellness, Clean Beauty, and Flavor & Fragrance. Within Health & Wellness, $AMRS focuses on alternative sweeteners, vitamins, and food ingredients. In Flavor & Fragrance, $AMRS produces natural oils and aroma chemicals for a range of applications. In Clean Beauty, $AMRS focuses on clean skincare and cosmetic ingredients. For all you tree huggers, their production and products are totally sustainable, and by creating otherwise naturally occurring molecules in the lab, $AMRS saves the destruction of animals and other natural resources (as an example, they produce a skin-care molecule called squalene that otherwise requires killing sharks to get it)

$AMRS generates revenue from a combination of a partnership model and a wholly-owned direct model

In the partnership model, $AMRS creates a molecule/ingredient in the lab and scales it on a commercial level on behalf of a partner, who then uses the molecule/ingredient in one of its products, which the partner markets and sells to its own customers. $AMRS captures revenues from producing and selling the molecule/ingredient to the partner + $AMRS receives royalties from the partner’s product sales that contain the ingredient created by $AMRS. $AMRS has many commercial, industrial level partners including Firmenich, Givaudan, DSM, Yifan, the US Department of Energy, and DARPA. On the retail side, $AMRS has recently announced partnerships to create new brands such as [JVN](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-01-11-Amyris-Creates-Partnership-With-Jonathan-Van-Ness-To-Launch-Leading-Clean-Haircare-Brand) (Johnathan Van Ness clean haircare brand launching Summer 2021), [Rose Inc](https://investors.amyris.com/2020-10-30-Amyris-And-Rosie-Huntington-Whiteley-Announce-Creation-Of-New-Clean-Beauty-Brand-And-Business-Partnership) (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley high-end cosmetics brand launching 3Q 2021), and most recently, they announced a partnership with [Minerva](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-16-Amyris-Enters-Partnership-With-Minerva-Foods-For-Zero-Carbon-Protein-Production) (focusing on zero carbon protein production)

In the wholly-owned direct model, $AMRS sells its developed ingredients through brands that $AMRS currently owns, including [Biossance](https://biossance.com/) (high-end skincare), [Pipette](https://pipettebaby.com/) (skincare for babies), [Purecane](https://purecane.com/) (synthetic sugar similar to Splenda) as well as brands it has recently acquired, such as [Teresana](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-01-22-Amyris-Acquiring-Terasana-Brand-To-Offer-Clean-Cannabinoid-Consumer-Products) (sustainably sourced cannabinoids launching Q2 2021), and [Costa Brazil](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-01-Amyris-Acquiring-Costa-Brazil-Clean-Beauty-Brand-Francisco-Costa-To-Join-Amyris-As-Chief-Creative-Officer) (clean luxury skincare acquired in Q1 2021). Separately, the company has also recently [made headway using its technology in the production of RNA for use in MRNA vaccines](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-02-22-Amyris-Announces-Positive-Pre-Clinical-Results-For-COVID-19-RNA-Vaccine-Platform-With-Advantaged-Manufacturing-Storage-And-Distribution-Characteristics), though this is in its early stages

$AMRS’s consumer brands are distributed through many high-profile channels, including Amazon, Target, Walmart, and Sephora in addition to their own direct-to-consumer websites. **It is no surprise that they have demonstrated ridiculous revenue growth of 197% in 2020 alone**

**NOTABLE RECENT INVESTORS:**

No doubt, $AMRS’s progress has captured the attention of some incredibly famous investors, the most notable being the billionaire venture capitalist John Doerr, whose current portfolio of investments includes Alphabet/Google (where his investment is worth over $2.2 billion alone), DoorDash, Bloom Energy, Quantamscape, and of course, Amyris ($AMRS), where his investment is worth about $70,000,000. Doerr currently serves on the Board of Directors at Google and $AMRS and previously served on the board of Amazon

**SHORT INTEREST:**

As shown in the below ownership statistics, over 16% of $AMRS’s tradable float is sold short, which amounts to approximately 21.7 million shares as of 3/26/2021. With a 90-day average daily trading volume of just 4.9 million shares and just 2.3 million shares traded last Friday (3/26), I suspect that when the company delivers on its upcoming transactions this week, trading volumes will increase from intense buying. A rising share price will put tremendous pressure on short sellers to cover their positions, leading to a classic short squeeze and an increased pop in the stock

**UPCOMING TRANSACTION ANNOUNCEMENTS / NEAR-TERM CATALYSTS:**

Beginning last November, $AMRS began discussing a series of three upcoming strategic transactions that have truly changed the game for the company. Each transaction is different, but effectively involve the monetization of a molecule/ingredient whereby a partner pays $AMRS a significant upfront cash payment as well as licensing fees / royalties over a multi-year period. **The significance of these transactions cannot be understated as they provide cash to the business while creating recurring revenue streams. In effect, these deals allow $AMRS to self-fund its business without diluting existing investors from new equity offerings or extremely expensive debt. This is what the market has been craving**

The first of the three closed last December with a transaction value of just [$50 million](https://investors.amyris.com/2020-12-21-Amyris-Closes-50-Million-Strategic-Transaction) and the stock has flying ever since, gaining over 200% so far this year. **The remaining two transactions are set to close within the next three days with an expected total value of over $500 million for JUST ONE OF THE TWO TRANSACTIONS**

Here is the CEO on the 4Q 2020 earnings call dated March 3, 2021:

[4Q 2020 Earnings Transcript, dated March 2, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/w4mhtjjv6up61.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=0be49c2e03f7fb240f5b05c77cdc79574078d6ba)

The CEO re-affirmed that the transactions will close prior to the end of the first quarter several times thereafter, including an industry conferences on 3/4 (Cowen) and 3/15 (Roth) [as well as quietly in the last sentence of an unrelated press release on 3/25](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-25-Amyris-Delivers-Record-Production-Of-CBG-For-Consumer-Skincare-Formulations)

To those that would argue it is already priced in - you are wrong for several reasons. First, this company has almost no intuitional coverage and is paid very little attention relative to more established biotechnology companies. Said differently, the institutions that really set valuation and move the stock don't care enough yet to pay attention. But they will. $AMRS's investor base only continues to expand as more people wake up to it's incredible potential. Second, prior to the recent turnaround, the company overpromised a few times, just as companies that later mooned like $ENPH did. It happens, particularly with early stage companies. So even in the ""efficient market"" fantasy world, the company's public disclosures would have a credibility discount, leaving substantial upside for investors today when the company inevitably delivers

**CONCLUSION:**

These strategic transactions will announce by no later than Thursday morning (4/1), and $AMRS will be off to the fucking races. For some context, the suits at HC Wainwright and Roth Capital Partners currently have price targets of $33 and $35. I like the stock, and I think it is worth even more

I see some parallels between the smartphone revolution and the current ongoing connected vehicles revolution. There are mainly two approaches where software platforms can succeed. Either you go full vertical integration like Apple iOS/Tesla with an end-to-end consumer hardware+software product, or you go full horizontal integration as an outsider by unifying multiple hardware OEMs under the same software platform and rely on an alternative business model like Google Android+Google Mobile Services (and hopefully Blackberry QNX + IVY). 

Those that decide to go alone in an attempt to build a vertically integrated consumer product but could not quite reach the level of ""polished premium-ness"" to compete with the likes of Apple/Tesla will eventually die-off or join the horizontal integration group (see Nokia and Blackberry phones). 

The first-mover to start horizontal integration is likely to succeed if all its plans are well executed. The follower will have a much harder time competing with the first-mover even though it might have an equally-capable or even better platform (see Windows Phone).

IVY is currently a first-of-its-kind platform, so it has a major headstart. As soon as IVY's adoption reaches a critical mass, the network effect will take off and IVY will become the industry-standard vehicle data platform."

Go to about the 7 minute mark in [this interview of Alex Karp ](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-palantir-ceo-alex-karp/vi-BB19Aen1) where he mentions Apollo:

> We built this product which has gotten very little attention called Apollo. Apollo allows us to maintain and deliver software to any number of clients without essentially growing our Palantir force at all. So we're planning--now that we have Apollo--to grow the number of super cool customers all over the world, and we can do it all without raising headcount.

As he explains it, Apollo allows Palantir to:

> deliver the whole stack in 6 hour [...] We can do this with a small number of people, sitting in our one office that we have, maintaining, updating, and providing them with the product that we build. So they don't have the Frankenstein's monster that takes 2 years to build, and has to be maintained with either human hours--like in gov contract case--or by purchasing new product, or compensating sales people or hiring new IT people that you don't even like talking to. You can actually buy one stack. 

And the last thing he mentions in the interview is a question regarding what happens if the world's internet splits apart into separate jurisdictions due to de-globalization: 

> The architecture we built - both for PG and Foundry - will allow a superset to work with a subset. Which means if the world splinters and every country has its jurisdictions, it's gonna be very hard for normal software companies because they're not built to do that. But it's going to be very good for Palantir.

#Apollo

So just what *is* Apollo? For one - [Apollo: Explained](https://medium.com/palantir/palantir-apollo-powering-saas-where-no-saas-has-gone-before-7be3e565c379). The concept is actually pretty simple - here's the dumbed down version:

Most enterprise SaaS companies run on the public cloud and use a single cloud provider. 

Palantir software must run on a multitude of different clouds, including purpose-built government or classified clouds separate from standard public cloud, due to the need of their contracts. 

Apollo allows Palantir to deploy Foundry seamlessly regardless of the type of cloud the end user's data operates on. In other words, Apollo allows Palantir to deploy Foundry onto AWS, Azure, Google, or more unique clouds like CIA Cloud without needing to write individualized code for those deployments. 

Coupled with Palantir's familiarity with working on different unique end-user environments (which they had to do for the army with Gotham), they are essentially running a multi-cloud SaaS instead of a single-cloud SaaS.

As different countries start passing their own regulations on the internet--privacy, data sharing, etc., this will force SaaS companies serving different customers to adapt. 

Meanwhile, Palantir has already prepared for this inevitable outcome by developing Apollo: the continuous delivery system that enables multi-cloud SaaS on whatever cloud infrastructure available to them--public or private. 

**Remember:** Palantir's entire service is helping customers pull their data quickly and effortlessly. 

Boomer companies that acquired hot startups and need to integrate that data will most likely be operating on a multi-cloud environment. Same is true for a US-based internet company operating across the world where privacy and data collection laws may be more stringent.   

----

#Implications

In the Apollo article, it ends with:

>  We run our software in a homogenous way across heterogeneous environments, powered by Apollo. Apollo is the platform that makes it possible to bring a unified SaaS to our entire customer base.

Now pair that up with what Karp said at the end of his interview:

> The architecture we built - both for PG and Foundry - will allow a superset to work with a subset. Which means if the world splinters and every country has its jurisdictions, it's gonna be very hard for normal software companies because they're not built to do that. But it's going to be very good for Palantir. 

The world is slowly but surely headed towards different internet blocs, with the EU enacting more stringent data protection laws, China with its Great Firewall, India using the power of periodic internet shutdowns and the push to develop more indigenous software talent, and Russia periodically talking about shutting itself off from the rest of the internet. 

This means multinational firms will eventually be forced to separate out their data in Europe, Japan, and the US. For companies that have already transitioned to the cloud, critical code could be held in entirely different countries and subjected to entirely different sharing laws. 

Palantir's software allows a viewer to *look* at only the pertinent part of the code through Foundry's prioritization of intent as part of its privacy features. But more importantly, Palantir can continue to deliver Foundry even as the laws continuously change and get refined. 

Furthermore, Apollo is also going to drastically cut back on the number of people that Palantir will need to hire to maintain their code. This further cuts down on the biggest cost - employee stock compensation - and allows Palantir to really start growing its profit margins even further on super sticky clients who continues coming back for more.

Stock is Scorpio Tankers $STNG. It  has been all over the place for the last year, but is finally catching  its bid due to a real fundamental shift in the market for clean product  tankers and it has a pretty sizable short interest that will need to be  covered over the next week....

For  some brief background: Scorpio owns a bunch of super huge ships (like  the size of the eiffel tower and shit) that only transport clean refined  products (gasoline, diesel, etc) and other specialty oils and chemicals  (like palm oil, old bacon grease for bio-diesel, etc). Now, since it  got cold AF up in TX a few weeks back, US refineries have been offline  and we have been importing a bunch of gasoline, diesel, etc from Europe  (if you noticed how expensive gas is everywhere... there ya go). The  catch? The damage to refineries from busted pipes and downed power  sources was WAY WORSE than anyone expected and instead of a bump in the  road, we have a situation that is actually worse then Katrina in terms  of refined product availability. The result? We are puling a shit-ton of  fuel from Europe (where they were drowning in it) to the point that  they have now drained the Middle East, who is now draining Asia.  Needless to say... its crazy. Not headline news because... you know, its  the news, but if you start digging through reliable energy resources,  you can see how bad the situation really is (just a note, they still  havent got the refineries back online). To make the situation a bit  worse, the world is opening up faster than anyone expected and we are  using a shit load of refined products (everything from gasoline to  plastic) and its creating massive strain on the refining sector.

Speaking  of the refining sector, lets pause there for a sec. Due to how bad the  decline in demand for refined products was last year, OECD countries  decided to convert \~4Mbpd of refining capacity into import terminals  because it was cheaper to ship finished gasoline and diesel into most  countries than to bother with importing crude and refining it at home.  Australia was probably the best example, but it happened across the  globe in Europe, US, Japan, etc.

The  result? Everyone is now scrambling to try to import gasoline, diesel,  heating oil, and other refined products all over the world. Similar to  how these industries completely kill themselves for a decade by everyone  across the globe building capacity at the same time and oversupplying  the market; COVID caused this to happen in reverse! So, while the entire  refining landscape shifts over the next few years/decades, the  incredibly lucky winners will be the guys that happen to own the ships  that transport refined products all over the world. Enter Tankers.

Now  not all tankers are equal. First, there are crude tankers and product  tankers. As their name suggests, crude tankers carry crude oil and  product tankers carry refined products. They never cross paths, they are  completely their own markets. Ignoring the more complicated issue of  what will happen with crude tankers, lets take the more obvious play of  product tankers. With the current market going crazy due to the global  inventory imbalances due to the US refinery issues from the TX freeze,  product tankers are getting bid up as traders and oil majors are  desperate to get gasoline, jet, diesel, etc from Asia to the Western  Hemisphere... rates are surging and wont stop anytime soon. Add in the  rolling conversions of refinery capacity to import terminals and  biofhuel mixing operaitons, and you have a set-up that is just so wall  timed and placed for this specific sector, it feels honestly dirty to be  benefiting from the terrible shit that the folks in TX had to endure  with the freeze.

Finally for the  supply side. Product tanker owners - and tanker owners in general - have  stopped ordering new vessels over the past 5 years for a few reasons:  1) rates have sucked and it doesnt make sense, 2) banks have been burned  a few too many times and financing has dried up, 3) their regulator  has promised a set of carbon-related regulations that will drive  the decision for the next-gen of propusion technology, but they havent  delivered the regs and the propulsion technology is changing just about  daily so no one is ordering, and 4) the shipyards got crushed in COVID  and consolidated operations, followed by an insane rate boom in dry buly  and containers that subsequently took up shipyard capacity for the  forseeable future, you couldn't add a meaningful amount of capacity to  the product tanker market even if you cleared hurdles 1-3 due to  capacity. A small nuance: product tankers differ from crude tankers  primarily due tot he coating on their tanks that protects the more  volatile refined products from degradation during transport (pretty  important if you consider things like jet fuel); now those coatings  deteriorate over time and are deemed unreliable at \~15yrs. So whether or  not an owner decides to ""scrap"" his ship, nobody is gonna give him/her  any business for the traditional/premium product trade. A bit of  history: the product tanker trade really emerged in the late 1990s and  early 2000s, with a huge building boom taking place in that period as we  as a society began to trade refined products more heavily and  understand the importance of quality control in a more scientific  manner. Now, in 2020, we are seeing a huge portion of the existing fleet  ""age-out"".

Very long story short; The world will need a lot more product tankers in the near-term, and today, they just aren't there.

Now, Finally, why this is important in the context of a short squeeze in the near future.

The  largest operator of product tankers in the world is Scorpio Tankers  (NYSD: STNG). They have proven themselves strong operators and also have  (to a meaningful extent) created a consolidated position the LR2  segment where they are the largest single owner and also manage a huge  fleet of other owners' ships in what is called a pool. LR2s are the  largest product tankers, and given the market dynamics I described  above, they are in very high demand. Rates are rising quickly and dont  seem to have a good reason to stop. To make matters a bit more  interesting, Scorpio has a rather large debt load, making it the target  of short sellers. It is currently the most shorted tanker stock despite  having the youngest fleet with deepest scrubber penetration (discussed  below). After months of being pounded in 2020, the stock is finally  ripping upwards, and with the earnings potential of its fleet it should  easily double or triple on sheer fundamentals. Now, enter a few fun  freebees that make this fun: a related party to the Company, Scorpio  Services Holdings (or something), which is owned by management is  purchasing millions of dollars of stock roughly every 6 wks, along with  Scorpio's President, Robert Bugnee, who along with personal stock  purchases has purchased millions of dollars worth of out of the money  call options expiring from here to 2023. To put it lightly, they have  backed up the truck. The Board has also approved a $250M share buyback  program (market cap is \~$1B) and at Bugbees prior shipping venture he  bought back \~30% of all outstanding stock before selling the company at  the market peak for an absurd return to shareholders.

My final points on the company are on its fleet:

1. Scorpio  has the largest fleet of Long-Range (LR) vessels in the world: With the  closure of OECD refineries and global refining capacity shifting to  China, India, and the Middle East, voyage distances will increase  significantly making demand for LRs even stronger.
2. Scorpio  has the youngest fleet (Period): With the importance of e.s.g. and  customers need to track carbon output, combined with EEXI regulations  (google) from IMO and the EUs decision to add shipping into the carbon  cap-and-trade market, yonger/e.c.o. tonnage will dominate the tanker market  going forward. Over the past months, large charterers such as Trafigura  have instituted CO2 tracking and reporting policies that create a  pricing premium for ECO vessels like Scorpios. Also, Scorpio has already  begun to see revenues from generating carbon credits during Q4'20 due  to its ECO fleet; if Tesla has taught us anything: those can be  valuable.
3. Scrubbers:  Scorpio has been the most aggressive product tanker owner in installing  (expensive) exhaust scrubbers to reduce SOx emissions. This also allows  them to burn traditional bunker fuels rather than the new ""Very Low  Sulfer Fuel Oil"" or V.L.S.F.O., which has caused its competitors incredible  headaches. 1) V.L.S.F.O. is a new fuel and has not been delivered in with  consistent make-ups (they started experimenting with mixing jet fuel  into the blend when nobody was flying) which has caused extensive and  severe mechanical issues and engine failures. Additionally, the pricing  difference between V.L.S.F.O. and the fuel Scorpio is able to use in  combination with its scrubbers has been rapidly increasing and expected  to remain elevated, providing a SIGNIFICANT cost advantage to Scorpio.
4. Management  has used a lot of debt to build and support this incredible fleet, and  they have managed their balance sheet about as well as could be dreamed.  They have been able to maintain strong liquidity and continue to  refinance/roll their secured debt and push out maturities. They also  have avoided any real restrictive covenants, allowing them to return  cash to shareholders despite what seems like a hefty debt load. Note,  this is part of investing in cyclical industrial businesses... they  require capital, but when they hit the cycle right the cash flows are  unbelievable.
5. Finally,  the short squeeze. Scorpio has been heavily shorted for over a year due  to its debt load and a general pessimistic view on global oil  consumption (recall that even if consumption remained depressed,  refinery closures would create significant demand for product tankers  beyond current capacity). The market has finally turned - aided by the  freeze in TX - and the shorts have begun to cover, but there remains  over 2 days of volume sold short and with the brutal price action over  the past year along with managements large purchases, there could be a  real group of diamond hands that can create a real squeeze next week as  the remaining shorts look to cover.

This is both a trade and an investment. The squeeze could happen over the  next week or two; the signal form the underlying rates market along  with the strong price action will have the shorts looking to exit, its  just a matter of who will be selling (not me)? In the longer term, this  will be a multi-year cycle with multi-bagger potential for those who are  strong enough to just hold..

Current analysis is that BlackBerry is starting to rise in value ""on the street."" And NOT just WallStreetBets... Here's some of the more interesting reasons why I think BB is sorely undervalued...

First let's take a look quickly at what BlackBerry IS NOT...

&#x200B;

\* They are not a cat! (sorry DFV)

\* They are NOT a ""phone company.""

\* They are NOT, however, totally ""out of the phone business."" As early as June 2018, BB had made some interesting BlackBerry Key 2 phones for the international markets, and the Evolve and Evolve X had been licensed for the market in India by Optiemus Infracom.

&#x200B;

This last point is MOST interesting. Here's why...

&#x200B;

Though BB had sold most of their phone patents to Huawei, their licensee Optiemus Infracom (founded in 1993, I might add) seems to be a VERY strong player in the Indian market. Though the phone systems have seemingly been abandoned, or sold, by BlackBerry, there's ONE bit of VERY important news that isn't getting through:

""As of 2019, BlackBerry Limited stated that only technical support will be offered for the Indonesian devices built by the company. Additionally, the operational status of Optiemus is unknown as of September 2020, as there have not been updates posted from them in regards to BlackBerry in India since 2018.""

This last bit of information is MOST interesting! Did BB decide to intentionally hide this bit of info from the rest of the investing world? Did they think that their PR machine needed to NOT mention this fact to investors and shareholders? COULD BB at some point surprise the market with a new brand of phone?

&#x200B;

Okay, so India... It's a country on the ""other side of the world,"" why should we care?

&#x200B;

It is the second-most populous country, the seventh-largest country by land area, and the most populous democracy in the world. Cool geographic facts, but HOW BIG IS THIS MARKET? With a fifth of the world's population, it's current population is 1,389,308,662 as of March 10, 2021... Not much to really explain at length here...

Though BB DID ""officially"" declare as of September 28, 2016, it would cease designing its own phones in favor of licensing to partners. TCL Communication became the global licensee of the brand, under the name ""BlackBerry Mobile.""

&#x200B;

Now, what does this have to do with the ""validity"" of BB? This last bit of interesting info makes for a rather brow-raising piece of info:

A few weeks prior to the expiration of TCL Corporation's global license expiration for the BlackBerry brand, it was announced that Texas start-up OnwardMobility has acquired a license to make 5G devices for the brand beginning in 2021. Unlike for the partnership with TCL, OnwardMobility will be making the devices for the enterprise market, with manufacturing partner FIH Mobile.

Looks like BB is still involved in the overseas market. You can see just how far this company has reached!!

&#x200B;

Enough about the phones and speculation for the future of another BB phone, let's talk about the more recent events (besides WSB ""liking the stock"") for a minute...

BlackBerry has been in the healthcare market for some time...

In December 2014, BlackBerry and NantHealth, a healthcare-focused data provider, launched a secure cancer genome browser, giving doctors the ability to access patients' genetic data on the BlackBerry Passport smartphone!

Sheesh, I didn't know that!

Here's something interesting from the company's own website that caught my eye:

""38,000+ patents

18 major development centers in 7 countries

I wonder how many patents were sold off to Huawei.

&#x200B;

NINETY...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

You gotta be %$%&# kidding me?!?!? Out of 30 THOUSAND patents, only 90 were sold?!??

I'll let you ponder that point for a minute...

&#x200B;

So, we all know about BB's involvement in other countries, but what about here at home?

But wait, what about those other 30 something thousand patents, what are those?

Well, according to a Reuters article from January 12th of this year, those are:

""which include cybersecurity and building computer operating systems for cars.""

CARS... So BlackBerry COULD find itself on the cutting edge of EV and Self driving car technology!

&#x200B;

Now, I would be amiss if I didn't address ALL sides of this statement, and this is the BIG one for me, though not a total failure. Read on...

Articles from 2014 and 2016 point to Ford Motors using BlackBerry's QNX operating system in the new version of its Sync in-car communication and entertainment system, instead of Microsoft Corp.’s (MSFT) Windows, which it uses currently. One might wonder WHY the Microsoft system was steadily being abandoned by Ford...

Ha ha! Windows jokes abound I'm sure in this one, but quite simply put, the shift is being induced by numerous reported malfunctions in Ford’s current technology systems and touch screens.

So what happened this year? Ford decided to go with Android for it's future in car technologies. It's a Route One financial observer (affiliated with Cnet) noted, with automakers continuing to follow in Ford's footsteps, most notable with Volvo and it's cousin division Polestar.

Two things make this not TOTALLY bad news for BB, though this bit definitely affected BB price shares through most of the month of February (the news broke Feb 1st):

One, Ford didn't entirely detail what will make the partnership ""unique"" for drivers, but what will come to its cars in two years will be transformative.

Two, and most importantly, BB isn't TOTALLY out of the equation for Ford cars, since ""the Android software will also provide access to third-party developers who want a shot at creating apps specifically for the car. The automaker thinks it'll be what drivers increasingly want in the future: more customization and personalization in the car.""

So in a nutshell, BB COULD, theoretically, come up with apps designed to run off of the Android software that's going to be in these cars. It's funny how vague and murky the press release from Ford was without giving specifics to exactly HOW transformative this will be...

READ BETWEEN THE LINES....

&#x200B;

Finally, a few other noteworthy items this year to pay attention to...

As of June 2020, ""its QNX software is now embedded in more than 175 million cars on the road today."" That's a LOT of cars that will still be on the road for some time to come. In fact, if those are NEWER cars, those systems will probably still receive maintenance and updates/upgrades. (As opposed to, say, cars from 2000 - 2010.)

What sorts of cars are these systems in? That same article references... ""Automakers and Tier 1s use BlackBerry® QNX® software in their advanced driver assistance, digital instrument clusters, connectivity modules, handsfree, and infotainment systems that appear in car brands, including Audi, BMW, Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, KIA, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Toyota, and Volkswagen.""

&#x200B;

Shit, we haven't talked about cyber security or software!!! Cars, cars, cars! Yes, EV and self driving cars ARE THE FUTURE, even if it is still 2, 5 or 10 years down the road...

One thing I've noticed; once companies get government contracts, unless they royally screw it up, they're usually around for good, and stock prices seem to reflect that. With the newest Microsoft cyber security threat, you can be damn sure that Cyber security companies will get their ""day in the sun."" This March 9th article is MOST compelling, and a reason why BB is setting itself up for the future...

""BlackBerry Limited today announced new technology advancements to BlackBerry AtHoc that will improve how U.S. Federal agencies communicate and collaborate during times of crisis, and reduce the risk of unauthorized access to Federal data, systems and applications.""

This is freakin' HUGE... ""BlackBerry AtHoc is trusted by government, military, commercial and humanitarian organizations around the world including over 70% of U.S. Federal Government employees."" This comes from BB's own website, and you gotta like the numbers... :)

&#x200B;

March brought a number of other announcements as well, which makes me think the prices of BB, though rising at this particular point in time, aren't rising high enough. From the March 8th article stating ""BlackBerry Limited announced that it has teamed up with Desay S.V. Automotive to launch a dual-screen virtual smart cabin domain controller to enable safer driving. Leveraging the QNX Hypervisor and the QNX Real-time Operating System (RTOS), the new technology is now available in leading Chinese automaker Chery’s Tiggo 8 Plus and Jetour X90 models.""

to the March 15th article about introducing Next-Gen critical event management for the commercial sector, it appears readily obvious that BlackBerry isn't resting on it's laurels.

Add to that third quarter fiscal 2021 total Company non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, a high standard of measuring companies' financials here in the U.S.) revenue of $224 million, $757 million of cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments at November 30, 2020, AND having 19th consecutive quarter of positive non-GAAP operating income, and you see a company that has effective money management.

&#x200B;

However, all that being said, BlackBerry currently has a Return On Equity of 21.22 percent, which is somewhat high in the index, but when compared to companies like Microsoft (42.7%), Google (19%) and Amazon (27.44%), sounds like it should be even MORE of a bargain. Let me say, though that I'm not 100% sold on using ROE as a sole indicator of a stock's value...

All in all I love the stock and believe in this company's future... Thanks for sitting with me through my first ever attempt at providing due diligence on a company... It was rather fun to dive into this company's history and outlook for the future.

Trulieve's success is literally a house of cards, and I personally will enjoy watching it fall. Florida is one of the most restricted and monopolized cannabis markets in the US. Over 80% of the market is controlled by 5 companies, including Trulieve. This kind of market is exactly what our politicians pushing reform **DO NOT** want. This is not my opinion. This is easily concluded with ""social justice"" and ""social equity"" being at the forefront of legalization. It is the politicians intent to offer opportunities to minorities and communities hurt by marijuana prohibition and tax the fuck out of them on the back end. I think it's more likely these opportunities come on the retail side, not the production side. 

Trulieve has over 70 stores across Florida, and they are all vertically integrated. I know you already know what that means, but just in case: they sell their our products, and *only* their own products. It's a great business model of course, but it's all going to come crashing down for them and MSOs like them. Let's think about what a legal market does to a company like Trulieve.. 

As of a 2020 study, Florida had 1.1 dispensaries per 100k persons. States like Oregon with legal marijuana, or Oklahoma with a relaxed medical program each have over 15 dispensaries to every 100k persons. Considering Florida is the 3rd most populated state, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect similar ratios for dispensaries per 100k, if not higher. This would mean 15x more competition at least, literally. Even 30% less dispensaries per 100k than an average ""open"" market  would be 10 to 1, or 10x more competition. What's the bull thesis for Trulieve holding 50%+ market share in an open market like they do now in a monopolized market? Lol..

Also, as I've said before, they are currently vertically integrated and sell their own products **exclusively.** This will not last for many different reasons. So, they will see massive amounts of new stores opening around them, as well as having to stock their shelves *for the first time* with other brands. They will be losing daily customers in **droves**, and even the customers they do get in the door will be buying other products *not made by Trulieve*, which is going to hurt their margins and the bottom line. Hard. Then they will start to see an excess of marijuana as they struggle to distribute their over 1m sqft of grow space. If they lose even just 30% of their shelf space to competition (LOW estimate), they would lose 30% of shelf space across ever location they own. That's going to add up and *stockpile* quickly. 

This is where a genius thinks ""they will just sell their product into other stores!"" Okay. You're right there, but only to a certain degree. First off, I don't see companies who maintained a monopoly being welcomed warmly into a legal market. It's pretty easy to conclude more people will approach Trulieve with a grudge rather than a chubbie. Also, how many Trulievers will there be when *hundreds* of new brands are introduced? 


Meanwhile APHA is already selling ""weed beer"" to 23 States and all Delta Airlines Flights, hosts the largest 420 festival in Atlanta, AND busy tackling a global cannabis market while they wait for the US to open. Literally building a monopoly in the EU. Obviously the US is the crown jewel, but even Curaleaf's CEO sees more opportunities in Europe than the US in the coming years. So while Trulieve spends millions on stores in a single state, APHA is spending millions building a global cannabis conglomerate. These two stocks are not built the same. 

By the way to be clear, I think LPs like APHA/TLRY, CRON, CGC, and even OG-I are in a better position than MSOs like TRU, High tide, and any other retail heavy or monopoly focused companies. 

It's the MSOs ready for the Next Green Wave (<----) who have 2 year supply agreements with the largest brands in cannabis (Cookies) in the largest markets (California) and MSOs with proven success as CPG businesses in crowded markets (FFNT) who should be getting more attention. Not companies who **suffer** from legalization like TRU and SSPK. Weedmaps is just a complicated google search. Lol stores will operate their own online websites with online menus and not pay a commission to weedmaps 🤷.

I'm not an expert or anything, but I feel like people are saying they are investing in upcoming change, but make decisions based on the market now. The market you're investing for and the market that exists have very little in common, generally.

I’m sick and tired of hearing the narrative passed around:

 “Hurr durr Nokia Float too big- Nokia never move”

Here are some fun facts as of writing this post:

1) Regardless of how “large the float is”, Nokia’s market cap right now is ~24 billion and is trading at $4.30/share. 

2) Guess what hot company everyone has loved FOMOing into for the last 3 months? GME. Do you retards want to know what the market cap is for GME right now? ~25 billion while trading at $250/share. 

Quite literally the only thing required for Nokia to move at the same rate as GME is for buyers to buy ~58 shares of Nokia for every one share you’d have bought of GME. You’d have spent literally the same amount on your investment with either choice. 

Not only that, but as you’d have more shares amassed in quantity, when Nokia’s value is recognized and it booms, you’ll be able to make even MORE cash by selling covered calls against your shares. 

If you wanted even more leverage, because I know you retards do, you could buy LEAPs now, and sell calls against them either now or in the future after the leaps have appreciated massively in value. 

And, make no mistake, Nokia is set to boom. They just announced major deals today with the biggest tech companies in the world- Amazon, Microsoft, Google. That’s not even mentioning the non-stop contracts they’ve won globally the last few months- major contracts. The investing community is ignoring this diamond in the rough, but those that get in now on the ground floor are the ones that are going to see significant returns. 

Do your own DD. Make your own decisions. But...

For fucks sake, inform yourselves on what it takes to move a companies shares price. All Nokia needs is buying volume and a willingness for investors to recognize the value staring them in the face. 

I recommend both shares and LEAPs as the plays here. 

I’m holding 250 1/21/22 10c

So here's my part to hedging and why YOLO might be fun but a little bit more care when investing can help you to buy the dip and profit greatly!

## Why Hedge?
It's always tempting to go all in on one very promising bet to take the most profits possible with the available bankroll. Always hitting the perfect timing for entry and exit consistantly is impossible, period. And it's even more complex than buying at the lowest point and selling the peak.


Aknowledging this fact is vital to understand why hedging does not only reduce the risk to the portfolio but in the long run leads to a higher return on investment.

This guide uses $100k as a baseline not because that's what everyone has, it just makes the math a little easier to read.

For convenience I'll use a price of $100 per share of your favorite stock.

## Imagine this scenario!
Your favorite stock has been doing well so far. Excluding events such as GME recently with factor x2 swings within a week or two minutes of trading, such as last wednesday, are more of an exception. But let's say it's been doing exceptionally good with +20% in a brief period of time. 

If one has put 100% of its portfolio, $100k -> 1000 shares, into that stock the total value of this portfolio would now be $120k.


And now a market correction hits, pushing the price down 30%.

Some quick math (100%-30%) * $120k = $84k puts the portfolio value down -$16k in total.


Hedging in general would have cussioned that a lot. Let's use 20% of the portfolio for hedging and the 80% (800 shares) for your favorite stock.

The runup: $20k+(80%*$120k) = $116k

The dip (after rebalancing, discussed later): (80% * 116k *(100%-30%)) + (20% * 116k) = ~$88k, a dip of -$12k.


The hedging decreased the profits from +$20k to -$16k and the dip from -$16k to -$12k.

But that ""rebalancing"" is key here and makes all the difference.


## Rebalancing
If your strategy is to use 20% of your portfolio for hedging those 20% might represent different dollar amounts with time. After that runup from $100 per share to $120 the value of the hedged portfolio was $116k.

Initially $20k were used to hedge, now those $20k represent only 17.2% of the $116k. To get to 20% again some shares need to be sold in order to rebalance the hedge to $23k.

Stocks after the runup: 80%*$116k/$120 -> ~773 shares (27 sold, started at 800)


But the same goes for the dip. Now those $23.2k represent 26% of the portfolio so you'll have to buy the dip to get it down to 20% again. So to rebalance you'll ""have to"" buy shares for $3.2k. 

Total stocks after the dip rebalancing: $3.2k / $85 = 38 shares (811 shares in total)


Since you're bullish on that stock you and I both assume the price will bounce back. But this time you'll have more shares than before, giving you an edge over the plain YOLO.


Briefly:

### Whenever the stock goes up, this strategy takes some profits without ever exiting the position.
### Whenever the stock drops, this strategy buys the dip but never goes all in

## When to rebalance
That's not easy to answer. If you're asking r/investing folks monthly is more than enough but we're not investing in super stable low volatile ETFs here.

My rule of thumb is to rebalance when the planned allocation exceeds 10%. Want to use 20% for hedging? If your hedge goes below 18% or above 22% a rebalance could make sense. Since we're on WSB here people might hit 10% swings every single day and that's WAY too often.


So rebalancing maximum once per week and only if the allocation is off by 20% (so 16% or 24% with a 20% hedge) could be a sensible strategy.

But you'll have to see what works for you. Rebalancing too often means paying the spread every time for both the hedge and the bet and that adds up.


## What can be used to hedge?
There are a lot of ways to hedge but as a rule of thumb everything which is pretty stable can be used. Low volatility, tried and tested in the last few corrections and recessions.

You should, however, still be able to quickly liquidate your hedge. This puts most if not all physical hedges out of the question.

### Options

Options are the most powerfull hedge but are a lot more complex and won't be covered in depth here. It also throws off the math above a bit but can be used very effectively. 

Books have been written about using options to hedge and a short summary would probably confuse more than help. I _highly_ reccommend reading ""The Greeks and Hedging Explained"" by P. Leoni for that.


Very, very briefly and basic: You can use a PUT, preferrably a bit OTM (10% is common), to hedge your massive bullish position. Worst Case you'll lose 10% plus your premium which can vary wildly (Don't do this on GME. Just don't it's way to expensive).

### Currency
This is the easiest hedge. Just leave some cash in your trading account without it being allocated in some stocks.

### Precious Metals
Precious metals like gold and silver won't yield much returns if any but they usually go up when the stock market goes down. This will help you have the cash on hand you need to buy the dip.

I don't reccommend buying physical metals as a hedge since the spread is massive, taxes are much more complicated and finding a buyer can take some time.

There are some theories on several funds not allocating 100% of the metal in vaults so if you're afraid of that Sprott not just promises to have that metal, they check regularly and prove it. Symbols are PHYS for gold and PSLV for silver.
### SPACs (No, really!)
SPACs are very interesting! They have a hard floor at $10 per unit (units contain a share and a fraction of a warrant) because they are required to have that amount of cash per unit issued at hand.

That's not just a pinky promise, those funds are monitored. They have two years to akquire a company or they get dissolved, distributing the funds or $10 to every shareholder, whichever is higher.


So why SPACs? Those funds yield some interest and if they do find a company to akquire the stock price may go up a lot. 50%-100% are not uncommon and using them as a hedge is almost riskless.


What to look out for / type into google: Near NAV SPACs.

### Stocks or stock based ETFs (not very good)
You _can_ use less volatile stocks or ETFs as a hedge but when the entire market goes down they will go down, too.

So if you want to hedge against a market-wide correction they might be the wrong hedge.

If you really don't want to miss out on general market growth and only want to hedge against a correction on your favorite stock but not the entire market, say right before earnings, stocks may be useful.

I really don't like stocks as a hedge but if you really want to, some infrastructure / telecommunication companies (Not NOK or BB, they are too volatile due to WSB publicity) could be stocks to use here.

### Inverse Funds
Thanks to u/A_KY_gardener for brining these to my attention! Inverse funds don't exist for every stock or index but they can be used as a hedge on these, too. 

Basically whenever whatever they invert goes up, they go down and vice versa. 


They are a bit awkward to use since they're inherently as volatile as their underlying stock/index, but whenever the entire market goes deep into the red they're going to shine bright and green, offering some tendies to buy the dip.



There is one boring reason you can use them, depending on your local tax law, and that's to create losses on paper. If you bet both long on a stock or index and the same amount into these inverse funds then one of them will be up roughly whatever the other leg is down. If you realize the losses in the end of december then you'll have realized losses but unrealized gains going into the new year. That can delay the taxes to pay and you get to gamble with that tax money. 

## TL;DR
Want to buy the dip but don't have any cash left? Well then your hedging sucked and you should read this guide again.


## Afterword - Hedging and Hedgefunds; know the difference!
### Hedgefunds bad
Yes.
### Hedgefunds hedge?
They used to. Hedgefunds used to protect cash by utilizing complex financial instruments.
The goal was to protect the cash, not to increase it.


This has changed. Now they're exclusive to the ultra wealthy and trade anything and everything to beat the market.

Art, stocks, weather, insurance, whatever. 


They do hedge their super risky bets but recently it's become clear that these hedges are by no means allencompassing.
### The shorting meta
You've seen kids build sandcastles and other kids coming around, give that castle a kick and it's all gone.


Imagine that's a company being built in years or decades and some piece of bad news leaving the company in shambles. They might be rebuild but that's going to take time.

Since both the buildup and the teardown can be used to make cash and it's much, much easier, less risky AND FASTER to damage a company than spotting a good company with great potential.

That's why hedgefunds love shorting so much and why they talk about them identifying fraud so much, _""They're the good guys""_ and all that. Once they have spottet a target they'll dig up any dirt they can find or otherwise make sure the company is viewed as a bad investment to profit greatly.



Found some wrong information? Please let me know and I'll edit it in with the appropriate credit!

Any questions are very welcome but finding the time to answer them in depth could take a while.

      * ""**for this report, only those enrolled in Vanguard Personal Advisor Services® (PAS) are known to be advised**"" - I assume this is why they have 30m users, but only 5.1m in this report. Not everyone uses PAS, that's for getting access to advisors (and paying a fee).

97.9m\~ users WITHOUT including Robinhood. Just shy of $18 TRILLION rough numbers. Then remember, *there's international markets*. [This article](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/29/investing/china-gamestop-investors-intl-hnk/index.html) doesn't have sources, but it points out how global GME went. There's many more articles like it, for plenty of countries. Europe, India, Asia are several places I saw people trying to get in on the action. ""China’s approximately 200 million retail investors trade more often than any other investors on Earth—81 percent said they trade at least once a month"" [From this article](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/09/three-charts-explaining-chinas-strange-stock-market.html)

*Let me remind you that a stock like GME as of today has estimated between 27m-40m shares in the float, and a market cap of 18.4B at today's price.* **Retail has no control my ass**. Lets take a look at this:

A graph of apple users versus apple price from robinhood's API in 2020, going up to 8/6/2020. They stopped offering this information via API at this date.  We can ignore apple price here, we're looking just at ownership.

&#x200B;

[Source: Robintrack.net](https://preview.redd.it/1xji566rn1n61.png?width=1633&format=png&auto=webp&s=202fbbb95234ba5a1a6ae13453c992879805b25e)

The above shows on 8/6, 730k RH users owned Apple. That's 5.6% of users at the time using their 13m users number, which the total user number I would speculate is a bit lower at that time, as they grew from 10 to 13m users in 2020. RH stopped their API showing this info, so 8/6 is the most recent you can get on any company.

&#x200B;

GME was the most popular stock on RH, so I find it reasonable to believe at least 5% owned it, most likely WAY WAY more considering the global exposure this got. Once again, RH average account size is $5k. Please do the math here of how Jan may have looked. **This is ONLY on Robinhood**. Of course this is speculation here, but I feel that it's pretty reasonable. It's speculation based on prior data. & if users really are 23m, that's even crazier. Here's math below about what GME could have looked like. This is based on 13m users. Then, **add all of the other brokers**. This chart is only robinhood. You get the idea. Realistically, *other* brokers ownership percentage probably isn't *as* high, but it's still going to be way up there, especially during the GME phenomenon.

&#x200B;

|If average # of shares per person is|% of RH users that owned the most popular stock|Total shares owned on RH|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|5|730k shares|
|1|10|1.46m shares|
|5|5|3.65m shares|
|5|10|7.3m shares|
|10|5|7.3m shares|
|10|10|14.6m shares|

&#x200B;

Anyways, moving back to the more broad discussion and no longer focusing on GME.

""The **total market capitalization** of the **U.S. stock market** is $50,808,508.7 million(over complicated way of saying $50.8T (12/31/2020)""

It appears our estimates line up pretty closely with other data. *Notice how mutual funds are SEPERATE here.*

So why does retail ""not control the market"" ?

Personally, I disagree with this statement. Retail does control the market. **Then why is there a narrative that retail doesn't control the market?** Two main reasons in my opinion. Yes, this is speculation based on data. Form your own conclusions. Here's insight into mine.

1. Retail isn't coordinated. Even though we collectively own over 1/3 of the market, we can't coordinate things like the elite can. We can't dump 1 million shares all at the exact same time to tank a stock price. We can't control the media narrative because we don't own/aren't in bed with the media, so we lose some influence here. Retail doesn't control the day to day action on a stock, but retail controls it from a broader sense. *One raindrop cannot cause a flood, but continuous raindrops over an extended period of time do*.
2. Information **IS** becoming a commodity, there's just so much shit and misinformation to sift through right now, it's difficult for most people. Retail gains more and more control every day through decentralization and increased freedom of information on the internet. *They ARE terrified of retail*. The potential for ""power"" to shift back to the people out of the elites hands is higher than ever with the advancements of tech. I could write a whole paper on this concept. I believe decentralization is the future for everything. Information, politics, money, stocks, etc. It is imperative for the elite to keep this knowledge away from the people. Knowledge is power. Poverty and education are linked significantly. Keeping people in the dark and unaware of their capabilities is an extremely powerful tool that has been used to suppress people since civilization began.

I know above points might sound a little bit over the top, but these are my opinions based on data. I'd be happy to engage in talks around any of these points. There may be data that is just plain wrong, or that I misinterpreted. Please poke holes in anything.

Edit: /u/alice_oe made this data point “I use the European broker eToro, they have 20 million users and their app currently shows that 9.49% of them holds GME. In January this number was around 15%.” 
Heavily supports my points made, felt like it’s important."

# Purpose

The purpose of this post is to write out the thought process and analysis of some of my major investments. Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information.

\- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH?

\- Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias?

\- Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?

\- Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?

\- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that’s why I’m sharing my writing. I’m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.

# The Fundamental Constraint

**MOD DISCLAIMER: This post discusses B\*tcoin in an academic sense. I absolutely do not intend for this post to be speculative about the asset by any means and it is solely within the context of Square's strategy, business risk, and environment. This post is about under-banking, regulatory constraints, and financial services.**

&#x200B;

[The Underbanking Map](https://preview.redd.it/vpf82nkta1n61.png?width=1613&format=png&auto=webp&s=08837c21faf22549f3bfa8292a6fece047f9b4cd)

This one is not going to be easy to understand, so get your coffee ready and get comfortable. It’s going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer.

&#x200B;

A fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements.

&#x200B;

It may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, **trustworthiness and accountability must be established**. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B\*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy. This trustworthiness is also the reason why you’re able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else.

&#x200B;

[The KYC Bottleneck](https://preview.redd.it/shluc14va1n61.png?width=2073&format=png&auto=webp&s=c594663c43f266c2bab1d0bf5b4547b3d1da2382)

Just take Charlie Munger's advice to inverse. If these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime, then it means that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[The KYC Solution](https://preview.redd.it/2oueufhxb1n61.png?width=1457&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b3d6e4bb85aa337ed3a0f581929b4d8c2e70eed)

It is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B\*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank. To be totally frank, the American banking industry has quite a brutal history. Enter Jay-Z.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem.

# The Underbanked

Jack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted

&#x200B;

[The playbook](https://preview.redd.it/1eiwe2j1b1n61.png?width=1494&format=png&auto=webp&s=f81927188476f40d136d884d18be7a5cb172ef49)

Interestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards.

In my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and minority America. while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers. No really, go ahead and look at two things:

\- Cash App’s Twitter and advertising strategy

&#x200B;

[Urban strategy](https://preview.redd.it/c4gc0lvfb1n61.png?width=1487&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2b69447ee9c822aef198c97fcb83d7c992b886b)

&#x200B;

[Youth strategy](https://preview.redd.it/dyhd7ssgb1n61.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd5780a188b29e1a930b5d85cdd0272e01844a65)

\- The geographic results on Google Trends when searching “Cash App vs. Venmo”. Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty.

&#x200B;

[Underbanking strategy](https://preview.redd.it/xruw28aib1n61.png?width=2949&format=png&auto=webp&s=58c21fefe36277359c1d37adfa86b592d009af52)

&#x200B;

It is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water.  That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Square’s youth and culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. You’ve heard it before, “why doesn’t school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?”. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers:

1. The ability to start a business
2. The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks
3. The ability to invest and educate in B\*tcoin
4. The ability to save on basic purchases
5. The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to)

&#x200B;

[Reality](https://preview.redd.it/hb2b2zljb1n61.png?width=1402&format=png&auto=webp&s=5aa1cce454480fe56d30489feeae3a52809dc559)

What this inevitably means is that we probably won’t even see Square operating at “full-force” until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials.

# Speculation

This is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks:

1. Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank’s regulatory offerings.
2. Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services.
3. The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process.
4. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with organizations like Visa or MasterCard.
5. Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify.
6. Square will foray into equal housing.
7. Square will improved loan systems.
8. Square will enter taboo markets like cannabis.

&#x200B;

Background information on the company:

Tui is a German travel agency. In fact, they're the largest travel agency in the world, with 27 million customers, 48000 employees and ten billion dollars of revenue in 2020. They have 350 hotels, 18 cruise ships and 150 airplanes.

Their business model is mostly operating as a travel agency, that operates either through their website or physical locations, although they earn higher revenues by owning some of the airlines they use, as well as hotels or cruise ships.

Since 2012 the Tui stock has been on a fairly consecutive rallye, breaking out and shortly spiking at over 20€ (24$) in the summer of 2018, before correcting down, settling around 8€ (9.5$) and rising back to 12€ (14.5$) shortly before the covid outbreak in early 2020.

&#x200B;

As i stated, after this it rose to 12€ before dropping hard to slightly below 3€, where it spiked and fell a couple times, with a hard ceiling at 6.40€ (7.70$) and a floor of 2.90€. (3.5$)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# BEAR CASE:

Currently the stock is trading for 5€, which is a strong increase since its 2.90€ floor only a couple of months ago, and you need to ask yourself why? They had over 72.000 employees in 2019 but had to fire one third of them in the pandemic. Because of their low profit margin they are currently bleeding cash. They were the first company in Germany to ask for government aid, and the CEO said that the only other alternative was bankruptcy. Up until recently they had many airplanes in their Tuifly group that were not allowed to fly, and they lost a billion dollars in 2020. Germans are also only 10% vaccinated, so why is the stock up 40% in a month?

# BULL CASE:

The stock dropped hard from 20€ because their airline Tuifly ordered new airplanes. A bunch of 737 max's. As many of you might remember, a little more than two years ago, Boeings 737 max line experienced two tragic accidents, with them being grounded indefinitely. Recently (and i mean as little as two days ago ""recent"") airlines have been picking the plane back up and it is now flying again all over the US and Europe. 

Tui experienced a record breaking billion dollar loss in 2020, yet did not go bankrupt because of government support. This is the weak part of this analysis, but I do not think that *during* the vaccination procedures the government would let a travel agency go bankrupt, after having helped them once already. In early 2020 they had 1.4b in cash reserves, and many analysts are saying they are over the risk of being bankrupted by this pandemic.

Late 2019 Thomas Cook declared bankruptcy. One of their biggest competitors, which was a large component of why the stock sharply rose right after the 737's were grounded. I have little doubt, that without the pandemic, Tui would have grabbed a big portion of that market share, and now that the 737's can fly again, I don't see why Tui would not be able to be at least near their all time high. Of course we DO have a pandemic, and the company won't just bounce back to 20€, but if it does not go bankrupt.... how long do you think it will stay under 10€ when everyone starts making up for lost vacations, and they're by far the biggest travel agency?

**More speculative:** Many Germans are saving up for a vacation, because they couldn't go for so many months now. It will obviously be a long time before they feel safe with travelling to other countries and other continents again, so once the borders open again many will feel compelled to book pre-planned travels with existing and proven pandemic measures. Now who happens to be the biggest company supplying these? Right. Tui. It also just so happens that if i google ""reise buchen"" (book vacation) the first two generic search results are, conveniently, Tui.

&#x200B;

# MY CONCLUSION:

I for one am very bullish on Tui as a long-term investment, and I think it would not be a bad idea to just buy shares now, but I'm a greedy fuck who wants those $$$, so here's my takeaway from this.

Germany is really slow with vaccinations. Like most of Europe, really slow. Look at this chart:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wvlhbtse61n61.png?width=1149&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7c71c0aefcb040b4202c15777b29a4ccda4ce15

I don't know how Israel has 106% of its population vaccinated, but Germany is sitting below the European average at 10%, and our curve really does not look all that exponential. 

In my opinion the stock is currently moving up because people think the pandemic slows down over the summer and we will all be vaccinated by fall. I think they are forgetting about how slow we do business here in Germany! I'm personally going to wait until the inevitable happens and people realize that travel restrictions aren't even lifted in many parts INSIDE of the country, and that it will be a few months before enough people are vaccinated to actually travel to other countries. Tui made crazy rallys many times this year, for this exact reason, and it always dropped hard to between 2.9€ and 3.5€.

Which is why i'm thinking about investing half of my money into shares if/when it reaches 3.75€ again, and the other half into knockout call options with a knockout price of 2.80€, because I believe the floor is set, unless there is a mutated covid coming, in which case i have bigger worries than Tui. :)

&#x200B;

And just in case some of you thought i'm not retarded enough for this; Last week i bought a knockout put option on Tui so i can ride this stock down, and then buy call options and hodl it on the way up when vaccinations are a little further on their way.

&#x200B;

What do you say? Have I missed something in my assessment? I'd be happy about nothing more than someone to finally tell me why this is a dumb idea, or why 5€ is the actual current floor and i should get in now. I'm content with my analysis, but now i need your input. :)"

Quick recap last week Hindenburg yes we all know them and if you don't do some of your own DD made a short report on Lordstown motors $RIDE
This made the stock fall to $15 per share which is down 50% from ATH
Lordstown is one of the most legitimate EV companies out there. A major partnership with multiple companies like camping world and GM. This is one of the worst-hit pieces I've seen.

First off fuck short sellers. Lordstown motors is a truck company that is bringing much-needed manufacturing jobs to the Midwest US FUCKING A This is an American company hiring people in a struggling city so anyone who shorts this stock is simply anti-America. Seriously fuck you for profiting from the losses in small American manufacturing city's. Even if you don't think Lordstown is a good investment is is outrageously toxic to make money on the failure of fellow Americans.

This hit claimed multiple things that I will now assess 

Edit*: for all you retards that can't read in the comments find me an OEM EV company that has binding pre-orders I dare you.

1) there is no demand.
Claiming there is no demand for an electric EV truck is insane. EV is the future and trucks are part of that by claiming there is no demand makes no sense and it's as simple as that. the tesla cybertruck has 400k preorders and I am sorry tesla retards but your local plumber, an energy company, and farmer jack arent buying a cybertruck. The real bros of silicon valley will buy the shit out of cybertucks so they can use them to live in because they can't afford rent but ain't no real truck work is getting done in a cybertruck.

3) the truck doesn't work
There are many videos of working prototypes not rolling downhill that can be easily found with a basic Google search these guys are probably using internet explore and bing search engine to do their DD or they're just blind. The Endurance truck is entered into a 250-mile rally in April and will be competing. Why the hell would you enter a race if your truck doesn't even work no one could be that dumb. The truck did have some issues as one of the prototypes caught on fire but the keyword is a prototype. Yes, no way I didn't know that experimental prototypes fail a lot of that's the whole reason prototyping exists.

5) preorders are fake
No, they aren't they are not binding pre-orders that is true but name one EV company with binding pre-orders even teslas cyber tuck can be ""pre-ordered"" with a non-binding $100 check so don't try and argue this is any different no one in their right mind would lock into a binding contract with any new EV company and no one has.

This report has caused RIDE short interest to shoot straight up and if a prefect candidate for WSBs good olde fashioned short squeeze to the moon.

The bull case. I grew the biggest testies and doubled down on this bad boy during the dip last Friday. my position 350 shares 5 long 2022 $30 calls. Mostly all bought on Friday

1) All pre-orders are for commercial use, the 100k preorders are from companies to use as fleet vehicles and they do plan to work into the consumer market after they ramp production more.

2) They own and will produce in the Lordstown plant previously owned by GM which already has a 500k car per year capacity

3) I agree with your take on autonomy I think it is vital to an EV company and this is very speculative GM who has the cruise Autonomous driving system is a pretty big investor in Lordstown and the CEO of Lordstown says they have a great relationship and want to expand their relationship with GM. So I would assume sometime down the road this could mean the integration of the cruise system in Lordstown trucks.

4) The Price, in your video you said you think rivan and Lordstown are kind of competing, I think this is a bit of a mistake, first rivan is a consumer-first company where Lordstown is mostly in the commercial space (right now) and Rivan vehicles will cost much more than Lordstown. I grew up and still do live in the city of Detroit and follow the automotive sector. I know a lot about rivian being that they have an office here in Plymouth Michigan. Their cars and trucks have a more premium price and the Lordstown truck is only going to cost about 50k which is pretty good considering normal gas truck prices. The rivan will be more in the 70k range.

5) This is an obvious Biden play Made in the US in the midwest (Ohio) a state that democrats barely lost, this would be a great PR political move to hype this company up just to get more Democratic support in the state and the midwest all together

Finally

6) partnership with RV world, they recently partnered with RV world to act as a place to service their vehicles, as we know when Tesla first came out and still to this day have issues servicing the cars. This partnership means that the day the first endurance truck rolls off the line there will be hundreds of locations around the US where technicians are already trained to work and fix these trucks, not to mention that both CEOs mentioned in their joint press conference that there is a goal to electrify 5th wheel trailers to help increase EV trucks long road trip range and build EV RVs.

**Canoo Inc.

They seek to break the mold by pushing design boundaries while maximizing utility and advancing new concepts in vehicle ownership through subscription based models of vehicle financing and fleet management.

# Trend Reversal = No More Dryspell

Recently SPACS and EVs fell out of favor as macro market headwinds took the air out of Tech and Growth sails.  With a large amount of EV's being suspected of being Vaporware including the Pink Elephant in the room TSLA, Capital ran from these stocks faster than your Sunday morning retreat from that pig shaped MOPED you don't want your friends to see you riding.  This all came back to a stunning reversal of fortune after Warren Buffet said Yield Curve is so 1920's and everything is fine, stop being a bitch.  FED said QE forever boys and I'll let you know when I stop buying mortgages people haven't paid for since the pandemic started. Cool Bro, so Last week we saw capital come back to growth and tech stocks acting like nothing happened because they have a nice personality and tend to bang well. You know what I'm mean.

This saw our beloved GOEV take its gloves off (and its pants) and fight like it had a pair.  There's a short squeeze taking place that I have written about extensively.  The stock price immediately reversed its course and has continued to appreciate dramatically based on the electric magnetism of a gamma ramp. Friday the empire struck back and then we gave everyone fuck tons of free money. BullHood and his best friend WeRobbin' is going to turn this market into Burning Man meets 28 days later. Strap in.

For real though Canoo spent this week as the darling of the EV class.  Not only did its [SP](https://u.teknik.io/nkXjb.PNG) outperform every other fucking EV maker out there. If there wasn't the Friday Short shenannigans this week the SP would have dominated them all from the moon.  I believe that we are seeing the emergence of the Tesla Hedge. Canoo is, in my opinion, strategically grabbing market share while staying out of the way of direct competition with luxury EV models. Its doing its own thing.

# Hypermasculine BubbleTruk drop dominates automotive world.

[BubbleTruk](https://u.teknik.io/ikfDb.jpg) was so fucking weird.  People had a strong feeling about it, hating or loving it... No one ignored it. Media has shifted significantly into covering Canoo's Electric Truck Release (Did fisker even do anything at MPG ?)  [Google news overflowing](https://u.teknik.io/44XGk.jpg) with articles in the past 3 days. Probably some pay to play, but whatever.  Check the plenty of articles with titles calling the Bangbus as a TSLA competitor.  That belief will be self fulfilling.  We are currently standing at the base of a significant change in perception [a trend reversal](https://u.teknik.io/4Zo6x.PNG) that will have long lasting positive consequences to valuation.  But competing with Tesla is not the only thing on Canoo's mind, Canoo seeks to corner the entire fucking truck market.  Lets compare.

**Canoo hasn't been this cool always.**  I watched the MPDV vehicle video and succeeded in not suck starting a pistol but only barely.  In fact, If I was long in GOEV and that video dropped, I would have by now.  Its clear that the CannooBro's fanbase has only survived because of California's strict gun legislation.

I am highly encouraged by Electric ChadTruk video because everything about it was better. The presentation, the lighting the guest, the reality of its presence.  There was something just so dominant about it where Canoo just showed versus explained to me why I should think its cool. Tony talked about taking his significant other out and his Guys on the jobsite.  This offends the westcoast hipster elite.  Listen, the fact that he didn't say ""My arm candy sextoy never drives"" means he's paying attention to the Mandatory Training PowerPoint slides. The MPDV felt like a joke you have to explain... like your portfolio's performance before last Monday.   This level of difference is indicative of serious corporate flexibility and an ability to create meaningful change when you miss your target.  Its not all wins but its how you roll with the punches that matters. 

**Let me put it to you like this, you didn't know you wanted that truck until you saw the video.** 

# That stinks like Steve Jobs.

After being involved in stocks with ETF exposure (read: **Every single other stock out there**)  I can appreciate that we will only be going up versus blaming all of our losses on ""ETF shorting"".  Depending on the catalyst that brings that exposure we could see millions of shares being scooped up. Note the comparable amount of the rest of comparable stocks. Somewhere between Nio and Fisk is 10 percent of our FF.  Just saying.

In other news, Cathie Wood is excited about the Canoo truck because she will finally be able to fit all of Ark's Short Interest in the back without having to fold the seat down.  The only problem is that the 200 mile range might not be enough to find the share price at the bottom of the chart.  She's just a attention grabbing vaporware empty bag holdin... Wait what?

# Monday is Roth , Partner Announcement would be cool.

They could announce something and really just fucking make everyone who boarded this party train in the last 4 days so fucking rich its disgusting or longs break even.  I'm just kidding, they're going to be rich too. Especially people with warrants.  They are going to get the nursing home bed next to the window.

But lets be real and get to know the **bear perspective.**

/u/Dramatic-Trainer-268

""Roth could end up being fruitful, but it'd be the first time they released material info at a conference/round table like this since I started following them And since they revealed the MPDV in Dec they've been stone fucking silent So I worry they're going to drag their feet on providing any new info before 4/16And the only reason I think they'd hold those numbers for an extended period of time is if they weren't as good as they wanted them to be prior to announcing them Few weeks after revealing MPDV and opening up US pre-orders, they opened it up to Canada and Mexico too. Out of the blue. Felt like they wanted to juice the numbers.$100 deposit, fully refundable, so people will hate on them being true pre-orders""

He's actually super bullish and literally knows everything about Canoo Inc.  he just wants you to know that its not all shits and giggles.  I'm wondering about earnings too... Its like were at the action sequence of the movie and we just got done killing the monster, but there's still 30 minutes left in the film.  Nevertheless I'm feeling good.

I want to end with some wild speculation from the man that leaked the ChadTruk in the first place.

/u/PlaneReflection

""I’m speculating that Walmart will purchase a fleet of MPDVs for Walmart+ deliveries.

* \-Paul B mentioned “retailers like Walmart” several times.
* \-MPDV is the cheapest cargo van, electric or gas, on the market.
* \-MPDV has the greatest cargo volume for its footprint, meaning more deliveries in less trips.
* \-Canoo’s phone-as-a-key and fleet management software provides much better integration, than any other vehicle.
* \-EVs make sense from a fleet perspective as minimal maintenance, no dealing with gas cards, can charge at Walmart sites and etc.
* \-Canoo Lifestyle vehicle was coincidentally spotted charging at a Walmart in Arizona on [Twitter](https://u.teknik.io/4ImZF.PNG):""

If you guys read my DD on NIO before the NIO Day Catalyst, you would've bought in at 38 and sold around 60 (I sold calls, but still holding my shares).

Now, there are two new catalysts that are arguably even greater than the announcements at Nio Day.

**1) Energy**  
On Nio Day, William Li announced a second-generation Battery Swap station, where users don't even have to leave their cars. The stations are also a lot cheaper to operate, with greater capacity. They can complete about 312 battery swaps per day.

Imagine a world where Battery Stations replace Gas stations. What would that say about Nio? And what would happen to gas stations?

Well early February, William Li met with Sinopec's CEO. Sinopec is one of the largest oil and chemicals companies in the world (2nd globally according to Forbes). They have over 30,000 gas stations. Here's the kicker: There are not so subtle rumors that Sinopec gas station will incorporate Nio Battery Swap Stations. Nio plans to have 500 battery swap stations by the end 2021, some of which may be at Sinopec's stations. The growth in revenue will accelerate.

**Imagine if NIO's main source of revenue was from selling energy, rather than just cars.**

It'll send Nio's share price to the moon.

**2) Hong Kong Stock Exchange**  
Nio plans to list in the Hong Kong stock exchange around April. XPEV and LI will also be added. This is great news for Nio's stock price. An announcement about BABA listing on the HK stock exchange (around November 2019) led to its share price rising from 185 to 300 in three months.

The same will happen to Nio, and even more so, because Li and Xpev's rise will bring Nio up even more due to their coupling in various EV-related ETF's.

Watch out for an announcement in April.

**Other thoughts:** I've noticed, increasingly, that puts bought for the purpose of hedging positions are now mostly be applied to index ETF's like SPY and QQQ. Why? Because GME's short squeeze drama nearly killed several hedge funds. Sentiment Analysis has become a household name, and all the major hedge funds track WallStreetBets to avoid stocks that are too popular. Nio is one of those stocks that boomer hf's realize is one of the popular ones on ""reddit"". Google ""top reddit stocks"" and you'll see Nio routinely mentioned (this is also why I think stocks like PLTR will no longer suffer for too long).

Also Mizuho announced a Nio PT at $60, and Deutsche Bank recently released a memo stating that Nio can reach $70 in the near term. These things tell me that both retail and hedge funds are united in loving NIO stonk. We might be clear for another takeoff.

**3) What to Do**  
The dates on these catalysts are not announced like Nio Day was. All I know is that it'll happen sometime in the next few months. To play it safe, I would buy call leaps. My price target is 70-80 by EOY. Also, load up shares on dips and sell covered calls each time we reach new highs. I plan to diamond hand Nio, as I believe it'll reach higher than $300 in five years. I'll be buying/selling calls, but not sell my shares.

**4) Community Boost**  
If NIO passes $70 per share by eod, April 16, I'll donate to charity and post as an update. I don't want to virtue signal, but I hope it encourages some people on here to think about their community. I was inspired to do this by other WSBers that donated to the Food Bank with some of their GME earnings, so for that, thank you, and I hope I too can pass on the kindness.

**TLDR** \- NIO is likely to partner with the world's second largest Oil Company this year and have their newly designed battery swap stations operate in gas stations, thus Nio might actually make more money as an energy provider than a car company. Also, Nio will be listed in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which has helped stocks like BABA go to the moon in the past.

**TLDR** \- I'll donate to charity if NIO’s passes $70 per share by April 16."

Not only did earnings beat, but they straightup said that regulations will not negatively impact them and, in some cases, will actually help them.  The anti-trust regs against tencent's fintech will open up more room for growth for QFIN.**

“ On the regulatory front, we believe that the regulations brought out recently either has minimal impact to our business, or in some cases, even created favorable environment for top platforms like us. As you may already know, the new ruling from the Supreme People’s Court removed the more restrictive lending rate cap for our business. The new guideline on drug lending and micro-lending has a minimal impact on our business as our exposure to both is quite marginal. On the other hand, China’s antitrust and deleveraging push may squeeze some market share away from the industry giants, which will bring us spill over market opportunities” -CEO

This call and the earnings are even better than I was hoping.  Now we just need the market to realize it!  See you all on the moon.

EDIT2: Stock dropped today (3/15) alongside the entire sector.  It isn't dropping on its own - all the chinese fintechs, including the ones that are exposed to microlending, are dropping today.  Good last minute chance to buy, especially since premarket it was actually up 7% haha.  If you're really worried about macroeconomic risk, a good play might be to buy a ITM PUT on a fintech that's exposed, and an ITM call on QFIN. A hedge, so to speak.  But personally i'm not doing that. This is a casino, after all. 
____________
**EDIT: Many people have brought up concern that this stock has already tripled and might be played out. I strongly disagree - from a valuation standpoint it is still an amazing buy. It wasn’t the cash flow or loan quality keeping the price down - it was the regulatory risk. As that risk diminishes it will grow to reach it’s fair valuation, which is around 50 using even a conservative growth rate in a conservative FCFE. The real risk is new regulations, or a bigger impact of the current ones, hence why I spent most of this DD talking about them. Right now the market is pricing in regulations wiping out about half of their revenue sources, which I strongly disagree with.

The earnings call is Monday at 9PM EST, which is Tuesday morning for QFIN in China. The numbers will be interesting but the real catalyst will be management’s discussion of the impact of regulations. Make sure to place all bets by then!**
______________

I have ventured out of my usual territory in my hunt for an exotic rocket ship-shaped banana, and I’ve got good news for all ape-kind: I’ve found one. Here’s my DD (whatever that means). 

Ticker: **QFIN**, AKA ""360 Digitech"". They are a Chinese Fintech company. Currently trading around $31.50. Market Cap is around 4.8 Billion. Very few people in America have heard of them. PE is less than 10, growth is insane, plenty of cash on the balance sheet, low leverage, etc. From a fundamentals or cashflow analysis, this is a banana mine. 

**Here's their business model:**

*First*, they use their online presence to advertise loans to the rapidly-growing Chinese middle class.

*Second*, they use their proprietary risk-assessment tools to analyze the credit-worthiness of the applicants. They also have proprietary identification tools to help prevent fraud and simultaneously speed up the loan process (this is a bigger deal than it sounds like due to the strong desire for convenience in lending) 

*Third*, they partner with banks to supply the capital for the loans. 

*Fourth,* they service the loans and deal with recovery in case of defaults.

The business model is important because in order to understand why this is an amazing buy you also need to understand where their revenue comes from. It's not just loan interest as you would expect.

**But first, let’s talk numbers.** 
*(In RMB, 1 USD = 6.5 RMB / CNY)
2017 Revenue: *175 million* 
2018 Revenue: *3.75 Billion* 
2019 Revenue: *6.99 Billion* 
TTM: *9.19 Billion* (TTM means trailing twelve months, this is 4Q2019 to 3Q2020)

Obviously that’s insane growth. Most apes can’t even count that high. 

And yet, despite that growth, their P/E ratio is a measly **9.4!** *(P/E is a measure of how high up tree us apes must climb to reach banana, lower number = banana more soon)* **That’s less than half the P/E of the S&P 500** *(P/E: 27.5*), **despite having significantly more growth.** 

To understand why the stock is still so cheap, let’s talk about why dumb apes might *NOT* want to buy it. 

Firstly, I assume most of you haven’t bought it yet because you have never heard of it. Do a search for QFIN on reddit – it’s next to impossible to find mention of it here. Furthermore, the trading volume is extremely low…. And most of the ownership is institutional. A few hedge funds, sure, but mostly ETFs, which is exactly what’s caused this great buying opportunity. As most Chinese Fintech stock prices have struggled lately with regulations (with the exception of this week), QFIN is relatively immune from the changes. QFIN has only gone down because most of the ownership is through the sector ETFs, which have been dragging QFIN down with them. Only recently did it buck the trend and move away from its sector's performance, in large part because people are just now starting to notice it.

This is a misunderstood company with obvious value. The play here isn’t that there’s extra value - the value is obvious to everyone - the play is that the “problems” are being significantly exaggerated and misunderstood… so rather than tell you where the deep value is, I will instead focus on why the doubters are wrong and why QFIN is uniquely placed in its sector. 

**First Reason for Doubt – Winnie the Pooh.** The Chinese Fintech industry has recently been slapped with some extra regulations that I had to get my mandarin-speaking wife to translate for me. 

One regulation is that for microlending transactions involving banks and partners, the partners (in this case, QFIN) must contribute at least 25% of the capital. Here’s a breakdown of the rules: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/china-imposes-further-caps-on-online-lending-amid-clampdown](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/china-imposes-further-caps-on-online-lending-amid-clampdown). *The stock tanked 30% when this happened.*

**Why it doesn’t matter:** According to QFIN’s CEO, Wu “Cock Slapper” Haisheng, *“Currently, the outstanding balance of the outstanding loans issued through our micro lending subsidiary, accounts for less than 1% of the total loan balance, and joint lending accounts for around 0.01%. Therefore, based on our personal evaluation, the new rules will have little impact on our loan origination business.”* 

Another new regulation is that online lending can only be done with banks that are established in the same province as the applicant. This is no problem – QFIN has a multitude of partners in each region. There are other new regulations coming down the pipeline (capital requirements, etc) but QFIN is well capitalized and capable of overcoming all the known issues. 

**Second Reason for Doubt – Default Risk.** There is concern that the loan default rate will be high, especially if China’s economy crashes, and that this will destroy the value of the company similarly to what happened to US banks with bad mortgages in 2008.

**Why it doesn’t matter:** First of all, *sack up.* 

Now that we’ve covered that primary reason, the fact of the matter is that default risk will always be a thing for banks. But QFIN isn’t a bank. *(Actually, they technically do have a banking charter in case they have to become one for due to new regulations, but they aren't currently using it.)* Remember their business model I mentioned earlier? 

*Now consider this:* 

Remember that 9.9 billion revenue for the trailing twelve months? Of that 9.9 billion, 2.3 billion is interest income. *(600mm interest expense).* Meanwhile, **they’re receiving 8 billion in service revenue**. (source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QFIN/financials?p=QFIN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QFIN/financials?p=QFIN)) They’re bringing in far more money from loan origination commissions and the SaaS fees for their credit analysis than they’re bringing in from actual interest income. In other words, they aren’t a bank. What’s even more important is that QFIN literally does have the best proprietary software, as evidenced by the default rates of their loans. Compare QFIN’s loans defaults to FINV’s, who shot up *90%* yesterday after their earnings call. Go to slide 17: [https://ir.360shuke.com/static-files/6ffd9815-c5d3-478e-81df-0f4b3eb1ad0f](https://ir.360shuke.com/static-files/6ffd9815-c5d3-478e-81df-0f4b3eb1ad0f) 

If you’re too lazy to click the link, the TL DR is that QFIN’s historical defaults for every tranche is significantly lower. 

Another facet to consider is that even if their interest income does drop significantly, their operating margin is strong and, more importantly, improving. Despite their revenue increasing significantly, “Total operating expenses, excluding provisions were roughly flat Q-on-Q but decreased 33% year-on-year. The year-on-year decline mainly reflects significant improvement in operational efficiency” – CFO Alex “Oh God Please No Not My Face” Xu 

**Third Reason for Doubt – uNaUdiTeD fInAnCiALs**

OK so this is the best criticism the bears have. It’s also the most nebulous. 

A few things to think about: 

This is a Chinese company with Chinese consumer loans on their balance sheet. The QFIN ticker is an ADR. I’m not an accountant, but AFAIK all of the Chinese fintech companies without a US presence use unaudited financials. I don’t think it’s that weird. 

Speaking of accounting, QFIN has a history of overestimating expected losses. *In other words, they used pessimistic estimates that make their financials look worse than they really are.* Back in 2Q2020, Chinese regulators slapped a cap on the interest rate of internet-sourced loans. Some of QFIN’s loans at the time were above that rate, meaning they were impacted. An unscrupulous CFO would not have marked down the loans in anticipation of a decrease in value due to the new, lower interest they would be receiving*. QFIN did the opposite – they devalued the loans by too much* (mostly because they overestimated the default rate). “...the high take rate for capital-light model in the third quarter, maybe partially contributed to a reversal of the charge in the second quarter.” – Ethan “Prolapse King” Wang, paraphrasing something the CFO took two minutes to explain when asked why the loans were doing better than anticipated after being devalued.

**What risks are there still?**

First and foremost, macroeconomic risks. As the Chinese consumer fares, so does QFIN. I view this as a good thing, not a bad one, but it does constitute a risk. Additional regulation from Winnie-The-Pooh represents a risk too, but it looks like, for now, that storm has mostly passed. My take is that the Chinese regulators seemed to have a hard on for fucking up Ant Group – a spinoff of Alibaba. Jack “Actual Vampire” Ma had mouthed off publicly about regulations and so the CCP went after him with even more regulations after disappearing the guy for a month. Ant Group focuses more on microlending, but QFIN’s stock got dragged down by the bears despite not really being exposed to microlending. Ant group is finally approved for their IPO, so it looks like Winnie’s red rocket for regulation is rapidly retracting.

**Any big banana showers coming soon?** YES! **Earnings call on 3/15!** QFIN has a history of smashing earnings estimates. If QFIN has even half the success of FINV, who went up 90% on the day of their earnings call, then it’ll be bananas for everyone. Apes taking a rocket ship to banana planet. 

If you still aren’t convinced just look at the fucking fundamentals you god damn baboon. 

TLDR: I like the stock. 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 

*This is obviously not financial advice.*

*Positions: long 15 QFIN 3/19 calls 35 strike, and long 500 shares (cost basis $27.48)*

Therefore I’d like to bring attention to never-loved GPRO. This is a household name just like GME & AMC, shares have been beaten down to hell basically since IPO. This godforsaken stonk has barely seen double digits through most of its lifetime. That being said, everyone knows this brand. It was ahead of it’s time, but only for a very short time, when it came to camera quality and capabilities. As smartphones got better and better it started to deteriorate their sales as more could simply use their IFIN and Samscumb phone.

That brings us to the present. They are pivoting to a subscription model which has grown from new to 760,000 paid subscribers in approximately one years time since they pivoted their focus. This shit ass company’s market cap is only around 1.6B even after its present rally from $7 to around $11. Its short float is nothing great-approx 11% if this Google didn’t lie to this dumb retard, but that’s plenty to build on. This small cap target is the perfect candidate to diamond hand the hell out of and make a run towards Ape Heaven. GoPro has learned from their mistakes and focused on cutting costs while staying afloat. Now that we are REOPENING, this could end up being the perfect play as people begin to travel, climb mountains, skydive, snowboard nude down Mount Everest, and other shit GoPro people do that this ape wouldn’t touch. Per their last CC, they took a big hit with stores and travel being mostly closed as this product sells best in person. 

What day you apes!? Do you what to make a run at one of WallStreets most hated stonks of all time?! Is it time for this shitshow of a company to bloom? I don’t know shit about shit, but if we all agree on something then let it be so. 

This is not a recommendation for anything, and for many might have wasted some of your night and cut into your liquor and Tendy time. I apologize in advance for time wasted!"
m3t0k9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3t0k9/why_uwmc_has_value_in_both_the_long_and_short_term/,Why UWMC has Value in Both the Long and Short Term,358,57,2021-03-13 06:36:05,"Full Disclaimer: Not financial advice, I eat crayons.

United Wholesale Mortgage is an amazing buy that I think has both long term and short term potential. I will admit, I don't know a lot about stocks, but when I look at UWMC I see value town for days. I wouldn't call this DD because I just googled stuff.

**Who Is UWMC and What Do They Do?**

UWMC underwrites loans for brokers, banks, and credit unions. They do it all- FHA, Conventional, VA, the works. Their primary business however seems to be with brokers. Now what is a mortgage broker? No really I had to google this to get a better understanding. Mortgage brokers essentially take your info, screen it, and then look at the variety of home loan options available to you and aim to get you the best deal in return (usually) for a small fee. Mortgage brokers currently make up a little over 20% of the housing market vs. 7% 2011 and 16% in 2019. They essentially help people find the best deal on the market to help finance their home, and seem to be popular among millennial homebuyers. With mortgage brokers shares growing in the mortgage space this gives UWM great growth potential (I think).

**What is UWMC's Edge?**

Now what differentiates them from other companies? Well one is their fast turnaround times. UWMC proprietary tech that allows for the quickest turnaround time in the market due to streamlined efficiency. That tech alone makes them convenient for the broker and home buyer. This makes the loan process insanely fast vs their competitors who can take a longer time to close the deal. They've built strong relations within the broker community and appear to have a symbiotic relationship with the brokers they work with.

**UWMC Ultimatum**

There's been a lot of speculation over that Chad Ishbia's ultimatum to the brokers- sign the addendum by 03/15 saying you will halt working with Fairway and RKT. Well 90% of their brokers signed it, so I think this narrative is overplayed quite a bit. Like I said, UWMC and brokers work together to profit in a symbiotic fashion. Brokers are the face and voice you see UWM directs them traffic, they each get a cut, both walk away happy with fast turnaround times/best deal for their customers. According to UWMC, RKT has gone out of their way to bypass broker's. RKT is better off offering them a rate, bypass the broker, make more money cutting out the middle man (I may be under simplifying this or have it wrong). Rocket Mortgage is not interested in working with individual brokers when they have an in house team to help keep it all in the family.

**The Value Short Term**

Short term I think we have a few key things coming up.

* [u/faisall1](https://www.reddit.com/user/faisall1/) is convinced there's a short squeeze, if you wanna see his DD on that it's here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3o6bu/uwmc\_part\_4\_when\_the\_squozes\_keep\_on\_squoozing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3o6bu/uwmc_part_4_when_the_squozes_keep_on_squoozing/) I hope this is why I've been getting fed red crayons.
* Addendum Deadline is 03/15, looks like a majority of brokers have agreed which at the very minimum shouldn't hurt their bottom line. Looks like a win-win for the UWM-Broker channel
* Russell 1000/3000 Addition on 03/22
* Q1 Earnings Report after destroying their Q4 numbers. Housing volume Remains low, demand remains high. Despite Treasury Yield + Mortgage Rate Increase I think we're gonna see good numbers here. Also I like dividends.

&#x200B;

**The Long Term Value**

The individual broker is not going away, UWM has made quick turnaround times standard for brokers and homebuyers increasing the speed and quality of service you get from an individual broker. The growth of the broker sector is a positive for both homebuyers and UWM, I like my quarterly dividends, and the stock is just way too undervalued here. Every analysis I see online has a target price of $11\~$13, so it's at a discount at $8.30 right now. UWM has rock solid financials. UWMC has a PE of 6.17 and PS of 3.84 vs. RKT with a PE 2.06 and a PS of 8.46. Look, I'm not the smartest guy, but I can clearly see that UWM has a distinct edge in the home loan market. I think UWM has a wide valuation between $11\~$16 in a fair market all things equal.

I took my tendies and yeeted them all into UWMC. 374 share and x3 $9 calls 05/21.

&#x200B;

TL;DR UWM has been feeding me red crayons, but I feel like it's gonna give me green ones soon. I like dividends because I'm big boomer."

Ok what's up you fucks? It's u/afitdinosaur coming back at you with some old-school WSB style DD.

&#x200B;

Sit down, shut the fuck up, and close that r/gangbang tab of your wife and her boyfriends, because you're about to get slapped with some **real** deep dick value.

&#x200B;

A few months ago, I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jy3up1/dr_michael_burry_is_gonna_ilumnate_your_portfolio/) DD to WSB outlining how I thought LUMN was the bee's knees. I still think that. There has been some development in the stock since I posted that DD, and I think that y'all deserve an update. Because frankly, the pitiful DD I've seen on LUMN since, one of which references why ""Cables are like the future, man"", and another that had more emojis in it than a tweenage girl's apple chat, is well, unsettling. So you're fucking welcome.

**Act 1: Dr. Christian Bale, PHD, MD.**

For those of you who are too retarded to read my first DD, what initially got me interested in LUMN was a [13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761920019679/0001567619-20-019679-index.htm) filed by the one and only Michael Burry, who will henceforth be referred to Dr. Christan Bale, PHD, MD. As seen in the excellent movie The Big Short, Christian Bale is basically an autist who reads approximately 10 million pages of housing loans, and figures out that the trading of [Collateral Debt Obligations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo.asp) on subprime mortgages was going to crash the housing market.  Dr. Bale then buys approximately $1.3 Billion of [Credit Default Swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp), which is a kind of like a bet on a loan defaulting and proceeds to ride the housing market crash to tendie town. Is he the gayest of bears? No he's fucking not. They weren't puts, were they?

Confused about my lazy explanation of both an Academy Award-winning film and complex financial products? I don't fucking care. Google it, or watch the movie. Margot Robbie will explain it all to you, plus she'll get your dick hard. (Or your pussy wet. Idk I've seen some thots around here lately too).

Christian Bale has now increased his position in LUMN, per his last [13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761921003819/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml), and it is now his fourth largest holding. Remember that other stock that Bale invested in that helped put u/deepfuckingvalue on the map? What was it called again....? Idr. Oh well. Moving on.

**Act 2: A New Breed**

Ok, with that out of the way, onto the stock TL;DR at the bottom.

LUMN is formerly CenturyLink. Most of you are young enough now to not know that this company used to be shit, and was a part of a dying telecom industry that provided mostly phone lines, and no one except grandma has got phone lines in their house anymore. And grandmas die every day. So, much like the cigarette industry, CenturyLink's customer base was rapidly dwindling. Unlike the cigarette industry, CenturyLink could not replace them faster than they died.

&#x200B;

Until recently.

LUMN has rapidly transitoned to a cutting edge fouth industrial revolution company that is investing heavily in all the cool jazz that the kids love today, like hybrid cloud systems, adaptive network systems, AI driven adaptive threat recognition programs and advanced collaboration systems, which they have recently expanded with a partnership with [ZM](https://www.fiercetelecom.com/telecom/lumen-expands-partnership-zoom).

&#x200B;

Recently, they presented at the Morgan Stanley Technology Summit. I didn't watch that shit, but I guess it went well because the stock rallied almost 8% the day after, despite the market collapsing around it. I meant to post this shit before that summit, but was too busy getting my ass raped by PLTR weeklies to care.

LUMN is now trading at a cool $13.60, up from $9.76 when I first tried to bring you degenerates on board. Not bad for a boomer stock.

On top of this, insiders have been absolutely loading shares, you'd think this stock was [GME](http://openinsider.com/screener?s=lumn&o=&pl=&ph=&ll=&lh=&fd=730&fdr=&td=0&tdr=&fdlyl=&fdlyh=&daysago=&xp=1&vl=25&vh=&ocl=&och=&sic1=-1&sicl=100&sich=9999&grp=0&nfl=&nfh=&nil=&nih=&nol=&noh=&v2l=&v2h=&oc2l=&oc2h=&sortcol=0&cnt=100&page=1), or something.

&#x200B;

**Act 3: Money and All That Shit**

LUMN recently had their Earnings Report. After which, they got fucking obliterated. Personally, I think the finanicals are greatly improving. Let's discuss why, ok?

* Their non GAAP EPS was $0.48 per share, against the estimate of $0.30 per share, beating the average consensus estimate by 37%.
* EBITDA was $8.6B vs $8.9B in 2019.
* Their net income improved from -$5.2B to -$1.2B.
* Operating Expenses were reduced by by almost $570 Million.
* Their net profit margin was improved from a solid -24.33% in 2019 to -5.6% in 2020.

Ratios:

* Price to Sales .51 in 2020 from .66 in 2019.
* Price to Book .96 in 2020 up from 1.07 in 2019.
* Price to Cash Flow 1.61 in 2020 from 2.12 in 2019.

&#x200B;

Don't understand what any of this means? Me either, basically. But know this: LUMN's evaluation ratios are knock any one of their competitors in the 5G industry far, far out of the park. They are a company with a $10B market cap that does sales north of $20B. For comparison, TSLA's Price to Sales ratio is 24.23. If you don't understand why a lower number is better here, fucking google it. Because I lied. I do understand the financials but I'm too lazy to explain it all.

**Act 4: Forward Looking Statements**

Here are some additional reasons why I think this company will make your portfolio super duper green:

* LUMN owns one of the largest fiber networks in the world, with over 450,000 miles of fiber owned in North America alone. They also own the largest fiber network in Asia, where the expected CAGR of 5G Utilization is [46.4%](https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/asia-pacific-5g-enterprise-market-to-witness-massive-growth-by-2024-as-mega-trends-fuel-industry-transformation-870296850.html).
* Asians aren't the only folks LUMN loves they recently hired [Quincy L. Allen](http://blackmillionaires.blogspot.com/2011/08/quincy-l-allen.html) to their board of directors, not only because he's a successful dude, but because, you know, #BLM, as the kids say.
* Companies like AT&T and Verizon will rely heavily on fiber providers to expand the next wave of 5G, which, as you cool kids know, is the next bee's knees. There have been some unsubstanitated chatter of a potential buyout by AT&T. But take that shit with a grain of rice. Still, with how cheap options still are on LUMN, it's worth the gamble IMO.
* There has been a steady increase in [Darkpool Prints](https://twitter.com/darkpoolcharts/status/1364034343480545280) on LUMN since February of this year. For those of you who don't know what darkpool trades are, basically, folks with huge amounts of money will trade stocks on a private exchange because the size would otherwise throw the equity price out of whack on the public markets. Like, a lot of money. Like, more than you fucks who bought into GME at $400 have made so far.
* LUMN is prime to drop a bomb in the the near future. There was a lot, a lot of attention at the MS Tech Summit and LUMN got some attention, as previously mentioned above. Options volume has spiked, and the Put to Call ratio is a respectable .14. Bottom line, not alot of gaybears in the LUMN camp.
* There's a chance of a big upcoming catalyst at any turn with LUMN. However, I think the safe move here, and the best way to generate TENDIES, is leaps. For those of you who don't know what leaps are, they're pretty much the opposite of FD's. **It is possible to buy an option that expires farther than this friday, not sure if you fucks knew that.**

And yes, Sir, I know this is a casino. **I'm giving you a sure why to beat the house.** Currently, an ATM option for JANUARY 2022 is $1.75. This is cheap, folks. Real fucking cheap. I've got options that have been fucking printing since December. If you're a real tendie tickler, try leap call spreads. Set and fucking forget. [For the price of 4 GME shares, LUMN could net you $25k](http://opcalc.com/rlE). That's definitely enough to tell your wife's bf you're sleeping at the foot of the bed instead of a couch. In a year.

**Act 5: Don't Eat the Crayons**

Ok time for some chart astrology you fucks. As you can see [here,](https://imgur.com/YvMsoZy) we've got LUMN on the 10, hourly, and daily charts. For you robinhooders out there, there are things called candle sticks and technical indica-...fuck, nevermind. It's too complicated. Just keep yoloing your stimmies into GME FD's. It'll work out I promise. TBH it probably will you degenerates are a wild bunch. I hope you all make millions.

Anyhoo:

* The 10 is showing relative consolidation, with an arguable inverted head and shoulders, and had a strong move upward when RSI traded into the oversold range. there were multiple tests of the 200 EMA (purplish), 50 EMA, (yellowish), and 20 EMAS today in this time frame. LUMN held VWAP until about 10AM central when it dumped below it and traded under VWAP until it spiked up to retest VWAP after hours. A push over VWAP ($13.68) in PM tomorrow could set LUMN up for a strong pump at open for all you daytraders out there. MACD ended in the bullish/nuetral territory.
* Hourly is showing signs of a reversal if we can get strong out of the gate and get through the several levels of resistance: $13.19 at 200 EMA, $13.68 at VWAP, $13.73 at 20 EMA and $13.76 at the 50 EMA. RSI is still in the low to nuetral oversold territory at 45.50. MACD is getting ready to curl bullish and I think LUMN will be strong tomorrow. Volume Profile (not pictured) has strong resistance at $13.83, but over that we could get real fiesty.
* Despite the daily MACD curling bearish, and RSI being in the higher range of overbought, I'd argue we're seeing a small bull flag on the daily. Volume movement also makes me think bull flag, but be aware of the general market sentiment and get ready to play both sides of the coin.

&#x200B;

Ok Autists, you may be missing a chromosome, or might have an extra, or maybe I'm thinking of something totally different, but this one's a no brainer for me. Watch the price action and go long when the opportunity arises. Since my last post, LUMN experienced a sympathy squeeze from GME which drove the price up to $16.60. Since I'm no u/deepfuckingvalue, I cashed the fuck out of most of my earlier posted calls because I paid pennies for them and sold them for dollars. However, I still hold July, November and January 2022/2023 calls and spreads.

This is a smart play folks. Which might be sacrilege on WSB these days, but nothing will be unVALEd or turn PRPL in your portfolio and you will be able to afford to eat more than CORN. The only thing that will happen if you join the LUMN gain is green tendies and fucking caviar. #ganggang.

&#x200B;

TL:DR- Buy LUMN calls, leaps and shares. Did I mention there's a 7% div?

&#x200B;

Postions:

* 4,225 shares
* July 15c, 17.5c, and 20c
* November 15c, 17c, 20c, 22c and 25c
* January 2022 12c, 15c, 17c, 20c, 22c and 25/30c Debit Spreads
* January 2023 25/30c Debit Spreads

&#x200B;

Bonus Positons:

* JACKED TO THE TITS in PLTR shares
* PLTR April 16 35c at 3.21 Cost Average (FUCK)
* TAK January 2022 30/32c Debit Spreads
* WMT January 2022 165/170c Debit Spreads
* TSLA March 19 1050/1060c Debit Spreads at 1.25 Cost Average (ALSO FUCK)

 I know there have been a lot of posts about NOK recently across several different subreddits, but I recently did some due diligence on the the stock and wanted to share my findings.

I originally had a lot of links in this, but it led to the post getting auto-removed. Let me know if you would like any sources.

# History of Nokia

If you've seen any of the recent Nokia posts over the last few months, a common comment you will see is: ""Nokia?!? That stock has been trading sideways for years!""

While yes that is true, it is important to understand why. Let's take a look.

**2000-2013**

Nokia dominated the mobile phone market during this time due to a quality handset. NOK traded in the $50s during the Dotcom bubble and in $30s before the housing crash. However, they never recovered after 2008 due to struggling to keep up in software as the mobile phone market started to shift to smart phones.

**2013-2019**

When Nokia realized that trying to stay in the phone space was a losing battle they sold their phone division to Microsoft in 2013. For the next 3 years, Nokia was a large company in disarray.

This did not get much better in 2016 when they acquired Alcatel-Lucent and decided to focus on networks. The merger did not go as smoothly as planned and over the next 5 years Nokia started ""trading sideways"" due to a bearish sentiment.

Some investors stuck around through all of this due to a dividend being paid out, but that was suspended in 2019 so Nokia could focus on developing its 5G mobile networks. This dropped the share price down to $3.50.

**2020-Present**

In March 2020, sentiment started to change somewhat bullish as they announced Pekka Lundmark would be taking over as CEO. Pekka worked for Nokia for a decade in the 90s and most notably served as Fortum's, a Finnish state-owned energy company, CEO from 2015 to 2020.

The bullish sentiment was shorted lived due to the pandemic crash dropping the share price to $2.42. It started to pick back up over the summer when it was announced that Pekka would take over a month earlier than planned.

This was followed by rumors that there was a chance Nokia could win Verizon's $6 billion 5G deal. Hype around this brought Nokia's price above $5 for the first time since they suspended their dividend in October 2019. But in September, it was announced that Samsung won the Verizon deal and NOK fell down to $3.78. It fell even further to $3.37 in October when the rest of the market saw a down swing.

Then it climbed back up to the low $4s, had a crazy January hitting $9.79 for about 10 seconds during to the meme stock frenzy, and has since returned to the high $3s low $4s after the Q4 earnings call.

**Q4 Earnings Call**

So what exactly did happen during that earnings call on 2/4/21? Why did it hurt NOK's price?

A lot of people blame Pekka messing up the call with some pessimistic word choices, most notably the word ""challenging."" Why would he say this?

It may just be his straight forward personality. It might have been an intentional sandbag so he can control future expectations. It may because Nokia prides itself on being on ethical company. I think it was probably due to a little bit of all of the above. Pekka using this language was not surprising. He said the exact same thing during the 2020 Q3 earnings call.

So the rumors that Nokia may blow it out of the water during their Q4 earnings were unwarranted. Nokia did beat their expected earnings, but because of a decrease in year over year revenue, people overreacted (just like they did when Samsung won the Verizon deal) and sold their Nokia positions.

**Pekka's Tenure**

Pekka has been in charge for 7 months during a global pandemic, but he has been able to make some progress it appears. Much of this information can be found in the Nokia 2020 Annual Report.

* He trimmed their employee size by 11,000.
* He improved their free cash flow to $2.6 billion.
* Even with the decrease in revenue he nearly doubled their operating profit (page 82).
* He drastically reduced their net deferred tax balance (page 175).
* He created four distinct business groups with plans for these groups to be shared in more detail during during Capital Markets Day on 3/18.
* He replaced Nokia's CFO, CTO, and CMO (CFO happened before he took over)
* It appears he issued new shares to leadership.
* Pekka has a stake in the company (page 67 of annual report) with a long term goal to ""Focus on increase in share price and restoration of the dividend"".
   * "" In addition, Mr. Lundmark received an award of EUR 1.3 million of restricted shares on joining to buy out the awards he forfeited on leaving his previous employer. Mr. Lundmark was invited to join the co-investment based long-term incentive arrangement (eLTI) targeted to engage senior leaders with the long-term nature of our business and share price, and purchased EUR 2.6 million of Nokia shares against which he was given a matching award of EUR 5.2 million of Nokia 2020 performance shares. This investment by Mr. Lundmark aligns him with shareholders from the start and is a sign of his commitment and engagement with the company. Delivery of actual Nokia shares would take place in 2023 subject to performance conditions""

# Bullish

Here is a list of 28 deals and partnerships Nokia has established since December 2020. Some of these deals are not massive, but they span across 6 continents.

**Largescale Network**

* 5 year Multi Billion Dollar T Mobile Deal
* 7 year Belgium deal
* Deutsche Telekom in Germany
* France's Mainland 5G Network
* 5G Network in Austria
* Telecom Italia
* Cibicom ISP in Denmark
* Polkomtel Phone Provider in Poland
* Telenor Group in Thailand
* Ooredoo in Algeria
* 5G Network in Philippines
* Tele2 in Sweden, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia
* Ecuador
* Vodafone in Australia
* Saudi Arabia
* Singapore

**Private 5G Deals**

* San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Private Network
* Port of Seattle
* Japanese Companies Conexio, Hitachi Kokusai, Nippon Steel, Omron and Sharp:
* WEG Motor Manufacturer in Brazil
* Elisa in Finland
* Optus Stadium in Australia

**Partnerships**

* Google Cloud
* EU's Hexa-X 6G Project
* Brazil's Telecommunications R&amp;D Center
* AT&amp;T tests to deploy virtualized and open RAN
* Patents deal with Samsung
* LG Uplus trial in South Korea

**5G is the Future**

The confusing nature of 5G could be holding back the market's valuation of Nokia. 

* Nokia is currently trading at a market cap of $22-23 billion even with a 2020 revenue of $24 billion.
* A letter that Pekka recently published gives a decent explanation of what 5G is.
   * In it, he admits ""\[5G\] is exciting, but it can seem a bit abstract."" But then goes on to describe some real world examples that really helps explain it.
   * ""Our partners saw unanticipated breakdowns and production line defects drop by 30% after installing smart video sensors in our manufacturing deployments. In the logistics sector, deploying augmented reality devices cut machine monitoring costs by half. In ports, remote-controlled cranes doubled productivity and eliminated staff injuries: an incredible 100% drop.""
* This seems to suggest that there may be more uses for 5G worldwide than cellular networks.
* Nokia released a study stating that 5G could have an $8 trillion impact on global GDP by 2030.
* Nokia and Ericcson may have a duopoly on 5G with Huawei and ZTE being banned in many countries. This trend may continue.
* Some analysts have predicted massive (&gt;1,000%) growth in the 5G market over the next 5 years.

**Upcoming Events/Rumors**

* **Capital Markets Day (3/18/21)**
   * This is when we will get some true guidance on the future of the company. Not only will they lay out the strategic business plans for their 4 business segments as I mentioned above, but it should be when they make announcements toward potential a Dividend Reinstatement, Share Buyback, and future R&amp;D decisions.
* **Annual General Meeting (4/8/21)**
   * Not sure what they plan to cover during this, but I would assume it will act as a follow up to Capital Markets Day
* **Dividend Reinstatement**
   * Most signs point to Nokia investing in R&amp;D for a while, but based on Pekka's compensation package it should be back by 2023 at the latest.
* **Share Buyback**
   * Nokia did buy back 1.25 billion shares in 2015-16 and 1 billion shares in 2016-17. So the rumors they plan to do this again could be true. They can purchase up to a total of 550 million shares both this year and next year. 550 million because it correlates to 10% of the companies total outstanding shares.

# Bearish (Risks/Cons)

* The meme stock frenzy has a long-lasting impact on the opinion of this stock.
* The dividend is not reinstated for another 3+ years.
* Pekka does not have what it takes. Nokia is a sinking ship and cannot be turned around.
* FCF is used solely for R&amp;D and no shares are bought back over the next three years. The float does turn out to be too big to move significantly.
* Nokia may not be undervalued and their revenue streams may continue to decline due to network share loses and pricing erosion.
* Pekka has been very serious over the last two earning calls and things are going to get much worse/challenging before they get better.
* With a new US administration in place, the trend of banning Huawei and ZTE that they started is lifted. These two competitors then undercut Nokia pricing.
* 5G is no where near as big of an industry as the experts predict. Covid continues to slow the rollout of 5G well past 2030.
* 5G is too confusing and never gets the buy in from today's investors."

**AND** MX has $600 million of NOL carry forwards for next decade which historically cut its taxes substantially 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Great for an acquirer

**About**

1. MX is a semiconductor company that makes **Display Driver Integrated Circuits** (DDIC). ""DDIC chips are a core device for switching and displaying control functions needed by displays"".
2. Magnachip is the #1 independent global OLED DDIC manufacturer (33% market share) in the world and provides solutions for phones, TV's, automobile screens (regular + EV), VR, and more. They supply to companies like Samsung or LG who controls 95% of the OLED display market. - [source](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MAGNACHIP-SEMICONDUCTOR-C-6361073/news/MagnaChip-Semiconductor-Ranked-No-1-in-the-Global-OLED-Smartphone-DDIC-Non-Captive-Market-30995864/)

[Growing Revenue in OLED](https://preview.redd.it/f87ybxne5pm61.png?width=422&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4e0a6cfd4dc2cc8a3c1342b6f0d701db82d21d8)

**Currently MX stock is at $23 a share with $6 net cash on balance sheet (that's right, 1/4 of market cap is in cash). MX also owns a 8"" or 200 mm (read 200 millimeter diameter) wafer manufacturing plant that produces 30k wafers per month, soon to be in the 45-50k wpm range that could be worth more than $250mm.**

A wafer is like a round super thin pancake - and Semiconductor chips (square) are grown on it and then off the circular wafer. The larger the wafer the more efficient - but right now most Semiconductor technologies use 200 millimeter (8 inch or 8”) or 300 millimeter (12”) diameters.

What MX owns is one of the hottest assets as there is a global shortage of 200mm manufacturing space. [Global semiconductor shortage spurs run on vintage chipmaking tools](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-semiconductors-tools/global-semiconductor-shortage-spurs-run-on-vintage-chipmaking-tools-idUSKBN2AW18P)

* "" The demand has been supercharged by a combination of the COVID-19-driven boom in computer gear and unexpected strength in auto sales that resulted in shortages. ""
* “A real capacity increase would take nine to 12 months, minimum.”
* Used equipment prices have gone up by as much as 20% over the past six months, while the number of refurbished 200mm tools fell to 1,000, down from between 7,000 to 8,000 a decade ago.
* “You just can’t go out on the open market and buy a used 200-millimeter tool - they’re just not readily available""
* Demand for old tools is so robust that buyers are looking at every kind of factory.

**Enter MX with its Fab 3 8"". Comparable transactions are listed below** **and values MX's foundry at possibly $250mm.**

&#x200B;

The business of producing OLED devices and power integrated circuits also generates $60-65mm of EVITDA in 2021 given the sharp growth profile.

For Sale: "" A source from the investment banking industry said many foreign firms – mostly U.S. and Chinese capital - have already expressed their interest and set up meetings with local securities and accounting firms to ready due diligence ""

At an EV/EBITDA multiple of 15x would imply an equity value of $1.5 billion, up from its current market cap of \~1000mm. There is also downside protection from its $280mm in cash and \&amp;amp;gt;$250mm in foundry assets that don't appear on its PP\&amp;amp;amp;E given heavily depreciated. (and before any business earnings).

**If you’ve read this far, here is a juicy fact:** competitor Synaptics SYNA said in their Feb earnings call that they see incredible opportunity in OLED DDIC, MX’s bread and butter, and have a “tactical opportunity” this year. This was a month before MX sales rumors came out. With the $600mm of NOL carry forwards MX looks even more appealing for an acquirer.

SYNA CEO February: ""**Given the supply crunch, we've seen an opening, an opportunity for us for OLED DDICs...The current supply base in OLED DDICs has been compressed**..\[On\]...the second half of the year, as I mentioned, we do see a frontier opening up on OLED DDICs. Today, we have no revenue there. We don't think that -- in a backward look, we thought the margins were going to be challenged there, but **the dynamics have changed very significantly in that market, and we think that there's going to be a tactical opportunity.**""

This is some deep deep value u/deepfuckingvalue

Today was obviously quite eventful, and it looks like we're gearing up for a very active Thursday and Friday. There have been a few differing theories & perspectives I've seen posted here on why the price of GME, AMC, and etc. plummeted and then recovered (though not fully) and I was thinking it'd be a good idea to collect some of the different theories in one place so we can assess their validity for ourselves. Here are the theories I've heard so far - will edit this post to add more if anyone in the comments suggests additional theories and can provide a rationale that *could* make sense. Also TLDR at bottom.

- The Short Hedgefunds Theory: The HFs that are shorting GME decided to flood the market with low-priced shares to drop the price down and get people to panic sell.
- [The Short HFs and Media Theory:](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2dil9/the_gme_dip_today_was_shock_a_coordinated_effort/) Beyond just the action from the shorting HFs, some people have also suggested that the media is in cahoots with these shorting HFs because of how quickly they posted about the price dropping. There have been a few pieces of evidence for this claim, but no real ""smoking gun"". Some of the evidence has been:
 1. Articles were coming out about the drop roughly 20 minutes after the drop started. Some people are suggesting this is too short of a timeframe to write and publish an article. I personally think this is inaccurate given how quickly I've seen the media publish articles about stock movements in the past, but that's just my opinion.
 2. Google indexed a news article about the drop 14 hours before it was posted. [Another user posted reasoning of why they think this isn't sufficient proof.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2dil9/the_gme_dip_today_was_shock_a_coordinated_effort/gqin9qf/)
 3. There have been screenshots of an article that was posted about an hour before the drop happened, talking about the drop. I haven't been able to find the article with this timestamp so am skeptical of this + think it may be photoshopped, but I'm unsure who would lie about this and what their motivation would be.
- The Bullish Hedgefunds Theory: A bit similar to the shorting HFs theory, however, this theory suggests that the price drop was actually caused by HFs who are bullish on GME, AMC, etc - the same ones who some have theorized caused our current run-up in the first place. The evidence for this is that a massive amount of OTM call options were purchased when the drop occurred. I personally think this is the most likely scenario, as I don't see how that many options could be bought on the downswing by retail alone. That said, it could be that people were checking out the options prices while trading was halted and then made their purchases as soon as trading unfroze.

This is what I've seen so far - let me know if there's anything further I should add!

TLDR: HODL"

Join me on this journey fellow banana chasers.

TLDR; AMC is being heavily shorted; AMC has potential to go to $40  Time to save AMC and make tendies while we’re at it. This is not financial advice; it was originally written in red crayons that I found shoved deep inside my nose. 

Ever since COVID came along and kept our wives' boyfriends from taking them to the movies, hedge funds have been shorting AMC. AMC was close to meeting its demise on several occasions until the sound of apes screaming “We like the stock!” could be heard. The sounds grew louder with the cult-like chants. However… one thing was missing: More Apes. This is where we come to you with the facts laid out smoother than your brain in hopes of showing you what could be the best investment decision of your life. Bananas will be flowing. Question is: Will you grab it or… peel out?

First we will start off by reminding everyone that this is not investment advice, it is just the opinion of a few smooth-brained apes who like the stock, just like you. Now, why are we diamond handing AMC? 

**AMC has solid momentum.** To back this up you can look at the chart for this. The average volume has significantly increased. Months ago, the stock rarely had more than 10M traded a day. Now it's harder to find a day with less than 100m traded shares. In the same time frame, the price has gone from almost $2 to, at the time of this writing, $9.29. This means there’s more interest and liquidity in the stock. All good things for us. 

**Theatres are reopening.** A quick google search gives you dozens of links for theatres that have already opened their doors and allowed moviegoers back in to enjoy their favorite pastime. Biden has [stated](https://www.msnbc.com/11th-hour/watch/biden-all-u-s-adults-will-have-a-covid-vaccine-by-may-101867589951) that there will be enough vaccines for everyone by May, which will allow all theatres to open at full capacity. 

**Capital raised, debt reduced.** In January AMC raised $1.2b ← with a b, in funding and paid off $600m in debt. Which leaves them with a clean bill of health and a solid ground to build up from.

**Started A Streaming Service.** They have branched out into [streaming services](https://www.amctheatres.com/about/on-demand) as well, with AMC Theatres On Demand. 

**The Chart Below Looks Amazing.** First off, it's showing a cup and handle as indicated with the yellow line. This is a bullish pattern for price and we officially broke out of the handle to the upside on March 8. If we break above the tip of the cup, there isn’t much resistance stopping AMC from filling a gap to $13 and continuing on to the $20 mark, which is where Vlad decided to manipulate (read:suppress) buying action in January.
Next, we have the elliott wave theory that AMC does a great job of following. At the very least, AMC looks like it will move up from $9 to $13; on the smaller degrees. But on the larger degrees, if we assume that Wave 1 was the January spike, then we are in the beginning of Wave 3, which under EW Rules, has a realistic target of $30-40. With enough volume, AMC could easily blow past the $13 up to $20 and eventually reach the $30-$40 range. 

https://i.imgur.com/ramEhoQ.png

**Blockbuster movies lined up/Pent up Demand.** With movies not being able to be seen in theaters, some have been put on the release back burner until they can get sufficient eyes to view them. Some of these movies include Coming 2 America, God VS King, Mortal Kombat, Black Widow & Tom Gun: Maverick.

**The discord bot don’t lie.** If it worked for DFV it can work for us!

https://i.imgur.com/nmbRPmi.png

**Short Seller Data:** Forget about the momentum and the technicals for a minute and lets talk ape to ape. We did some research and found that there is still a TON of short sellers on AMC trying to take our movie theaters away. They just won’t learn; we LIKE the stock; we LIKE our movie theaters; we WANT them to stay in business. Forget the technicals, AMC is a great buy & hold because it will keep a fundamental aspect of our social fabric intact. If theaters close down, where else will our tweens make their first sloppy moves? And don't you dare say microwave popcorn is better than the theater kind - yes, even after your wife's boyfriend reminds you he ""doesn't do salt.""

Comparing AMC to GME, AMC is being shorted a lot heavier than GME right now; the numbers don’t lie.  Take a look at what Harambe found: 

https://i.imgur.com/w6WCJag.png

Sources: Data in table from Ortex.com, iBorrowDesk.com, and fintel.io

**Fellow Smooth Brained Ape Definitions Key:**

**Free Float:** Number of shares available for trade
**Short Interest:** Number of tradable shares being shorted
**Utilization Rate:** Percentage of lendable shares that have been borrowed (most likely to short)
**Short Borrow Fee Rate:** The interest rate each borrower pays on shares borrowed for shorting purposes
**Days to Cover:** The estimated number of days it will take for shorts to cover their positions

**Harambe’s Heavenly Thoughts:** Although GME has a higher percentage of its shares on loan, AMC has more shares on loan in total that are being shorted (Compare GME’s 12M shares with AMC’s 67M shares shorted). On AMC, the shorts have already borrowed 100% of the shares available to borrow, while on GME is only at 72%. We looked at the data from January, and saw a similar spike in GME’s utilization, followed by a rapid drop before the price mooned. AMC seems to be setting up a similar scenario. Looking at the short borrow fee rate, it is now more expensive to short AMC than it is to short GME, which could increase the pressure on AMC shorts to cover. Also, AMC has a higher “Days to Cover” than GME, which means it will take shorts longer to cover, so the price spike could last longer.  What Harambe’s trying to say here is: Me like AMC. Apes stronger together. AMC to the moon.

tl;dr: The writers and DDers of this:

>Me, Ape 1: 1 contract, 90 shares. Bagholding some at $15 but bought in more at $10. 

>Ape 2: 40 contracts, 600 shares

>Ape 3: 8 contracts, 100 shares

>Ape 4: 59 spreads, 6 contracts

>Ape 5: 40 contracts, 100 shares

>Ape 6: 400 shares, 10 contracts

>Ape 7: 69 contracts, 1361 shares.

Fellow apes, this is very simple but first let me say sorry for the picture with portuguese words but I assume most of you can read any language anyway. Well the picture above, not only points to the moon, but also shows - via google trends - that ""trendwise"" GME & Gamestop are at the same level as they were back in 2020. This pictures the reason behind the blackout that is going on around the media: it can be very very dangerous (read interesting for us) if this thing gets the smallest bit of media focus because it will just fuel the biggest rocket launch in the whole security history.

&#x200B;

There are now several trillion dollar companies. The new asset class that didn't exist a few years ago which must not be named here is worth well over a trillion. GME, well fucking GME, Hertz, all that shit. This is what the end of a [bull market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp) looks like. The gains during the final stretch are unbelievably high. With the returns from the market recently, it begs the question if the bull market is coming to an end.

## Blow-Off Top

A “blow-off top” is when the price of a stock or general market increases sharply, only to be followed by an as sharp decrease in price.

>*A blow-off top is a chart pattern that shows a steep and rapid increase in a security’s price and trading* [*volume*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp) *followed by a steep and rapid drop in price usually on significant or high volume as well.*[*Investopedia*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blowofftop.asp)

As a bull market nears its ends, the gains are too good to miss out on. As people buy into the market, fearing they will miss out on gains, it drives the price up to unstable values. Investors who have been in the market long enough, take their profits. As people start to sell and lock in gains, the price drops, causing a frenzy as others try to get their money out before the price goes even lower.

## Why the Current Rally Might End

The S&P 500 had its longest bull run in history ended in February because of the coronavirus. After a decade of steady gains, things came crashing down in a little over a month. Now the market is back like it never left. The market is up 65% since it bottomed out less than a year ago. *65% return in less than a year!*

The S&P closed in October at $3,269. It closed the first week of January at $3,824. That is a 16% gain in 2+ months.

[Tesla has been on another level lately](https://medium.com/yardcouch-com/elon-musk-just-became-the-richest-person-6a0675911677). Not only did they [dominate 2020 ](https://medium.com/yardcouch-com/2020-stock-market-review-b736a4ecff67)by returning 700%, the stock was up another 22% in the first week of 2021. How much more steam does this thing have?

As stock prices keep soaring, when will people start to realize profits? Some may be inclined to take their profits now while others may still in and not want to take their gains until it is too late.

When Q4 earnings start getting announced, how will the market fare? Will analysts be happy if companies' top or bottom lines are still too far from pre-pandemic numbers?

With stocks at all-time highs, it may seem the risk is greater than the reward going into the next few weeks.

## Why The Bull Market Will Likely Continue

Which of the many reasons do you want to hear first?

I’ll start with the latest from Joe Biden, as [NBC News said](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/joe-biden-wants-set-aside-deficit-concerns-invest-ailing-u-n1253638),

>\[Biden\] favors [setting aside concerns about the federal deficit](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/biden-s-agenda-gets-fighting-chance-after-democrats-capture-senate-n1253305) in order to spend more money to boost the ailing American economy.

This is on top of the nearly $4 trillion the US government has printed out in stimulus money in 2020. Easy money means easy profits right? As more money has been circulated, it has found its way to the stock market and inflated prices. With more government stimulus coming there is reason to believe the stock market will react the same.

And as we know, the stock market looks to the future. What’s in the past doesn’t matter. The millions unemployed, rising coronavirus cases, growing debt, potential inflation, or slowing global growth is history. We have vaccines now. The end is in sight.

The news of vaccines and thoughts of a “normal” society in the [second half of 2021](https://medium.com/technology-hits/why-google-can-be-the-best-performing-tech-stock-of-2021-25dff4a73fc7) is music to investors' ears. With life back to normal and an open economy, people will abandon these record-high saving rates and go back to increased spending, which should benefit companies and therefore stock prices.

Need a [technical reason](https://medium.com/yardcouch-com/three-technical-indicators-for-beginner-investors-to-know-3d06758e9d82) to think the market is not topping off right now? Look at the chart of the S&P 500 from any time to today. 1 month, 1 year, 1 decade, 1 century. Sure there are some downturns, but it always comes back and sets new records."

m0rako,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0rako/why_you_should_buy_sonos_sono_tomorrow/,Why you should buy Sonos (SONO) tomorrow,111,120,2021-03-09 05:58:54,"Listen up all you man babies.  If you're interested in making money the play tomorrow is to buy Sonos (SONO) before 3 PM EST.  Why is that time so specific?  Because tomorrow Sonos is having an investor day in the afternoon.  Where they will announce new products! Talking about the future! And (likely) raise their 2021 guidance! 

Sonos is one of the more undervalued companies still on the market and below I talk about reasons you should get in now.  They are a well positioned company for both 'stay home' and 'reopen' trades and their CEO is a boss.  They will crush tomorrow and the weakness their stock showed today on low volume should be taken advantage of immediately. 

TL;DR?  Buy Sonos on its weakness today and get in tomorrow before 3 PM EST to get in on this moon mission. 

**What is a Sonos?**

*From Yahoo: Sonos, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, designs, develops, manufactures, and sells multi-room audio products in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific. The company provides wireless speakers, home theater speakers, components, and accessories. It offers its products through approximately 10,000 third-party retail stores, including custom installers of home audio systems; and e-commerce retailers, as well as through its Website* [*sonos.com*](https://sonos.com)*. The company was formerly known as Rincon Audio, Inc. and changed its name to Sonos, Inc. in May 2004. Sonos, Inc. was founded in 2002 and is headquartered in Santa Barbara, California.* 

Basically Sonos makes incredible home speakers and audio related devices mostly for an at home setting.  They hold over 775 patents and are currently applying for over 500 more. Their speaker systems are so solid that Alphabet (google) and Amazon have tried to steal their technology. Sonos is currently in litigation against both of them and they've said they except to have the Alphabet litigation settled in their favor by the end of the year (GREAT FOR EARNINGS). 

**Reasons for buying them long term:**

I could spend this whole post talking about how they saw the coming supply chain issues and quickly worked through them.  How their CEO is has partnered with IKEA to get Sonos' systems in front of eyeballs who are looking to buy new furniture and now can add a TV sound system on the way out, or how they are going to release up to 3 new products this year. No I'm only going to focus on TOMORROW. 

**Reason #1 for buying them TOMORROW:** 

New product announced.  Go look at Sonos' stock twits, Seeking Alpha page, or even their Yahoo Finance new feed.  No one is talking about their new product they're going to announce.  It's already been leaked.  It's the Sonos Roam.  A lightweight wireless speaker where you can take anywhere.  A fantastic new addition to their stable as people want to spend more time outside this year. 

[Here's a link to the Verge talking about the details of it](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/6/22317082/sonos-roam-features-trueplay-sound-swap-leak-specs-price)

But here's why this is important. The average investor or algo hasn't picked up on this because it hasn't hit any of the media they cover.  It's going to be new information to them.  While you'll have the leg up on it. 

The Roam is likely to be their main announcement tomorrow but since they leaked this people are expecting another announcement, like in the headphone space.  

To give you an idea of how big the headphone announcement might be Kingston just sold the HyperX headphone brand to HP, for nearly half a billion dollars.  If you give Sonos that same market cap increase, that's worth 12% upside from it's closing price today. 12%! Because of a product announcement. 

**Reason #2 management wants to talk 2021 guidance:** 

Let's imagine you're having an investor day a month after you last earnings call. Things are going just okay.  Do you want to make it a point to talk guidance during your new product presentation? NO, you don't.  You hope things get better and just reaffirm you current guidance.  

Now let's pretend things are going great.  That your team is currently crushing the current Q's numbers.  You have an investor day coming up, what a perfect opportunity to tell everyone that you're going to raise guidance and likely crush those low numbers again with the new products. 

Situation number 2 is what is likely to happen. Management made it a point to let people know they'll be talking earnings and guidance during the meeting tomorrow. Management only does this if they're confident. 

**Reason #3 no supply chain issues:**

I'm cheating a little, this is more of a long term investment reason but it's likely to get brought up tomorrow.  Sonos' management team has been open about their supply chain struggles last year, and vowed to fix them.  During their last conference call they talked about how with the latest shipping issues they were not caught flat footed and have a solid pipeline of materials to build their products. Which is likely why they might raise guidance tomorrow. 

**Reason #4 new partnerships for Sonos Radio:** 

I'll let others who have Beams talk about this, not just me, but Sonos radio is super solid and an amazing long term growth addition to Sonos' catalog of products. The streaming service is fantastic when you just want a mood or type of music but don't want to deal with Spotify or Pandora playlists. They've been getting bigger and bigger names to partner up with them and create a curated playlist.  They will likely announce a few new ones tomorrow, and talk in detail about the reoccurring revenue of Sonos Radio. 

**In conclusion:**

Sonos is one of the few companies I feel it worthwhile to take a risk on in this environment. Its got huge long term tailwinds that I'm happy to talk about in more detail, but tomorrow is going to be a big uppie day.  So feel free to be in on Sonos with a cheaper buy in price.  Than buy in on Wednesday for 10% more. 

Positions: 1500 shares, 3/19 35s, 4/16 40s, 7/16 45s. 

TL;DR?  Buy Sonos on its weakness today and get in tomorrow before 3 PM EST to get in on this moon mission."
m0pnrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0pnrl/how_to_secure_and_protect_your_online_brokerage/,How to Secure and Protect Your Online Brokerage Account,38,15,2021-03-09 04:47:37,"With a lot of us apes recently coming into money, it is extremely important that we secure and protect our RH or other online brokerage accounts. I am no expert in cybersecurity but I can ""Google"" well. Here are at least a few things you should consider doing **right now**:

1. Change your online brokerage password to something easy to remember but difficult to crack. Remember to mix up the characters in your password, like ! for I and 3 for an E for example. Or you can use Google Chrome's suggested passwords. But remember those passwords will be leaked if your Google account is hacked. So ensure you change your Google password as well. Look here for more information --> [https://www.howtogeek.com/195430/how-to-create-a-strong-password-and-remember-it/](https://www.howtogeek.com/195430/how-to-create-a-strong-password-and-remember-it/)
2. Enable Two-Factor-Authentication (2FA) not only for your online brokerage account but also for the email account that is connected to your brokerage account. Remember, a hacker who has access to your email account can easily reset your online brokerage password. You can opt for receiving a text for your one-time authentication code or use an app like Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator. Here is a link for a blog post by RH --> [https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/best-practices/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/best-practices/)
3. Beware of phishing scams. Do not click on any link sent to your email. If you get an email asking you to input your username and password to ""verify it"", it is most likely a phishing attempt by someone trying to obtain your password.
4. Never login to your email account or online brokerage account from a public computer or even from a family or friends computer. You never know if their computers are compromised.
5. Always update the antivirus and firewalls on your computers to the latest version. I check my antivirus and Windows firewall for available updates every Sunday.
6. Never answer emails asking for your detailed information that could be used to steal your identity. Never provide your full SSN number on the phone or in e-mails or input it in online forms.
7. **MOST IMPORTANTLY -** protect your phone since it will have RH or other online brokerage app running and logged in. Change your login pin/password and remove alternate fingerprint or face ID logins of pets/husbands/wives/boyfriends/girlfriends/neighbor, etc. If your phone is lost or stolen, immediately wipe all data remotely and block your number.

For more information, refer to the SEC guide here --> [https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsonlinebrokeragehtm.html](https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsonlinebrokeragehtm.html)

**Edit-1**: adding good comments from u/SportTheFoole to the post -->  consider getting a password manager. I use LastPass at home and 1password at work. Both have the ability to generate secure passwords. I honestly have no idea what password I have for almost all of my logins. Most importantly: DO NOT REUSE YOUR PASSWORDS. Every site gets a different password so that if one is compromised, the damage is limited.

I would also say make sure your email account is secure (long, hard to guess password, 2FA). IMO, the most important account you have is your email account, because once that’s compromised an attacker can do a lot of damage (like click “forgot password” and have a new one emailed)."

1) BB has nothing to do with smartphones. Throw those 2007 notions out of your mind and bring yourself to the future

2) Whilst the whole stock market has been pissing themselves for years over EV/AV industry speculation, the reality is that these are hardware companies with low margin, and limited scale potential.

Even Tesla, owned and run by the richest man in the world, has yet to build more than 500,000 cars in one year. Meanwhile Tesla competitors springing up everywhere with both new challengers such as NIO and old money fucks getting into EV such as VW and GM (GM in December 2020 announced 100% by 2030 all cars would be 100% EV).

THE REAL FUCKING MONEY is not in EV production which has low margin and low scale, but in data monetization which is high margin (and being software) has unlimited scale. In the same way that Google makes only $18Bn revenue from hardware sales (phone, nest sales etc) but makes $120Bn from data monetization, $BB is going to to the fucking moon with $200BN revenue + by 2030 with 10% net whilst Tesla and other big auto are fighting over 4% margins (Tesla net profit in 2020 = 4% whilst **BB sat at a juicy 10.15%**).

This industry is going to the fucking moon, and BB is the only one with a front row ticket 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. This shit is like investing in Google or Amazon in the year 2000, by the time the mainstream saw the potential 5 years later, shit was already at pluto

u/just an everyday life couldn't have put it better: ""Zombie cars and QNX

QNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. What the fuck does that even mean nerd? For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.

Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.

Fast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot program but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?

SONY? Blackberry QNX. Baidu? QNX baby. XPENG? Blackberry as well. If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? Li Auto But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using Nvidia DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both Canoo and Hyundai makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.

You might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀""

3) BB is a cash flow positive, growing company with near nil competitors in an industry that is skyrocketing. Despite this, the boomer fucks who still believe BB is a smartphone company, have in their own glorious act of autism, have massively shorted BB bringing the share price down. 

BB is a growth company in a growth industry, these hedge funds are going to need to borrow more money if they want to buy tendies after the wider market realizes the market inefficiency that is an undervalued BB. u/Tradergurue went into a lot of detail in his $BB short interest post here [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short\_interest\_in\_bb\_its\_increasing/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short_interest_in_bb_its_increasing/) 

TLDR: hedge funds caught with their dicks in their hands are about to get Royally Fucked as the market corrects itself with a BB rise over the next month

“In a gamma squeeze, the price of a stock transiently increases based on an investor buying many options to drive up the prices of select stocks due to option sellers needing to hedge their trades on the underlying stocks. “

The reason gamma squeezes are even a thing is because of this.... They don’t have to own shares to sell you shares. Therefore not really costing them much. With options, because they are more riskier and more volatile they have to make sure they have those shares available. Which causes them to hedge those options. Thus costing them more than it would if they just sold you shares. 

Where the gamma squeeze actually happens is when you have multiple weeks of high options volume coupled with options expiring in the money. High volume call option purchasing drives the price up which In turn helps the upcoming expiring contracts to expire in the money causing them to be covered which causes the price to go up even more. Now one week of this most hedge funds can recover and regroup from but multiple weeks they cannot. Often times at this point (if the stock isnt already heavily shorted) any short positions begin doubling down often leading to the stock to be shorted. This is why gamma squeezes can lead to short squeezes (though not a guarantee)

I want you to understand the simple concept of what a gamma squeeze is, so you aren’t just expecting something you haven’t fully understood yet. More less just throwing money into a stock aimlessly. 

You may not like what I’m saying but anyone who knows anything about a gamma squeeze knows I’m telling the truth. I’m just simply wanting people to understand what a gamma squeeze actually is. And that each day that passes that option volume does not increase the less likely a gamma squeeze can happen. 

You can refuse to acknowledge the facts or you can simply understand the fundamentals of what a gamma squeeze is. A gamma squeeze is not something that magically happens, it’s happens with consecutive weeks a high volume of options investors with calls expiring in the money. Yes borrow interest, SSR, etc are all great things but those things alone don’t cause a gamma squeeze. Increased option volume forcing sellers to hedge the shares for those options is the very definition of a gamma squeeze. Borrow Interest, short available, SSR, etc aren’t some magic wand. They just set up the ability for a gamma squeeze to happen.

On another note...There is also a quadruple witching date coming up on 3/19 (if you don’t know what it is just type it in your google search engine and read) which adds to the possibility for a gamma squeeze to happen. The day alone doesn’t guarantee anything. In addition to that Friday was great and those FTD’s helped the possibility of a gamma squeeze but that alone won’t cause it. 

I honestly would imagine hedge funds laughing at people trying to gamma squeeze them without actually buying a lot of options. Actually I know they would be laughing at people trying to gamma squeeze them without buying a lot of options because you can’t have a gamma squeeze without buying a lot of options. It’s like trying to start a car with no gas. High volume of options investors is the gas for a gamma squeeze. Without gas (options investors) that car (gamma squeeze) goes no where. And if you only fill that car up once (FTD’s from last Friday 2/26/21) it’ll start, but it will only take you so far before it runs out of gas. 

I wouldn’t share this if I didn’t want to see all of the people that have invested money into AMC win. I want to see you guys win. It would be a sad day if I sat back while you hope for a gamma squeeze and not tell you what a gamma squeeze actually is. Great night apes!

This is not financial advice. Just a mere essay teaching gamma squeeze basics, class 101. Thanks to this community because every other community has silenced me. It’s really led me to believe that some of these communities are ran by hedge funds themselves trying to manipulate people and lead them astray. I had speculated that but the fact they delete my post explaining how to properly execute a gamma squeeze on certain Reddit and discord communities seems real sketchy to me. Again thanks!"
ly0d4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ly0d4m/how_to_beat_hedge_fund_algorithms_on_wsb_a/,How to beat hedge fund algorithms on WSB: a proposal,1216,306,2021-03-05 09:08:34,"Hey guys,

So recently I was thinking..

Hedge funds want to protect themselves from a future GME incident and have obviously developed algorithms to essentially parse through WSB and see what stocks are gaining momentum. The problem is that it’s extremely easy to parse through Reddit and find what post has a lot of upvotes and capture which stock ticker is mentioned. So, I was thinking why not make it more difficult for these bots (potentially causing further headaches for these hedgies) 

Why don’t we create a program that converts text to images that can’t be parsed so easily.. kind of like a captcha system that bots can’t easily win. This will make it way more difficult to parse and we can get a time advantage. As we know timing is essential here. 

Obviously, it’s easy for hedge funds to hire actual people to search through WSB and find the next stock that gains momentum; but that takes significantly more time; there has to be a solution here too .. I just don’t know what it is.

Whatever the case, I WONT be surprised if hedge funds are hiring people right now to write the code to go through Reddit to protect themselves. Let’s at least give them a major headache!


Edit: sharing ideas on a forum shouldn’t be illegal. Algos manipulating stock prices and hurting retail traders should be ILLEGAL. I want to be able to share ideas to real humans and not bots designed to fuck us over. That’s all I’m saying.

Edit #2: Potentially we can use ReCaptcha something that’s has been out for a long time (Google has developed this over many years) before allowing access to any DD.

Edit #3: I really like this suggestion by /u/TheLegendDevil: “One way to beat them would be a browser plugin that changes your comment before posting to make all words that are close to being a ticker actually a ticker. Easy way to one way encode messages and humans should still be able to decipher what stock they were actually talking about.”"

Analysts are cautiously optimistic, because the valuation is high but the prospects also very high so it's hard to put a price tag, just like buying a house when the market's hot:  
[https://www.thestreet.com/investing/snowflake-gets-cautious-support-from-analysts](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/snowflake-gets-cautious-support-from-analysts)  
At $71B market cap/$250 share, and a nearly 2X growth prospect, that's 70X 2021 earnings 35X 2022, 20X 2023... Maybe we can assume growth slows around 5B to 10B aka 10% of TAM.

* Does the employee lock up really matter ?

Lockup ends this week. The vast majority of the shares are held by VCs, the CEO & founders, etc. the hands of a very few. Those shares will likely never see the market, as they're controlling shares. Original B shares had also 10 voting rights, and needed to be converted to single voting right A shares to trade, but it looks like they're disolving this structure. Will these billionaires sell lots of shares? no. And if they do they'll have to disclose. Snowflake has few employees and they don't hold that many shares so would they really influence the market selling? Also would they sell at $250 lows? Is this deadline just FUD fuel?  


* I like the stock.

I'm personally very bullish on the company's future. I like its culture  and the product, I  trust the founders who've worked hand in hand with the angel investor VCs along the way, and I believe they're passionate about the company and product. IDK about the CEO who was brought in later - because of his track record. There's tons of ex Oracle employees working there who understand the business and the customers (it's a customer centric company).  
For me their product is this : it's a classic SQL OLAP database in the cloud that's elastic, with easy management, which has many plugins to do data mining and AI, and fine controls for sharing securely parts of tables (that's big for security inside a company AND for selling data). It is secure enough to be certified to hold medical (HIPAA) and banking data (CapitalOne!). It's also an ""ACID"" transactional database, and its SQL language superset is rich enough to facilitate migration from other vendors like Terradata, Redshift, Oracle, etc. That'll be key to migrate customers from legacy on-prem solutions to cloud.  
Unfortunately it is not an OLTP database so it can't tap customers sensitive to query latency. It's also likely not the fastest to store and manipulate text like logs, though it can handle large JSON and XML data fine, it shines in columnar data.  
Why it's hot I think is it bring old school SQL to the next century as a compatibility story, where other map-reduce cloud solutions failed to become ubiquitous because it was too hard to migrate.  
The big 3 (AMZ, GOOG, MSFT) provide similar offerings BUT AFAIK, they do so packaging old school on-prem databases into cloud servers, so it's a kludge to make it work and the customer ends up dealing with it when they try to use the scalable ""elastic"" part, aka hiring very skilled DBA engineers. There's a reason SNOW customers like the product, stick there and buy more. It's not just because it's cheaper, it's also easier.  
Databases are the foundations to build on top of, and all businesses need to buy strong foundations, SNOW is such an offering with a few years of lead time vs competition in terms of tech. I believe the addressable market (TAM) is like many 10's or 100's of billions estimated with a handful of big players. ""Big data"" and ""cloud"" have been buzz words since Y2K, but that revolution happening now.  
I have a feeling Snow was at the sweet spot: not too early that it needs to justify why you want to buy the product, and not too late to justify why to use them vs other established vendors. I feel it will be one of the mammoths. :)  


* Why I care?

I am overweight on those shares and I need to decide when to sell & diversify my savings. I still feel Snow might be the next CRM or ORCL growth story, but did it just start too hot? Will it go back to $420 within a few month? How good do the news have to be? I certainly don't feel I want to sell at $250, it feels I could be on a rocket's passenger seat waiting for liftoff and I don't want to miss that... At $350? Hmmm... maybe I'm willing to miss some of the liftoff, and diversify to protect myself if SNOW actually trips :P At $420? I definitely would diversify.  


* Palantir

IDK why there's way more hype on Palantir than snowflake on reddit, and why they're compared so much. Maybe it's PLTR's valuation? What's Palantir's addressable market and its competition? Palantir I feel is more of an end user product to do analytics with custom plumbing behind, but I don't really understand their business  value add and how it's different from say Looker or Tableau, and if Palantir's value add is relevant if the data is in a database format compatible with standard tools, which should be the case for most non-gov customers."

After a long hiatus (banned for mentioning a SPAC that went from 10 to 60 back to 24, and AMC before it was 1 billion in value). I have returned for the next big opportunity. Honestly there are a few with the recent route in the market, but here is opportunity #1 in my opinion based on technical and internal financial information.

Alibaba ticker BABA: But OP, china risk, and regulation, and it’s down 26.25% from its high of $317.14! STFU and keep reading:

[Alibaba Group Holding Ltd - ADR (BABA : NYSE) Stock Price & News - Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/BABA:NYSE?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijpci4gZfvAhUaGVkFHT4EDsoQ3ecFMAB6BAgGEBo)

Yup that’s why I love the company. Alibaba posted better than expected earnings beating on top and bottom with growth YOY 36% yeah that’s amazing. Because fundamentally nothing has changed. It’s current P/e is an amazingly low 25.93x yes, a company growing 30% YOY is trading below its growth rate and further the sector average P/e is 49.18x Now I know we are fucking retarded here so based on basic math BABA is valued at half of its competitors. That’s a buy signal alone as if it can reach the same valuation; get ready: it doubles from this price.

But OP China is going to regulate big Chinese tech! No, China wants to be the leader in tech and can’t afford to cut the legs from its largest most profitable companies. The recent “NEWS” on the clamping down of its tech companies is in my opinion noise. Think of it this way: When FB was fined in the EU they fined FB $122 Million dollars. Ouch. (But not really because: day do be rich doh! FB is in a similar BABA spot in the USA I like it too) China’s fine to Alibaba? 76k [China Fines Alibaba, Tencent Unit Under Anti-Monopoly Laws - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/china-fines-alibaba-tencent-for-flouting-rules-in-past-deals) Yeah… that’s a serious reprimand… This is classic China manipulation of their publicly traded companies to reduce the price before they rocket higher. They do this very often in the penny stock area of the market. This time they just went bigger. ANT ipo? Still on, they just are requiring higher cash reserves for the lending arm. What does that mean? It means that the loans provided by ANT will have better backing and will be less likely for default. Further ANT deals with digital money and the people’s republic of china government has already said they are looking to Alibaba to help roll out with a digital yuan. See what’s going on here? China is publicly reprimanding a company that it is actively working with to bring in the future. [MYbank, backed by Alibaba's Ant Group, joins China's digital yuan pilot (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/mybank-backed-by-alibabas-ant-group-joins-chinas-digital-yuan-pilot.html)

Ignore the noise, ignore the “Smart Money” they have a time horizon of 2 weeks. We have the time horizon of DIAMONDS!!

My position is 6 BABA 280p sold short at $61 I also have 5 credit spreads 290/300p

TL:DR BABA could double based on its current valuation and the fact that it continues to grow, is picked by government to work on digital currency roll out and its low P/e"

OTGLY/CDR",15,15,2021-03-04 19:11:27,"CD Projekt has lost about 50% from the top because of the terrible launch of Cyberpunk 2077 and a hack. But let’s look at what has actually happened. 

**You will find a TL DR at the bottom.**

 &nbsp;

**Sales of Cyberpunk 2077**

Sure the game was buggy as hell on release and Sony is yet to put it back on its stores (you can still buy the physical copy) but the PC + Xbox version sold well even after refunds and it’s still selling on Xbox store. Also if you look at the independent PC reviews (not count the outlets that always give AAA games 10/10) it was still very well received so if they manage to fix the console version we could very well see the sales pick up for consoles.

The facts are that 12 days after launch they had sold over 13m copies of which 10.8m (80% coming from PC sales) was estimated to be digital, which would make it the largest digital launch ever. This is a big deal because digital sales earn them a much higher margin, for example steam takes 20%(+50m$ sales) while physical stores take 40-50%. These numbers include the first 8 days of refunds which arguably would be the lion’s share of total refunds.

Currently on Steam its still #20 of bestselling games (removing free to play and special offers), if you only look at games costing +30€ then its #7, #5 for +40€, in fact it was the bestselling game for 7 weeks in a row on Steam and it’s still selling for full price. On GOG.com its currently #2 and still full price. On Epic Store its #6 and full price, in other words the game is still selling well on PC and still going for full price. So the sales have not been bad in any way, its possible that’s it could have been even better than good, of course it could have been fucking stellar record breaking shit had they not released a buggy mess but still not bad sales in any way.

So let’s run some simple numbers and lets be very conservative, lest say they only sold standard editions and no €250 collectors editions. Let’s also say that as of today with refunds they only sold 12m digital and 3m physical copies. For retail let’s say the revenue split was 50% and for digital 25% (Steam 20%, GOG 0%, Epic 12%, Xbox 30%, PS 30%). This gives us €690m in revenue and that’s more than all revenues from 2012-2019 combined and that’s just for 3 months of Cyberpunk sales. This gives us a PE of roughly 7 as a worst case scenario.

https://www.pcgamesn.com/cyberpunk-2077/steam-top-seller-player-count

 &nbsp;

**The hack**

Source code was stolen but that’s not a financial loss because a Witcher or Cyberpunk knockoff is not a substitute in any way. The hack has pushed back the second patch about 2 weeks so that’s 2 weeks of lost dev time, make that 2 months and its still not a big issue financially. Add another 4, 5 or 6 months of extra dev time for patches (due to buggy release) and we are still talking peanuts. Also remember it won’t be the full dev team working on patches, just a parts of the original team.

Lost trust and reputation loss has a minimal affect of future sales in this business. EA, Zenimax, UbiSoft, Activision to name a few have been shitting on gamers for a long time now with unfinished games riddled with micro transactions and gamers still come back every time for their fix. FOMO is too great.

 &nbsp;

**The hidden gem**

Now let’s look at what’s actually in front of us and that is something I believe many have missed. I’m sure most that follow the stock knows about the Witcher Netflix series and the Witcher mobile game, by them self’s they are alright but together they could be explosive.

The Witcher Netflix series was a fucking successes and the next season is almost done and will be released this year. The first season also boosted sales of the PC games. Its production is independent of the game studio so it won’t be affected by it. 

The Witcher mobile game being developed by a separate studio from the one working on PC/Console so once again not affected by Cyberpunk problems. The game is basically a Pokemon Go copy and it has been in open beta for 6 months. The reviews on app store are very good, 4.5 and version 0.9 was released a month ago. They released the beta on version 0.6 and they got to 0.9 in 5 months so I think the game is basically done and they are just waiting for the right timing to release it.

https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/the-witcher-monster-slayer/id1509704647

I believe their strategy is for a simultaneous launch or maybe a week or two apart, hoping that the series popularity will bring tons of players to the mobile game and mobile games like that make filthy amounts  money, it won’t make Pokemon Go money  but even a small amount of that would be filthy amounts. 

One could however look at another AR game connected to a popular franchise, namely Harry Potter and say that it wasn’t popular why should this one be? Well to start of that game missed its timing as it was released far after the franchises popularity peak. Secondly I would argue that a larger base of the Witcher fans are gamers compared to Harry Potter fans. Thirdly that game was aggressively monetized and CD Projekt are known to take it easy on monetization which is more profitable in the long run.

 &nbsp;

**M&A**

A third thing worth mentioning is the increasing amounts of M&A happening in this segment and CD Projekt is juicy target, it is almost the only large studio left that has not been acquired as a whole or in part by any of the large players, almost all other large studios have either been acquired or have large shareholder like for example Tencent. Possible buyers could be Amazon or Google, they have both been trying to get into the gaming industry and failed with their in-house efforts. Other buyers are any of the large Chinese players and even Sony after Microsoft bought Zenimax to protect Playstation from Xbox, but this one is a bit of a long shot now that Sony is a bit pissed of at CD Projekt.

 &nbsp;

**So whats the price target?** 

Well the top was not fair value but this bottom sure as hell is not. I feel based on the known revenue from Cyberpunk and the estimated sales based on bestseller ranking we can assume that it is bringing in good money and will continue to do so for the coming years also we must account for some delays for upcoming projects. But all in all I feel a drop of 20-30% would have been fair not the 50% we have seen. So yesterday it closed at 228 down from a top of roughly 450 and my target is somewhere between 300-350.

 &nbsp;

**TL DR**

Based on available data, sales are not a fail, more than all the revenue combined from 2012-2019 on very conservative estimates, it gives us a PE of roughly 7 for just 3 months worth of Cyberpunk sales.

The Hack has limited financial impact, a month of dev time.

Lost dev time for fixing Cyberpunk is also of limited financial impact even if its 9 months as it will not be the entire dev team for all that time.

The combination of Netflix The Witcher Season 2 and the mobile game The Wither Monster Hunt has the possibility to be a fat cash cow.

An increased chance as of late to be acquired in part or as a whole by large conglomerates.

Price target of 300-350, now trading at 230"

While everyone was crying about the market taking a shit and RKT crashing ([I was crying too](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx7mlz/rkt_12k_114k_17k/)) it was announced ZNGA acquired a game studio, [Echtra Games](https://venturebeat.com/2021/03/03/zynga-acquires-diablo-co-creators-echtra-games-in-expansion-to-pc-and-consoles/), whose creator and his team played a pivital role in Diablo/Diablo II. They were acquired with the goal to help Zynga move into PC/cross-platform game play. I think this is a promising acquisition with lots of future potential and is just [one of many planned for this year](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/zynga-q4-earnings/).

The CEO of Zynga also spoke at a conference with Morgan Stanley today. Below are some excerpts he said during the call that I found interesting .

&#x200B;

**Well known established global IP + data driven iteration + proven game mechanics =** 🚀

>We like to learn from what we've done before. And in the case of Harry Potter that was a big element of it. One of the things that we learned was we needed an intellectual property in a world that was appealing to a much larger audience and a much more global audience, so that a lot of the cool game play features that we had could reach a bigger audience. So we combined a new IP with some proven mechanics that we'd been messing around with. And then we tested it for a very long period of time and test markets. That's really the structural difference between mobile and console.  
>  
>In mobile, you can really test market something to remove a lot of the introduction risk. And so with Harry Potter that was something that we did as we went into whether it was Australia or Canada, we were testing very specific elements of what makes for a successful game. Does it retain? Does it engage? What's the conversion rates? Does the UA scale against what the cost of acquisition is? And so, we thoroughly put Harry Potter through its test marketing phases. And what we're really excited about was first and foremost the reception from fans was phenomenal.  
>  
>We saw - the ratings were very strong. The Harry Potter fans were raving about it. It went really viral. We did some fun stuff with Zayn Malik. And it really had really a lot of nice momentum out of the launch. But then when it started to hit weeks 14, 30 and beyond, all the testing that we had done about what were the retention rates engagements, we were exceeding them. So it was actually really positive to see that the test marketing worked and that was a critical part of the success here.

The Harry Potter IP is a money machine. If you can integrate the game mechanics that get people to continually make micro transactions, or spend hours playing, combined with a raving fan base of an established global IP, imo this is going to print money for them.

The Harry Potter game was [launched on Sep/23](https://investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-launches-harry-potter-puzzles-spells-worldwide). I think we could see a lift in revenue in the coming quarters from this game.

&#x200B;

**2 Upcoming Game Releases in the First Half**

They're targeting 2 new game releases in the first half ""Puzzle Combat"" and ""FarmVille 3"".

**On Puzzle Combat**

>So as we think about releasing Puzzle Combat in the first half, I wouldn't necessarily set the expectations that this is a theatrical movie model where it's - a Marvel movie that comes out at summer and it's got this huge spike. That's not at all the model here, right. We're in this for the long-term. This is a marathon, not a sprint. And so, we're going to be releasing the game, see how it settles in and then very methodically start acquiring based on what we're seeing in the dynamics and the metrics.

**On FarmVille**

>And, there are a lot of fans that have tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of people had played FarmVille over the years. And when we think about all of those fans and what their expectations are and how to bring them into a new experience, we’ve doing a lot of testing. We’re also running a bunch of FarmVille games right now, whether it’s Country Escape or Tropic Escape, which has a very big fan base and they love the game.  
>  
>And so it’s a little bit more complicated to navigate some of the pre-set expectations, but what we’ve done is really build out a terrific new experience and experience that is unlike LA. It has things that are familiar to people that have played FarmVille in the past, but it’s got a lot of unique new elements to it, and a new look and feel that feels very modern and very cutting edge for what we believe mobile games really are these days.

Puzzle Combat is more of a long play, and I like these types of strategies mixed in with shorter term plays. Zynga seems to have a healthy balance of this, which I really like.

What I think Zynga does well is tailoring their games to the fan base. I think FV3 is going to be a fresh reboot of the beloved game by its fans with new elements to keep users engaged.

&#x200B;

**Expansion into cross-platform gaming**

As mentioned, they acquired Echtra to boost their expansion into cross-platform gaming. Unrelated to the acquisition, one of the first cross-platform titles later this year will be Star Wars Hunters.

&#x200B;

>Yeah. I think if you take a step back and look at the industry overall, some of the largest franchises in the world right now are cross-platform, and they’re free to play in many cases with seasons passes and things like Fortnite, Pub G, Engine Impact, a lot of people have been talking about how the console developers getting into mobiles the thing. Well, I think that door swings both ways. I think mobile developers can actually step into the cross-platform mega franchise part of the market, because of a few reasons.

&#x200B;

Regarding the team they acquired:

&#x200B;

>I think the last point I’d make on cross-platform is that. We’re just getting started in this. So the acquisition of Echtra is really a key one for us, because ultimately game quality is a function of game team talent and leadership. And when you look at these guys, they’ve worked on RPGs for up their whole careers. They’ve worked on Diablo, they helped to create Torchlight, which is a fantastic IP and the action RPG category. They’ve actually published games cross-platform. It’s a team less than 50 in San Francisco right near our shop.

I think if the launch of Star Wars Hunters goes well in the second half of the year then I think it's possible we see a nice upward movement on the price.

&#x200B;

**Becoming a first party ads platform cutting out third party platforms like Google/Apple**

&#x200B;

>...mid-point the last year, we started looking at the fact that we were one of the premier advertisers in gaming. All of our games are enabled for IAP and IAA. But between the time that they saw an ad and they ended up in our game, we had it was kind of opaque, right. We worked with other parties – other third particles or use other third-parties like, Iron Source or Unity app and Google, Facebook, and the third-parties were handling a lot of the information and a lot of the acquisition. And then we looked at our first party data asset, which is the data that we were generating around what a player was doing inside of our games.  
>  
>And that was tremendously valuable, but we were missing that piece of it. And so when we looked at it, we said, wait a second. If we do a couple of things here, we can capture the 15% to 30% we’re paying partners right now, just to manage the exchanges. We would get more information about what’s hot, and what’s not at the top of the funnel in terms of what’s appealing? What’s not appealing? What companies or products are doing better and why? We would be able to creatively optimize our products better. We ended in a post IDFA world that would all become first party data. The big issue with privacy is what is one party exchanging to another party about an individual, right? But if you enter one network and you have a good exchange of what your permissions are, you carry through that whole process in a high fidelity way from a data standpoint.  
>  
>And so when we looked at it from multiple directions, we're like, wow, we can margin expand, we can pick up more efficiency in our UA dollars and in our advertising business. We could grow our advertising business faster and we could generate potentially a competitive advantage and information superiority, just knowing more about the players coming into our walled garden or into our platform than the next guy.  
>  
>We felt like this was something that we could go after. We went through a very diligent process of breaking down what these look like.

This really sticks out to me. Zynga was 1 step ahead from the new pivot by Apple/Google on stronger ad tracking privacy. They're becoming the ads exchange where companies pay for displaying ads in games. This also gives them an advantage on learning what's working for others and apply that to their business model.

*DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR AND NONE OF THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE*

Firstly i want to talk about the recent spike in OCUGEN stock price, this was due to a tweet by OCUGEN saying positive thing about there covid-19 partners and the cure itself. This was followed buy HUGE spike in stock price and great VOLUME for the stock. The trading day ended with OCUGEN up 9% and it's currently up 4% pre-market/after-hours.

Ok, lets get to the real potential behind OCUGEN stock in 3 scenarios.

1. The company and there partners successfully develop a viable COVID-19 cure. I can see OCUGEN stock price going $27+ if this is the case.

2. The company does not find success in developing the COVID-19 cure. If this was the case the stock might fall down to $4 a share.

3. If the company develops the COVID-19 cure and make it commercial. If this is the case i can see the stock go up $38.50 give or take some.


Fundamentals, OCUGEN as a company does not have great fundamentals, for example the revenue is almost non-existent and only a decent DTAR ( debt to asset ratio ) of no more than 40%. ""So why us this stock so great"" you ask, let me tell you about a little something called BIOPHARMA AND BIO-FUCKING-TECHNOLGY. lets talk about Biopharam, so biopharma or BP is a a biological macromolecule or cellular component, such as a blood product, used as a pharmaceutical. Now this sector is growing at a very fast rate, and this will be the biggest sector in 2026 by far. And  Biotechnology is a broad area of biology, involving the use of living systems and organisms to develop or make products. ... The term biotechnology was first used by Karl Ereky in 1919, meaning the production of products from raw materials with the aid of living organisms. Yes i copied this from Google. 


ANYWAY, my price target for ocugen in on friday is $16.50

Probably everyone has heard about a saying “buy the dip”. I know many believe it is a risky strategy, but there are plenty of research suggesting that over sustained time it might be profitable and sound strategy. For example, this one: [https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/documents/MI-Research-QR-Buying-the-Dip-180522.pdf](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/documents/MI-Research-QR-Buying-the-Dip-180522.pdf) . Below are the results of back testing 2002 -2016 data:

https://preview.redd.it/ul5eb2a73wk61.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=e77a04df316cdb82863263a98623c7b97f135521

If you read the paper, you will find that these returns can be improved by using additional screening criteria and company fundamentals. Conclusion from there: “A sharp decline in stock price can signal an investment opportunity if investors can accurately identify which dip to buy and when to buy it. It is important to note that no one indicator can ever constitute a solid investment decision on its own, and BTD is no exception to this rule. In this paper, we examine several factors that may be used to improve the profitability of the BTD strategy. Our empirical analysis shows that institutional ownership level, stock price trend, and company valuation can all contribute to the overall success of the BTD strategy.”

Now all of this is cool and dandy, but how to identify those stocks? There are plenty of market screeners, that can show you biggest losers of the day, but how to know at what point dip the bottom? Well, que in support points. Some say that using support points is same as predicting future from stars or cards, but somehow dips always find their bottom and more often than not it’s somewhere around previous low points. I could not find any freely available tool, that could show me tickers that dropped to their support points (admittedly I haven’t looked for very long), so decided to build my own – The Dippinator.

I wanted something that gives me a lot of info in a single screen and where I could check the latest news or public opinion about the ticker to get the sentiment behind it. Took me a few weeks and now I have result – a tool that drops me an email notification when ticker meets certain conditions and falls below 3rd support point. To calculate these points, I’m using the following formulas:

1. Pivot point (PP) = (High + Low + Close) / 3.
2. First resistance (R1) = (2 x PP) – Low.
3. First support (S1) = (2 x PP) – High.
4. Second resistance (R2) = PP + (High – Low)
5. Second support (S2) = PP – (High – Low)
6. Third resistance (R3) = High + 2(PP – Low)
7. Third support (S3) = Low – 2(High – PP)

Conditions:

1. Ticker dropped below third support point and possible gain if it reaches 1st resistance point >25%
2. Liquidity: AVG volume + Today’s Volume must be more than 1kk
3. Market Cap >50kk

Have been running it for 5 market days. It has identified 326 events meeting the criteria above. Investing same amount ($100) in all of them would have yielded below results. These does not take into account a possibility that position could be sold before close at higher point.

https://preview.redd.it/mpc6b4s93wk61.png?width=226&format=png&auto=webp&s=2468ea3e530bce4f7ee625b5cab6334bcd378522

Obviously, I don’t have enough resources to buy each event, but I have made some day trades and ended up with 14% gain (my biggest gains were from PLTR and FGEN). Combination of notification from tool and some manual screening should always give better results as some companies deserve to fall into oblivion. Furthermore, last 5 market days had a lot of volatility, so it might not be very representative of future performance.

I’m sharing all of this, because I think there is a possibility to use Dippinator as a pointer where to look. Problem is that I might be missing something and would like to hear your ideas, suggestions or critique. On red days it bombards with notifications. For example on 23rd of Feb I got 142 notifications (it kind of also helps to see early on the trend for the day).

Currently I’m scanning total of 5k tickers from US markets and data is refreshed every 4 minutes. Once ticker below 3rd support point is identified I get below notification. Example is end of the day 2nd of March. I will break it down bit by bit.

What do you think? What other indicators would be useful? I know it’s not very pretty 😊I also might be slightly retarded.

Will post today’s results after the day close, but few minutes into market open received 68 notifications. It might be very red day…

If we become rich, we take over the golfing scene. If we don't, hedge funds will always be golfers. Also, NBA Top Shot collectibles (NFT bullshit) are in a crazy demand rn and that just dropped 2-3 months ago.

1. Covid Shut Down Everything and Introduced People To Camping - At my former tech job I worked with a lot of data and one thing I noticed around Covid time is that there was a huge spike for searches related to campers and camping. Check Google trends for ""Camper"" ""RV"" etc and look at it on a 5 year horizon. The growth is explosive in the camping market. Camping is a hobby that once people get into it, they typically continue to do it just has a high barrier to get people to try the first time.

I've even seen this reflected in my everyday interactions with friends and family. I had several friends and family recently purchase new or used RVs or campers so they could get out of the city to do stuff during COVID. These were people that NEVER camped before in their lives and now they regularly take out a camper or an RV. There is huge new demand from this market and the reports from the dealers have been extremely positive. Look around your friends and family and odds are you will see the same. (This strategy of paying attention to what people are starting to buy is from One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch)

2) Millennials and younger people love travel vans and tiny houses which are basically a form of a camper - Many times the best products are ones that are simply reintroduced to the public under different marketing. Look at foam mattresses. These were actually around in the 1980s but were recently introduced with better marketing by Casper and took off. My thesis is that an RV/Camper is basically better than a tiny house in every way and Winnebago sells premade travel Vans. Why build a tiny house when you could instead invest in a used RV which has decades of user feedback to perfect these small living units on wheels?

Also I've seen some people my age (29) who can work from home who have been traveling the nation in a camper while they work. They spend a week in each town/RV park and work out of their camper during the day.

3) Valuation - Right now Winnebago trades at a market cap of $2.45B so it's definitely a small cap and has a P/E ratio of 23.5 vs the S&P 500 average of \~39 currently. Given their recent great earnings for the past two quarters and their very solid continued growth prospects this seems like the stock should be trading much higher imo. Now this isn't a short squeeze situation where you are going to get 90% gains overnight but I'm looking at a solid return over the next 12 months.

Disclosure: This idea is retarded but I'm very long WGO. Also this likely applies to other camper/RV companies but I'm not as familiar with them. I'm from Iowa so I know a decent amount about management and how WGO is run so I feel the most confident with them.  


Next earnings are scheduled for March 24th"

It beat last quarter’s earnings by 2.4x predictions, and upcoming earnings will be the catalyst needed to make ASO skyrocket. Guns are a major part of their sales, and January 2021 had the 3rd highest single-month gun sales recorded in US history.

\-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

**Fundamental Analysis:**

**Gun Sales**

Academy Sports and Outdoors is focused on selling hunting, fishing, and camping equipment. A major point of interest in this company is its gun sales. So long as ASO continues to go down the path of marketing and selling guns, they will continue to grow, especially in todays climate. Gun sales are up in January from previous months, with the third-highest monthly total of gun sales on record ([Gun sales surged 80 percent in January, data shows - The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/03/gun-sales-january-background-checks/)). On top of that, the number of NICS Firearm Background Checks is up 30.53% from last year’s monthly average, from 3,307,943 background checks per month in 2020 to 4,317,804 in January 2021 ([NICS Firearm Checks: Month/Year — FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf/view)).

CEO Ken Hicks claims that many people picked up new hobbies such as hunting, fishing, and camping, which has helped drive sales. And if only 20-30% of those people continue with those hobbies, it will greatly help their sales ([Academy Sports CEO says hobbies acquired during COVID will continue to drive sales in 2021 - MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/academy-sports-ceo-says-hobbies-acquired-during-covid-will-continue-to-drive-sales-in-2021-11608054715)). Especially if many are scared of future potential gun restrictions created by the Democrat-controlled Congress, now could be a time where we see a surge of gun purchases before any restrictions are made, which would drive ASO sales.

Location-wise, ASO is in the perfect position to continue making sales year-round. Located in the South, people can continue their outdoor activities throughout the winter, providing ASO with sales when it may not otherwise have been able to if it were located further north.

&#x200B;

**IPO and Leadership**

In 2011, KKR bought out ASO, however, ASO recently went public on October 2, 2020. Led by CEO Ken Hicks, ASO is well-positioned to continue boosting its sales. As CEO at Foot Locker, Hicks helped reverse three years of negative same-store sales, and he brings his experience in other executive positions to the table ([Academy Sports + Outdoors Announces Ken C. Hicks as Chairman and CEO - ASO](http://corporate.academy.com/academy-sports-outdoors-announces-ken-c-hicks-as-chairman-and-ceo/index.html)).

ASO is clearly focused on growth, rather than maintenance. Effective Jan 29, 2021, ASO eliminated the COO position at ASO “in order to create a more efficient operating structure and focus on key strategic priorities” ([Academy Sports eliminates COO role - MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/academy-sports-eliminates-coo-role-2021-01-21)). It is focused on increasing its efficiency and sales. This is also indicated by the fact that it just went public, meaning it intends to use the money gained from its public offering to help grow the company.

&#x200B;

**Stimulus Bill**

The $1.9 trillion stimulus bill that was passed by the House on Feb 2, 2021, would be a huge boost to the company if it were to pass the Senate. This is not exclusive to ASO, but it would help the overall economy, and give more disposable income for people to spend, and help boost sales.

&#x200B;

[Financials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14d-1TgdKxr_Bz1f3yDdQ6Uclt04MxzXJivPQmDEUirw/edit?usp=sharing) **(obtained from Yahoo Finance; click title for link to spreadsheet)**

This is a key part of my valuation of ASO. It displays how criminally undervalued ASO is a company relative to the market as a whole, as well as its competitors. I have linked a google spreadsheet to this post that shows several key indicators as to why ASO is undervalued relative to its competitors. I will compare ASO’s financials to Dick’s Sporting Goods, as they are the most similar competitor.

ASO’s trailing P/E ratio is currently 10.82, as compared to DKS’ 17.56

ASO’s forward P/E is 9.78, as compared to DKS’ 14.9

ASO’s P/S (ttm) is 0.41, as compared to DKS’ 0.74

ASO’s P/B (mrq) is 2.29, as compared to DKS’ 3.15

Additionally, its most recent actual earnings (0.91 eps) were 2.4x its predicted earnings (0.39 eps), and its predicted earnings for next quarter are 0.48 eps, still well below last quarters earnings ([ASO 23.96 -0.78 -3.13% : Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. - Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ASO?p=ASO)).

&#x200B;

**Debt**

ASO’s debt is one of their few worrisome financial indicators. They have a great deal of debt, with their debt to equity ratio sitting at 272.59 (as compared to DKS’ 150.66). However, ASO has already designated around $200 million obtained from their IPO to help pay off some debt ([Is This Retail IPO a Winner? | The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/17/is-this-retail-ipo-a-winner/)). They also have the ability to pay off short-term debt, so I do not see this as a company that will likely go bankrupt. Their current ratio (mrq) is 1.61 and although this is significantly lower than many other gun-related companies, it is actually lower than DKS’ 1.4, which shows that they do in fact have the ability to show off their short-term debt.

&#x200B;

**Short Interest**

While I am not a fan of solely using short interest as an indicator to invest in a stock, it can still be a helpful tool. According to [S3 Research](https://www.shortsight.com/category/s3-research/), ASO’s short interest as a percentage of its float is 28.18%, as compared to DKS’ 14.97%. Both of these are fairly high, and show that there is great short interest against both these companies. Although I strongly believe that there will not be a sudden short squeeze, over time I believe that sustained stock price growth will force investors to cover their short positions, and will definitely help fuel ASO’s stock price growth.

\-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

**Technical Analysis:**

ASO has been following a strict channel since its IPO in October as seen below. It has bounced off support and resistance multiple times, but still remains in this channel. ASO is currently hitting the bottom of the channel, and I believe it will soon bounce back. This is a perfect stock for MMs to manipulate and keep in this channel, with small volume and sizeable bid-ask spread:

https://preview.redd.it/lf1ye790duk61.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=408a12894490a9040f3a6a095b6cc96caa354cf2

&#x200B;

This channel has major support. At the end of January 2020, ASO announced its secondary offering, and the stock price plummeted, only to hit support and bounce right back:

https://preview.redd.it/wpq6m5v1duk61.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3578e028b55e3d721fa36273148b3872d113a9e

This channel has some crazy support, and ASO is the perfect stock for MMs. It has a low volume, high bid-ask spread, and high institutional ownership (sitting at about 75%).

EDIT: Forgot to link ""Financials"" section to my spreadsheet

EDIT 2: AutoMod is deleting my comments because I don't have enough karma for some reason, so I will try to respond to some of your questions here:

1.) For charting, I use TD Ameritrade's Thinkorswim.

2.) I have noticed multiple people questioning ASO because it is nearing its ATH. Just because it is nearing its ATH does not mean that it cannot go higher. I do not believe that its old ATH is an accurate valuation of the company, and so I believe it will break through that price. As u/uncowisdo pointed out in the comments, Amazon's ATH was $70 at one point.

3.) Someone also asked why I have 3/19 and 4/16 calls if my target price of $30 is dated 5/1. This is because I bought them before I knew the earnings report date (and I still don't believe they have officially announced it as 4/8 yet). Also, their costs were relatively low compared to the potential upside. And being the idiot that I am, I only know how to buy and not sell, so I will be holding onto them.

&#x200B;

EDIT 3: I just bought 4 more ASO $30c 7/16 this morning for an average price of $421, so now I have a total of 15.

lwrbfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwrbfm/dd_nokia/,DD: Nokia,133,83,2021-03-03 19:06:11," Nokia's Networks Margin Situation:  


In 2021, networks division is projected to have 0% profit margin.  
In 2020, Nokia's networks division had higher than imagined margins due to product cost reductions as ReefShark shipments of 43% was well above the targeted 35%. This resulted in an excellent earnings report.  
The type of results Nokia achieved in 2020 should have caused the stock to soar but it didn't as the Verizon loss was very significant for Nokia and it will cause a ""challanging 2021"" per Pekka Lundmark.  


Having said that, if in 2021, the 70% ReefShark shipment goal is exceeded, it would be a giant step towards having better than 0% margins. There will be top and bottom line pressures due to Verizon loss and increased R&D spending. However, each 1 percent point increase in Networks margin means about 100 million Euros in pure profit (directly goes to the bottom line since expenses are largely fixed). Each additional profit margin increment means higher EPS which has almost perfect correlation with the share price.  


Networks division has the following customer types:  
CSPs (such as Verizon): 18 billion Euros  
Enterprise: 1.6 billion Euros  
Licensees: 1.4 billion Euros  
Other (ASN and RFS): 861 million Euros  


The unfortunate situation we are in is the CSP revenues are going down. Since, North America is a favorable region for margins, Verizon loss will cause a higher damage to Nokia's profitability than say if they lost a Latin American customer.  
YoY constant currency revenue change for the CSP subset is -5%. Since this is the biggest subset of Nokia, it is obviously causing all the problems we are facing today.  


However, the big opportunity here is the Enterprise market. It is relatively small as of 2020. However, within just a few months, if my memory serves me right, Nokia increased its Enterprise customers from 70 to 260 (probably a lot more now. We'll see in Q1 2021 earnings report. I am very interested in this number as it might not only negate the CSP concerns for the upcoming years, but it might become a giant revenue and margin provider for Nokia.)  


[https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/07/21/nokia-announces-first-commercial-5g-standalone-sa-private-wireless-networking-solutions-for-enterprise-customers/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/07/21/nokia-announces-first-commercial-5g-standalone-sa-private-wireless-networking-solutions-for-enterprise-customers/)  


[https://www.nokia.com/blog/the-future-of-enterprise/](https://www.nokia.com/blog/the-future-of-enterprise/)  


As of 2020, Enterprise subset revenue is only 1.6 billion Euros. HOWEVER, it is growing at 14% in constant currency YoY. Since, Enterprise market is newly developing, and per Pekka Lundmark, Nokia is a leader, this subset could objectively become the driver for Nokia to reach $20 and beyond.  


Do me a favor and google private 5G/Enterprise market growth projections or take a look at this article.  . [https://www.statista.com/chart/9604/5g-subscription-forecast/](https://www.statista.com/chart/9604/5g-subscription-forecast/)  You will see that the 14% annual growth is VERY conservative. This opportunity here for us shareholders is not pure positivity, lying, deceiving or some unachievable dream but is a reality as it is happening right NOW. Not in 2-3 years, not in 5 years but right now.  


Also, the bigger opportunity with the Enterprise market is not only the revenues will soar year after year but that the profit margins are much better than the global CSP market per Pekka Lundmark. As we know the profits directly effect EPS and EPS directly effects the share price.  


Having said that, I think 2021 will still be challanging due to the Verizon loss as it was a GIANT loss. It is really hard to make up for that loss in less than a year. However, the near future objectively looks bright. The million dollar question is how quickly will Nokia negate the Verizon loss and how quickly will the Enterprise subset become very significant. Based on a conservative 15% growth rate, this subset will bring in 1.8 billion Euros and a minimum of about 180 million Euros in 2021. IF Nokia exceeds these expectations, I would become even more bullish than $20 per share. Don't forget, Nokia is projecting to be breakeven in the networks division only for 2021. Afterwards, Nokia says it will significantly improve the margins. If Nokia gets somewhat close to what Ericsson is achieving in PMs, it will have around 12-15% in networks margin. That will bring in 1-1.5 billion Euros in additional profits per year. That would alone cause the stock price to at least triple from its current price.  


The truth is, there are risks in the short term. The stock might go down to low $3 range after March 18th if Pekka Lundmark gives a poor forward guidance. However, the potential is there and it is in motion right now. It is not a pipe dream. Unless Pekka Lundmark talks negatively about the Enterprise markets future, I am here to stay.  


Nokia stock in my opinion has probably one of the best risk reward ratios in the market right now."

When you need a profitable place to land after jumping from the tech train.",243,140,2021-03-03 14:46:02,"Alright so let me start off by mentioning that i'm a long time lurker, first time poster in WSB, and thought it time to make my first contribution. I know, I know, I didn't think my first contribution would be about a Jim Cramer Boomer Stock... but yea, it really is. But just follow along with me here.

I first began the day planning out my next moves for when I start jumping off the tech train (like right about now), and begin embracing the market for post pandemic retail/life (and once the CPI begins to bump, the moves for making money in the market during inflation). This led me to look at commodities and companies which deals with commodities.

**ENTER COSTCO**

I then pull up COST and wonder what the heck am I looking at. Why is there such a dip!?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fs582ukeerk61.png?width=501&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd299c206740f45dbfec2923e2483ee9e4fd46cd

There must have been some terrible news right? Being an avid costco shopper to feed my family of 5, I begin researching what terrible thing happened to Costco to cause such a rapid selloff. But the more I looked the more I realized that this selloff is really just weird...and it could be an opportunity to get some tendies...(or rotisserie chickens...see what I did there?)

**Researching Possible Causes**

Could it be massive shorting like we all see with other stocks? No, its only running 0.98% of shares shorted.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b6jtyoyferk61.png?width=505&format=png&auto=webp&s=52d06efbe13966d7ee2d559e5a7c4fd0d7f6a106

Was there any news of accidents or management issues? None that I could find on google.

Then I come across an article about warren buffet which may explain some things

**Warren Buffet Sells his shares of Costco**

https://www dot yahoo dot com/lifestyle/warren-buffett-dumps-all-his-costco-stock-3-reasons-why-that-is-a-big-surprise-235600486.html

Well, considering that he sold it off prior to November 16th 2020 (could it have been him doing that huge red candle on nov 9-10th?) shouldn't the stock have begun to drop from there? It should have, but it didn't. So I looked some more and found that Costco announced a special $10 dividend (which is pretty high...I mean RKT announced a $1.11 div and thought that was amazing). My first thought was that damn, Costco made a lot of money to do a $10 dividend, and second, that this drop isn't justified if Costco is making a ton of money.

https://finance dot yahoo dot com/news/supermarket-chain-costco-declares-special-222312149.html

Here's a chart with the dividend marked (you can also see that big red candle right before it which could have been buffet?).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7nnd0trherk61.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=063271b9d3c38f3b13c8d7296a83c7e1171f5f18

As you can see, right after the dividend has passed, the stock begins a slow bleed until you see the final crazy selloff at the end, and with that $10 dividend in the back of my head, im already thinking that this sell off is all sentiment without any real reason.

So I do some due diligence and look at the financials, earning calls, etc. I then mark them on the chart to see what kind of effect those things had on the price. They seemed to help or negate the stock even during this time of speculative hype.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k9hpvqcjerk61.png?width=998&format=png&auto=webp&s=830afac11cd00a1ba28c1822105e29a3b5ae78c3

Each blue vertical line marks an earnings call, where if you zoom in close enough you can easily see the market respond negatively or positively to the results in a pretty normal fashion within a week or so afterwards. Each call is followed by a swing of about 10 points up or 10 points down. Typical moves for a stock trading in the hundreds. This confirms to me that without a trigger to drop the price of Costco, there really isn't any reason why the stock is dropping and that any positive earnings should push it back up and any negative earnings should drop it further (or remain the same).

&#x200B;

As you can see, the stock is just completely oversold, trading outside the bollinger bands which tells me that it might be a good time to catch a falling knife (you know, buy the dip)...but what could slow the downfall and even reverse it?

**Enter the earnings call March 4th and why I am Bullish**

Looking through the financials, Costco has continuously beat its earnings.

>This warehouse club operator has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 11.04%.  
>  
>For the most recent quarter, Costco was expected to post earnings of $2.04 per share, but it reported $2.29 per share instead, representing a surprise of 12.25%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.85 per share, while it actually produced $3.13 per share, a surprise of 9.82%.

https://news dot yahoo dot com/costco-cost-beat-estimates-again-171005710.html

And looking at its previous 2 years of March earnings, it has always beat its December earnings (for all you call options people). I didn't do a screen capture as its a long scroll. But the data is on the link below. Just look at all the March earnings vs the one reported before it.

**Fundamentals (if they matter anymore) have not changed, AND WHY I LIKE THIS STOCK.**

**They make a ton of money (selling tendies):**

>In FY 2020, ended August 30, 2020, Costco posted year-over-year (YOY) gains in revenue, net income, and other metrics. Total revenue increased by 9.2% YOY while net income attributable to Costco climbed by 9.4% YOY.3﻿ The company said that its e-commerce business saw a 50% YOY increase in sales for FY 2020 as a result of gains in grocery deliveries, prescription medications, electronics, and office supplies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.4﻿  
>  
>Costco posted revenue of $43.2 billion and net income attributable to Costco of $1.2 billion in its Q1 FY 2021, ended November 22, 2020. Revenue rose 16.7% while net income attributable to Costco grew 38.2% compared to Q1 FY 2020.

**They are growing their online business (growing and selling rotisserie chickens):**

Continuing its sales strength during the COVID-19 pandemic, the company reported net sales across all segments of $19.1 billion for the five-week period ending January 3, 2021, a 12.3% YOY improvement overall as e-commerce sales jumped 62.5%.

**They are international (also making tendies):**

>Besides the U.S. and Canada, Costco operates membership warehouses in Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Spain, Australia, France, China, and Iceland, and these latter countries are represented in the Other International Operations segment. Together, the non-U.S. and non-Canadian countries represent roughly the same amount of revenue and operating income as the company's Canadian business. For Q1 FY 2021, Other International Operations generated total revenue of about $5.9 billion, a 21.8% YOY increase. Other International Operations also posted Q1 FY 2021 operating income of $289 million, a 46.0% YOY increase. This makes this segment the fastest-growing in terms of both total revenue and operating income. It comprises 13.7% of revenue and 20.2% of operating income.

https://www dot investopedia dot com/how-costco-makes-money-5094774

**Why Costco post pandemic will still retain its customers (Article from 2020):**

>Nearly all the members who had the opportunity to cancel their subscriptions last quarter declined to do so. A full 91% of its U.S. shopper base chose to renew, in fact, which marks a slight increase from the 90.9% that Costco reported in each of the last three quarters. Costco counted 55.8 million member households at the end of Q3, up 500,000 compared to the prior quarter. Its global renewal rate was unchanged at 88.4%.

https://www dot fool dot com/investing/2020/06/01/why-almost-no-one-canceling-costco-membership.aspx

Costco is a solid business with much upside. Despite buffet selling (he also dumped AAPL), the fundamentals of the business have not changed. Seeing as that the majority of its profits come from the membership itself, and that most people do not cancel their memberships, I dont see why Costco would suffer post covid. At the recent price its currently at, it signals an overly sold stock which will very likely bump up in the next earnings call to stabilize the price and bring it back into traction.

**My Plan:**

I like this stock for both a long hold, and will supplement with $340 March 19th (sound familiar?) Calls. Ill have 60 shares come market open tomorrow.

edit: fat fingered march 5th instead of march 4th earnings call.

edit 2: i wrote horizontal line instead of vertical line when referencing the plotted earnings calls (too much writing!)."
lwlol7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwlol7/high_times_ipo_a_dying_brand_from_selling_mags_to/,High Times IPO - A Dying Brand —> From Selling Mags to Selling Bags,22,12,2021-03-03 12:57:33,"High Times is a - beloved - American monthly magazine and cannabis brand with offices in Los Angeles and New York City. The magazine was founded in 1974 by Tom Forçade and the publication advocates the legalization of cannabis. The magazine has been involved in the marijuana-using counterculture since its inception.

On Jan 29th, 2020, ditched dreams of [NASDAQ Listing](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/high-times-ditches-dreams-of-nasdaq-listing/)

>Hightimes Holding Corp., parent of High Times, revealed that it has abandoned its efforts to list on the NASDAQ, a goal it had been pursuing for since mid-2017. The company launched an offering two years ago at $11 per share through the Reg A+ process, and it reported that it would extend its Reg A+ capital raise until 4.545 million shares had been sold or until March 31st. It disclosed in an SEC filing that it recently sold 363,636 shares at $5.50 in a private placement to Ontario-based Rayray Investments (Raymond Leach, an original investor in MedReleaf), a 50% discount to where it has been selling shares.

High Times securities lawyers, Stephen Weiss and Megan Penick of L.A. based Michelman Robinson LLP, confirmed in an email interview that the company can not accept sales until they get their annual report filed and publicly available for investors.

[High Times IPO - Sorry, No Refunds - Teri Buhl of Cannabis Law Reports Talks Reg A](https://vimeo.com/438846483)

**Harvest Acquisitions**

It was in March that Harvest Health announced an $80 million buyout of that entire company. Then, literally two months later, we see a letter of intent filed by Hightimes now and Harvest saying, 

>""Okay well, we're actually going to buy the California assets of Have a Heart."" 

Why that was contradictory is that Harvest had just been on an investor call telling people, when an analyst asked, 

>""Why are you doing this deal?"" They said, ""Well, we want a stronger footprint in California."" 

It didn't make sense that two months later they're getting rid of everything they just bought in California.

Additionally, in the last month there have been[multiple news reports](https://mjbizdaily.com/high-times-cannabis-retail-bid-complicated-by-web-of-owners-social-equity-partners/amp/) questioning if Harvest even has ownership or control of the cannabis licenses to sell to High Times.

Very little cash actually changes hands in the deals crafted by High Times; instead it has announced millions of stock *(which isn’t publicly traded yet)* will pay for the asset purchases. With the Harvest acquisition, High Times attorney Stephen Weiss confirmed for CLR that $1.5 million was paid to Harvest but at signing only $500k was given. The asset purchase agreement filed with the SEC said High Times would pay Harvest $1 million on signing.

This is just a complete lack of transparency, and it's completely unfair for the Main Street investor trying to get into cannabis.

**Done before starting**

The Securities and Exchange Commission has told a U.S. operated cannabis media and dispensary company, High Times Holdings, that they must halt accepting investments in their mini-IPO because they have failed to meet an extended deadline to file their audited annual report.

>The last date the company was allowed to take investments was the middle of June.

High Times used a reporting extension the SEC created because of the Covid-19 pandemic to get a 45 day extension to file the annual report and said in recent SEC disclosure filings, called Form 1-U, that they promised investors to get them current revenue, cash flows, debt levels and asset values by June 12, 2020 via the annual report; but CLR has learnt that this never happened.

Adam Levin’s company has spent over two years trying to get main street to invest up to $US50 million without a successful close date that could lead to publicly traded stock on the OTC Markets under the ticker $HITM.

On June 30th, 2020 the company made an [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1714420/000149315220012247/0001493152-20-012247-index.htm) announcing once again their mini-ipo would be extended for yet another three months but left out the important fact that they couldn’t actually accept sales.

When asked if it is normal practice for a Reg A issuer to continue to solicit investments when it can’t accept sales; securities attorney Sara Hanks said:

*”The SEC may have softened up in the Covid crisis but previously, both sales and offers were supposed to stop during such time as the issuer was delinquent in its filings, because there is no exemption under Reg A  for “offers” (advertising etc) while a company is delinquent.”*

High Times still has their investment offering page [live](https://hightimesinvestor.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=hightimesx&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3ZX4BRDmARIsAFYh7ZLylKUJKyHSWhczvAcJAdLVBjLED6hTfWbWCb4Oejeqm5j-yCs4zpgaAgzCEALw_wcB)

Since then investors have seen a rapid pace of public announcements about asset purchases, via signed letter of intents, hyping the potential growth of High Times followed up with quiet SEC filings announcing the deals had either fallen apart or been watered down. 

I have personally fallen for this sham (F), as I invested in 5000 units in 2018. They stopped responding to my inquires, in fact, there was a random charge on my credit card (from an airport in LA) the same day they charged my card for the IPO.. they stated that it would be refunded - never was. I can still log on and see the shares I have “invested” but they obviosuly don’t represent anything. Lesson learned..

**Recent Financials**

The company filed a[post-qualification amendment to its Form 1-A](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1714420/000121390018007523/f1apos2018a1_hightimeshold.htm) with the SEC that suggests the financial condition has become even more precarious. In the first quarter of 2018, sales plunged 64.9% to just $1.481 million:

Most of the decline can be attributed to the events business, which fell almost 83%, but publishing revenue declined over 16% as well. The company indicated that its Cannabis Cup events will take place later in the year compared to the prior year, with one in Las Vegas and in Los Angeles taking place in the first quarter of 2017 and none in the first quarter of 2018. The $554K in sales were generated by smaller events, and the company expects the number of Cannabis Cups and small events to increase for the full year. It blamed the publishing decline on lower sales at the newsstands and through subscription and lower print advertising revenue, with digital partially offsetting these factors.

The company provided information about its cost of revenue, which was $503K, as well as its operating expenses, which declined substantially to $2.391 million, producing an operating loss of $1.413 million compared to an operating loss in the first quarter of 2017 of $6.54 million. Much of the year-ago operating expenses were due to a one-time non-cash charge of $6.689 million for equity compensation charges for consulting.

The last time the company filed official annual earnings was June 2019. High Times had told investors it would get updated financial information on June 12, but that did not happen. The company has extended the offering of shares for two years, initially telling investors that it would list its shares on the NASDAQ. Then it lowered those expectations to the Over-The-Counter Marketplace. 

**Still, it hasn’t happened.**

Where I live in upstate New York, demand is 'very high' almost all the time however I don't know if that's from a lack of workers or a large amount of orders. Either way, without a customer tips the company probably can't pay workers a reasonable amount. I also order it on rare occasion when there's a discount. 

We all know they are slowly bleeding cash but I'd like to put in perspective how fragile their revenue is even when its at a loss. Their prices are inflated for almost all restaurants. If you order pickup through the DDash app its like 10%ish more expensive than just ordering on the restaurant's website. For a real bad example this greek place I like costs 11.99 for beef shawarma and its 13.99 on the DDash app. This is either because DDash is raising the prices on their app or the restaurant has to charge more to compensate for the commission paid to DDash that comes along with getting your restaurant on the app. I dont know what percentage or how much it is per restaurant but I know there is either a flat rate or a monthly rate. I couldn't be bothered to google it but if most restaurants pay a flat rate, this revenue will slow down eventually as more stores get on the app, or if its mostly monthly it will be long term revenue. They also collect money from subscriptions, if the customer pays 9.99 a month they can get unlimited no-delivery-fee-orders as long as that order is for over $12. This is deceiving for this reason: **They charge an additional 15% 'service fee' at checkout and you miss it because its added to the sales tax.** My assumption is this: two types of customers: single persons and families/large orders. If you ordering a lot of food, that 15% earns DDash quite a bit. If you are a single person ordering, a $12 amount is awkward to reach, a chipotle type restaurant is just under at $10 and like half of applebee's/chili's entrees are just under $12 therefore you're spending more like 15-20 to reach the point where you're ""saving money"". In short, people on the pass need to get 4-5 deliveries to be ""saving money"". If you are not on the battle pass it makes zero sense. As a customer, say you want chipotle, $10.15 for the meal (steak bowl) $0.89 sales tax (NY) $1.52 service fee $3 delivery fee and $3 tip (if you want your shit to be delivered on time) = **$18.56.** If you compare this to buying on the app $8.65, tax is $0.76, say you are a fuckin long way but u really want that burrito 10 miles at the average of 25mpg and a cost of $3.00 a gallon is $2.40, but you left work and are late coming back on your lunch break by 10mins bc you drive 30mph so it took you 40mins and at an average US wage of $20, you lost $3.33 which is **$15.14** so even in this stupid scenario DDash will never be worth the cost. Unless you have an injury, sickness, disability, are holding a special occasion or have ""fuckyou income""... you are not paying for this delivery service.

Now their expenses are essentially just paying drivers and running the app. Drivers can accept and decline orders. At certain hours where demand is high or there are few workers, drivers get a bonus typically $1-3 per order. Last summer there could've been a whopping $3-7 bonus like once a week which doesn't happen anymore. I assume that was because the company was doing great from covid. Most 'good' orders are $7-9 total to the driver, that is probably the delivery fee + tip. Anyone who doesn't tip usually has their order sit for a long ass time because no one is going to get paid $3.00 to bring your food 6+ miles. I don't know where bonus pay comes from though, delivery fees don't change. Since delivery fees cancel out, you can assume they make money from restaurants and the ""15% fee"" so all the bonuses must wipe out a portion of that. A small amount is paid in referrals which is alright at best $1000 to you if a friend does 280 deliveries in 60 days which amounts to like 16hrs a week but no one with a job is gonna commit to that. Another small amount is rewards for dedicated dashers, its a huge lie, this month its 550 deliveries for an extra $225 that's 68hrs a week if 1 delivery = 1/2hour. Even if we account for double orders and some fast ones that may or may not be worth our time, you have to be mentally insane to work 8-9hrs a day for 30 days straight while getting some dogshit orders along the way, sometimes of the day you might not get orders so add that on.

**BULL CASE (SORTA):** I will be buying some future puts here soon when I save the money but it would still be nice to see them succeed. The only long term bull case is that they completely squash all their competition. This industry's margins are too small for more than one company. DoorDash would need to be making moves now to completely undercut GrubHub, and Uber. Them buying Caviar was good but their only options seem to be: blood let themselves on cash, make delivery's free, advertise out the ass and control so much market share their competitors die, or acquire them somehow (virtually impossible). They cannot be competing and making money at the same time (obviously). Maybe Instacart and DDash can coexist since they don't directly compete. Instacart is positioned well in grocery delivery, if you ignore walmart they stand basically alone. They're valued at $7.8B so if DDash could somehow acquire them it would help a lot. Radical change has to happen in this company and if someone else could do the DD that proves the CEO has balls to buttfuck the competition have at it. The way they are going is a slow death even though the service they provide is pretty sick. Sitting on my ass I can make food appear, revolutionary idea, poor business model.

Sorry for making this longer than it had to be a lot of it has been said before but hopefully it'll feed your confirmation bias, have a swell day my fellow retards 🤠🚀"

Ford’s plan to invest in EVs and self-driving cars rose to $29 billion, including $22 billion for EVs through 2025. 

Ford and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL are entering a six-year deal that will make the tech giant responsible for much of Ford’s growing in-vehicle connectivity. This partnership is designed to streamline Ford’s operations and accelerate an ongoing $11 billion restructuring plan. 

General Motors:

General Motors announced that it plans to invest $27 billion in EV and autonomous vehicles through 2025. The company also mentioned that it plans to release 30 EV models globally by 2025.

The company has partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT in leading a $2 billion investment round in self-driving car startup Cruise LLC.

Difference:
Ford is going with Google and General Motors is going with Microsoft. 

Google has 14 Automotive startup investments and Acquisitions.

Microsoft only has investments in 4 automotive startups.

This will help Ford and General Motors in the following areas:

- Autonomous driving technology.
- Connected car tech & fleet management.
- Electric vehicle technology.
- Automotive retail.
- Mobility-as-a-service & shared mobility.

Who wins?
In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars.

I will keep buying Ford, because of the potential technology integration. Also I really like the stock.

lu46g7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lu46g7/jfrog_frog_dd_a_great_software_company_with_a_lot/,🐸🐸 JFrog $FROG DD - A great software company with a lot of room for growth. 🐸🐸,14,48,2021-02-28 11:20:57,"# 🐸 is getting ready to leap.

This is my first DD post so I would appreciate any feedback and criticism of assumptions I am making here. But I thing that JFrog is setup for a good run in the next few months and here is why.

# What do they do?

Their main product is JFrog Artifactory which is a universal repository for software binaries (runnable code) and it also serves as a mirror repository - local copies of Open Source Software. They also offer JFrog X-Ray that scans those Open Source libraries for malware/vulnerabilities). This is one of the most critical cogs in the software sausage factory, Artifactory is comparable to a walk in refrigerator, with the mirror repo it adds the loading dock, with X-Ray it also helps to ensure food safety.

**You may have heard of the Solarwinds attack and if you have been following it heard that it is described as a “supply chain vulnerability” attack. In my professional opinion, the toolset JFrog offers is the best available to combat this kind of threat and will stand to benefit from the need to increase cyber security.** That is why I am very much a Bullfrog 🐂🐸. If there is interest, I will do a deeper dive into this aspect at another time but for this initial one, this is the huge surge in demand for their capabilities and the need for going beyond the basics is my thesis why this company is positioned to do very, very well going forward.

# Company background

They were founded in 2008 and there main product has been Artifactory ever since. It has only 1 direct competitor with similar scope, Sonatype Nexus, but Artifactory is better and cheaper. Sonatype started as a plugin for Artifactory that does something similar to X-Ray before X-Ray existed, then they copycatted the Universal Repo, so JFrog hit back with X-Ray. I have used both of these products over the years (since 2013) and I have worked in environments without, Artifactory improves developer productivity a lot and it secures company Intellectual Property.

Their product is used by most of the Fortune 500 companies. This includes **Google, AWS, Microsoft, IBM, and Facebook. These companies trust this product to keep their crown jewels (the software that runs their entire companies) safe**. That should tell you something about how good it is. They have over 90% renewal rate of their customers.

They acquired Shippable in 2019 which basically lets them offer the whole sausage factory. Though the area where this competes is very competitive with some very good products that are Open Source.

Their focus lately has been on offering a SaaS model to complement their on prem offering and make adoption easier. This should also grow their revenue a lot because it will make it easier to buy the total package instead of just the most basic.

They went public in late 2020 but it was very low key since they came out the same day as Snowflake.

# Financials

I am including a couple of Comps here based on the segment they operate in. Atlassian (TEAM) makes Jira, Confluence, and Trello which are used by most software teams for managing requirements and agile software Team collaboration. I picked them as a comp because I view them as a developer productivity tool that you need around the same time you start needing Artifactory. Crowdstrike (CRWD) is another best in class cybersecurity company that comes into play as you are in operations protecting and detecting threats as your application is running.

* As a high growth software company, unsurprisingly their GAAP earnings are negative. Surprisingly to me though, they are very minor and they have even had 1 quarter of profitability.
   * FROG: -$0.1861
   * CRWD: -$0.4763
   * TEAM: -$4.9355
* Their market cap
   * FROG: $4.9 B
   * CRWD: $47.8 B
   * TEAM: $59.4 B
* Their forward P/E Ratio
   * FROG: 615
   * CRWD: 771
   * TEAM: 173
* They don’t have any long term debt
* Their current ratio (short term assets/short term debt) is 5.3
* Their margin is over 80%
* Revenue is growing 44% YOY

# Ownership

65% owned by insiders and institutions

Most of that ownership is insiders because there are only 5 ETFs (including an ARK Index Fund) that own it.

Their final lockup was just released on 2/16 after their earnings and insiders have through 3/13 to sell before they go back into lockup. This is similar to what happened with Palantir recently, but it seems like most of them have sold what they are going to sell.

# TL;DR

They have a great product and have cornered a growing market they invented which has high barriers to entry. They are well managed and have good financials as well.

# Positions

420 shares and 61 options, I am planning to get 8 more options on Monday. If you haven't guessed yet, I like the stock. You can check my post history to see some YOLO posts from earlier this week. I will post another update when I am fully loaded with 420/69 to ride this 🚀

My EOY price target is at least $100/share from the current price which is at $53.49 on Friday.

DD on where to invest next.",735,115,2021-02-28 07:13:01,"I have been following the **GME, AMC** short squeeze, gamma squeeze closely and creating spreadsheets, collating data and performing more google searches per min than the average ape and I am really excited to reveal my conclusions of the technical analysis to you all.

By adding up the number of posts and comments on this sub reddit, of people who claim to be holding shares and having diamond hands, combined with the confirmation bias of all the people making side bets of what they will do when the price hits certain technical levels, we have very clear markers for reading the next moves the market will make and how to best capitalise on them.

Key reference data used in my spreadsheets (but not the only post, honest!!) https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls3n78/people_who_get_permabanned_if_they_dont_do/

First off as soon as GME breaks the **$500** mark there will be a huge rush on the market for people needing to fill their orders for tattoos they had promised at this benchmark. This is a HUGE new demand for tattoos that if Robinhood could not predict the demand for GME how can the tattoo artists predict the demand for tattoo ink? Here we have all the market makings for a first bull run on the **tattoo industry**, so invest heavily in them!!! 

Unfortunately the wise apes amongst you will already know (and I found out after one google search) there has not been an IPO for a tattoo studio so there is not a direct stock you can invest in.... Booooooo..... however all hope is NOT lost. We see clear evidence of past WSB users who fat fingering buying GMED when trying to buy GME, so the actual stock is NOT necessarily important.  The rush of Apes who will invest in the ticker **$INKAU** will be significantly high as they will likely think it is the Australian supplier of tattoo ink. 

Next marker to look for is the **$1000** price break.... should GME go above this we see another flood in the tattoo industry, but also we see divergence into the ""inserting things in places the sun does not shine""... hence the next top tip ticker to watch for bull run at $1000 are the **Lubricants and Grease** manufacturing tickers **$KAI** Kadant Inc is my pick here. 

By **$5000** a share things start to get a little hard to model as soo much cash will be flowing back into the retailers hands at this point, the call options to fill of: The drinking of the own users piss is outweighed by the pure tendies spilling out of fellow apes pockets from the stonk being close to the moon. Hence I theorise that a movement will have formed off the internet that will drive up the demand for... **$TSLA, $KFC and $WENDY** as it will become ""the fashion"" to drive around in a Tesla while eating a family size bucked of KFC tendies in a Wendys parking lot.

Beyond that I can not model accurately enough to share anything worthwhile, but there is one AI program that has spat out an interesting result possibility now on two separate test runs that I want you to just hold as food for thought.

When a simulation was run at a price mark of **$42069.00 and $69420.00** per share the **Festo Octopusgripper AI robot** indicated that there was going to be a huge run on Gourds. That is right the vegetable gourd as a commodity will become very popular and the simulation recommends investing in **gourd futures**.

UPDATE: Fresh off the ticker tape with a 83.7% probability if the price hits **$100,000** per share then the retail investors will pool all their tendies and buy the **actual moon** and have diamond hands tattooed on the surface to be visible from earth!

Needless to say there is not a wrinkle in my brain left so I'm gonna jump the gun and open my long positions now, I am not a financial advisor but do with this information what you will.

Space Ape out

TLDR: 

* $500 - Tattoo Ink from Australia $INKAU
* $1000 - Lubricants and Grease $KAI
* $5000 - Tesla, tendies in Wendys parking lot
* $42069 and $69420 - Future Gourds
* $100,000 - WSB will buy the actual moon

Enter Acadia Healthcare. Acadia Healthcare develops and operates inpatient psychiatric facilities, residential treatment centers, group homes, substance abuse facilities, and outpatient behavioral healthcare facilities to serve the behavioral health and recovery needs of communities in the United States. So basically mental hospitals and rehabs. Looking at their facilities on Google, many are very well reviewed. People have really good experiences in rehab and hospitals. I think they genuinely do help people who have gone off the deep end, or have addiction problems, or severe mental illness. I’ve visited one before and I genuinely enjoyed my experience.

Mental health is only going to continue to get worse over the next few months. Buy ACHC calls to take advantage of the trend. These have absolutely no volume right now so if this actually memes you're going to make a shitload of money.

I trust this retard because he proved to me that he's a market clairvoyant(metaphorically speaking). If you are a new WSB ape(retard:WSB ancient slang), -/JeffAmazon- is like the kid who shot the Damn Daniel meme(Daniel being DFV and the camera guy is -/JeffAmazon-), nobody knows who he is, but he was as important, if not more important than Daniel...

My humble street Cred: When $BB was undervalued (\~7$), I wrote a [DD(click me)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kb6exy/the_fallen_berry_will_be_reincarnated_as_a_bb/) literally preMoon Launch and made the Forest grump BB meme! So, I hope this gives me some Retard street credits!

**So Let's start!**

Right now, we are in a bloated market with some insane valuations, inflation fears, and recession nightmares... So intuitively, the plays which would make most sense(withstand all of these) are undervalued stocks(rare gems) in an overvalued market!

I introduce to you **(Ticker: $F) FORD 🇺🇸 🦅.** The all American car manufacturer which withstood every recession since 1920's... The company which our government treats as a favorite child! The car manufacturer which produced most American cars ever, and finally the innovator which employs one of the greatest PR firms and R&D teams. **I know, I know, you may say WTF??!! FORD?? GTFOH boomer!! Hear me out till the end and you'd be surprised.**

# FORD IS STORMING THE ELECTRICAL VEHICLE MARKET AND THEY AREN'T FUCKING AROUND!! (Veni, vidi, vici)

Yes, you read the tittle right!! Not only that, but also they are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EV cars to compete with TESLA). After years of development, this year they came out with **Mach-E.** An EV car which has a starting price of $35,395(After Federal Tax Credit which still applies to Ford EV's (indicates great government connections)) and easily rivals a model Y when it comes to value. It's way cheaper and has relatively comparable features.

As The Verge's Sean O’Kane perfectly said: ""I don't think people should underestimate just how important the Mustang Mach-E could be. The Mustang branding makes it instantly familiar and the design is striking enough that it gets noticed right away without being so out there that it's uncomfortable or weird or alien. **It's the kind of car that in a couple of years, if enough of them are on the road, it can really make people take notice and think about buying an electric car in a way that the I-Pace or the Audi e-tron or the Chevy bolt never have or will. I think Ford is tapping into something only Tesla** really does well right now with the Mach-E, which is trying to mix that modern design with increasing ubiquity in a way that could make people feel like they're missing out on something, much like the **effect a new iPhone can have.""**

For more on Mach E comparison to Tesla cars: [Link 1](https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/23322283-rd-barris/5534036-reviews-of-ford-mustang-mach-e-show-tesla-no-secret-sauce) Link 2

# What about production, constant need for innovative technology in EV's, and the need for other models?

**Production(keep all of the following in mind because a Tesla comparison is ahead):**

Ford produces around 5.5-6 million cars per year, it's the second biggest US car manufacturer. They know the in's and out's of the car production market and have top tier international connections^(1). Additionally and more importantly, they have the government in their pocket.

Ford has **active** production facilities in Turkey, China, Romania, Spain, India, Canada, Germany, South Africa, Thailand, Russia, Taiwan, Argentina, England, Venezuela, Mexico, Brazil, and Slovakia^(1)(arranged by size). But, I'm not here here today to talk about that. I'll be focusing on the EV car production.

Ford has already produced 10,000 Mach-E's and they delivered 5,000 of them to dealers. In addition, They are planning to produce 50,000 Mach-E's this year. While this number may seem minuscule in comparison to the six figure production number of their gas vehicles, it's an impressive start in the EV market. By comparison, this year so far Tesla has rolled out and sold just 14,100 of its electric SUVs, the Model X. And back in 2017, the EV manufacturer was able to produce only 1,764 of its popular Model 3s in the first six months of production. The following year, however, Tesla delivered more than 140,000 Model 3s.  While Tesla had a slow start, it certainly has caught up in filling  customer orders. In 2019, it’s averaged sales of 12,500 Model 3s a month or about 150,000 cars a year. While Ford won’t be able to match this years Tesla Sale numbers **initially**, it looks as if it’s off to a strong start. (Source: Motor Biscuits).

Another point to keep in mind, Other carmakers haven’t had as an impressive showing as Tesla in EV production, either. Jaguar sells a mere 200 I-Paces a month. The Audi E-Tron, a plug-in SUV, is averaging about 600 sales a month. As for the Chevrolet Bolt, its sales numbered about 13,100 to date this year. The Chevy EV’s first year saw only 23,000 produced(Motor Biscuits). and please don't get me started on Chinese EV BS... Bottom line is, aside from Tesla production numbers in the EV space, Ford is the next runner-up after Tesla.

**What about international production and sales?**

Ford to go all electric in Europe by 2030! It intends to spend $1 billion to revamp a factory in Cologne, Germany, where it will produce EVs using a Volkswagen platform(Biggest car manufacturer in Europe).  This new strategy involves phasing out gasoline-powered vehicles in favor of electric power. The automaker expects to have **all commercial vehicles made by Ford in Europe be electric by 2024.** Two years later, it expects **to have converted its entire lineup into electric or plug-in hybrids.** Gasoline-powered commercial vehicles will still be offered for sale in Europe after 2030, Ford says. However, the automaker currently sees electric models accounting for two-thirds of its European sales.(source: Tech Crunch)

**What about Asia?**

Ford announced Jan. 27 that its Mustang Mach-E SUV **will be manufactured by Changan Ford for customers in China.** The Mustang Mach-E will start being produced there later this year as it looks to tap into China's electric vehicle (EV) market. Remember that China is the world's biggest car market with more than 20m vehicles sold each year. (BBC)

**What about government support in production?**

Ford CEO calls on U.S. government to support EV batteries, charging(Headline on Feb. 24 Reuters). He outlined the automaker’s plan to develop electric platforms for its top-selling trucks, vans and SUVs. What happened after that? Biden ordered for a review of US supply chains for vital goods such as large capacity batteries and semiconductors! In addition, he signed an executive order to amend the Semiconductor shortage. It seeks 37$ billion in funding legislation as a shortfall of semiconductors has forced U.S. automakers and other manufacturers to cut production.(Reuters)

**Innovation and Technology:**

Ford and Google to Accelerate Auto Innovation, Reinvent Connected Vehicle Experience (Feb. 1) [(Ford link)](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html). Ford and Google came together in **first-of-its-kind partnership** to create unique services and capabilities for Ford and Lincoln customers, and to **accelerate Ford’s transformation plan.** They are working on data, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) innovations. As part of this new, **six-year partnership,** millions of future Ford and Lincoln vehicles **at all price points will be  powered by Android, with Google apps and services built-in.** In addition, Ford and Google have established a collaborative group called, Team Upshift, that will push the boundaries of Ford’s transformation, unlock personalized consumer experiences, and drive disruptive, data-driven opportunities.

**What other EV models are they working on?**

in 2019, the Ford F-Series was second only to the Apple iPhone, which raked in $55 billion, in terms of total revenue generated. The F-Series  generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined, which added up to $40 billion, Just something to think about. The F-series is their most successful car and they are planning to release the new EV version of it soon this year. After that, They will move to electrify almost every model one by one.

# Valuation and Price target (~110$ = 429,000,00$M market cap)

Yes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.

$Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple

(Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- some are outdated)

TSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X

NIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)

GM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X

F - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X

**(Important part starts here)**

As you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.

If you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.

If WSB adopts $F, it can raise it be the next (110$+)  EV play in the industry. At that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **🇺🇸 🦅**.

Ford has always put the American people over money and has provided so many American jobs for the last century. Ford is a well known American brand and it's deeply ingrained in the American history and culture. I'm proud that my grandfather used to work in Ford(ME) and had great memories in there. In my opinion, the strength of this brand will continue on and it will rise from the ashes like an American bald Eagle**🦅** after a forest fire.

**TLDR:**

1- All American, highly undervalued stock.  **✅** **🇺🇸**

2- They are ready to dominate the EV market. Targeting mid class with high quality cheap EV's. **✅**

3- Have the government support. **✅**

4- Have a strong international factory presence for production. **✅**

5- Strong PR, Research and development teams with a 6-year google partnership. **✅**

In that moment, I realized I am bearish on Jim Cramer's facial hair. 

We have watched the hedge funs short everything, and it is time for us autists to strike back and short the very symbol of their power, Cramer's Moustache.

After this I started thinking about whether Russian stonks could go to the moon, and google Russian Moon Rocket and the first thing that came up was a nose diving russian rocket.

Recap on VIX: A high VIX means there are significant market irregularities and we should expect volatility and large fluctuations in the S&P500 market. VIX going down means investors are acting normally and we should expect regular S&P500 growth.

The VIX has been on a steady trend downwards since lockdowns began. VIX is played mostly by institutions, not retail investors, as it requires actual market knowledge to not lose money here. Typically, the movement of a smallish cap stock such as Gamestop is not going to have any effect on the VIX. Wall street seems to really be showing their hand here. I think they know that a Gamestop moon rocket could slam the market. Has anyone else been looking at this correlation?

Not investment advice. I just take screenshots from google.

💎🚀🌕


History repeats itself... The story of Nokia is that of a modern day epic. Here's why:

""Nokia Bell Labs is an American industrial research and scientific development company owned by Finnish company Nokia. With headquarters located in Murray Hill, New Jersey, the company operates several laboratories in the United States and around the world.""

\- 9 Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories, as well as 4 Turing Awards.

\- The C Programming Language, as well as Unix was developed here.

With the 5G/6G arms race heating up, it is time for the 100 year old think-tank to be leveraged once more.

### TLDR: Nokia is going to be one of the 3 kings in the world of 5G/6G... which will be used in EVERYTHING that matters in the next decade and this is the absolute ground floor.

All data that I present is publicly available. By no means do I claim to be an expert, nor is this financial advice. This is simply observation and speculation. I simply like the stock.

 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

## (Hard) SPECULATION:

\- ""Big tech trades human futures"" - Zuboff, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism

\- IMO, modern institutions are very cunning... Everything they do has purpose.

\- From the cryptocurrency community in the previous bull market, I have learned this, and scaled it into larger markets... The behaviors are the same, but even more predictable due to the dominance of algorithmic trading. Just trade ""whale"" for ""institution"".

\- Nokia is seen in a negative light by retail, and the whole GME/Robinhood farce has further smeared their image to traditional retail investors. Many investors are repulsed from this company.

\- We have seen the clients of Big Tech influencing geopolitics to an astounding degree in the past few years through social media and surveillance capitalism... I believe that financial institutions have now caught on and now are cashing out on social media to move the markets...

\- Forgive me if you have disdain for WSB and the ""Robinhood"" investors, but I believe that there is big money behind them... BlackRock, JPM, etc... They are a vehicle for change, and a perfect fall guy for market manipulation.

\- Some of the DD are likely released by BlackRock themselves... I've seen some of the account's post histories. ""Robinhooders"" are looked down upon, yet under the guise of anonymity, they can release DD that far exceeds any big name analyst report? It smells fishy!

2 Possible threads of speculation:

\- Accumulation

\- Inst. ownership as of Q4 2020 is only 5.30%, shares float is 5 Bn... child's play to manipulate with high float. Other high growth companies that institutes are betting on have 90%+ inst. ownership.

\- Impulse Wave 1 was a test breakout... To gauge the retail demand levels. Institutions love to do this, and only create a melt up when an ideal motive wave can be created with public participation.

## FA:

""Have you ever wondered how you can enter the world of IoT or meet the increased requirements of the emerging 5G use cases? Are you in need of tools to seize the opportunities of 5G? Would you prefer to win new revenue with low risk and minimal investment, instead of spending CAPEX and time building an IoT network and developing new services?

Welcome to Nokia WING, a managed service that offers operators the ability to support their enterprise customers with global IoT connectivity across borders and technologies. It is live today with a truly global footprint but also prepared for the challenges of tomorrow – no matter what directions it is taking.

There is nothing else like WING on the market."" - Nokia website

\- Like Blackberry, a comparison can be made to the mining sector. At the start of new bubbles, CapEx for juniors get filled very quickly. If we make a comparison to precious metals miners... this company is a first wave major, not a second wave junior.

\- Nokia, Elisa and Qualcomm together have achieved the fastest 5G speeds recorded in the world.

5G Market:

Market size value in 2020: USD 41.48 Billion Revenue forecast in 2027: USD 664 Billion

""The global 5G Applications and Services Market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 25.8% from 2019 to 2027"" (According to 180+ page research report by Fidelity National Financial)

25.8% CAGR sounds good to me...

Verticals:

\- Manufacturing

\- Energy & Utility

\- Media & Entertainment

\- IT & Telecom- Transportation & Logistics

\- Healthcare

\- Retail

\- Agriculture

\- O&G and Mining

\- BFSI

\- Construction

\- Real Estate

Sounds like a service that has unlimited applications... My favorite type of technology!

\- The global market for Internet of things (IoT) end-user solutions is expected to grow to 212 billion U.S. dollars in size by the end of 2019. The technology reached 100 billion dollars in market revenue for the first time in 2017, and forecasts suggest that this figure will grow to around 1.6 trillion by 2025.

\- 5G/6G is the LIFEBLOOD of IoT.

\- ""5G is much more than just fast downloads; its unique combination of high-speed connectivity, very low latency, and ubiquitous coverage will support smart vehicles and transport infrastructure such as connected cars, trucks, and buses, where a split second delay could mean the difference between a smooth flow of traffic and a 4-way crash at an intersection.""

\- What is the number 1 problem that EV wishes to solve right now? Completely independent self-driving. 5G/6G is part of the solution! Why is Elon Musk focusing on Starlink now? It is the solution for Tesla's biggest roadblock.

\- 5G infrastructures are the neurons for IoT!

\- 5G is huge. It is of UTMOST importance. Why would the US go to such lengths to cripple China's Huawei for YEARS? Huawei seems to be their number 1 target!

Key contracts and partnerships:

\- The FIRST company contracted to set up internet on the moon. Partnering with SpaceX.

“Why would astronauts on Earth have access to 5G at home, but not have the same access to the same technologies when they are on the Moon?”

Thierry Klein, head of Enterprise and Industrial Automation Research Lab at Nokia Bell Labs, is addressing the gap between communication technology on the Moon and technology astronauts have access to on Earth.

In October, Nokia was named a NASA partner for its Tipping Point technologies for the Moon program, receiving a $14 million contract to deploy the first LTE/4G communications system on the Moon.

\- 5G/6G will be essential for space travel... Sounds like ARKX will need to look into this one!

\- Dec. 1, 2020 - Nokia and AT&T extend Worldwide IoT Network Grid (WING) collaboration to deliver seamless IoT connectivity to enterprises around the world, and support upgrades to 5G. As IoT networks transition to 5G and with Nokia WING also supporting 5G network slicing, AT&T will be able to partition its 5G network into multiple networks that can deliver specific capabilities to its IoT customers and support various use cases.""

\- Jan.14, 2021 - Nokia selected for U.S. Federal 5G Cybersecurity Project

\- Main collaborator for the Hexa-X 6G European Union Project... ""Being a 2.5-year project within EU’s Horizon 2020 ICT-52 program, Hexa-X is a consortium of 25 key players from adjacent industries and academia. Nokia has the overall lead and Ericsson the technical manager role in the project. Hexa-X is a broad collaborative initiative to frame the 6G research agenda and lay the groundwork for a long-term European investment in future wireless network technology."" - Ericsson's website.

\- ""Google Cloud and Finland’s Nokia are teaming up to develop cloud-native 5G solutions for communications service providers and enterprise customers, the companies announced in a Thursday (Jan. 14) press release.

The companies plan to develop solutions that combine Nokia’s 5G operations and networking capabilities with Google Cloud’s AI, ML and analytics technologies. The solutions will run on Google’s Anthos platform.""

Yes.. a Google partnership.

Take the below figures with a grain of salt... Sources are varying and biased, and there needs to be more rigorous audits in this sector. However, you will get the idea:

5G Hardware Market Share 2020:

\#1. Huawei - 28%

\#2. Nokia - 16%

\#3. Ericsson - 14%

(These figures vary depending on the source, but it is clear that these 3 are the leaders by far)

Investors accumulate shares, Research companies accumulate patents. Those who own the patents are the power brokers in the industry.

Total 5G patents owned 2019:

\#1. Huawei - 13,474

\#2. Qualcomm - 12,719

\#3. Samsung - 9,299

\#4. Ericsson- 8,116

\#5. LG - 7,694

\#6. Nokia- 5,554

There is an argument for Standard-Essential Patents (SEP) ownership... supposedly, which patents actually matter, and Nokia owns about 3,000. I am no expert on IP law or 5G technology, but these figures gives me a rough estimate, and are an indicator to the larger picture. Robert L. Stoll from Faegre Drinker's report has some good secondary sources if you want to dig into this.

A quick calculation of Value metrics:

\- Current Mcap of 23.35 Bn.

\- 16% market share of projected 664 Bn... Market size refers to the maximum total number of sales or customers your business can see, often measured over the course of a year.

\- 664 Bn x 0.16 = 106 Bn Revenue, assuming Revenue = Sales for now, 106 Bn/5 Bn shares = 21 SPS. Assuming P/S Ratio of 1, Market Value per Share = $21.00 USD by 2027.

\- Current price = $4, 21/4 = 5, so a 400% gain in 6 years based on a P/S Ratio of 1.

\- Tesla's current P/S ratio is 23.78, and Zoom had a high of 108.95 with the lowest being 25.83.

Does it sound right to you?

 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

## TA:

\- MACD has crossed over on lower time frames to bullish, and is converging on the 1D.

\- Current Price action shows fake consolidation... Motive Sequence has already begun.

\- The first run up to 10 must be wave 1 of the motive sequence, as this corrective wave has gone below the previous high.

\- Fib levels for wave 3 and 5 are around 14 and 21.

## QA:

First, the problem with options...

\- 142,040 Open Interest for options expiring 2/26/2021

\- 158,201 Open Interest for options expiring 3/05/2021

\- 434,917 Open Interest for options expiring 3/19/2021

It is possible that these need to expire before we move up again. However, all is not lost:

\- Heavy speculative call interest, with large short interest (in this case short volume) that are pushing up against major resistance levels can quickly pop higher. This indicates that they have consolidated and are getting ready for the next large move.

\- NOK had 370.0 ATM IV on Jan. 27, 2021, where the MM was forced to gamma hedge and we got the big but short-lived pop. Currently 50.2. This can be interpreted two ways. Low IV is good if organic growth and MM pinning pressure to ease, but abnormally low IV compared to the historic IV, where there is large negative gamma exposure means a big directional move is imminent.

\- Once again, call skew is turning bullish. Option interest always leads the price!

Institutional Behavior:

\- 442 institutional investors, and rising... More than Palantir Technologies...

\- Average 13F ranking rising (calculated from Total # of 13F shares and # of Funds holding)

\- institutional interest is GREATLY decoupled from stock price! Extremely bullish indicator. Price is what you pay, Value is what you get.

I always look for the big players, and what they are doing with their money. Words are cheap. Follow the money.

\- \*\*Blackrock increased their position 333,000,000 shares during 2020, an increase of 21 million shares held from the year before (7% increase) and representing a 5.90% ownership of the company.\*\*

## Speculation:

\- I have noticed that BlackRock and JPM have been massively accumulating shares in companies that I believe have the deepest of value, and are future tech monopolies (PLTR).

\- Such movement has been preceded by RenTech, Citigroup, and Citadel, RenTech and Citadel being top Quantitative Hedge Funds.

\- Speculative interest appears in the Robinhood community.

\- Extreme media FUD campaigns and short-selling follows to depress the price, while BlackRock and JPM accumulate enormous amounts of shares.

\- The Quants are playing MM for BlackRock and JPM. They are RUTHLESS! I have suffered for 2 months at their hands at Palantir!

\- The news will be out soon... This won't stay down here much longer. Information moves quick nowadays. Maybe Cathie will buy in.

To be an investor in such conditions, one must have the strongest of conviction. One must do their own DD... Conviction cannot be outsourced.

One of the global leaders in 5G. The previous CEO which brought NOK down was fired and replaced by Pekka Lundmark late last year. Under him he guided the company back to profitability in 1 quarter with increasing positive free cash flow. He also fired a number of those useless employees and trimmed the fats. Pekka radically reorganized Nokia into independent business units each responsible for P/L. Profitability and revenue surely going up.

Massively undervalued. Has nett cash (means after deducting debt) on hand. Small market cap compared to next competitor Ericsson.

More contracts in 5G than Ericsson (go google number of 5G contracts between both companies). During the ex-ceo term, yes they lost some market share but Pekka has sworn to win back market share and be leaders in 5G. They are clinching many 5G deals this year.

Black rock increased their positions in nOK recently. 

5G is expected to reach trillions in worth in years to come. Massive growth year on year.

Nokia is also the european leader in building 6G (code named project Hexa)

Nokia is building telecom technology on the moon under Nasa contract with Intuitive Machines.

With Huawei gone even more market share. 

Under HMD global (also from Espoo Finland run by Nokia phone ex-executives) which pays royalty to nokia, nokia is now releasing phones under android in India.. the world's largest phone market now outside China. So Nokia is not just 5G but is trying to recapture the consumer mobile market too. With many chinese mobile having limitations in india, Nokia has a chance to ride up here.

Pekka Lundmark will turn this company into a massive multibagger.

Keep snatching new 5G contracts. 2/3 giant telecoms (M1/Starhub) in Singapore are with Nokia. Philippines largest telecom (Globe) just announced yesterday they are going with Nokia. Just to share Philippines was considering Huawei but the recent pandemic and political tension has led Nokia to pick up market share. I believe more to come.

I heard some people worry Starlink will displace 5G. That's totally untrue. In fact, Starlink will complement NOKIA's 5G equipment. Starlink beams down bandwidth from the high heavens and Nokia beams it around the city/indoor/tunnel. Yes nokia and Starlink are complementary as they serve different parts of the entire chain.

Nokia was just named as 2021's one of the top most ethical companies. Smell the ESG / ethical / responsible investing drift yet?

But why trust me? Do read the news and make up your own mind. I'm not a financial advisor, just sharing my personal opinion on my favorite stock in my portfolio. For far too long Nokia has been neglected. Whether in pandemic or out of Covid, NOKIA is a solid profitable company with a huge potential. Yes they had a decade of bad results, but everything has changed under our lord and savior, the sandbagging Pekka Lundmark (as a typical Finn, he likes to undersell and overdeliver. He is a depressing person to talk to, but he is a hard worker and will bring Nokia to great heights).

I love NOKIA.

Btw the ticker is $NOK"
ls3ktz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls3ktz/unity_for_the_crazy_or_for_the_tanks_game/,Unity - for the Crazy or for the Tanks? - Game Developer POV [$U],45,58,2021-02-25 18:26:22,"So, here I'll gonna bring **my worthless POV on Unity**, but first of all - a 1 minute background:

**Unity is a game engine, which is the most important infrastructure of game making** \- before game engines appeared, game developers had to calculate every stupid pixel on the screen by themselves, then a lot of wrappers appeared (OpenGL, etc) and after that the game engines. The **game engine allows the developer to connect the code, graphics, music, physics, and basically everything together.**

Most of the large companies develop and use their own game engines. But as far as I concern, the only public, known, large and practically adopted by developers are Unity and Unreal Engine (we'll back to that shortly).

&#x200B;

Let's get back to Unity:

As a game developer (also ML/DL, but who cares), I've used many frameworks and game engines for more than 15 years, hell, I even used ""dark basic"" when I was young, and I can say that **Unity is the only time I felt at home**.

Now **I know you don't give a shit about my experience, so let's talk business**.

**The GOOD stuff:**

Unity solves one of the major problems of native growth in game making and that's a FULLY CROSS PLATFORM ENGINE, that means that I can develop once, and **my stupid stuff would work PC, Android, iOS, Xbox, Playstation, Virtual Reality, Web..**. You got the idea...That work of being cross platform is INSANELY HARD, which means there is a huge leap to create a competing product. Even the best open source game engines have a very limited amount of devices they support, which means that as a developer an open source game engine might be a risk for me in terms of growth and future support.

TL;DR 1:  **Cross Platform**

Unity got a huge asset store, which is a crazy source of revenues from stupid developers like me, that means that even if I'm totally not profitable - Unity might have some revenue from me without investing a penny or a minute of support team.The huge asset store makes it very easy for new developers to do their first steps in the platform, and like Maya vs 3DSmax or Nikon vs Canon - the first one you've touched is gonna be the only one you'll know.

TL;DR 2: **Easy step in, huge asset store, revenues even from non-profitable games**

Next, the future. Game industry is growing and we all know it, but what Unity got that it would outperform the market? Glad you've asked, they got everything.Unity supports Machine Learning infrastructures which can be connected easily to many application - well that's too general right? So let me put it like that:3 years to the future, self driving cars are more and more popular and... regulated. When you regulate it you also have to test it - digitally. Unity is one of 2 (!) game engines that practically gonna be available for that task.Virtual Reality is also a trend - guess how most developers develop for it. Also it might enter the movie industry and stuff like that.

TL;DR 3: **Tons of ""room to grow"" - VR, Algorithms and algorithms testing**

As I've mentioned, Unity got only one real competitor - Epic - which got  Unreal Engine that does basically the same. Epic are not public but hopefully will, but currently Unity is just the only exposure to this kind of product. If I had to choose, I would just put my Happy Hippos on both.

TL;DR 4: **No publicly traded competitors**

Lastly, Unity can grow without a single phone call. There is no major difference for Unity to support 1K users or 1M (just like Google or Facebook) - if we compare it to companies like TTOW, Nintendo and even Xbox-Microsoft and Oculus (Facebook) - they all had to invest ton of money for content creation and physical platform making.

TL;DR 5: **Unity have to spend almost 0$ for each new user**

&#x200B;

**Now for the BAD stuff:**

Unity price was very high, how much high? At the pick Unity passed EA (!) in terms of market cap. That's high.

It's currently at 35% discount right now, and it still might considered high - but do notice it's around 50%-60% more than IPO day (PLTR fore example is already multiplied - I think they were out on the same day).

TL;DR 6: **High Price (whatever that means...)**

Another bad thing - Unity had relatively bad quarter - their revenue went up but they earnings were still negative... Why is that? Well... first of all they've **donated something like** 750,000 shares, which is like **80M$** \- that's exactly the margin they needed to publish a profitable quarter - you know what that means for the next one...

TL;DR 7: **Last quarter was good revenues but bad earnings - mostly due to stupid reasons**

As I've mentioned, large companies generally use their own game engines, that's a lot of money the currently Unity miss.

Lastly, Epic might go public sooner or later, it won't be a surprise if $U would go down some percents at the same day. But for the long run, ETFs would buy both of the stocks (like ARK/ARKK did with Unity) and that would bring the price up.

TL;DR 8: **Their only real competitor might go public sooner or later**

**That's it, if you survived everything tell me what you think.**

For me I think I'll just buy the dip and hold forever since the growth is crazy and the world just getting more and more digital but please do your math since no one know what's gonna be.

Disclaimers: **I know nothing about nothing. I'm not an investment advisor and don't take any advice from me - or in general don't just listen to a random stupid guy on the internet and all that, read about it yourself.**

**I'm just a developer that enjoy and know to appreciate the platform and its cross platform abilities for my game.**"

# Quick Thoughts

**Inflation is not as much of a concern as people think**

Look, I've talked about inflation risks for three weeks now and this is old news at this point. Right there should be your biggest clue that those risks are priced in but I can give you more reasons.

But first, let me be clear on one point : This is a long term risk, not a short term one. The market will not crash tomorrow nor in the coming months but it can decrease the growth of the stock market. Or in the most extreme case cause a bear market or a crash.

But it seems like there are some confusion on reddit on what inflation we're talking about. So read this 10 times :

*The Inflation risks are not on consumer prices but on the stock market.*

Read it again! Again I said! And keep reading it because I'm sick of reading posts about that. Those risks of increase in consumer spendings are WAY overblown and frankly non-existant.

This is because the average consumer didn't receive much money from the government in the last year. And the little money he did receive, he used it to either buy stuff that he would have bought anyway or buy stuff for leisure purposes. ""*But have you seen Amazon's revenue?*"" you might say. ""*Yes, I've seen it*"" I would reply. Part of this revenue growth was due to AWS (their cloud business) and people being online more than ever during the pandemic, so server costs ballooned! 

But I grant you that : there was a big increase in consumption (on e-commerce especially) BUT it was mostly due to people being stuck in their home : they didn't travel, didn't party or anything like that, so they used that excess money to buy stuff online. Also, they were pretty bored at home and buying stuff was a few clicks away so of course they'd buy useless stuffs. There were other stuffs that impacted consumer spendings like people moving outside of big cities and making their home more confortable to live in (because you know, they're stuck at home).

So, when countries reopen, this trend will probably slow down (although it's setting a shift in consumer spending from brick-and-mortar stores to e-commerce but that's another story).

And with the [US exports increasing during the pandemic](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/exports), the dollar increases enough in value to offset potential inflation risks.

So yeah, this inflation was never really a concern, but now let's talk about the stock market inflation concerns that most institutions were worried about.

The concern is as follow :

> FED buys bonds and gives money to companies, banks and hedge funds. Hedge funds and banks put this money in the stock market. Stock market goes up artificially thanks to all that money. Companies use this to compensate for missed revenue. Their financials don't look so bad because of all the money given to them. But, nothing is organic, everything is given by the FED and this might create a giant bubble that's ready to burst.

Ok, so a few things about that :

- The stock market being stretched is nothing new, it's been a bubble ""ready to burst"" for a decade or so.
- The tech sector did very well without the need of quantitative easing.
- The actual thing you should worry about is not a market crash or a bear market but rather a *reduced growth*. That's why value stocks went up or flattened these past two weeks when growth stocks plunged. Most companies will increase in value but since a much bigger growth was priced in for growth stocks, their stock prices went down. By the way, that's why Tesla's stock price went down, that had nothing to do with its 1.5bn bet. 
- And for the concerns regarding all this money given to companies, there's not that much to worry about. When the economy recovers (in my opinion slowly from end-2021 to mid-2022), companies will generate revenue organically and as the economy gets better, MoneyPrinterMan will *progressively* reduce his bond buying program and *slowly* go on phase 2 of his plan : actually combating the inflation if it becomes a concern by then. 

There might be a correction at some point but hedge funds still have a shit ton of money to invest. And they're not going to keep it in cash when we have a massive bull market like that.

And I'll finish this rant by quoting our great savior Mr. MoneyPrinterMan Powell :

> Fuck your puts.

Also, there's [an article that explains this very well](https://www.im.natixis.com/en-ch/markets/post-pandemic-inflation-risk-2021).

Ok now let's talk about Powell speech for a minute.

**Powell talked. Investors were not impressed**

Summary of the speech tuesday : Hey bulls, nothing new, keep buying!

Seriously, that's it!

He said he will keep buying bonds at the current pace because the economy has still not recovered as much as he would like. 

He said that the inflation concerns are overblown.

Then senators asked about racial inequalities and Powell basically said ""wtf I'm just the chairman of the FED not the fucking president."" (I'm paraphrasing a little) Although he aknowledged the problem, he didn't give any solution because well as he said it very well, he's ""not the fucking president"" (again paraphrasing a little ;)).

The Senator Kennedy asked ""*Do you think we ought to go Catwoman on the budget and actually look for savings there?*"" (yes he actually said that, I'm NOT paraphrasing here). Powell said he didn't know the reference (and frankly I don't fully understand what that meant either).

[Link of the video and transcript](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/ux2lCF7KhCxCaP893gBjj6a3vD6H8wjZ47XZ56eLOD_bCvbSROyURMo4XtKOMy8-K2LB3wZ87l89r0ELEMVOJYvebgU)

He also talked about unemployment rates and that... Ah! That was pretty interesting. But today's recap is already long enough. Tomorrow, you'll get my ""quick"" thoughts on that (spoiler alert : it's not quick).

**C3.ai is a must buy more than ever!**

This is a short one because I've talked about this company in a previous daily recap. So I encourage you to read it first.

But now, I think this is the best time to buy the stock as it went down a lot recently (it's a growth stock and all growth stocks went down the past week or so). 

But there's something that you might know : Chinese competition in the Big Data Analytics space was and is still going strong. The Chinese government is tracking everyone down which generates a lot of data, the chinese government gives chinese companies carte blanche on all fronts even if they become monopolies. And they do.

[Here's a paper written in 2015 on how big the industry is in China](https://www.afcdud.com/fr/transport-afcdud/387-bigdatachina.html). 

But something might change that. I really don't want to talk politics here so let's make it brief : Trump went hard on China and planned on continuing that way and people thought Biden would not go as hard. But turns out, [he follows pretty much the same strategy](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/business/economy/biden-china.html). There's more detail to it, I encourage you to read the article and be informed on the situation.

So, this *might* be the moment where chinese companies get a big hit. They will probably get the same treatment as american companies and their big advantage will disappear.

Anyway, so my point is this : My DD on C3.AI still stands and the potential regulation on China gives you another reason to buy (long term).

**Here's a list of luxury brand companies**

2 days ago, I wrote that companies selling luxury goods *that hold their value* are hot right now. Here's a curated list of companies that I think will benefit the most from people buying luxury goods :

- Watches of Switzerland Group (it had a good run but it still has a lot of potential and it's a better bet than the others imo)
- Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA
- LVMH
- Ralph Lauren Corp

Also, [a good article that talks about that](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-23/-unstoppable-luxury-stocks-remind-some-investors-of-u-s-tech).

# Quick Update on my portfolio

Last week I was cash gang up until yesterday where I bought spy calls expiring in June. I fucked up my timing, I bought them 2 hours before market open because I didn't know Powell was talking yesterday. Averaged down by buying calls at open as well. I think now the inflation concerns are priced in. The worse case scenario is NOT though but there's a very small probability that inflation will actually create an economic meltdown.

I expect to keep my calls for at least a month or two. But I will revise my plan if the situation changes (and I will update you anyways).

BB these past 3 weeks has gone through a shit storm and none of us BB holders know why. It is the most undervalued stock I’ve ever seen in my investing life. BB is your wife’s boyfriend when he comes over for dinner dressed all nice and shit to impress you so that he can fuck your wife after dinner.

Listen to me when I tell you this. Blackberry is a company that used to sell phones back in like 12 BC, it flourished for a bit until Apple came in and beat BB into the multiverse.

Last few years blackberry floating around in time and space realized that it missed some sweet juicy titties and decided that it wants to go back to the physical world so that it can get a taste of some good ol’ titty juice. And decided to move into cybersecurity, or just a security company in general. And I mean the absolute best security the world has to offer, just a few hours ago BB won as the best autonomous cybersecurity company in 2021. And that’s just scratching the surface. World governments still use Blackberry phones and services because of how much they trust it. Including the US government.

BB has a product called QNX that ensures the safety of the next big thing - Autonomous vehicles. And it’s working with every fucking one. just to name a few giants using QNX - Ford, Motional, Baidu(China’s google), Audi, GM, Toyota, VW, BMW and more. All of these auto giants are currently working on AV’s and use BB’s QNX, except for Apple and Tesla, but they’ll join in soon enough, Why? Because Blackberry’s QNX was approved by the government, whereas Tesla has yet to do that. QNX is currently installed on about 200M cars and that’s just the beginning. No we won’t see profit this March because it is yet to boom. 

another product BB offers is only the best cybersecurity software available for you an I, called - Cyclance. It is basically like CRWD but better. And it’s only one of their products. It’s a subscription based software that protects you as if you were walking down the street with 3 Tyrones backing you up.

IVY - A partnership with AWS(Amazon Web Service) That BB has been working on. It’s basically an App store installed in AV’s, and Blackberry will be the backbone in it. Well knowing Amazon, they don’t fail. And knowing BB, they know how to ensure that nothing around them fails.

This is probably one of those once in a life time chances to get in before the floor goes up. Watch when the revenue starts to kick in, the floor will be 60$, and mark my words.

DISCLAIMER: This is a long term investment, not a get rich in a day kind of stock, but if you are willing to make a solid and rewarding investment, go for it. It may take weeks, to months. But I truly believe that Blackberry is making a revival. And that’s why I yolo’d 80% of my portfolio into this, sold all my BA shares to put more in BB.

Also, I am not a financial advisor, nor am I above average intelligence. This is just me sharing what’s on my mind. And you should take this with a grain of salt.

Positions: 500 @ 12

Edit: Thanks a lot for the rewards retards, but shouldn’t you just buy more BB?"

As You might know this is the last era of the lithium-battery. You know, that chargebale battery and the one and only reason why you have to charge your phone every 2 hours and your Tesla (who doesn’t have one these days?) after 400-500 km. Let’s not forget a battery’s purpose is to stores energy. The more energy you can store in a smaller battery, the happier we humans are. Energy=happiness.

Finding a cost-effective and efficient solid-state battery for electric vehicles could prove equivalent to finding the golden fleece in Greek mythology. According to the legend, anyone who possessed the golden fleece would be considered a true ruler. According to the present technology, anyone who could develop a cost-effective and efficient solid-state battery would rule the EV world.

A few listed companies are working on revolutionary Solid-State Batterys. Instead of LI-ion, Solid-State Batteries use solid electrodes and solid electrolytes. For the ones who never heard about these, use Opera or Google to DYOR.

Solid-State Batteries promise, already today:

\- Twice the energy  
\- 1/100th of the size  
\- 6x faster charsing  
\- 10X longer lifetime  
\- Non-flammability

This new piece of 21th-century-technology will definitely evolve coming years. Elon Musk already called it the MOAB.

Now let’s talk stocks. A few companies are working on a Solid-State Battery, expecting to bring it to the market within a few years. Today, much of the development work on solid-state batteries is performed with partnerships. Among the players are conventional Li-ion battery-cell manufacturers (i.e., Samsung SDI, LG Chem, A123 Systems), battery separator technology solutions suppliers (Asahi Kasei), and materials suppliers (Solvay, Umicore, etc.).

QuantumScape  
Panasonic  
Samsung  
LG  
Ionic Materials  
BMW Solid  
Power  
Toyota  
Ilika

According to Yole Développement’s market forecast, mass production of solid-state batteries will begin by 2022 and represent less than 1% of Li-ion battery demand by 2025. This might explain the relative low interest from investors today, which might change when large solid-state battery manufacturing capacities start to be built.

Samsung, LG, BMW etc are all searching for the Solid-State battery for own use, so that is not interesting for me to invest in; they already reached their market share. Today there are 2 stocks I want to discuss with you: Quantumscape and Ilika.

You might have heard about QuantumScape before. QS went to the moon ($10- $130) when Volkswagen announced it took an extra 20% stake in the battery manufacturing company (crazy times on the stock market back in the days). Now QS is stable between $40 - $50. Fair price for a company with no revenue, but a huge potential in the EV market. QS is already backed by $300 million worth of investment from Volkswagen, Bill Gates and hedge fund billionaire George Soros. Ilika is also a pioneer in solid state batteries, trading around $3-$4. Ilika has has two development programs:

\- Stereax: miniature batterys for MedTech

\- Goliath: solid-states for the EV and other battery-powered transportation The scope of growth is huge in both industries. Compared to QS and to see what’s happening with their stocks, lets only focus on the EV market. Ilika aligned a road map where the plan to start production of the Solid-State Battery in 2026, that’s the same period as the planning of QS. Ilika actually plans a pre-pilot this year and a construction pilot in 2024. For more information, DYOR.

So why is ILIKF trading $2-$4 and QS $40-$50?

Founded by Stanford University scientists a decade ago, with financial backing from Volkswagen AG, QuantumScape became a public company in November after merging with Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp, a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC). When the SPAC deal was announced in September the parties decided a $3.3 billion valuation was appropriate. Following a blistering stock-market run, QuantumScape is now worth more than 10 times that initial value. Those who bought shares in the Kensington SPAC in August have enjoyed a 1,060% return. QuantumScape’s prominent backers include venture capital firms Khosla Ventures and Kleiner Perkins, Microsoft Inc. cofounder Bill Gates, hedge fund billionaire George Soros’s Quantum Partners and investor Jeremy Grantham. JB Straubel, a former chief technology officer at Tesla, is on the board. These people know how to bring a company to the market and make it moon $$$.

Looking at their financials and progress, QS and Ilika do not differ that much. They both have enough capital to fund the business processes for the next 5-7 years, and both planning to bring their product to market in 2025. To understand the difference we have to look in the type of investors of both companies and their strategy for production.

The difference is QS plans to build a giga-factory to manufacture their batteries, which asks for a huge investment (0,5 billion – 750 million per GWh). That is the real reason why they are raising these amounts of capital. Ilika has chosen a different route. They will use the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre (UKBIC) as a first step before scaling up through an existing manufacturing company to get to the GWh. UKBIC is a key part of the Faraday Battery Challenge (FBC), a Government programme to fast track the development of cost-effective, high-performance, durable, safe, low-weight and recyclable batteries. Therefor Ilika doesn’t need the same capital investment to fund their growth.

So here is the point. Solid-State Battery technology is the future of battery. Ilika is growing in multiple industries including the EV market. Therefor I believe Ilike is a save and good investment for the long term. What are your thoughts on this? Is Ilika a good investment?"

Henrik was fueling this rumor himself with meme's that seemed to wink at the idea. 

Fast forward a few months, Apple has ""partnered"" with Hyundai which honestly is like you partnering up with your wife's boyfriend, seems like a good idea at first but then you realize it's like mixing oil and water, ain't no way that's a good idea.

Hyundai has since come out with their own shit sandwich, [https://www.ft.com/content/b742f5ec-44e2-4f3d-9a63-05662eab0f0b](https://www.ft.com/content/b742f5ec-44e2-4f3d-9a63-05662eab0f0b) . They are involved in the largest EV recall, just announced.

Do you think Apple really wants to be associated with that nonsense?

Fisker is still early stage enough where Tim Apple could come in and apply the Apple style to the Fisker design, which TBH are already sexy : [https://www.fiskerinc.com/](https://www.fiskerinc.com/)

lrivnu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrivnu/daily_dd_1_gm_is_stupidly_undervalued/,Daily DD #1 GM is stupidly undervalued,71,71,2021-02-25 01:52:42,"Welcome to Daily DD! I'll be offering one piece of DD on a stock every day for the next few days. On today's episode, GM.

tl;dr at the bottom

Why it'll  🚀this year and next year:

1) Biden wants to make the entire US fleet EV by the end of his term. You really think he's going to buy $70,000 cybertrucks for the fleet? Can you imagine the outrage if federal cars are using fancy Teslas while the average American has to buy regular cars? I think Biden will be more likely to buy GM's newer electric cars once they come out because they'll be much cheaper. Biden also drives GMs cars adding to possible bias or favoritism there. I don't think it's a coincidence that GM announced going fully electric while Biden pushed for a fully electric federal fleet. Either Biden knew GM was going electric or GM knew Biden would make this big purchase order.

2) Cap and trade? Have you heard of it? No? You should learn about it or else you'll lose out on tendies.  Cap and trade is complicated so I'm not gonna explain it here. Go google it. Point is, companies who produce electric cars can receive a rebate because the car emits less CO2 compared to a gas car. In fact, Tesla would've **lost money** in 2020 if it wasn't for California's cap and trade program ([https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/investing/tesla-profitability/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/investing/tesla-profitability/index.html)). Now that GM has access to this cap and trade market, they'll be able to sell these to the remaining gas car companies. This will also hurt Tesla because the more companies sell credits the cheaper they become. 

Also, you know who's likely to pass cap and trade? The federal government. Obama tried to pass cap and trade in 2009 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American\_Clean\_Energy\_and\_Security\_Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Clean_Energy_and_Security_Act)), but it was never brought to the senate. With climate change being a more pressing issue, and Biden's talk about solving climate change and green energy jobs, he's for sure going to try to expand and pass cap and trade on the national level. He's also publicly supported cap and trade ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/climate-change/carbon-tax/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/climate-change/carbon-tax/)). From his campaign website ""And, he will demand that Congress enacts legislation in the first year of his presidency that 1) establishes an enforcement mechanism to achieve the 2050 goal, including a target no later than the end of his first term in 2025 to ensure we get to the finish line."" This seems to refer to cap and trade as it's the only real enforcement mechanism to achieve a targeted climate change goal. With democrats controlling everything, cap and trade is likely to pass this time. 

Then again, politicians lie all the time and  Biden isn't much different. However, even if the feds don't step in, multiple states have already passed cap and trade with many more to come. 

3) GMs cars are comparable to Tesla's cars.  The Model 3 isn't actually that good. The Chevy Bolt has a range of 259 miles, about 22 miles longer than Tesla. Both cars cost about the same amount. The newer Chevy Bolts also have fast charging, so Tesla's starting to lose its moat here. Guess Elon's plan to not patent anything really screwed him over.

4) The PE on this is stupidly low. Come on? 12.13? It's practically **begging** to be bought at this price. Compare this to Tesla's 1,230. If GM and Tesla, both EV companies, had the same valuation, GM would be worth $5000. This is my price target lmao.

5) The UK, Norway, and other countries are planning to ban vehicles. Norway is the most aggressive at 2025. China is also considering it, which would make EV companies like GM go absolutely parabolic. GM has the Chevy Bolt, meaning they already have a head start in terms of experience when it comes to producing EVs. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Why is the stock down?

There are a lot of things that make people scared of GM. Here's why I think they're dumb:

1) The chip shortage:

This is a concern for GM in the short run, but they were still able to beat earnings compared to 2019. Currently they're projecting the earnings will be $1-$2 billion lower next year due to the shortage. I think that's a worst case scenario and the market is **overreacting** to the chip shortage. The chip shortage is now getting the concern of Congress and Biden ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/23/biden-semiconductor-shortage-meeting/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/23/biden-semiconductor-shortage-meeting/)). Given that Biden always talks about manufacturing, funding the semiconductor shortage via loans or grants and boosting domestic production of semiconductors could serve an easy win. He can claim this is coronavirus stimulus money to build manufacturing jobs or whatever. GM gets its chips from Qualcomm, which has a ton of facilities in the US and is based in San Diego. This can serve as an easy political win for Biden. 

2) Charging stations. This isn't going to be a concern for much longer. Most people don't drive for long haul journeys, so driving stations aren't really needed. Think about it. If you could fill up your car with gas at home, would you ever go to a gas station? Very rarely. This is the point of EVs, and it's why I think they'll be the future. Also I hate to mention Biden again, but he's planning to put 500,000 public charging stations in the US by 2030. This won't be a problem much longer. ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-02/joe-biden-plan-to-fight-climate-change-could-sell-25-million-electric-cars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-02/joe-biden-plan-to-fight-climate-change-could-sell-25-million-electric-cars))

3) bEaR mArKEt. Chill. This shit happens every couple of months. People panic and say the market is crashing. It's not. Even if it was, GM would hardly be hit because its PE is so stupidly low. IMO the only company that should tank a ton is Tesla. People always bring up the **bUfFeT inDicAtoR** because they think Buffet is some kind of god. He's not. Sometimes Buffet is an idiot. He doesn't understand the tech industry, and I think the rise in stocks recently is tech related. We're entering a new era of American capitalism where tech companies dominate. 7% stock market growth is the norm. With GDP rising 2% per year, you should expect to see a high divergence in the long run. The buffet indicator only measures GDP too, which isn't remotely the same as stock prices. Stocks get their values from earnings and also the assets the company owns. GDP doesn't factor wealth into consideration at all. 

One last point: people think it's a buy and hold for 10 years, but it's not. I think GM will go to the moon ($5000) quicker than you think. Stocks move faster than reality and price in future expectations. There are a lot of catalysts incoming (charging stations, no new gas cars, chip production, and cap and trade). If any one of these things are announced, that's GM to $100. 

&#x200B;

tl;dr Buy GM. Cap and trade, EV ban, and its undervalued price make it super attractive. GM will hit $5000. Buy or cry.

Positions: GM 1/21/22 $60c (I plan to roll over these options as they approach expiration)"

No squeeze, no HFs, just good ol’ fashioned numbers and the Google.

**I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR, AND I’M NOT RECOMMENDING STOCKS. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH AND LEAVE ME ALONE.**

TL;DR -  if GME was valued normally, it would be worth anywhere from $150-400 per share.

**First off, there’s a world where GME is worth nothing.** That’s a world where the new leadership fails, GameStop can’t become a key player in the gaming industry, and somebody else cannibalizes their market. **I don’t think that’s likely.** The store focuses on market segments like gaming, nerd toys, and increasingly PCs where the normal consumer is criminally underserved. So, it seems likely to me that they’ll be able to carve out a solid spot in the market as they up their online game.

Now let’s look at their fundamentals. For the last few years they’ve been running at a loss, but they’ve been turning that around and seem primed to continue doing so with their new initiatives. Before running a loss, they were generating about **$2-4** average **Earnings Per Share** **(EPS).** That puts them in line with stores like Best Buy, that hovers around $5-6 EPS. Remember, there are just under **70 million shares** of the company, so every **$70M** in profits is a dollar in EPS. So **$210M** of profit – for a company that did ***$6 BILLION*** in revenue in 2020 – isn’t a huge lift.

Here’s the thing – the average Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) for retailers is **20.54** – so **<$20** of share price per dollar of EPS. For digital retailers, the average is **38.96** – almost **$40** of share price per dollar of EPS. Assuming GameStop makes a strong move into the digital space and shores up their balance sheet, their pure fundamental fair value is conservatively (with no short squeeze) anywhere from a **minimum of $65** (minimal profits and a market average PE ratio) **to $400** (10% profit on 2020 revenue and digital retailer average PE ratio) per share.

**In short, there is a lot of value here even outside of the HFs getting railed for their own stupidity.**

lr1l80,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr1l80/pltr_extensive_dd_part_2_what_makes_it/,$PLTR Extensive DD Part 2: What Makes it Disruptive/Valuation,419,118,2021-02-24 10:42:56,"Yesterday I posted a lengthy DD on Palantir Technologies ($PLTR), where I went in-depth on my evaluation of the firm's history, its financials, and why I believe the naysayers are wrong (Link included here:[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq8rw4/i\_think\_pltr\_is\_invincible\_rn\_and\_in\_the\_long\_run/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq8rw4/i_think_pltr_is_invincible_rn_and_in_the_long_run/) )-i do recommend reading this first, this post is meant to be a follow-up/supplement to my liking of this stock.

But I wanted to go more in-depth into just why I find this company so special and unique. As I mentioned in my DD last night, I am just a 19-year-old college student, not an investment banker or hotshot market maker, but I believe the information I have ascertained about Palantir by just scouring the web distinguishes it from any company on the planet (but we'll keep it strictly to the software industry in this DD).

What is truly unique about Palantir's software (Gotham, Foundry, Apollo) is how collaborative, scalable, and advanced it is. Let me break this down: Palantir's software is COLLABORATIVE b/c it meshes the company's clients' data into a mega cloud. For example, the LAPD, BP, JP Morgan, and top law firms all upload their data onto Palantir's cloud, where they can get insights into efficiency, efficacy, and receive suggestions from the advanced software on how to improve their venture (these guys are all PLTR clients btw), and particularly useful for say, defending an embassy or managing a supply chain.

Now, just to get it straight, there is no data/cloud that can come ANYWHERE close to the insights and knowledge on what Palantir has.  You might often hear from Wall Street research analysts/CNBC shills who complain that PLTR has too many rich clients (big companies/gov't). But I think what boomers don't understand is that building your foundation amongst the biggest fish in the sea is quite the ADVANTAGE, not a weakness.

Let me use an example from our beloved Cathie Wood and her firm Ark Invest's large position in Tesla extremely quickly (I promise). When asked about how she felt about Tesla's performance in the autonomous driving space compared to competitors like Waymo (owned by Google), she commented last year that **having a vast collection of data** would separate those who succeed from those who attempt. As a reference, Tesla cars all transmit self-driving data back to the firm, which comes about through the many Tesla owners who drive all over the world. On the other hand, Waymo is committed to private testing stages only, which is shallow-minded b/c it doesn't have access to trial data on say, congested roads.

Back to PLTR. The reason I bring up the Waymo-Tesla-Ark example is to highlight just how many clients PLTR's revenue base represents, and how impactful that is on a company's growth, scalability, and ultimately, the *success of their product*. But I mean when you think about it, Palantir's clientele is the **ENTIRE GLOBAL ECONOMY/SOCIETY**. Go to the *Financial Times*, and try to find me an article that doesn't talk up Palantir's greatness in the U.K and their work helping NIH. EU members like Greece/France also use it for COVID vaccine tracking. Palantir has contracts with the Japanese/South Korean governments. Palantir has notably helped the U.S. catch infamous cucks like Osama Bin Laden to Bernie Madoff. Quite the diversity!

The reason for that entire BJ to Palantir right there is to illustrate just how extensive this scale is. Not only is all this data accessible RIGHT NOW to all these clients to collaborate on Palantir's platform, but is comprised of the single most dominant and sustainable institutions/enterprises in the world. No matter how the political winds blow or how the global/domestic economy winds up, you can count on 3M, the DoD, Ferrari- to name a few- to continue seeking ways to scale, grow, expand, and Palantir certainly is the way.

This gets back to another central, bulletproof thesis surrounding Palantir. Who are its competitors? Who can do what Palantir does? 

Let's start with Snowflake. All credit to their talented team, Warren Buffett, and their gang of bulge bracket banks who underwrote their IPO and cheerlead the stock on media outlets on the daily. But for lack of a better word, their software just isn't *dope* enough. I mean the UI contrast speaks for itself, but the intelligence is what matters here. Yes, data warehousing is no joke and is certainly a scalable business, but what kind of innovative insights can you draw from just essentially a digital warehouse that doesn't add any value? All Snowflake really is is Salesforce dressed up in pretty bells and whistles. Really makes me question Buffett's whole commitment to ""value.""

[C3.AI](https://C3.AI) at least has me interested. It seems like a real knock-off version of Palantir based on what I can ascertain from their public materials, but so what? A bunch of washed-up junkies from Oracle think they can lead the transition to AI? Compared to a company that was seeded in 2003 specifically to work with the CIA and other intelligence agencies after 9/11 (PLTR also called the ""gold standard"" by these agencies according to *TechCrunch*), why waste your time in [C3.AI](https://C3.AI) or Snowflake? Don't even get make me started on Splunk, IBM (who conceded they suck by signing on w/ PLTR last week), or MSFT.

And while we're at it, let's talk about valuations to drive the point home. According to the *Financial Times,* PLTR is valued at a $48B market cap and is trading at 34X 2021 estimated sales. To start, yes that is very lofty, even after accounting for the recent sell-off due to earnings/lock-up fears. But I'll pick on my prime targets, SNOW and AI, if we can even call them competitors (we'll be nice). SNOW has just under an $80B market cap, but is trading at 80x 2021 estimated sales! AI is trading at a $15B market cap, and is trading at 70.5x 2020 estimated sales!! That's fucking crazy, and Buffett should sell SNOW immediately if he cares about value (or he just doesn't understand technology).

Since the whole speculation is going to be about earnings in the next few years, let's talk about that. As I mentioned in my DD yesterday, PLTR reported EPS of $0.06/share on a non-GAAP basis, which is TRIPLE what the street predicted!! But thanks to a $100M stockholder compensation expense, the GAAP basis was a loss of $0.02/share, and Wall ST took the opportunity to AMBUSH PLTR. 

If you understand how business development works, these incentives are necessary in the early stages of a company. How else do you expect to attract top talent to the company and incentivize existing brains to stay? But as you grow into your valuations, like PLTR will, why do you need to do it? (PLTR has essentially promised 30% + growth for 5+ years, and earnings are on the way this year thanks to their earnings report). Who does Apple need to incentivize to stay? Wall St is simply trying to make something out of nothing.

I also mentioned PLTR was a direct-listing yesterday, unlike any of these other names here. If you don't know what that means, basically PLTR didn't have its IPO underwritten by banks or pay them massive fees in the process. So equity research, investment banking, asset management, and other areas of lucrative finance have no incentive to talk up PLTR (just Jeffries it seems for now).

And this is what I mean. Again as I mentioned yesterday, it happens with all megacap tech companies. Think about it as evolution. Facebook. Apple. Tesla. Google. Microsoft. These guys weren't oversubscribed by the money makers either, nor were they cheaply valued either. But by the time the robust top line translated into earnings, these firms were worth hundreds of billions of $ with the snap of your fingers, which is exactly what will happen with Palantir (we are already seeing this- their institutional ownership nearly doubled from 12% in January to 21% right now).

This is what I want you all to think about. As a disclosure, I am very long PLTR (you can view my positions on yesterday's DD), but irregardless of whether you will invest in it or not, read about Palantir Technologies. This is the company of the future: able to tailor its cutting-edge technology to all the intricate challenges the 21st century projects: climate change, further space exploration, geopolitical/nuclear tensions, renewable energy adoption, inequality, police reform, and so much more, while providing a platform for all these parties to collaborate and improve. Given the world is an ever expanding place, and the dominant players are already seated at the table, I could not feel more relieved or excited than to have all my chips in the one waiter who will serve them all.

\*\***This is not financial advice. I recommend you read up on PLTR, pour through its financials, and hear more from its CEO, Alex Karp, and Chairman, Peter Thiel- then make your own informed, balanced, intelligent, rational decision. Without a doubt, this will be** ***the*** **company being discussed in the decades to come, and I just want to expedite the conversation now.**"

If you think BB is a distraction from any other stock, then scroll on past these tendies new blood.

https://presentations.akamaized.net/FileLibrary/1218/4/AWS_BlackBerry_Final_Slides.pdf

Blackberry and Amazon Web Services just finished their webinar explaining their multi-year, global agreement to develop BB IVY. They are addressing the undeniable need for software development in the growing and evolving automotive space in terms of apps, shared mobility, and software development and updates and how they can help solve and transform them.

**TLDR:** Blackberry will help automakers address the security issues, while delivering constant updates to a vehicles software in their infotainment system, apps, voice assistant capabilities, and also active safety features (including self driving). 

They will also help monetize on the ecosystem of in-vehicle apps and services, and BB will also be a bigger giant in this space because compared to Apple or Google who want to own this information, BB offers it to their OEM partner.

They are transforming the UI and product design of 
their products in cars and also working on a way of allowing customers to communicate to other endpoint destinations and operating systems (not just QNX).

Key Points:

1. **Ivy benefits the whole value-chain** because modern cars and trucks are built with thousands of parts from many different suppliers, with each vehicle model comprising a unique set of proprietary hardware and software components. These components, which include an increasing variety of vehicle sensors, produce data in unique and specialized formats. This requires highly specific skills required to interact with this data and with BB IVY there is no need to worry about special automotive programming languages, hardware variations, or proprietary sensor data formats.

This means the developers won’t need specialized or automotive software skills and the consumer (driver) gets more frequent feature updates allowing for better performance/experience along with safety of their data. 

2. **Data is the new Gold/Oil**. Blackberry pivoted from phones many years ago and has had a vision to build a data analytics platform for years which they showcased at CES 2 years ago.

In a Bloomberg interview, John Chen says that this new business model creates a recurring data business for BB. This revenue stream should not be overlooked as a Mckinsey&Co report outlined that connected cars will allow for the OEMs to monetize data from connected cars. We all know that 7/10 most valuable companies in the world generate billions in profits from data-based services.

Chen explains that Amazon is interested in BB:

1. QNX provides Amazon with a secure, safety certified OS (aka the “plumbing” or ecosystem Ivy will be built on)
2. BB secures all endpoints in the Internet of Things
3. Potential move to provide endpoint-based security platforms to **Amazon Alexa, Amazon delivery drones, Smart stores**, etc.

**What does Amazon provide BB:**

1. AWS experience with user interfaces
2. AWS Cloud
3. Machine learning models from AWS Management Console

So what about competition?

Chen points out that he is not worried about Apple and Google entering the space as they also only have experience with user interfaces and, but they lack experience in the OEM space with the ecosystems. The leverage BB also has over them is that Google and Apple want to own the data themselves, where BB would offer it to their OEM partners, which is very valuable data to automakers.

End note: 

The automotive space is changing rapidly as every single company is rushing to make more technologically advanced cars. If you own a Tesla you are already aware how crucial the Apps, Self driving, Car software updates, etc. are all crucial to the experience of next generation cars. 61% of the EV market already use QNX and soon every car will be needing more security and BB is already in 175 million cars that haven’t even scratched the surface of being next gen. Among Amazon, Baidu, and Motional, Lucid motors is also on the plate and hiring a QNX specific engineer at the moment. 

**Bear’s Case**
The opposition says that BB’s revenue has yet to prove that it has grown as a software company in the automotive space. One of the first disadvantages, according to analysts, is that it’s still a small-scale company compared to several of its software security competitors. This will make it very difficult to compete with competitors much larger.

The company also hasn’t proven it can consistently grow its business solely as a software company. Furthermore, BlackBerry stock has slowly been losing market share for years, especially in endpoint management.

So although operations may be stabilizing as of recently, analysts still see a tough path to consistent growth for BlackBerry.

But in my bias opinion, BB has tackled many of these obstacles just this year. Partnering with big names in different spaces has provided recognition, new sources of revenue, AND public awareness.

Nobody is forcing you to read BB updates and I ain’t trying distract you from shit. BB isn’t a boomer phone company anymore, educate yourselves in any stock before investing.

My non-professional price target: $20.00 is feasible and modest EOY. 2x? 3x from there?Nobody knows what the limit is, but it’s a steal at the current price. This isn’t a squeeze or a heavily shorted company, it’s an **iNvEsTmEnt**.

Positions: Increased position of 4000 shares (2000 @ 9.67 BEFORE GME sent it on a rocket, and 2000 more averaging UP since shit hit the fan with GME) and 9/17 17c, 19c, 21c."

**Numbers Overview & Leadership**  
**TL;DR** \- 🔢👌

NASDAQ: **RAVN**

|Market Cap|$1.5B|
|:-|:-|
|Shares Outstanding / Float|35.9M/35.4M|
|% Held by Institutions|80.07%|
|EPS\*|0.61|
|P/E\*|69.78|
|Price/Book|4.63|

\*I know numbers make some of you dizzy, and I wish I didn't feel like I needed to include this, but for you fellow tards that keep investing in companies that don't have products yet, EPS is Earnings per Share and P/E is Price to Earnings. These things mean the company is actually making money.

Looking back, the company got pretty fucked by COVID. Their EPS dropped from over $1.00 in 2019 to the $0.61 listed above in 2020, but their earnings have largely recovered as of Q4 2020 ($0.28 in 2019 vs $0.24 in 2020).

Also of note, they ""indefinitely suspended"" (read axed) their dividends in 2020 to more aggressively invest in their growth areas.

Overall, there's nothing exceptional about those numbers. My key take-aways were that, unlike some other companies in the sectors Raven is in, the price isn't insanely inflated. The fact that over 80% is held by institutions (Blackrock, Vanguard, and Thrivent are the top 3 holders, all of whom added last quarter) is also reassuring.

As for the leadership, no one really stands out as an all star or an asshole. The CEO/President is a home grown dude who started at the company as an intern back around the time of Christ. Everyone is about what you'd expect--a dude with a masters from MIT, a buncha dudes with MBAs, etc.

**Bottom Line--this isn't some artificial hyped up bullshit.**

&#x200B;

**History**  
**TL;DR - 🥣🏭+👴💭+⌛➡🎈🏭**

Let's go back in time. To the time of dinosaurs. 65 whole years ago--when the contiguous 48 was the only 48. Some chucklefuck busts into his boss's office at the cereal factory they work at.

Chad: ""GOD DAMNIT. IM DONE WITH THIS SHIT HARRY. MAYBE THIS BETTY CROCKER MAKING, ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE SPONSORING BULLSHIT IS NOT FOR ME. MAYBE I WANT TO FLY.""  
Harry: ""Sounds good, Mr. Chad, sir""  
U.S. Navy: ""AND MY AXE""

And boom. A Raven baby.

""*MRE, I don't understand* 😖😢""  
Fuck I gotta spell everything out huh?

Back in 1956, a bunch of duders working at General Mills (yeah, of cheerios fame) High Altitude Research Division, broke off to form Raven Industries after their big brained leader, Ed ""Chad"" Yost got a $47,000 grant from the US Navy after he built and flew a tethered hot air balloon.

You remember all those old ""ITS A UFO""/""Nah bitch it's a weather balloon"" stories? Turns out a bunch of those were made by our boy ~~Ed~~ Chad--both from his time at the cereal station and from Raven itself.

""MRE THAT SOUND LIKE AN OLD COMPANY 😭. I DONT LIKE BOOMER SHIT 😓😥""  
Yo shut the fuck up. If Pfizer (founded in 1849) is still around and providing ~~little blue~~ fat green gains, you bet your undescended testies that a company like Raven can do the same. But I hear you. That was then, this is now. What's Raven done for me lately?

**Raven Aerostar**  
**TL;DR - 🎈🕵️‍♀️🏋️‍♀**

Decades later, Raven still gets some of those fat military contracts. [Last month](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/raven-aerostar-and-persistent-systems-network-constellation-of-stratospheric-balloons-in-comms-demo-301217001.html), they demoed a platform where they use a constellation of stratospheric balloons to create an on demand, low cost, reusable, wireless networking system above battlefields or other points of interest.

These aren't your kids party balloons. And Dorothy, these aren't the wizard's balloons either. They have a bunch of different types created for different things. Some of these things go to the edge of space--Remember that dude who drank too many redbulls and jumped out off a balloon? That was Raven. You remember Google/Alphabets Loom project where they were going to float hot spots around the earth using balloons? Yeap. Raven.

In 2015 NASA needed to test their Supersonic Decelerator. To do that, they had to drop it from the edge of space. Guess how they did it. You bet your ass it was a big fucking balloon made by Raven. Raven got a special award for that, btw. But that wasn't the end of the relationship. In 2020 alone, NASA threw \~$3Mil at Raven for all sorts of weird studies--cosmic rays, the magnetosphere, atmospheric sciences, seismic events on Venus--they used balloons and raven for ALL that shit.

""MRE. I don't give a fuck about balloons.""

Well, you should. Along with that shit above, Raven's balloons have a bunch of capabilities that have yet to be fully realized simply because we don't have the technological capability to use it. Lets say, for example, that we wanted a worldwide network of autonomous delivery drones. What if there was a platform that could float around providing both a charging base and a warehouse simultaneously? Amazon has already thought of doing this with blimps/airships (I don't want to mislead you, there have been no public discussions between amazon and Raven that I've found, but I am sure that Raven would be a leading candidate to build them). What if you want to carry 8000lbs of fuel up to 110,000ft and let your futuristic spacecraft or drone or whatever refuel when it gets there? What if you want to go and survey an alien planet? Balloons can do all that shit. They can lift a shit ton of stuff for cheap, they're semi-autonomous and can control where they're hovering, and they stay up for MONTHS at a time. I get it, though, fuck balloons I guess.

Raven Aerostar also makes:

* Military Radars and early detection systems
* Payload recovery parachutes (think rocket parts falling back down, high altitude payload drops, etc)
* Stratospheric airships
* Aerostats (which the army keeps buying)
* Various ""Dry suits"" and other PPE

""Wait. Dry suits? Why?""

**Raven Engineered Films**  
**TL;DR - 👩‍🔬👨‍🔬🧪➡👩‍🌾👩‍🚀🥗🎈🏠**

You thought ""Raven Industries"" was just Aerospace and Defense? Fucking. Wrong. Raven is a conglomerate. For you smoothbrained fucks, that means it's a business slaver. Its a business that makes money by owning businesses that actually do work. These include Raven Aerostar (Aerostar International, Inc. and Aerostar Technical Solutions), but also other shit.

When Raven started doing crazy shit with balloons, there literally weren't companies making the materials that they needed. So what did they do? Started making it themselves.

Along with the various materials for the balloons, Raven learned to make all sorts of materials. Ultra-thin, ultra-light films? Check? Thicc ass fiber reinforced shit? Check. Everything in between? double check. Seriously. You want some shit to wrap around your plants so you're not wasting water? How about shit to put over one field while another one is being fumigated? What if you wanted to build a temporary structure to keep something warm while a more permanent structure was being built? What if you had a shit ton of nasty ass shit that you didn't want leaking into mama earth (land fills, fracking water, etc)? What if you had a fuck ton of cotton that you had farmed but if it got wet, shipping bills would be \~5x more expensive? What if you needed to ship some veggies across the country? You ever see those half built houses getting carried down the road with big ass pieces of plastic on them so you can't see in the living room? What if you want to build your own living room but you got argon seeping up out of the ground? Yeah... All of this is Raven. And I'm just scratching the surface. I was going to try to cover everything, but fuck I still need my fingers to buy FDs. [Go look for yourself](https://ravenefd.com/products). Then check out [geomembranes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomembrane#Applications). And again. that's just one of their products.

And they have all sorts of ways to do this. They do blown film (heh), cast film, sheeting, laminating, coating, and basically anything you could think to do with large pieces of single materials.

So they're fucking with space, military, farmers, builders, energy, and more. They got flying shit, beeping shit, floating shit, anti-seeping shit. Honestly it's kind of hard to stay on track writing all this. Speaking of staying on track, though...

**Raven Applied Technology**  
**TL;DR - 🚜+💻+🛰=🥗🍅🍊🥔🥙💲💲**

Yeah. I get it. This is long as fuck. I'ma keep this part short. Raven one of the leaders in autonomous farming tech and precision agriculture. Want to make the best possible use of some specific land and get that bitch farming itself? Raven is the company to call. They make and use field computers and GPS to measure with sub-meter accuracy and then provide the data crunching to plan it all out. They even have a software suite designed to enhance efficiency on the office side of farming businesses.

Also of note--they acquired an autonomous agriculture startup ""SmartAg"" as well as majority ownership in another autonomous tractor startup ""Dot Technology Corp"" at the end of 2019  (they acquired the rest of DOT in 2020) and have been folding their stuff into Raven's pre-existing systems ever since--the first revenues from this acquisition are probably just now coming to fruition, with much more potential.

**Review and Future**  
**TL;DR** **-** **💹 $50-65 End of March, $70-90 EoY**

So if you're keeping up Raven is an established company that came from (at the time) futuristic ideas and has recently made moves showing it's still looking toward the future. At the base of this growth, it already has:

* Long standing relationships and active contracts with both the US DoD and NASA
* A ton of products with space and futuristic applications
* Ownership of production for proprietary materials used in aerospace, construction, farming, and just about everything else
* Autonomous agriculture solutions and precision agriculture planning software

Fuck this sounds like something Mama Cathie would like.

Because it is. ARKQ currently owns 3.33% of RAVN, and that number has been increasing. Cathie has been using the past few red days to buy some shit on sale, but she's also been **buying RAVN at 52 week highs.** She's bought RAVN 4 out of the last 5 trading days (excluding today, or maybe not--I don't have that info at time of writing).

I'm not gonna spout some bullshit about guaranteeing it'll be in ARKX. Anyone saying something is a lock is just lying to you. Mama Cathie does as Mama Cathie wants and we'll all fucking like it. That said, I would be extremely surprised if it's not a consideration for her.

So where do we go from here? Just like the balloons, we go up. Obviously. Nasdaq has been doing its best to keep this bird's wings clipped the past few days, but RAVN has been growing regardless (at least prior to today--may have finally gotten it to come down temporarily, but I'm not ruling out a late rally). Regardless, I'm looking at hitting a new ATH around $50 (\~$1.7B valuation)before the end of March (sooner if NDX can quit being a bitch). If it's added to ARKX, I think $60-$65 ($\~2.3B valuation) could be realistic in that same time frame. Because of their re-found focus on growth (again, shown by their cutting dividends to reinvest) and recent strategic acquisitions, I'm targeting $70 (\~$2.5B valuation) without ARKX or $90 with (\~$3.2B valuation) EOY.

Here is the data I collected and an Explanation.

Ok, after 3 hours of work here we go.  (Note Totals are shown at the bottom in green and red.)

1. A: Represents the Type of Award Given.
2. AX: The total number of awards given of that type of award.
3. AY: The number of years of Reddit premium that DFV will receive of that category of award. 
4. AZ: The total amount of coins DFV will receive from those awards.
5. BA: The price of the award in coins. 
6. BB: The total amount of coins required to purchase that specific award (NOTE: look horizontally) 
7. BC: The money spent to purchase those coins. (NOTE: I calculated this In terms of the best deal 82,000 for 199.99 so this is not 100% accurate but pretty close.)
8. BD: The amount of $GME Shares that could've been bought with that money at market value (Close FEB 22 46.00)

Looking at this we can see, with all the awards totalled up, u/deepfuckingvalue receives a whopping 40.9 years of Reddit premium. Those awards will give him an eye-popping 396,900 Reddit coins on top of the 335,300 total coins he will receive if he lives out his 40.9-year Reddit premium credits. The total amount of coins needed to purchase those awards is 2,300,250, those coins have a real-world value of about $5,627 (Keep in mind 5,627/82000\*199.99 so your getting the best deal possible on coins, I didn't feel like doing it the long way lol) or in autist language, 122.203 GME shares which would be worth around 42,466 at the spike. And, these are just awards that gift DFV Coins or RP, counting the non-gifting awards and their price is my next project! :)

Happy holding!

Later Autists."

Positions:

Why $PEP, a boring ass boomer stock? Well, a few reasons. Firstly, earlier this month Pepsi announced that they would have a quarterly dividend of $1.0225 a share, a 7% increase versus the comparable year-ago period. If you own the stock by March 3rd, and hold it through the end of the month, you get paid.

Cool dude, I can get four dollars and nine cents a share per year when I just lost five figures diamond holding GME. Yeah, it's a boomer thing to care about, but I'm not gonna lie, I'm excited to get my $57.26 in late March for my common shares. And I'm betting a lot of risk averse bears like myself are thinking the same way. Google best dividend stocks - Pepsi comes up frequently. All these boomer money managers are going to want to show some cash in their clients accounts - they're moving over to Pepsi.

You're probably thinking I'm an idiot for believing I'm the first person to consider that stocks might rise before a dividend payout. Clearly the market will account for this and price it in beforehand. I'm not outsmarting Wall St. However, I do believe there might be extra pressures this year that just might not be accounted for. We're all a little nervous in this market. Money flew to travel stocks today and out of tech. But once travel stocks take their profits, I think dividend stocks will seem extra comfortable.

In addition, $PEP has been a little unloved lately, despite surviving COVID just fine and slightly beating earnings estimates. Their forecast was boring and nothing special, just like it should be for the company, but in this insane tech valuation market Wall St has sent the stock in a slow sell off. I don't understand technicals, but it looks like the stock is potentially oversold, and that most of the sellers are now out of the game, and dividend buyers are ready to jump back in:

So why the strike prices and dates I've chose? I don't really know. Perhaps March 5 would maximize profits. I'm mostly being a nit on this one, as I have no idea what I'm doing."

I am open to counter-arguments so please feel free to roast me on my first DD.

TLDR: Retail is not dying, it is transforming and even COVID was not enough to kill Class A malls. Bears and paper hands are driving MAC below their intrinsic value. Boomers are gonna flock to MAC when previous dividends are reinstated. MAC is at the Launchpad ready for its moon mission.

Positions: $15k in $35 Jan 2023 leaps and $5k in $35 Jan 2022 leaps (because I am a non-resident alien and I do not want Uncle Sam to tax 30% of my dividends, and whats a YOLO without options?)

**What is MAC?**

MAC is Macerich Company, which owns and operate 52 regional malls in the United States. Macerich’s malls comprises of trophy properties (Class A Malls) in the most desirable, densely populated and highest-barrier-to-entry U.S. markets.

**So what happened? (Bear thesis)**

1. Retail Apocalypse 

The biggest factor responsible for the rapid dying of brick and mortar stores is the rise and shift of consumer habits towards e-commerce, and Amazon stands as the apex predator of brick and mortar stores. If so, then how do you explain this - [Five Reasons Why Amazon Is Moving Into Bricks-And-Mortar Retail](https://www.forbes.com/sites/annaschaverien/2018/12/29/amazon-online-offline-store-retail/)?

&#x200B;

Not all malls are created equal, and they are further classified into Class A, B, C, & D’s. [Per Green Street’s analysis](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/10/a-third-of-americas-malls-will-disappear-by-next-year-jan-kniffen.html), there are roughly 380 C- and D-rated malls out of the 1,000. And those are considered the most at risk of going dark, permanently, as they don’t generate enough sales to maintain the property and have greater vacancy rates. Green Street has said C malls “are not viable retail centers long term.”

The population then gets redirected towards the surviving Class A malls, which theoretically means that there will be even higher human traffic, triggering a chain reaction of boosting sales psf, which increases rent levels, thus improving dividend yield, and ultimately share price.

2. Debt on its balance sheet

Macerich ended the [most recent quarter](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MAC/key-statistics/) with $6.2bn worth of debt and equity of $2.4bn, resulting in a Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 2.5 times. This drew concerns to its highly leveraged balance sheet, however, roughly $4.3bn of debt are Mortgage Notes Payable, and are non-recourse to the company according to [Form 10-Q filed 11/06/2020](http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14486154&RcvdDate=11/6/2020&CoName=MACERICH%20CO&FormType=10-Q&View=html). This means that each property is responsible to generate income to cover its own mortgage, and a default on mortgage will result in Macerich turning over the defaulted property’s keys to its lenders (banks), while the rest of Macerich’s operations continue unaffected. 

The reality though, is that banks would rather award extensions to the maturing mortgages than to take over the keys of properties as evidenced by [SPG's jingle mail](https://wolfstreet.com/2021/02/04/deutsche-bank-got-jingle-mail-from-1-us-mall-reit-simon-property-group-foreclosed-on-mall-got-no-bids/). And Macerich has [successfully secured over $660m](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/11/the-macerich-company-mac-q4-2020-earnings-call-tra/) for 4 of their mortgage loans, with similar expectations on the remaining mortgages which matures in 2021. 

The remaining debt comes in the form of their revolving credit line which they [withdrew the last $550m](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/macerich-provides-covid-19-update-301030753.html) of $1.5bn in March 2020 in preparation to handle the impact of COVID-19.

The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan [liquidated all of its 25 million shares](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wallstreetbets-short-squeeze-mania-subsides-for-macerich-2021-02-02) which it had held for over two decades, and this was seen as “smart money” pulling out of Macerich. However institutional ownership still stands at [over 85% of total outstanding shares](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/mac/institutional-holdings). Some viewed the liquidation as the pension fund capitalizing on the bump in the share price due to the short squeeze, and pulling out of a highly volatile holding which wasn’t suited to its more passive investment style.

4. COVID-19 

The pandemic was supposed to be the last nail in the coffin in the retail apocalypse, with the lockdowns and mall closures. But the pandemic has also shown that the population cannot live without malls, check out the walking tour of Tysons Corner Center in Dec 2020 on youtube (unable to post youtube links, idk why). Imagine the amount of shoppers around Macerich’s malls when we finally achieve herd immunity with the successful rollouts of vaccines.

**What’s next? (Bull Thesis)** 

1. Management Flexibility

Gone are the days where malls mostly consisted of fashion apparels and departmental stores, with many surviving malls transiting into adaptions which offer amenities, experiences and entertainment to enhance the shopping experience. Macerich has proven that it is flexible and adaptable to the evolving landscape of consumerism through the following projects:

a. [Tysons Corner Center](https://www.macerich.com/Leasing/Property/202) – Combining [luxury rental apartments](https://investing.macerich.com/news-releases/news-release-details/macerich-announces-opening-vita-residences-tysons-corner-center), [hotel managed by Hyatt Regency](https://investing.macerich.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hyatt-regency-manage-hotel-tysons-corner-center), [office towers](https://investing.macerich.com/news-releases/news-release-details/macerichs-tysons-tower-named-2014-best-new-office-development) with the ultimate shopping experience, basically creating its own city within a city.

b. [One Westside](https://investing.macerich.com/news-releases/news-release-details/google-leases-one-westside-hudson-pacific-properties-and) – Formerly known as Westside Pavilion, the dying mall has now resurrected, like a phoenix from the ashes, into Google’s creative office campus due to be completed in 2022 with a lease of 14 years.

c. [Wilton Mall](https://www.wiltonmall.com/Directory/Details/766523) – In the same space which Sears used to occupy, [Saratoga Hospital has since taken over for their hospital support functions](https://www.saratogahospital.org/News/saratoga-hospital-opens-first-offices-in-wilton-mall), to free up much needed space at the main hospital campus for more inpatient rooms and services which requires the capabilities only a hospital can provide.

d. More redevelopment plans can be found in their [Feb 2021 8-K filing](https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14694100&RcvdDate=2/11/2021&CoName=MACERICH%20CO&FormType=8-K&View=html) (pg 26).

2. Instrinsic Value

Removing properties with mortgage debt from the list of properties in their most recent [10-K filing](https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=13949368&RcvdDate=2/25/2020&CoName=MACERICH%20CO&FormType=10-K&View=html), we will arrive at the same [list of properties](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/reddit.com/r/MACArmyBets/comments/lkon2l/25_properties_are_owned_free_and_clear/) provided by [u/IndividualPlant6861](https://www.reddit.com/user/IndividualPlant6861/), which are highly likely to be owned by Macerich free and clear of debts. For the exact values of these assets, let us refer to the transcript of their [Q4 2020 Earnings Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/11/the-macerich-company-mac-q4-2020-earnings-call-tra/), where CEO O’Hern mentioned “unencumbered pool (of assets) is significant enough to support our existing line of credit of $1.5 billion”. Taking the face value of $1.5bn of unencumbered assets and the $555m cash on hand, Macerich has an intrinsic value of $2.05bn, even if they were to default on all outstanding mortgages in a worst case scenario.

So at their current market cap of $1.88bn, they are trading at a 9% discount in the most conservative estimate.

3. Achievements in 2020

Collection Rate – Extracted from their [8-K filing](https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14694100&RcvdDate=2/11/2021&CoName=MACERICH%20CO&FormType=8-K&View=html), Macerich has achieved collection rates of 89% in the third quarter and 92% in the fourth quarter of 2020, with significant improvement during the fourth quarter in tenant openings and leasing activity. At year-end 2020, occupancy was 89.7%. 

[Bureau Veritas SafeGuard™ Certification](https://investing.macerich.com/news-releases/news-release-details/macerich-earns-bureau-veritas-safeguardtm-certification-key) – In a safety and hygiene conscious year of COVID-19, Macerich has continued to put safety first – and implementing the industry's highest hygiene and health standards to protect their employees, retailers and shoppers.

[Top Global Sustainability Honors](https://investing.macerich.com/news-releases/news-release-details/macerich-again-earns-top-global-sustainability-honors) – Macerich launched its One Million Meals Challenge to direct donated non-perishable food items to dozens of food banks across the country. Their commitment to the people, communities and the planet, during this COVID-19 pandemic, has earned them the recognition they deserved.

4. Short Interest

Although the squeeze has been squozed, with more than half of the shorts covered, the remaining 34 million shares shorted is still a significant 25% of current float. And as Macerich improves and eventually reinstate its dividends of $3 pre-COVID, these shorts will be liable to pay out those dividends, coupled with rising stock price, causing a double whammy for the bears. So when the time comes for these shorts to cover, we can expect Macerich’s share price to appreciate reasonably.

Conclusion

I believe that MAC has been severely undervalued due to the overreaction from the “retail apocalypse” and COVID-19 combo, and the focus on short term results on quarterly earnings. The resiliency of Macerich has proven that they will overcome this pandemic and rise from the ashes and the market will soon reflect the [fair intrinsic value](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/mac/quote)."

# Quick Thoughts

**Europe and the Stability and Growth Pact (ok this one is a bit boring)**

[The Stability and Growth Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_and_Growth_Pact) is ""*an agreement, among the 27 member states of the European Union, to facilitate and maintain the stability of the Economic and Monetary Union*"". The goal is to monitor members of the EU and to make sure of their fiscal stability. If the country's deficit or debt is higher than a certain limit, the other members will give recommendations on policy actions to correct this. 

In 1997, at the inception of The Stability and Growth Act, the same limit was given to every state members and that was not very flexible. In 2004, they've reformed it to have limits specific to each states.

This is still not very flexible. A country might have a ""bad year"" and based on this model will still need to take corrective actions even if there was no problem to begin with. Some countries' debt and deficit are cyclical and highly variable while some are pretty stable. And sometimes, a big event might put countries in the red zone and they can't do much about it (\*hum hum\* the pandemic \*hum hum\*).

So, knowing all that, Europe decided at the beginning of the pandemic, to suspend those rules as they didn't make any sense during this context. And in the coming weeks, Europe will decide whether to extend this suspension or not.

This is a key event for countries like Italy or Greece but really mostly Italy. So let's talk about Italy.

**Italy might recover??! (Not clickbait!)**

Italy's budget deficit reached 10.9% of GDP in 2020 and IMF expects it to go down to 7.5% in 2021.

As for their public debt, it was at 157.5% of GDP in 2020 and is expected to rise to 159.7% this year.

If the Stability and Growth Pact was still in place, the EU would basically ask Italy to cut costs anywhere it can at this point because there's no way Italy will ever repay its debt. And EU wants that knowing full well it's the worst course of action for Italy's sake. But Italy and the rest of EU have different objectives : 

- Italy wants to recover (duh!) and hopes for a restructuration of their debt.
- The rest of EU sees how fucked Italy is and wants to help them but at the same time wants to make sure that this doesn't bring the whole EU down in the process.

Right now, the Stability and Growth Pact is suspended and Italy is set to get 200 billion euros from the EU's COVID Recovery Fund. It's crucial that Italy uses that money wisely. There are a lot of things going for them though :

- Draghi is now Prime Minister of Italy. He was president of the ECB for 8 years, and before that chair of the Financial Stability Board and Governor of the Bank of Italy for 5 years. So regarding finance, let's say he knows his stuff.
- Also, Draghi has a very big... majority at the Parliament which will let him do basically whatever he wants.
- If he manages to prove himself capable of creating growth in a economically declining country, then EU will be much more open to give them more money.

[Italy however decided to relax their pandemic restrictions](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20210201-restaurants-and-museums-reopen-as-italy-relaxes-coronavirus-curbs) which is being criticized by Health Minister Roberto Speranza and the WHO. While this can indeed increase the number of cases, so far the number of new cases stabilized at 12k per day (7-day moving average) in february. 

So if you need your gambling fix, you could go long on the Italia 40 index or you could stay on the sidelines and wait to have more informations on the matter. Or you could just not care at all, I wouldn't be offended.

**Home Depot earnings play**

Let's see the key points of last year :

- Their revenue was at 33bn in Q3 of 2020.
- Their net sales increased inside and outside of the US by roughly 18%.
- They expect to have slightly less revenue in Q4 of 2020 and Q1 of 2021.

My prediction is that, as countries reopen and all the constructions put on hold are resuming more and more, their revenue will beat expectations tomorrow.

My short-term and long-term bullish thesis :

- people are using their money for esentials only and if you've started big renovations before the pandemic it's pretty necessary to finish it. 
- a lot of people work from home and plan on continuing to do so so. That means they will need to upgrade their home in the near future or already upgraded it.
- some people are moving outside of the big cities and buying homes in smaller cities. This increases the number of renovations in the US.
- the Stay-At-Home situation makes people buy more stuff to improve their confort at home.

While some of this is factored in the price, I think investors are still pretty conservative and you can see it in the price action : it's flat since august last year.

So, today, I will buy some shares. If you want to increase your risk, you can make a small bet on this earnings and for the long term bet, you can buy calls expiring in 6 months.

... Or you could just wait and see what happens, I would not be offended.

Ok Bye!

There are some great Due Diligence posts out there regarding the short percentage on GME, the hiding of the shorts game with An ETF that cannot be named here and other ETF’s, and the AI model of where GME could moon at because of this.  I encourage everyone to search and read all these posts as I encourage all investors to research anything they are investing in.  They are great reads put together by apes with many more wrinkles on their brain than I have.  These posts explain out the different methods that people who are going to lose a lot of money are using against retail.  The high frequency trading, the media, and the schill accounts.

We all know why we are here, duh it’s cause “we like the stock”. Here is some possible catalyst information everyone should know about.  Any one of these things could be the catalyst that starts the squeeze or they could just bomb. We don’t know exactly what will start the frenzy. What we do know is that costs to hold shorts will need to increase and shares need to be called in before the shorters find that line where it’s no longer cost effective to hold their position and they have to buy at any cost and we get our tendies.  So here is a list of certain key items coming up.

1.  This weekend has created another major round of buzz concerning GME which started with the Congressional House Services Financial Committee Hearing on Thursday.  Then it really hit when u/deepfuckingvalue followed up to his response to the Congressman that he still though GME was a great value at its current price and then Friday put his money where his mouth is and bought another 50K shares.  Fucking legend.  That buzz has led into a lot of chatter this weekend that could start a FOMO buy on Monday.  A FOMO could drive the price which will cause the borrow rate of shorts to skyrocket and could cause lenders to start pulling back shares.  This “might” be all the catalyst we need to see the moon.

2. An ETF that cannot be named here is being used and a way for shorters to short GME since the fund holds GME stock as a part of it portfolio.  If State Street performs quarterly balancing and reallocations of their ETF their could be a call back of shares.  Honestly we don’t know if this will happen since none of us know the inner working of exactly what they are going to do but this could be the start of events that squeeze GME.

3. GME releases the quarterly earning on March 24th.  This report includes the sale of both new consoles as well as the Christmas rush.  In fact many stores opened back up after Covid lockdowns in the 4th quarter.  We also don’t know if any other information will be released at the time of the earnings report since they have been very tight lipped during this whole run other than announcing some new people that are going to help move GameStop in a new direction.

4.  Annual call back of shares prior to the June 2021 annual meeting.  In the months leading up to annual shareholder meetings many stocks end up becoming “Hard to Borrow” with additional rates and fees to borrow them.  The reason for this is that people who lend out shares do not get a vote at the annual shareholders meeting.  You can go back and research this historically for many companies and a quick google search will show you that last year GME shares had to be called back prior to 4/20/20 in order to vote at the shareholders meeting.  With all eyes on GME this year and the corporate changes my feeling is that this year will be no different.  I just hope the use the same callback date of 4/20 for obvious reasons.  The shareholders meeting is in June this year and I think it will be a great time for retail investors to go meet and greet since we know when we get together it will be one hell of a party.

Like I said I am not claiming any one of these things will happen or cause a catalyst but I thought it was important to get these things out in the open so everyone had an understanding of upcoming events.  Like it is repeated over and over again we don’t know when the squeeze will occur because we don’t know the shorters positions and where they feel their line is on cost to hold vs cost to give us our tendies. All we know is when it happens hold on.

Thank you for reading, hope you are all well informed.  Please do outside research and don’t rely on any one person as this is not financial advice.  I’m just a fellow ape holding GME that’s eats the crayons my wife’s boyfriend brings me when he comes over.  I prefer the orange crayons. I am not a cat. I like the stock. I thank you for the opportunity to bring you this information as it’s great information however I don’t have any good stories about growing up as a small child in Bulgaria.

lomoax,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lomoax/estimating_robinhoods_assets_under_management/,Estimating Robinhood’s Assets Under Management,51,23,2021-02-21 10:15:08,"Vlad bragged about customers $35B in unrealized profits over deposited funds in the financial hearing

There are 13 million RH accounts

Google searches claim average RH acct value is <$5k but I’m very skeptical that’s accurate

Assuming a range of $5k to $10k for average acct value would mean that Robinhood manages between 

$50B to $130B

Subtracting the quoted unrealized gains of $35B, would mean initial deposited customer funds were

$15B to $95B

Well $15B is too low that would mean avg retail account is up nearly 200% 

While $95B would still be approx 30% return 

Why does this matter?

Robinhood likely has more than $100B in Assets Under Management and they couldn’t even post $3B or even $1.4B of company funds to meet capital requirements. It’s their job to do this every single day, this isn’t an unforeseen business anomaly. And that’s less than 3% of money managed. So they are negligently under capitalized, even with the recent $3.4B raise. 

If Robinhood had met the capital requirements on the 28th, they would have failed to on the 29th as the Value at Risk continued to climb. In fact they will fail again if meme stocks take off before they raise again or IPO successfully.

Furthermore NSCC / DTC claim they provide tools & calculators to their members which allow them to estimate the required daily deposit and any hypothetical scenario. And Vlad has publicly admitted to following the GME action on Reddit for weeks prior to the spike (on the All-In podcast IIRC). They also limited AMC on margin days before GME became non-margin, which is questionable oversight in risk management practice.


P.S. I do agree with one point from Vlad, we need to switch to T0 or real-time settlement. T+1 is a cheap cop out that allows all of these things to occur again. As well as all of the shadowy things with share failure to deliver and short sales to continue to occur. Lastly the NSCC states that would lower required deposits 30-40% which means the trading halt still would have happened a day or two later.

Edit: incorrect calc on returns"

So I was just poking around randomly on Google. I found some interesting information that leads me to a retarded ape-like conspiracy.

Short end of it, I think Gamestop was in the process of closing everything down and I think the real estate division were giving Melvin inside information which is why they went so heavy on the shorts to begin with.

Let me explain my thought process. Maybe I'm retarded but you apes help me to see if I'm crazy or autistic.

The real estate connection begins with this PDF document:

[https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/CCIMCONNECT/8f473331-34dc-49b0-a5cc-4a6fe64f26ec/UploadedFiles/VqsY4FaMQna7C7UeT3Kb\_CCIM%20Preferred%20Partners%20Book%202019.pdf](https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/CCIMCONNECT/8f473331-34dc-49b0-a5cc-4a6fe64f26ec/UploadedFiles/VqsY4FaMQna7C7UeT3Kb_CCIM%20Preferred%20Partners%20Book%202019.pdf)

CCIM is a commercial real estate group that basically just puts people together in a room and does conferences and shit.

The PDF starts off innocently. Just a thank you note, President's Forward and random ads.

But then it begins to list a directory of members. On Page 46 there's a strange coincidence.

Gamestop's real estate leasing manager, Christopher Morris is listed.

Right underneath is Scott A. Morris of...... Citadel Partners LLC.

I was like holy shit when I saw that and I looked into it and Citadel Partners is a real estate group in Texas, doesn't seem to be a connection to our evil Citadel overlords. Just... a really funny coincidence. Maybe someone wrinklier brained than I can find an actual connection lol

But then I did some other digging and found a random document:

[https://cases.primeclerk.com/ascena/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTYzODk5Ng==&id2=0](https://cases.primeclerk.com/ascena/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTYzODk5Ng==&id2=0)

Which is a voting form for Ascena Retail Group's bankruptcy filing.

On page 49 and 50 something jumped out at me:

GOLDMAN SACHS & CO -- F/A/O MELVIN CAPITAL MGMT LP -- ATTN PRIME BROKER ACCOUNT

Idk if it's well known, because I had no idea but apparently Goldman Sachs handles Melvin's accounts.

I looked further into it and found:

[https://aum13f.com/fund/melvin-capital-ii-ltd](https://aum13f.com/fund/melvin-capital-ii-ltd)

**Custodian** Deutsche Bank Securities Inc, Morgan Stanley & Co LLC, JP Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman Sachs & Co LLC, National Financial Services LLC

Melvin is in publicly bed with Goldman and JP Morgan.

And it just so happens Jason Butler of JP Morgan Chase bank is also listed in that CCIM real estate group directory. I can't find anything about what Jason Butler does except this page which shows him as an analyst:

So would it be impossible to think that Christopher Morris, Gamestop's regional leasing manager, Jason Butler an analyst at JP Morgan got together at any one of the events CCIM held in 2014 ([https://www.ccim.com/networking/past-meetings-conferences/](https://www.ccim.com/networking/past-meetings-conferences/)) and had a little discussion about how Gamestop was considering bankruptcy as the digital age may be putting them in a bad position financially?

And then at that point word got around to Melvin who's probably paying for information like this from any one of their insider analysts at Goldman or JP Morgan and decided it's a safe bet to start shorting Gamestop?

Then all this shit hits the fan and now Gamestop is doing better than they've ever done and now have no plans to continue that route of possible bankruptcy and Ryan Cohen swooping in to save the day destroying all of Melvin's hard insider traded tendies.

It's a cooky theory but plausible.

My goal is not to make money.

My goal is not to lose money.

I am not trying to send a message.

I do not care about your upvotes.

I will not be donating any proceeds to charity. Namely because my goal implies that there will be no proceeds.

My goal is to ***own GameStop***. As absolutely much of it as I possibly can, while I am alive and on this planet.

Because of this, I *want* GME shares price to go down. Whether this occurs due to algo-driven price suppression or organic selling-off of shares. The more the value drops, the more shares I can afford to buy.

obligatory: Not financial advice. I like the stock. I fully expect everyone to watch me lose money on this.

-------------------------

Here are the facts:

1) **Mark Cuban raised a very valid point.** 

If you are investing in a company, the way we *used* to, as a person who actually wants to own a piece of that company, then prices going down is a good thing. Cheaper cost of entry / position expansion. 

2) **GameStop is poised to d.o.m.i.n.a.t.e. the space within the gaming industry.**

Looking to build Esports arenas? Guess what, gyms are going out of business left and right. Cheap real estate.

Dedicated gaming streaming channel? Disney and others are already on that bus for their niches, so dedicated game streaming platform owned by the single most universal name in gaming, would be no surprise. I'm not talking about livestreams, I'm talking about *produced* content.

Speaking of live, Twitch? Discord? Already set up, and instead of competing, GameStop could literally just *buy* these companies and relabel them Gwitch and Gamescord (or leave them as is, just own the revenue streams).

There are so many more things possible for a centralized brand with clear intentions of being a cultural hub (epicenter, really) for such a massively exploding industry (an industry with zero sign of slowing down. Ever). 

Entertainment as an all-things umbrella industry will only become bigger and more valuable as our human lives become increasingly comfortable, and more necessary as we deal with increasing amounts of stress when shit goes badly. *Interactive* entertainment is just unrivaled.

3) **The man, the legend, the boyfriend to all of our wives, DFV/Roaring Kitty/Mr. G, just doubled his shares position.** He undoubtedly recognizes the potential negative impact that him selling his entire position on GME would have on the stock, and I have little to no doubt that he has already pulled millions of dollars off the top of his originally exploding positions values (remember all those calls he had that were absolutely blowing up? I didn't do the math, and I'm not gonna, but I'd be willing to bet money that he didn't turn 100% of those profits into shares anywhere near the top).

Because of this, he has negative downside risk (GameStop could go bankrupt and he would still come out ahead). I'm in a much *much* smaller, but similar boat. I made $100K, and kept 100 shares, which I fully intend to take to my grave. This is the thing that got me thinking about this in the first place.

4) **GameStop will never be forgotten.** This is a stock which will be discussed in investment classes until the end of time. The face of investing will be changed forever because of WSB and the GME phenomenon. Even if there are not new regulations / trade taxes, the world will always *always* remember ""G.M.E.""

5) **I am just fine, financially.** My small business generates $100K to $250K/year in revenue. This is not a YOLO play. I can afford to lose the money I am putting in. Do not slide into my DMs seeking financial assistance. See above, where I discuss proceeds and how they won't exist, so there's no money anyway.

--------------------------------

**The Plan:**

- Buy *as many shares* as I can afford, never expecting to see that money ever again.

- Sell a few covered calls way in the future, at or out of the money. As they approach expiration, roll them forward another year. This will either reduce my cost basis as the price drops, or secure (and yes, limit) upside potential in the case of the stock going up significantly in value. As long as these options do not get exercised, I will still own the shares. I would prefer these options expire worthless so I may expand my share count over the 25-35% cash ROI every year (see below somewhere).

- As I earn more money externally, buy more shares. Again, as many as I can afford. Every. Single. Year. Just constantly expand my position. No matter what. Forever.

- ????

- Profit, never. Not ever sell a single share. Use any capital gained from selling covered calls to, you guessed it, buy more shares.

------------------------------------------

Remember, my goal here is to own shares, not to make money. Any money earned from selling calls will turn into more shares. Any money earned externally that I do not need access to will be turned into more shares.

Currently at-the-money covered calls expiring 1/21/22 (about a year out) are effectively worth 35-40% of the value of the stock. Assuming the stock value declines or stagnates YoY, then I could theoretically increase my position by a solid 35% each year. Yes, there will be a decrease in IV in this case, but using externally-earned money I should be able to make up the difference.

------------------------------------------

- **First milestone:** overtake u/DeepFuckingValue in share volume. I will never beat his % gains, and I may never exceed his actual cash value returns, but that is fine. My goal is purely share count. 

- **Second milestone:** overtake Ryan Cohen in share volume. My understanding is that he currently owns 9 million shares. I haven't dug any deeper than literally the first thing that pops up on google when you type ""ryan cohen gamestop shares"" and I'm not gonna. Anything further is basically the deep web and 9 million shares is a plenty fast rabbit to chase to keep myself motivated. I am confident that I will fail at my second milestone, as it would likely be reliant on Ryan selling his ownership in the company and moving on to do something else with his life, before I get old and die.

- **Third milestone:** Own, run, and manage GameStop. Whatever that means. Member of the board, sure? Bust in on meetings like ""Hey I own most of this place, someone grab me a coffee."" and then yell about how ""I pay your salary!"" as I'm being escorted out by security, more likely. But I'm not gonna stop until I am at the head of that table, even if I have keep at this until I am 85 years old, or even if it happens right before GameStop finally gives up the ghost and goes bankrupt.

------------------------------------------

With this strategy, cumulatively expanding my position by 35% YoY, I should be able to turn a 1,000-share portfolio into a 8million-share portfolio in 30 years. This is just based on current prices, options values, and my current income.

It couldn't bother me less if it goes to $1, $0.50, or $0.25 per share. At a certain point, cash infusion for shares from my income will grossly outweigh the rate at which options can possibly expand my ownership of the stock.

I like this stock, and if that means I end up owning enough shares to run that shit myself then I will consider my life a massive success.

------------------------------------------------------

The **only** disappointment I could possibly experience with this plan (it's not even a strategy at this point), would be if GME finally squeezes all at once and all these options get exercised, calling all my shares away from me, increasing my net worth by 35% all at once. 

Or if GME just does really well organically, which would significantly slow down the rate at which I could expand my ownership in shares.

Becoming a millionaire would be cool and all, but I'm trying to do something specific here.

SEC interns: I'm just sharing my thoughts and am in no way advising anything to anyone. I just like the damn stock.

Hedgies and MMs: please crank up your algos to maximum. Never stop doing what you're doing. I need this thing continually dropping so I can keep my covered call money and amass shares YoY.

Current 💎🙌 shareholders: you are the only thing standing in my way, and the ask ladder is pretty brutal with all y'all's meme-ass prices. If at some point you get bored and sell off to take profits, I will thank you for it. If you wanna dump that shit all at once and not worry about it (maybe shoot for buying back in lower), I'd appreciate that even more.

----------------------------------------------------------

Yes, I'm going to be updating y'all weekly or monthly or annually, whatever. Might be a little bit to get started, as I'm currently working to get all of my cash out of RH and somewhere better. But hey, I have 30 years to get this sorted out, right?

Make fun of me as I lose money. Ask me for advice as I make money. Call me an idiot for the platforms I use. Try to sell me access to your crappy web-based indicator research tools. None of it will matter. Whether I am a fool or a genius will undoubtedly be decided by a coin-toss of whether or not GME becomes 'fundamentally' valuable, I suppose.

**tl;dr - there is no tl;dr I am posting this just so I can reference it later when sharing my GME lifelong investor updates**


----------------------------------------------------------

edit: To clarify a few things for those who apparently can't sense where some choice satire/irony/sarcasm is within this post, as well as those who straight up can't do math:

- **Anyone who didn't chuckle at least a little bit at ""Gwitch"" and ""Gamescord"" is for sure dead inside.** 

Yeah, Twitch may be out of reach, but check out the timelines of Twitter adding pics, Instagram adding videos, and Vine existing (yes, vine is dead, but TikTok took over that vibe). I guarantee you something will be the ""Next Twitter"" or the ""Next Instagram"" or the ""Next Tiktok"". It likely will not literally replace these things, but it *will* provide the next thing users want that hasn't been addressed. And it will grow too big to get back the audience these 3 giants will have lost. Something similar *could* happen with gaming. And if GameStop makes it (or buys the small service outright before they get too big to be bought), then the prophecy will have come true.

- **Sick burns, everyone.** 

I have not laughed this hard reading comments here since I first discovered WSB. I absolutely love you guys. The adderall bits in particular are gold. Yes, I am at baseline as of writing this stuff (my baseline is high as a my risk tolerance). Apologies for the length and lack of formatting and emojis. This was really just supposed to be for me to point at later when people are all ""Why exactly are you doing this?"" on future posts. As Blaise Pascal said, I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.


----------------------------------------------------------


edit: **Okay, basic math time.** Yes I calculated this with what few crayons I had not eaten, so y'all can relax and let me do the reeeeing for you:

If you have $100 and you make 10% return, you then will have $110. If with that new amount ($110, you following?) and you make another 10% return, now you have $121. Now I know it seems like you should have $120, and some of you seem to think that in order to turn $100 into $121 that I would have to add $21 of my own money from somewhere else. But this is the magic of how % ROI woks and a little thing called *cumulative* returns.

Okay, gonna keep this in dollars for a moment, just so you guys can follow and I don't lose anyone (though it seems many of you stopped reading at ""Gwitch"" anyway, and those are probably the only people here who could follow this elaborate and complex algorithm).

Let's say you own $1,000 and you can make 35% returns each year, for 30 years. This would be calculated as $1,000 x 1.35^30. Type that into a calculator and you'll get over $8Million. Trust me, and trust your calculator. This isn't magic. It's investing.

Now, if you own 1000 share of a company, and you call sell call options on those shares for 35% of the value of said shares, then it *does not matter* what the share price is (as the price goes up, so does the value of that call option, as the price goes down... surely you get it by now). If you quickly reinvest that money into the *same shares* at the *same price* then you will have increased your holdings by 35%. On a yearly basis, assuming the stock value ends at or below your strike price by expiration, *and* assuming the IV remains high enough to do it again the following year, then you could just do it again once that all expires worthless. Only now you can do it with 1300 shares (1400, if you go ahead and just buy 50 more). At this rate, you would theoretically end up with 8 million shares at the end of 30 years.

If you can secure 5% more shares cumulatively on a *weekly* basis, without them ever getting called away from you, would own over 323 million shares within 5 years.

**tl;dr (for real real this time)** If the stock literally ends every week lower than the previous week, and ends every year lower than the previous year, forever (**and** assuming the volatility remains high *or* that I can make up the difference via infusions of cash externally)... Then I'm gonna own all of GameStop somewhere between 5 and 30 years from now. If the stock goes up consistently, especially if it goes up significantly, then it will be very difficult to accomplish this. Because math.

What is $ozon? 

Ozon.ru is pretty much Amazon copy cat, that was around for years . I grew up in Russia, and back in a day they were just an online bookstore 

They IPOed this year , they didn't get much buzz, but it caught  my eye after realizing how much they grew. 

They are unprofitable as of right now , but they invested heavily into building up delivery system infrastructure to speed up delivery process. 

Thing I remember about Russia , is their mail system freaking sucks. Its like USPS but 100x worse . Can you imagine, cold Russia , and your mailman is some old woman who just carries mail (literally no truck , just old woman ) , that walks from post office on her two feet rain/snow and covers decent size area ( Район in Russian  ). 

So obviously express delivery is out of the question, so ozon builded up infrastructure of carriers, pick up locations,  warehouses in major cities .... so now they can cover most of the Russia with 2 day delivery without relying on Russian mail service, which is one smart investment .

Thats another thing that nobody talks about, its a good covid recovery play , they sell plane and rail transit ticket through their app, which rail system is essential in Russia , its more developed then Amtrack (or however you spell that)

Another thing that caught my eye is institutional ownership for a brand new ipo without much buzz :

I don't look at Ozin as a short term quick buck play , but I do think this is going to become multi bagger in a long run.

I simply am clarifying definitions.

&#x200B;

To start - I have several hundred shares of AMC from before the whole blow up of GME + AMC. So call me a shill and I'll John Travolta meme at your comment.

Do I think AMC price will go up eventually? Yes, absolutely.

&#x200B;

If you think that 99.2% of AMC stock is held, you're wrong. Look at Disney. It's at 99.9%. Does that mean that only 0.1% of people are selling Disney? Is Disney gonna moon to $1000 all of a sudden? NO. You need to LEARN about what these values mean. Let's explain why none of what you're believing is true.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r00crx1w1oi61.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=050aff5674cc7c9aee852525003c54ee5d1e14c3

Look, I get it. Some of you are well versed in stocks and just freshly made a Reddit account. Some of you are new to the world of stocks in general. And some of you just can't fucking spell correctly in your titles. You heard the hype and joined in for the fun or possibility of profit. Well, educating yourself is the best thing you can do. The last thing you wish to become is sheep, following what others say without being able to understand if what they say is true or false.

&#x200B;

Let's begin:

The main example today - the bullshit 99.2% of **all** AMC shares being held.

Wow, do you fucking hear yourselves? Does that sound even remotely like it makes any sense? You truly believe that out of the entire world, 99.2% of all people that own AMC stock are simply holding it? For one moment, try to remember that Reddit is not the world. There are, as impossible as you might think, people that own AMC stock that are not part of this subreddit or any others. Think of all the automated algorithms that day trade vast quantities. All of them only amount to 0.8%?

""But I saw 99.2% on some screenshot of some website!""

You sure did. But did you know what that 99.2% was actually indicating? No, of course not. It's a far more blissful experience to see the number, hear some fuckwit tell you it's gonna moon **based on that**, and then you post 💎🙌 and scratch your head why it didn't happen a week later.

&#x200B;

Here's what it actually indicates: there's a 99.2% ratio of the **float shares** to the **outstanding shares**.

What does that mean? Well, like half the posts in [r/explainlikeimfive](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/), it's really fucking simple to Google. Here's an extremely dumbed down version:

&#x200B;

Outstanding Shares: all the shares of the company including **institutional** shares + **restricted** shares

Institutional Shares: shares that other companies hold in that stock.

Restricted Shares: shares potentially for employees. You as a retail investor don't have access to these.

Float Shares: all the shares minus the **restricted** shares. This is also called the **PUBLIC** float because it's the amount of shares that are available on any given day for the public to trade with.

&#x200B;

Sooo, using words instead of numbers for some quick algebra, what have we concluded?

Float / Outstanding shares simply means all of the AMC shares that are available to the public. 99.2% of all the shares (outstanding share) of AMC are available for the public to purchase (float share). This percentage is BASED ON some website's analysis and the actual numbers will of course be different depending of what website you look at because no one actually has the precise number.

&#x200B;

TLDR: The 99.2% of all amc shares being held statement is FALSE. I still believe amc shares will go up, but this number is not what you think it means."

O.K. I would like to declare Vuzix Corporation and thier Smart Glasses to those that have missed the boat until now. I have been waiting and watching the market cap for a snap shot to prove it's currently 1B plus when this is posted. THere is a lot more I could post, but it's too long as it is and I probably didn't do it right.

I declare 300 shares averaged in at7-8 or somewhere in there....you get the picture.

Also some April 18C's.

I sold one April 25C.

Why? Why would I be bearish like that with selling a call? I'm so....oh well. I'll probably eat that one once 25 is a way distant past.

I'll be selling and striking higher as we go. It's just my strategy and you can FTFFIFI. Vuzi has been a fun ride so far and I hope you all can make a good judgement on any strategy if any. This is me doing my thing and just DD sharing my outlook to see how wrong or right I am later. I'm complete bullish. I only sold that one call because a bear shits in the woods near me residence. I saw the sign and then smacked myself back in to reality. That wasn't no banana.

I'm not good with visuals, but I'm good with seeing the vision and future of this technology and the grip that Vuzix is showing thru their continual raving reviews from wear house to med house usage, educational usage, remote training, sports training, etc.. This is real live results. The real shit. Not speculation. Hands free and micro view and whatever high tech jazz they throw in there that I can't speak of. Me have no chippie, but only banana.

Is there competition? There is, but Vuzix has patents and proven model. The market itself is just now presenting itself back to the market. Every top search for augmented reality glasses will have Vuzix mentioned. They have stormed on to the scene since October really.

You say why would I invest in Vuzix if Google couldn't make it work with their augmented reality glasses? The answer is simple. They were a little ahead of themselves and now they are outpaced and outclassed. It's not those ugly things you didn't want to be caught wearing thing anymore. Covid changed the world and the type of augmented reality was coming anyways. Now it seems to have even more relevance and acceleration on the remote training aspect.

But if they didn't pass the mustard then, why would Vuzix pass the mustard now? Time has passed to get smaller chips and advance better visions, functions etc., Five G, Five G, and Five G. Micro chip advancements are a big help, and a company that knows why G Glasses wasn't a success seems to be proving itself on a regular basis.

Nobody wore those big ugly G glasses before, so why would they wear the VUZi glasses now? They have pretty good models for production forces and hands free work for sure. They are smaller and more productive than G's back in the short day ago. They don't look ugly, and the newer and upcoming models are going to blend in like regular shades. They already have pretty nice blending pairs now. Think of a smart phone thru your shades in the real near now.

With Five G. this has potential to expand to a very wide horizon of possibilities.

Imagine a doctor getting live vital readings on a critical patient from his desk, thru the eyes of the medic on the street. You think that won't save lives? Well this stock ain't for you then. This is already assisting in surgeries, and nursing care.

How does it effect everyday life and not just industries: I envision this taking to the next level with 5G and virtual shopping as you're walking down the streets of NEW YORK CITY. <<<<Let's get him. Any city that has a 5G net that we will all have. Sorry suburbanites, you may need to come to a town near you to get the real potential. I'm sure you can use them effectively staring in to the stars somehow too in the near future, so you might not be totally left out on the recreation side of these. These glasses will be the augmented directory as your walking down the streets. Need to know where to get those sour bumballs that you can never find anymore? Tearjerkers? Ya. Where the heck did you go? My pucker is worse that some the puckering I read on WSB. Only that gum can do it. Well I see the future where these glasses will show me where to go and how much they are without me having to look at my phone once. I can see purchases thru taps on glasses as well. Talk about premium contactless purchases and true window shopping. Step up to the shop window and get an augmented view of the contents. Go in if you want, order to have delivered if you don't want. We all know those drones will be following you home soon too. Might as well be bringing my goodies with it.

Oh yeah. Bullish drone stocks too.

Recently I have felt some confirmation in my early entry to this stock. I know I don't have a ton in it, but I started with little only a few months ago. I'm going to keep investing and call striking and rolling into stocks on every win. This one has been a win the whole way in my portfolio. With I had a real YOLO on it, but i'm not done buying. either.

Cathie on that boat thingie just bought 290K Shares as well. She beat my DD, but that damn WSB rule is to blame.

The stock is at it's all time highs and it's only rating has it pegged at 30. This is the only initiation/rating I have seen to date. All announcements are usually agreements, sales, advances in industries etc., Take what you will. THis is not my estimate, but I can't disagree for the short term. I see a big buyout of some sort if it doesn't rocket all the way thru 2025+. I like the stock. I am not a professional.

The speed is just now picking up in the augmented reality market. Vuzix is the leader in fashion, performance, and patent backed.

It's current Market cap of 1B is currently 1/100th of the TAM we will see in the next 5-6 years. Vuzi won't get it all, but a buyout from a big wig may be the only way they don't take most of it at this pace.

TLDR: Vuzix (Viewzix}. VUZI ticker is going to be a huge factor in every day life once the 5G net is thrown all over the cities. Already assisting in Education, Remote Training, Surgery assist, Sport assist training and more.... The augmented reality is leaps and bounds what is was when the G company failed with G glasses. Now is the time and Vuzix is leading the pack to mordernize the look and performence. Bullish to the moon. Do some research or read my amateur notes."

COVID has turned this company into a major player in Asia.

The company's three operating segments are:

Garena: Sea's video platform is a place to distribute both internally developed games and third-party titles.

Shopee: The largest e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia. Shopee was Indonesia’s largest e-commerce platform, with 310 million orders in the third quarter. Shopee ranked No. 1 in the stopping category in the country for average monthly active users, downloads and total time spent. Shopee had a daily average of 3.4 million orders in the third quarter.

SeaMoney: A digital payment solution to purchase stuff both on and off Shopee's platform
They recently acquired Bank BKE in December (and acquired a digital banking license) and will incorporate the banking nature across their entire platform, focusing and expanding on the digital banking and supplementing the ecommerce aspects.

Now let's talk financials you dumb wendy's slinging 🐱:

**Income Statement**
$SE has doubled down in S&M expenses to expand and handle the massive growth they've seen in FY2020. Growing the category by 95% and 87%(YoY) in the past two quarters and I expect to see an increase in Q4 as well to accommodate the rocket increase in revenue.
As mentioned COVID has caused revenue to dramatically increase +100% in Q2 & Q3 2020 (YoY) and this will continue. Q4 2019 showed massive growth without COVID and with it still being a factor revenue will continue to climb well past their their record Q3 2020 1.22B.

**Balance Sheet:**
This company is flushed with cash, 3B 💰 . Their debt is incredibly attractive as its mostly convertibles. If you don't get it google it Bitch!

**Stocks:**
$SE has broken through their main resistance lines of 237 and 276 this month and are currently in a wedge while the market tries to determine where the stock will head. This is the perfect opportunity to get in before it races up (or down ). I fully expect the major analysts to upgrade their price targets to ~300, like JP has done. Also their CEO (Forrest Li) holds large portion of the stock, which is always a great sign in a company. And did I mention Tencent holds 22% and is a gaming partner. They also ended on a LARGE green candle 🕯. They will run it on Monday. 

Summary
Their earnings report will be on 3/2 with analysts expecting a very positive outlook on Q4/FY2020 report. It's currently flagged as overvalued but so was Tesla and Amazon when they were at this price. $SE is considered the Amazon of southeast asia due to their expansion in ecommerce, fintech, and gaming. The big next step is - can they get EBITDA positive? They've already turned around their operating cash flow so...

**TLDR:** $SE is in a wedge touching resistance lines of ~282. If broken there is a lot of green space to run up past 300. Depending on the earnings call it could 🚀🤑💹 .I'm a massive bull on this stock so I'm in:

C: 282.5 

285/290 (if you want full retard).

[shitty logo ](https://preview.redd.it/vxkuuscdegi61.png?width=200&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2b36d7a588e2afcaf8db7f115d25b24c8de91b8)

Name aside, this company does one thing well, it consistently makes MONEY. Flowers has beaten estimates on their last eight earnings to the tune of 15-24%

This isn’t a pump and dump that you’re going to make 60% in a week. But a 20% share price gain can still take you to tendy town with the right call options and a good batch of shares. The last week of crabbing share price has dropped the IV since the last earnings price spikes, making it a perfect opportunity to pick up some calls pre-Q3 fiscal results in April.

# 🚀   🚀   🚀  The Bull Case   🚀   🚀   🚀

It’s no secret that the only reason this stock is trading sub $40 is that their growth hasn’t been drop dead sexy. It’s been consistently seasonal, but it hasn’t really blown the roof off the fucker… until fiscal Q2. Industry analysts always expect Flowers to have a strong Q2 (September - December is their growth months); however, they never expected the company to post $1.72 EPS 🚀   🚀   🚀 🚀   🚀   🚀 🚀   🚀   🚀 . Flowers not only made more money overall, but they also managed to lower management costs and improve e-commerce growth (up 59.7% YOY). On some level, a portion of this could be due in part to COVID-19 driving consumers online. Local traditional florists were small businesses that have been shuttered by cancellations of large-scale events and local business restrictions. Many will not re-open, or can not compete with the FLWS model. The real question is will the average consumer return to purchasing at their local florist if they’re even open anymore, or just become a  customer. 🚀 🚀 🚀

Just before the earnings bomb was dropped the share price rose to a 52 week high, \~$37 on hype alone. Paper hands lit up and it dumped down to $28. The bull case would see the stock climb back to 40 over the next 2-3 months, and perhaps even touching $45 before Fiscal Q3 earnings are due in April, 2021. Wall Street expects a net loss of 9c/share. If Flowers can beat this and go positive, it would mark the first time the company made a profit per share in Q3. I would imagine this would signal a shift in the companies growth, and lead the stock to some sort of breakout. If their newest acquisitions can drive earnings in the off-season (Q1, Q3 and Q4) then expect a huge upside.

Further, Flowers has made some power purchases over the last two years to expand its eCommerce reach. Their most recent acquisitions include:

1. **🍓**  *Berries.com (Shari’s Berrys – Purchased 08/19 for $20.5 million)*  **🍓**

a. This was a steal. Shari was about to start selling used panties online after her retail model resulted in multiple store closures. Flowers stepped in and scaled the business into a successful e-commerce business on berries.com. Now they’re dipping 9 million berries a year at \~$3.75/berry. I would imagine the margins are pretty big on these given how little a strawberry and some dipping chocolate costs.

2.  💰 *PersonalizationMall (Purchased 2/20 $252 million)* 💰

A big player in the personalized gift space. Ranks above Etsy on an organic google search (which is nuts), and is going to expose Flowers to a new sector for growth. What’s especially important about this acquisition is that the site drives business year-round. Flowers has a VERY cyclical earnings cycle subject to huge swings based on seasonal revenue (the lion share of the companies earnings comes Thanksgiving through Christmas). This site will drive revenue in the dry fiscal quarters for the company (Q1, Q3 & Q4) 🚀 🚀 🚀

3 . 🚀 *The gay bears are betting against us*🚀

The stock has historically been shorted. As of 1/29/21 data, the stock is 20% of float short, down significantly since earnings. I wouldn’t call it squeezable, but there are some strong bets against the stock, most of which are looking pretty dumb right now. It would take \~ 4 days for them to cover based on estimates. 🚀 🚀 🚀

4. 🚀 *The financials look good*🚀

https://preview.redd.it/uvjy8opeegi61.png?width=1295&format=png&auto=webp&s=01ada09b901fd6b270ff8100095b90d7e20f454d

30% asset growth in 2020, that's the exponential growth I'm getting on. Before that we were seeing sub 10% asset growth. If Flowers can keep this type of growth, I really like the stock even more. 🚀 🚀 🚀   🚀 🚀 🚀   🚀 🚀 🚀

## [🌈🐻](https://thisinterestsme.com/rainbow-bear-emoji/)The Bear Case  [🌈🐻](https://thisinterestsme.com/rainbow-bear-emoji/)

Look, Flowers is a seasonal business. EPS is over a dollar in Fiscal Q2, and is often negative, or barely positive, in the remaining months. The gay bears betting against this stock believe that it’s possible Flowers doesn’t go net positive for the rest of fiscal 2021. The question on everyone's mind, is the stock actually making a positive growth trend? Or was this just a fluke based on COVID-19 closures?

If the gay bear theories prove true, the stock could sink. Flowers doesn’t report positive news very often, only on acquisitions and fiscal Q2 earnings. The rest of the year is basically hype. A few shitty news cycles and this stock could have a VERY negative sentiment. If Flowers doesn’t blow away Fiscal Q3, I wouldn’t expect much movement above $30-35. Still pretty safe to hold shares against gay bears, but calls won't print.

Primer: The fed uses monetary policy to control the flow of money in the system. When they want to restrict money (lower inflation) they increase interest rates and increase banks reserve limits (saying banks must keep a certain amount of cash on hand so dont loan out as freely). 

In 08 the fix to the recession was to open the flood gates. We printed new money, lowered reserve requirements and lowered interest rates. 

We never recovered from it (interest rates were at 4-5% and are now at 2%.) The ideal would have been increased spending to increase inflation and over time interest rates would have risen. 

The problem here is in 2010 when lending started up again people were buying houses at depressed prices from their 08 inflated prices. They could exactly raise rates on the people buying the homes in 2010 because that would put them upside down on their homes (interest rate goes up home value goes down). 

Fast forward 2020 enter pandemic. Interest rates were already low and now the fed had to lower them more so banks could lend more to: people, companies, etc. That however wasn't good enough to move the needle they needed to basically create an artificial inflation (stemchecks) so the whole thing wouldn't seize up (think last Feb). So, the Fed saved us. 

Now, if they raise the interest rate there will be a broad market sell off, recent home buyers could be upside down on their loans and the economy isnt anywhere near ready to come roaring back. It would kill the economy. 

Rates HAVE TO GO UP (google Japan early 90s real estate). Yellen knows this Powell knows this. The only way to offset the market selloff then is with a UBI which will inadvertently dump back into stocks in earnings or investments. This is the catalyst for home prices to increase. 

Home prices will increase because a UBI will cause a rent seeking problem. Rent will go up and the price of housing will go up equal to the amount of rent. 

So when home values get to high banks lose their primary money making product and will revert back to equities (stocks) which will continue to push markets higher. 

Basically the market will continue to climb because if it falters at this point it will trigger a much larger collapse and the fed and treasury are no longer equipped to deal with a crash. Thus it is in everyone's best interest to keep the markets up. 

1) interest rates low
2) interest rates lower
3) cant increase interest rates without a crash
4) create artificial inflation via UBI
5) housing prices spike, interest rates begin to go up (propped by UBI)
6) people are priced out of buying homes, banks pour money into markets. 

Stocks only go up."

lme4i6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lme4i6/youre_unironically_retarded_if_youre_still_using/,You're unironically retarded if you're still using Robinhood,7020,878,2021-02-18 12:53:07,"Look, I get that some of you genuinely tried to transfer to another broker, but that legitimate gambling addiction that you have to the stonk market prevented you from closing out all your positions and letting your trades settle (even though if you did you probably wouldn't have lost 80% by FOMO'ing into weed).

But by staying in Robinhood, you scream ""Oh please daddy Vlad Tenev, please impale my asshole one more time like you did with Geee Emmm eeeEEEEE!!!"" 

# Why you should use a real broker and stop using Robinhood:

**Not being glued to a chart all day**

How many of you have your eyes glued to a fucking chart all day long because Robinhood is mobile and looks cool? This seriously is not helping any of your positions. You're more likely to dump what might be a solid play too early because you're staring at the ticker and have TP hands and panic when SPY is down 1% for the day. Think about all the times where if you held a position for a little while longer you would've printed. Robinhood looks amazing as an app and keeps your eyes glued to the screen. If the sell button is right in front of you at all times, you're gonna be more likely to dump when you shouldn't. Get a broker with a shitty looking UI so you aren't glued to a chart all day. Trust me, your relationships and work will thank you.

**Access to penny stocks**

Ever want to trade OTC penny stocks and make some real bank? It might be a good thing that some people don't have access to them given the inherent risk. But for some unknown reason, RH makes it easy to yolo your whole life savings into 0DTE so penny stocks are pretty safe compared to the options you can trade.

I wrote a DD on a penny stock on another subreddit and I got DMs about how to buy it on RH. Bruh please stop. Use a real broker.

**Actual customer support**

I haven't used Robinhood customer support for anything, but I've heard it's god awful. I'm gonna sound like a shill, but I've been using Schwab for the past six years and the customer support is amazing.

**Instant transfers**

Again, gonna sound like I work for Schwab or something (I wish). Schwab and many other big banks allow you to instant transfer from your checking/savings to your brokerage account with no limit. 

**Huge assets under management**

Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab have 6.6, 3.3, and 3.23 trillion AUM. That's a lot of focken money. These brokers had no issues with the clearinghouses and did not limit trading on meme stocks. Gee Em Eeeeee would probably be 2000 if everyone used them.

**Cool desktop/web apps**

Wanna look like a cool badass trader to pickup bitches at your local library? Schwab has a FREE trading platform with many cool features like the dark pool block trades. Add fancy crayons and lines to your charts too! Not gonna lie this app probably makes it harder to stop looking at stonks all day thus defeating point number 1.

**Cons of not using Robinhood**:

I'm not blind to the pros of Robinhood. 

\- Looks cool

\- Options are free (Schwab charges $0.65 per option contract)

\- Easy to use

&#x200B;

So please, do yourself a favor and use a real broker :)"

Updating my thoughts on PLTR from earlier this afternoon, but I just wanted to share an interesting case study from Facebook’s IPO back in 2012:

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/id/49824482

TLDR: FB and PLTR have many similarities in that they are cutting edge companies that disrupted the entire tech industry. The similarities are eerie: FB had a bearish lock-up period, just like PLTR.

Now, FB was off 40% from its IPO as the lockup approached (PLTR is up triple, but strangely ~40% off the highs), nevertheless, there is much skeptism with PLTR as there was with FB in 2012.

People wondered whether FB would be able to transition from PC to mobile... the Street questions if Palantir can secure a stable corporate client base. There’s worries about the lock-up expiration with PLTR, just like with FB in 2013 (see the link).

But here’s the whopper: I don’t believe this lock-up will be nearly as bad as “smart money” speculates. Sure, certain directors @PLTR might sell some, but why would they kill it all now? There’s too much potential.

Cathie Wood reaffirmed her support forholding this bad boy for 5 years by DOUBLING her stake yesterday. You’re a fool if you think Alex Karp and Peter Thiel are thinking much differently.

This negativity is overblown. Perhaps we see $25 on PLTR, but think: how much lower can we go? We are stuck at a $50B valuation right now, compared to $80B for boomer-based Snowfuck ($SNOW). 

A software that looks like COD (yes Call of Duty)-Gotham Foundry (bad ass name btw) that can prevent terrorist attacks and catch Osama Bin Laden??

A predictive AI that can help manage supply chains and forecast growth/risk? A tech wizard that helps oil companies strategize how best to transition to the renewables era?

Name me one damn company that does any of that, much less ALL of it and stores the data on a mega cloud for proprietary/client computing?

If you feel queasy or unsure, just ask yourself: who else does what PLTR does? A mega, all-seeing, AI mastermind that can solve problems across defense, technology, financials, and energy? 

Certainly ain’t POS C3.AI or Spermflake. By the way- those other names are wayyyy more *overvalued* than King Palantir.

So I’m personally doubling down and buying more shares/calls tomorrow. This is simply the greatest firesale engineered on a looming corporate giant in financial history, and we retail investors & enthusiasts are chumps if we sit this one out.

This isn’t a short squeeze or a big short or any other financial gimmick. This is just about markets recognizing talent, and as more retail investors (us strong 🦍) and institutions (who are currently 🌈🐻 on PLTR) get in, $PLTR will send it to the next dimension.

POSITIONS (very highly requested): https://imgur.com/gallery/pldEQsP

UPDATED (2/18): WOW! Mama Wood just bought 5.3 million more shares TODAY, adding it to her flagship ETF $ARKK for the first time. Feeling ballsy enough to say the lock up is over and to Mars we go. 🚀🚀🚀

———————————————

BUY BUY BUY

Reload, double down, do it all!

This is the firesale of a lifetime on the next Google/Facebook. On days like today, you BUY PLTR with a take-no-prisoners attitude. 

Considering Cathie Wood doubled her PLTR stake yesterday, I don’t feel too fucked in the head.

Reloading on shares and $40 calls, and if this corrects to $25, Wall Street will be asking me to do some pretty ridiculous DCAG trades.

Conclusion: PLTR 🚀🚀🚀🚀, hold forever!!"

2. Already profitable with a 5 P/S ratio, which is low for the streaming market

Using $Bili as a comparison, which is currently still unprofitable and has a 31 P/S

&#x200B;

It's true that Bili is currently growing at a faster rate than HUYA, 70% as compared to 50%, however, this difference is huge, and I believe that HUYA can reach at least 10x P/S considering it is still a growing company.

&#x200B;

3. Institutional Holdings

Ark, MS, and Rentech heavily added positions in HUYA last quarter. A quick google search tells you that Tencent has a 37.2% stake in HUYA. Excluding companies below JOYY Inc. because the reports are old, we would get a total of 112.15% institutional holding. 

This is a similar situation to gamestop, although I don't this should be a short squeeze play, I think that a squeeze is very possible under the right conditions.

&#x200B;

4. Potential merger with DOYU

If they do merge, DOYU would be a better play because the share exchange ratio would be HUYA\*0.73=What you get for each DOYU share, but DOYU is the riskier play in this situation if they don't merge because DOYU is consistently losing market share to HUYA in china.

Some quick DD on Chinese websites tell you that Chinese people tend to prefer HUYA

&#x200B;

Even if this merger doesn't go through I see this as a very good tech ""value"" play

7. Chinese stock craze

The Chinese stock market has been going harder than the US market recently. There are many Chinese stocks that are breaking out. Some examples include FUTU, TIGR, BILI, TME, YY.

I believe HUYA could be next but this is pure speculation.

*don't know why my screenshot doesn't show on reddit, so here's another link:*  https://imgur.com/2YvrkR0 

&#x200B;

Firstly, I want to thank everyone who commented constructively yesterday on [my initial AMC DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljz99b/amc_blockbuster_dd/). A lot of good input and questions. I thought it'd be best to try and summarize/address a lot of the concerns raised in a second DD, where I can get more into the details, in advance of the market opening tomorrow.

This sequel DD is split in Fundamentals and Mementals. A tl;dr is at the top of each section. At the bottom you'll find my thoughts on catalysts and forward momentum drivers. You don't have to agree, that's just how I see things. I'm not trying to convince anyone. My position is 15,000 shares at about $2.40 price. For those who wonder why I didn't sell at the squeeze: I bought the shares before the stock started mooning and had sold covered calls. It was too expensive to get out of them, so I was rolling them up. Unfortunately for me, the squeeze subsided before I could extract myself from the calls, so I'm still in, and at a substantial unrealized profit as well. **My horizon is up to the end of 2021 the latest, so I'm only assessing the potential for the share price to go up until then** \- I'm not in it for years. I'll probably sell some CSPs in the meantime and if it stabilizes higher by June or earlier I'll sell some CCs for income.

I'll preface this DD by saying that in 2020, and it looks like in 2021 as well, fundamentals don't mean much one way or another in my opinion. It's pure moment trading in the market from what I gather and everything is overvalued. Every-fucking-thing is overvalued, so saying that a company's fundamentals aren't that great means shit when you got stocks with $bn market caps which have never turned a profit, have no product and won't sell anything for years to come. Investors are looking for what's least overvalued, or what may benefit from momentum over the next few weeks/months and jump on it as soon as possible. Today 2/15 the markets were closed in N.America, but Europe was open and anything related to post-Covid normalcy skyrocketed. All leisure/travel stocks mooned even though noone is travelling yet. I do really expect something like this will be happening in the american stock market very soon, if not immediately, as well. People will try to position themselves for the post-covid times as sentiment shifts to positive. I expect big rotations out of tech stocks and likewise into leisure/travel/socializing and back-to-business stocks. I do think AMC is one of the beneficiaries, irrespective of fundamentals or not.

Finally, all my figures are taken from the company's own annual report unless stated otherwise.

&#x200B;

# Fundamentals:

**tl;dr = if AMC does not change strategy it will stagnate and it's share price will not move much. I think $5 is the bottom anyways so getting in at this price point is fairly low risk. Should the price drop more after buying in you can make up the difference with CCs over a few months. Should it stay where it's at, again, selling CCs is a nice way to make money. But don't sell CCs just yet, because when it rallies you'll be trapped. Wait until it's price stabilizes.**

Onto the details:

Let's get something out of the way really quickly. AMC reaching meme status did not do anything for its solvency. Nothing, nada, 0. AMC had managed to raised capital through debt and equity BEFORE it became a meme, so shut up with that bullshit and google the timelines. Their CEO had announced that bankruptcy is off the table way before the stock took off.

&#x200B;

July 2019: **$9.5** @ 104m shares outstanding by year end

&#x200B;

The above is some food for thought for those who say that AMC has diluted itself so much the price will stay forever low. As you see, the AMC share price has fluctuated wildly despite being diluted in the past, and despite revenues and profits not growing much. Therefore anyone who says this will go to $1 because of debt or dilution is talking out of their ass and is too ashamed to say they are a bear. The price has gone up and down despite being diluted and borrowing increasing, and it will go up and down again. The question is what will drive it either way.

&#x200B;

Shares dilution from 2020 onwards:

* Feb 21st 2020: 52.5m Class A and 51.7m Class B
* Jan 2021: 287m Class A and 51.8m Class B
* Jan 2021: 44.4m shares added due to convertible bonds sold as shares
* 2/15/21 estimated shares outstanding are: 287m+51.8m+44.4m = 383.2m (my estimate, could be wrong)

Note: there is a difference between shares outstanding and float. Float is what is available to buy in the market, which is of interest when you start thinking about short interest.

&#x200B;

According to the following sites:

* [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC)
* [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc)
* [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/key-statistics/)
* [https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC?mod=searchresults\_companyquotes](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC?mod=searchresults_companyquotes)
* [https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amc-stock](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amc-stock)

Float is between 56.1m to 115m depending on where you look.

Btw, they all quote shares outstanding as 287m, so maybe I'm double counting something?

&#x200B;

Short interest:

According to these sites the short interest ranges from:

* [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/)
* [https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AMC.htm](https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AMC.htm)
* [https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest)
* [https://docoh.com/news/benzinga/19561873/top-30-high-short-interest](https://docoh.com/news/benzinga/19561873/top-30-high-short-interest)

37.7m shares and some quote 79% of float. Clearly a lot of sites are calculating float as 56.1m.

If anyone has any official sources on short interest it'd be great to see. In any case, I'm not advocating that this will be short squeezed. That has nothing to do with my thesis. On 2/25 the Q4 ER is taking place so we'll have a definitive answer on shares outstanding.

**Tickets, sales, customers:**

2019 = 356m consumers

2019 = NYC, LA and Chicago represent 17% of USA total box office. AMC holds 39% market share there.

&#x200B;

[2019 annual report](https://preview.redd.it/mxpbc9wp0qh61.png?width=1664&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bcac6e37fa3fa23c30d671ac3a42c8ddb859237)

*The image I uploaded may not show up. Another link:*  https://imgur.com/WARXMTh 

It appears that there are y.o.y fluctuations on attendance. Adjusting the 2010 box office revenue for inflation ([https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/)) would result in 2019 sales of $12.5bn, when real sales were $11.4bn. Therefore, when adjusted for inflation the box office sales are not keeping up. However, it's worth noting that neither the ticket price nor the indoor screens have increased by inflation, and looking at the figures AMC is making more money per screen. I believe the reason why box office sales haven't kept up to inflation is because the strategy for theatres has been stale. I also want to believe that COVID has been a wake up call for the theatre industry to diversity and execute on more bold strategies, which combined with cost cutting measures should pay off going forward.

**Competition:**

2019 annual report = the 3 largest exhibitors are AMC, Regal (now bought out and turned private) and Cinemark, which account for 60% of box office revenues. Back in 2000 they accounted for 35% of revenues, so there is substantial consolidation happening.

Non-theatrical competition is of course the streaming services, cable tv, pay-per-view etc. In reality it's only streaming services as pay-per-view and cable tv is dead as a dodo.

Current (2021) peers are IMAX, Regal and Cinemark.

**Ops:**

2019 annual report: 1,004 theatres (636 in US) and 11,041 screens (8,094 in US). The rest are in Europe and Saudi Arabia. Market leader in USA and Europe.

26% of their revenue comes from int'l market. Europe is reopening fast and the UK GBP (biggest int'l market for AMC) is increasing in value, which in combo with a weak US dollar will bolster revenue figures.

A lot of people commented on AMC not making money and that it's doomed etc. Looking at their financials:

&#x200B;

[https://preview.redd.it/4am3oenr0qh61.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d128de7c97c295f2552e4ca95d068c43f42ed8e](https://preview.redd.it/4am3oenr0qh61.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d128de7c97c295f2552e4ca95d068c43f42ed8e)

*The original image uploaded doesn't seem to show up, so here's another link:*  https://imgur.com/Gx9Ded6 

It seems to me that the biggest bummers with regard to their operating income have been rent and Opex. Rent expenses went up purely due to accounting standards, but the end result is that it made their EBITDA look worse. Should accounting treatment rules had not changed their 2019 EBITDA would have been very close to 2018.

*Note: in one of my responses to a comment in my previous DD I erroneously suggested (that's what I thought) that the capex servicing and SG&A were what was dragging them down, but that seems to remain stable year on year - which are of course dragging them down, but are not what causes fluctuations in their yearly profitability.*

Now, we know that AMC has done a lot of work to keep rent costs down, and has done massive strides to reduce OPEX. Hence why I strongly think the profitability margins will improve going forward, all else remaining equal. Just look at the int'l markets where OPEX was the reverse (4.3% down y.o.y) and how it made all the difference in their bottom line. Add to that the fact they have gotten rid of a lot of underperforming screens. OPEX should go further down as everyone gets vaccinated and any additional spending on COVID sanitizing is no longer necessary.

**Capex:**

Between 2015-2019 AMC has built 37 new theatres with 310 new screens and bought out 700 theatres and 6,500 screens. They have doubled their capacity in 5 years. That's a lot of CAPEX spending, and obviously a lot of borrowing to deliver that.

Capital spending was $0.5bn in 2019, $0.6bn in 2018 and $0.6bn in 2017. This is resulting to about $300m cash outflows to serve that capex, per year from 2020 and onwards.

It appears that capital spending has stopped, so at least no more new servicing costs.

**Debt:**

2019 = $4.8bn

2020 (9/30): $5.82bn, but we know that in 2021 about $600m was converted to shares, so debt should be about $5.2bn currently. Again, if I've missed any bonds let me know.

**Comparables:**

Price to Book (ttm) and 5yr avrg:

AMC -0.26 / 1.16

MSGE 0.85 / 0.63

CNK 2.41 / 3.12

IMAX 3.34 / 3.54

AMC has the lowest valued share price amongst its competitors, therefore appears the cheapest across the peers. It also trades far lower compares to its 5yr average compared to its peers. Should the tide change it should see its price equalize to the others then there is a great upside. You may say that AMC has a lot of debt etc., well the rest are not in a much better position, with CNK being screwed with Regal for instance.

&#x200B;

# Mementals:

**tl;dr: A lot of positive catalysts await, and every single piece of news will boost the price. Aside a resurge of COVID there is nothing stopping people returning to the theatres, and a slew of blockbusters will be coming out soon to entice them. A change of strategy should also help add some growth to the revenue which will only boost prices further.**

If we were to ignore fundamentals, like the rest of the market does, then we need to look at AMCs potential for popping, squeezing or rallying. I'll start by saying I don't think a short squeeze is in the books. I just doubt it. There's a lot of confusion around its short interest and float. What I do know is that the float has increased a lot compared to early 2020, but it appears that short interest has increased as well. I don't think that shorts have covered to a large extent since mid-Jan and I can see - through checking the IBKR availability of shares to borrow - that shorts are hitting it every day. It's worth noting that its share price is now 100%+ higher than were it was when they were shorting it, so who knows, but I don't count on it.

What I'm thinking is catalysts that will push the price upwards. I do expect that people are just gagging to go back to the cinema. That's not going to change once things reopen. Things that I expect will make the price rally:

\- COVID vaccine roll-out proceeds well and movie studios decide to finally start releasing movies. That should happen once capacity restrictions are lifted at movie theatres. There will be a big marketing push around this in the news.

\- NYC and LA announcing the reopening of theatres at full capacity. This will happen and will happen soon. It will lift the price by a lot as those two are the price revenue makers for AMC.

\- Partnership with a major streaming service. Netflix, Amazon or Disney, or even bought up by a major movie studio. The synergies are insane and the worst case scenario for those giants' balance sheets is negligible. Streaming service subscription numbers are stagnating and streaming giants are forced to increase prices (hi Netflix) to make up for growth. Expanding through an acquisition of AMC makes sense to reach out and grow further. It'll be like Amazon buying up Walmart. Low chance but even chatter about it will push the price up fast.

\- Summer (and Xmas) are the prime seasons where studios release movies. This summer should be huge in terms of releases and times well with the reopening of theatres. This is guaranteed.

\- Wanda converted their shares and is no longer the controlling shareholder. This allows substantial more maneouvering ability to the executive team to do things differently.

\- COVID restrictions lifted sooner than expected. This will allow AMC to use the cash pile it has squirreled for a tough 2021 in repaying debt faster, reducing interest expenses and improving its net income. Any announcement around retiring debt will push the price up.

\- More strategic changes towards PVOD, eSPORTS, booking theatres to people through apps etc. to utilize all the spare seating capacity. Even at peak revenue AMC is only using 17% of its seats, so it's got a lot of idle capacity it can make money off with 0 additional costs. AMC should pivot to additional offerings on top of movie releases to capture more footfall in its screens. I do believe that COVID was a wake up call that will push them to more innovative ways of generating revenue.

\- As people return to theatres they will realize a lot of locals have shut down. There will be consolidation due to natural causes. Fewer screens but the same number of movie-goers. That's a benefit for AMC.

\- With sentiment improving around the economy reopening a lot of these stocks that were hit hard by Covid will get extreme tailwinds that will make them rally. Look at what happened when the Pfizer vaccine was announced with the massive rotation out of tech stocks. I expect similar moves, sooner rather than later. Biden is doing a decent job with vaccine roll out.

I believe that $5 is the new bottom of the share and I think we will be seeing a lot of weekly pops with small pullbacks, basically higher highs and higher lows, going forward. If you actively manage your position you may be able to exit at the high points and reenter at the pullbacks for additional profit.

&#x200B;

I don't see any negatives aside from COVID resurging for some reason. I do believe that the very worst is past for the theatre business.

&#x200B;

**Finally, let me address some common comments:**

\- I got Netflix, why would I go to the movies?

You've had netflix for years, yet you (and everyone else) still goes to the movies. The movies are not gonna die anytime soon. Worst case they won't grow and stagnate, but they are here for years to come.

&#x200B;

\- The studios will just offer their movies to streaming and not to theatres.

Absolute bullshit. Theatres are doing the opposite, pulling out catalogs from netflix. They are in a conundrum as they don't really know what to do. They don't want their movies streaming (because it's far, FAAAAAR less revenue for them) through 3rd parties but at the same time cannot create their own platforms to stream. The latter is just stupid. The CAPEX required to build your own platform is high, and the benefit is trivial since they can play movies in theatres and keep the majority of the ticket price. Besides, streaming movies only works for low budget films. Any blockbuster requires the cinematic experience. Very few people have top-model TVs at home with surround sound, and even if they do, 4K streamed over the internet results to sub-par quality. It just does not compare to the cinema quality. The only realistic alternative to cinema for home entertainment is having a top of the line tv+sound+bluray. But that's not streaming is it?

If streaming was to kill off theatres then VHS, DVD and Bluray would have done so before (Studios would have released straight to DVD, why didn't they?). It never happened and for good reason. People go to the movies because of a) The cinematic experience, b) they combine it with a night out, c) it's a way of socializing and much more. That won't go away. Btw, Disney, despite having a streaming platform decided to go ahead with theatrical releases of all its movies in 2021, and won't offer them on streaming at the same time. Get it now?

Another reason why that won't work = Look at Disney, they offered Mulan through their own platform, so what best example to examine. They did not offer it as part of the subscription, so forget about paying your monthly neftlix and having new movies for free. They instead priced it at about 2x movie tickets. Even if they are to continue that with their next releases it's not really that much more affordable compared to going to the movies, is it? So don't expect Universal or 20th Century offering you all their new movies for $10/month. Ain't gonna happen.

&#x200B;

\- Theatres have been open since August but noone is going

Noone is going not only because of COVID concerns, but there are no movies to see. You need studios to release their movies for people to return. I don't expect them to do so until restrictions are lifted and everyone can safely return to the theatres.

&#x200B;

\- So, what else besides James Bond is coming in 2021? why would I go to the cinema for just 1 movie.

You are an idiot. Here is a list of upcoming blockbuster releases: [https://qz.com/1948011/the-2021-movie-calendar-previews-hollywoods-new-normal/](https://qz.com/1948011/the-2021-movie-calendar-previews-hollywoods-new-normal/)

Look at summer time onwards, there is a hot movie almost every week. Most of the movies in the first half will likely be released in the second half after all, making it a bonanza of new films coming out in summer onwards.

&#x200B;

\- Theatres are dead in the long term, aren't they?

We are all dead in the long term. I don't care. Let's focus in the next six months ok? My investment horizon for AMC is up to the end of 2021 the latest. In a best case scenario I expect the recovery to be fully priced in by summer time when I will exit or just start selling CCs again. I may exit/renter several times to what I think may be short-term peaks and troughs. I'm not Buffett so I'm not buying for life. I'm in this for the rally to normalcy.

&#x200B;

\###I may edit this post at the bottom to address any recurring comments.

\###I'm also planning on buying some calls if IV goes down a bit

\###I won't be doing another AMC DD for a few days at least, maybe after 2/25 when ER happens.

Lots of words below, so here’s the TL;DRs, Table of Contents, a self dox, and position disclosure before my DD.

**TL;DR #1**: After watching Demo Day twice, I am blown away at how much Palantir’s products have matured in the last 6 years since I left Palantir. I find the new UX far superior to offerings from GOOG, MSFT, and CRM. Apollo is absolutely incredible, and it’s going where no clouds have gone before… from Humvees to nuclear submarines. Lastly, it is clear to me that PLTR has invested heavily in best-of-class administrative tools to improve the speed to deploy Palantir. Bottom line: I fully understand why IBM gave up fighting Palantir and is now selling Palantir Foundry to IBM clients.

PLTR when I left in 2015 versus the Palantir I saw on Demo Day:

[You've come a long way baby.](https://preview.redd.it/fuvi00aejph61.jpg?width=1182&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d993cff432e6b8f49b6728ac4d180cbbb2979080)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #2:** IBM just surrendered to PLTR. In the words of POTUS, this is a…

# Big.

# Fucking.

# Deal.

To put it politely, IBM and Palantir don’t have a very good past relationship. So the fact that IBM is now pushing Foundry means one thing: Foundry is so unfuckwithable that IBM was losing numerous contracts to Foundry-wielding competitors and IBM had no choice but to swallow their pride and cut a deal with Papa Karp.

* First they ignore you.
* Then they laugh at you.
* Then they fight you.
* Then they surrender to you and sign a deal to slang Foundry to thousands of clients in 180 countries.
* Then they send your shareholders tendies for decades.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #3:** Regardless of how ‘good’ or ‘bad’ the 2020 earnings are tomorrow, I find the news from early 2021 to be an incredibly strong signal pointing to an eventual $250B+ market cap for Palantir – BP renewing their enterprise deal, Rio Tinto and PG&E signing a new enterprise deals, AT&T aggressively hiring for Palantir skills, and 2,500 IBMers now pushing Foundry to clients all over the world, etc. IE the tea leaves I'm reading point to strong growth in 2021 and beyond.

It's also worth mentioning that many of the new commercial clients have some of the most difficult and complex supply chains in the world.

If they’re in, I’m in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #4**: Eventually, institutional traders will comprehend the immense long-term value of ~~Planeteer~~ ~~Planter~~ Palantir and the stock will join the PFAANG club (though I vote that we rename it the FAAPNG club).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Because there are so many shills, pumpers, and bullshiters on WSB these days, I’ll self dox myself. I’m Jason Payne. I joined Palantir in early 2007, when it was a few dozen geeks with big dreams, and left in 2015 to become the CEO of [Ada Diamonds](https://www.adadiamonds.com/) (hence my username).

I joined Reddit to do an official [AMA on laboratory-grown diamonds](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8pb8d5/i_grow_diamonds_i_make_custom_jewelry_with_these/) a few years ago that hit the front page, stuck around, and have absolutely fallen in love with the Reddit community. Thus, I want to give back to my fellow Redditors with a bunch of words and a few pictures to explain Palantir from the perspective of a former employee.

You may think that I’m a Palantir sock puppet given how my bullish I am in this DD. I’m not. Turns out I have a DD-writing fetish. Don’t kink shame. [Here’s a couple of my prior DDs](https://medium.com/@Jason_Payne) on De Beers, Tiffany & Co., and the FTC.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Positions or ban:** At the current PLTR share price, I hold a Keyser Söze position - I could sell out this week and simply walk off into the sunset. But I’m not going to. I have yet to sell all of my unlocked 20%, and I plan to mostly diamond hands my soon-to-be-unlocked 80%, with a decade long diversification plan to exit my concentrated stock position, regardless of earnings tomorrow.

Why? I like the stock, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#1) Praise & Constructive Criticism for Demo Day**

Existentially, Demo Day was incredibly impressive. This thread with u/namingisreallyhard, u/DentalFox, and u/jamauer sums it up:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d0p7dwzijph61.jpg?width=526&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9caa7b51ca8f7c2315988eda62f4afa7f30f7b07

Four things stood out to me:

**Superior Design Language to CRM, MSFT, and GOOG:** Palantir has a completely different front-end user experience (UX) than my time at Palantir, that I saw for the first time on Demo Day. I find it practical, beautiful, and efficient.

The design language is called Blueprint Javascript, and it’s built on React, a modern web development platform that Facebook built. Big ups to Palantir for open sourcing BlueprintJS, meaning that anyone can use it: [https://blueprintjs.com/](https://blueprintjs.com/)

Blueprint is a UI toolkit for web development of complex data-dense interfaces for desktop applications. Compared to the cartoonish UX of Salesforce’s Lightning, the flat UX of Google, and the rigid UX of Microsoft Office, I would much prefer to work in Blueprint all day.

I struggle with how spread out Lightning is by default and really appreciated how dense the Blueprint inerfaces are without feeling crowded. Getting that balance right is really difficult.

**Deep Investment in Deployability**: Administrative tools are the unloved stepchild of enterprise software. No-one buys the backend system, so minimal investments are typically made to build the backend tools to run the software.

Salesforce still hasn’t ported their admin tools from their clunky Web 1.0 Salesforce Classic to their more modern Lightning design system. Google’s back end admin tools suck compared to their client facing tools - Gmail, Calendar, AdWords, etc.

The admin tools that Palantir demoed appeared far better than what I use every day to run my Salesforce instance. I bet I could do most tasks in Foundry 40-75% faster than Salesforce.

**Migration from ‘*****Find the Terrorist*****’ to '*****Cheat Code for War*****':** When I was at Palantir, the primary use case for Gotham was link analysis to find the bad guy. Gotham has clearly evolved from that mission to a far broader set of missions.

Another Redditor described Gotham as ‘cheat code for war,’ and I think that is spot on. That’s why Palantir has won so many different logistics, mission planning, command and control, etc. military contracts recently, including the Space Force

**DoD IL-6 SaaS Approval:** Palantir moving to IL-6 approval could be an entire massive DD on its own, but I’ll keep it short. It’s a big fucking deal to get Apollo running on classified networks, and Palantir is far ahead of the other big SaaS players in this approval:

https://preview.redd.it/hl1j7wwkjph61.jpg?width=1314&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4dc190a30dc75e8d66bcd6c8ab74cb42472137d

Now that I have fanboied on Demo Day I want to be critical of the presentation style of Demo Day. I’d give the presenters a C+ at best. I found it rushed, confusing, and difficult to follow. I had to watch it twice to fully absorb the content, and I’ve given 500+ Palantir demos in my lifetime! My constructive criticism:

* Slow down 15-20%
* Err on the side of a simpler, more approachable lexicon
* For the love of God, stop reading from scripts. Use bullet points
* Handoffs were way to abrupt. Take a deep breath between presenters for us to get prepared for a new topic
* Get better microphones and Snowsound panels for future presentations
* Get a professional public speaking coach involved in rehearsals

I’m not alone in my take on Demo Day. Here are a few unprompted DMs I got from random Redditors on the presentation:

>*· I don't know if it is just me, but I genuinely felt like I was watching a haphazard presentation that didn't really do justice nor capture attention in a lucrative way*  
>  
>*· It lacked charisma and charm, and it felt cobbled together like a group project by university students*  
>  
>*· I was watching the demo day presentation, and left feeling underwhelmed. It may have been impressive to someone who is in the industry, but from someone outside of it, it all sounded greek to me.*  
>  
>*· I felt like the Gotham team was clearly the A team and Foundry needs better presentation skills.*

I know my last PLTR DD made the rounds at Palantir, so here’s a direct message to those behind Demo Day - if everyone told you that you ‘*killed it*,’ you \*really\* need to find someone in the organization willing to speak truth to power.

\_\_\_\_\_

**#2) Why Palantir is a Diamond Fisted Iron Man Suit**

One of the Demo Day presenters made an interesting comment that stuck with me: At Palantir, we build Iron Man suits, not robots.

No, Palantir does not have a skunk works program building flying mech suits (AFAIK).

Palantir builds *cerebral* cyborgs, not *physical* cyborgs. Palantir’s products create a symbiotic relationship between human beings and computers to better solve *cerebral* tasks, not *physical* tasks.

&#x200B;

[Iron Man. Cerebral Edition.](https://preview.redd.it/77xps5ipjph61.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb3acbee813e27ca69f7b94c9158fba44c6e142a)

If you have not watched Demo Day yet (or you rewatch it), listen for how many times they say the words ‘decision’ and ‘decision makers.’

Why a **diamond fisted** Iron Man suit? Palantir just closed an enterprise deal with Rio Tinto, who is the 3rd largest diamond producer in the world. So Rio Tinto will be using their PLTR-powered Iron Man suits to dig for fistfuls of diamonds on multiple continents.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**#3) The True ROI of Palantir**

Palantir is really expensive. No question about it.

But you know what’s more expensive than Palantir? Bad Decisions. Being wrong is really, really expensive. See the Airbus 380, Microsoft’s market share of cell phones, the Golden State Warriors drafting Todd Fuller over Kobe Bryant, shorting GME in early January, and BMW/Mercedes/Lexus’s dismissal of TSLA.

The true ROI of Palantir is substantially better decision making across your organization. Even a moderate improvement in decision making creates deep fucking value for an organization.

For example, Airbus claims that Foundry helped them improved the speed of A350 production by 33%. There are 5 million discrete parts in an A350, and the Foundry-powered decisions led to a 33% improvement in production. Palantir doesn’t make that claim. Airbus makes that claim. That’s absolutely bonkers and that’s why this is no surprise:

The BP renewal and the new deals (PG&E, Rio Tinto, Fiat, etc) prove u/petroduct is right. If you have complex logistics, you should have Foundry.

Say that Palantir improves the quality of decisions made at United Airlines by 6.9%. How much will the UAL stock appreciate over the next decade? If Palantir helps Rio Tinto improve decision making by 4.20%, how much will their bottom line grow by 2025?

Below are a few excerpts from United's Director of Technical Operations on how they use Foundry. This is just scratching the surface of how an airline can use Palantir to improve operations; however, if each of these models/decisions are incrementally improved, even a little bit, the value to United is fucking deep.

The entire blog post is a great read if you want to go deeper on Foundry: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/)

**#4) Muthafuckin’ Clouds in Nuclear Submarines**

Toward the end of the Apollo demo, one of the presenters offhandedly mentioned something that caused my jaw to hit the floor: Palantir will be deploying Apollo on US Navy submarines.

IL-6. Clouds. In. Nuclear. Submarines.

As someone who has installed and managed Palantir servers in server rooms all over the world, I can’t state how huge it is that the US Navy is approving the Apollo modular cloud architecture to be deployed on some of their most sensitive and expensive assets.

The fact that upgrades to the entire fleet can be managed like upgrading an AWS server?

\_\_\_\_\_

**#5) Does it Matter that Palantir Needs FDEs at Deployments?**

One of the favorite arguments of the Palantir bears is that Palantir is an unscalable, overvalued services company that should have the same P/E as Accenture, Booz, BAE, etc. The bears say that Palantir only has a handful of clients and can’t scale. In my mind, the quality of the admin tools show on Demo Day and the IBM partnership announcement eviscerated that argument.

When I was at Palantir, it was a bitch to build and manage deployments. From what I saw on Demo Day, Palantir is now easier than Salesforce to deploy. I say that as someone who has written tens of thousands of lines of code for Salesforce (Lightning, Apex, SOQL and Visualforce).

Eventually, Palantir will have the same ecosphere of 3rd party developers that deploy and manage instances of SAP, Salesforce, Microsoft, etc. but that will take years to fully mature that ecosphere. Eventually, Palantir will have robust certifications for various skills and tasks to manage Palantir deployments.

But in the meantime, Palantir's Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) will continue to directly manage deployments. Given how much progress Palantir has made on the tools to improve the efficiency of the FDEs, I no longer worry about the scalability of that team.

Say that three utility companies all buy Palantir – PG&E, ConEd, and Entergy.  Palantir invests 4 years worth of FDE time in PG&E, 1 year in ConEd, and none in Entergy.

* PG&E improves decision making by 10% and does a massive enterprise deal with Palantir to deploy to every part of the organization.
* ConEd improves decision making by 2% and does a moderate renewal for a few specific teams.
* Entergy bungles their deployment and actually makes worse decision as a result. They do not renew.

Assuming \~$500k/year all in is the cost for a good FDE at Palantir, we're talking about small up front investments that return bigly for PLTR in the long run as those deployments are extended like the BP deal.

To put it another way, when you think about Palantir deployments in months or years, the FDE overhead is spooky. But when you think about those deployments converting into decade long *operating system for XXXXXX* deals, the FDE overhead is not significant.

Also, to be honest, there are very few people with TS/SCI security clearances that even know what React is, much less how to write code against it, so in some of the more sensitive use cases for Palantir, I think that FDEs will be the way for a long time.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#6) Should you YOLO on PLTR?**

I’m not going to give anyone financial advice, but I do want to point out a few things:

PLTR is not a meme stock. Palantir is not a small-cap that can move bigly because, a bunch of furry quadrupeds gathering on internet messaging boards collectively decide that we like the stock.

Palantir is a bunch of wickedly smart people building Iron Man suits for the largest, most important organizations in the world.

Many of the larger institutional investors still don’t truly comprehend Palantir and the medium term public valuation may not properly reflect the present and future value created by Palantir. I have no idea when the analysts will finally get the value of PLTR.

A lot of historically successful investors think PLTR is extremely overvalued. They may be right.

A lot of historically successful investors have massive positions long PLTR. CathThey may be right.

So my crystal ball says PLTR may go up, down, or sideways for longer than you can stay solvent or interested in Karp memes.

Regardless of the ticker, if you YOLO, please YOLO responsibly my friends, and for the love of god take some off the table if/when you’re fortunate enough to have green dildoes in your accounts– whether your gains are from PLTR or any other stock you happen to like, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#7) My Appreciation for the Palantir Team**

I do want to take a moment and say to anyone who has been a part of building Palantir over the last few decades: what you have built is incredible. Thank you. As an American, thank you. As a stockholder, thank you.

Enjoy your tendies, you’ve earned them my friends.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#8) How I Play My Lockup**

Regardless of how the markets view the earnings report tomorrow, I’m largely HODLing my remaining Palantir shares, as I think Palantir is in a class of it’s own, lapping the competition like SpaceX and Tesla.

I do have a professional advisor and we have prepared tax-optimized divestment strategies for a number of scenarios, but none of those scenarios involve paper handing out of my remaining position, regardless of a good, bad, or ugly response to the 2020 earnings report tomorrow.

Why would I sell now if I believe that FAANG-like is growth coming over the next 10 years? Why would I sell when I think Palantir in 2021 is like Mercedes F1 in 2014 about to go on a worldwide domination over the next few years? Also, with the shares finally unlocked, I can borrow against them for the first time.

I've already responsibly taken enough off the table pre-IPO, so I’m not in any rush to sell. My first substantial limit order will be at a market cap of \~$100B with a ladder up to \~$250B. So I’m skeptical that I’ll sell any more than 5% of my remaining shares this week.

That’s my $0.02 on Demo Day and some of the recent news.

So long, and thanks for all the tendies. See ya at the restaurant at the end of the universe PLTR gang!

A tribute to George Carlin's thoughts on germs (stonks) in America.

&#x200B;

They can fuck with you anytime they want. As long as you put up with it which means of course anytime they want because that's what Americans do now. They're always willing to trade away a little of their freedom in exchange for the feeling--the *illusion* of security. What we have now is a completely neurotic population obsessed with security and safety and crime and drugs and cleanliness and hygiene and stonks.

There's another thing: stonks.

&#x200B;

Where did this sudden fear of stonks comes from in this country? Have you noticed this? The media constantly running stories about all the latest stonks. Tesla, Hertz, AMC, Gamestop. And Americans they panic easily so now everybody is running around buying this and selling that and cutting their gains short and repeatedly listening to the news to avoid all contact with stonks.

It's ridiculous and it goes to ridiculous lengths. In prisons before they give you a lethal injection they ask if you want to sell your GME. That's true.

Well they don't want you to lose any more money. And you can see their point. Wouldn't want some guy to go to hell and be poor. Would take a lot of the sportsmanship out of the whole execution.

Fear of stonks...why these fucking pussies. You can't even find a decent YOLO anymore. They FUD the shit out of everything now and everybody's afraid of losing.

Hey where's your sense of adventure? Take a fucking chance will you? You know how many people lose all their tendies every year? 9,000 that's all. It's a minor risk! Take a fucking chance bunch of goddamn pussies.

Besides what do you think you have diamond hands for? They're for holding stonks! But they need practice. They need stonks to practice on.

So listen, if you ignore all the stonks around you and live a completely sterile life then when the FUD comes after whatever you're holding you won't be prepared. And never mind ordinary FUD. What are you going to do when some super virus FUD comes along that turns your portfolio into liquid shit? I'll tell you what you're going to do--you're going to panic and you're going to sell at a loss. And you're going to deserve it because you're fucking weak and you’ve got fucking weak paper hands.

Alright, let me tell you a true story about the stock market okay. When I was a little boy in New York City we gambled everything we had on pennystocks that were going bankrupt. Okay? We spun the roulette wheel and put it all on 21, you know just because? And at that time the big fear was a market crash. Thousands of kids lost their tendies to market crashes. But you know something? In my neighborhood no one ever lost anything to a market crash. NO ONE! EVER! You know why? because we YOLOED ON PENNYSTOCKS. It strengthened our diamond hands; the market never had a prayer! We were tempered in raw FUD!

So, personally I never take any special precautions against stonks.

I don't shy away from people who spread fear and uncertainty.

I don't listen to anything on TV.

I don't listen to friends or family.

I don't take advice from billionaries.

And if one of my stonks drops 50% I double down and buy more of it. Even if the company is just a sidewalk cafe in *Calcutta*. The *poor* section. On New Year's morning during a soccer riot.

And you know something? In spite of all that so-called risky behavior...I never have losses.

I don't get them.

I don't get paper-hands.

I don't get FOMO.

I don't get stressed.

I don't buy into FUD.

You know why? Because I got good strong diamond hands and they get a lot of practice.

My diamond hands are equipped with SEC company updates, google trend indicators, and HQ sentiment analysis. And we have recently acquired positive EMA, daily supertrend, VWAP, and MACD. So when my BUY buttons are on patrol reconnoitering the market seeking out bankrupt companies and other undesirables...if they see any, ANY suspicious-looking stonks of any kind they don't fuck around. They whip out the DD, they buy the motherfucker, and deposit the unlucky stonk directly into my portfolio. Into my portfolio. There's no nonsense. There's no Miranda warning. There's none of that three strikes and you're out bullshit. First offense BAM into the portfolio ya go.

Oh and speaking of my portfolio I want you to know I don't automatically downsize a stock once its taking up a large % of my portfolio. Okay? Can you deal with that? Sometimes I do. Sometimes I don't. You know when sell my stonks? When I have to buy other stonks! That's the only time. And you know how often that happens? Tops TOPS...two maybe three times a week TOPS. Maybe a little more frequently before the holidays you know what I mean?

And I'll tell you something else my paper-handed friends. You don't always need to trade every day. Did you know that? It's overkill. Unless you work at a firm, or have 10 monitors at your disposal, or for some reason come in intimate contact with huge amounts of FUD and FOMO every day... you don't always need to trade.

I appreciate it thank you.

Market cap is smallish roughly 40bil.

Means even if they double they are still tiny compared to Tesla! Even if the 10x they are half the size of Tesla. This means room to grow 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Everyone knows “Ford” there’s rumors a merger with Tesla but I don’t think it would ever happen the brand “Ford” is like Disney to famous be acquired but it’s a possibility because Ford has the factories and can pump out tons of cars FAST something Tesla struggles with.

They are doubling down on EV now! Mache-e has the WOW factor which = free advertising for them via social media. Beats out Tesla in almost all the reviews. Seriously go google Mache-e.

The new Branco also has the wow factor! Legacy company and brands which = consumer loyalty. Has factories in place already ready to ramp up EV FAST!🚀🚀🚀🚀

F-150 going electric in a few years this is THE truck there really isn’t any other truck out there because Ford is undeniably the best truck maker in the world.

Vehicles cheaper because of EV government credits which Tesla doesn’t get anymore.🚀🚀🚀🚀

New CEO! Who reshaping and got the business back on track! Auto sales are up significantly and they closed under performing regions.

""Yup, Ford has all that, plus:

* A 500 billion dollar investment and partial ownership of Rivian, a member of the Ford family on Rivian's board of trustees, and a partnership with Rivian to be able to use Rivian's skateboard (R1T, R1S) platform.
* 1 billion dollars investment and majority ownership in Argo AI which received a multi billion dollar investment from VW early last year. Argo AI is the team putting together Ford's autonomous vehicle. They must have been doing something right for VW to invest billions in them.
* Partnership with VW that allows Ford to use VW's MEB platform (ID3, ID4).
* 7.6% stake in Velodyne, a LIDAR company. How many autonomous vehicles do you see without LIDAR? No, not even the Tesla's with the ""full self driving beta"" are fully autonomous.
* Owns SPIN, the scooter company.
* Massive ICE F-150 profits instead of Tesla shareholders and tax credits to fund their EV and autonomous plans.

CNBC has it wrong - this didn't start with WSB. People are losing faith in the dollar and wanna hold fucking metal.

You don't think there's a shortage? Go try to buy a 1,000 ounce bar of silver. Google it. If you happen to find a dealer who isn't out of stock, you'll be paying an insane premium over the spot price.

I'm not gonna get into all the silver manipulation conspiracies. Let's stick to Retard Economics 101: if there's a shortage of the good it means the price is too damn low.

Because of the differential between the physical spot price of silver, and the futures price in the COMEX there's an arbitrage: Anybody with any serious cash today could take silver delivery from the COMEX at $27, and quickly flip it for well over $30. Futures deliveries last year were already at a record:

But the amount of folks standing for March delivery might just break the bank... because there's just not enough Silver to deliver to everyone who wants it. That's why (as another WSB post already detailed) The SLV ETF amended their prospectus to basically say [we can't actually get the silver that we need.](https://twitter.com/BullionStar/status/1360703958029905921)

If silver futures start creeping up, this thing could completely snowball. Because those industrial consumers of silver - Tesla, Apple, Medical stuff - absolutely cannot afford to have their production lines shut down for a month because of one input, and will pay anything to make sure they get those 1k bars in hand.

How to make tendies? Look what happened to AG and SILJ a few weeks ago when Silver went up 9%. Those two tickers FLEW. Buy calls on them for July if you're responsible, April if you're a degenerate gambler.

How to do your part and make sure the squeeze happens? Buy PSLV. That fund is going to actually take delivery of 1,000 ounce bars on your behalf.

Positions: $PSLV shares, $AG July calls, strike 20,  $SILJ August calls strike 25.

DON'T BUY $SLV

EDIT: I received a message from a smart dude suggesting that this news actually means that $SLV is vulnerable, and buying it is also a direct way to create tightness in the silver market. Could be. Don't know. Good luck out there. "

On the other hand, AMD replied with the acquisition of XLNX which seems wouldn\`t be such an issue considering AMD is way smaller than NVDA or INTC.
3. AMD and QCOM are actively lobbying US gov to address the issue, which they will. What to expect? Quite likely to remove previous trade policies regarding chips - resulting in easier access and higher/cheaper volume of chips being produced overseas. Which would mean AMD can ramp up production and meet the huge current demand of data centers and whoever needs their GPU. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage) . 
4. Price action - stocks follow certain pattern. They kinda wobble within some range for long period of time, 6-18 months, this is where a lot of accumulation by big players happen, and fundamentals kind of crystalize. Once the conditions are right, the stock can shoot 50% in a span of a month and then hover on new level for considerable time. Look at the chart of TSLA 2015-2019, NVDA numerous times, AMZN, GOOG, etc. Right now, NVDA is up already 20% in the last month. I believe the market will look from NVDA to AMD very soon, given points 2-3 and major holders wont be willing to sell for current price.

To recap what is the perfect storm. In 2017/18 chip shortage was caused mainly by A. the thing we dont mention here, right now its also B. new consoles cant be produced fast enough, C. supply chain issues which might be resolved soon, C. simply way bigger improvement in new CPUs/GPUs hence new upgrade cycle coupled with corporate upgrade cycle due to COVID

I'm no financial advisor, quite the opposite actually, but when I see an opportunity for short and long term money, count me in.  The amount of data these guys are stealing and selling must be astronomical.  Aside from the future of every child being glued to a phone at a young age, how can this stock really disappoint?

I'm assuming we may not see another dip under 109 for this stock ever again, I'm trying to jump in on it.  I will bite my words if I'm wrong and become a bag holder with diamond hands.

**What is COTY?** Coty is the makeup/cosmetics king. With its subsidiaries, it develops, manufactures, markets, and distributes fragrances, cosmetics, skin care, nail care, and both professional and retail hair care products. Coty owns around 77 brands as of 2018. These brands include: Covergirl, Burberry, Gucci, Calvin Klein, Boss, Chloe ETC. You can google the rest if you are curious.

**Why are they beaten down?** One major reason: With the pandemic, a lot of girls have adopted work from home/stay home lifestyles. Basically, alot of girls are too lazy and don't find the necessity to put on any makeup or perfume if they are just sitting at home with their sweatpants on. 

**Recovery/Online Growth**: Makeup/skincare isn't going anywhere, this isn't a dying industry. Also this has jump started COTY's e-commerce sales though their retail sales were hurting. According to their recent 4Q earnings call they are reporting that their percentage of net revenue through e-commerce has DOUBLED from pre-covid. As they invest in their e-commerce and online sales partnerships I can see this growing into a cosmetics/skincare version of Chewy. 

**Asian Expansion**: They are investing heavily in the Asian market and are seeing huge revenue gains from their previous investment. China is a huge market for cosmetics, especially premium skincare brands. Trust me, from dating alot of asian girls, they use makeup and skincare like its CRACK. They are addicted to the stuff. According to the CEO they have seen a whopping 40% Year Over Year increase in their prestige brand skincare retail sales in China. Considering again the lockdown environment this would probably be magnitudes higher if it were a non-pandemic year. Another sign of huge potential in Asia, is their Gucci skincare brand partnership with a Chinese Influencer had over 100million digital convos, the amount of skincare addicts in asia is insane and COTY will be making bank.

**New Leadership** - Sue Nabi new CEO, appointed July 2020, is a growth innovator in the beuty industry. Before joining COTY she oversaw double digit growth 4 years in a row in both Loreal Paris and Lancome. She also launched a booming green new-age skincare brand back in 2014. She is exactly what COTY needs, a younger smarter visionary CEO with the guts and experience to turn this retail focused blob into a online growth juggernaut.

**Price predictions**: I believe by eoy COTY will be back to 15 just as a recovery play. As they further expand their asian and online presense I could see them getting valued more as a growth play over the next 2 years. Growth price target: 50+

This campaign has been largely led by large hedge funds. Without S&P inclusion, the story might have ended there with hedge funds trying to escape with their profits and leaving retail the bag. However, S&P inclusion presented these hedge funds with a much better option to close out their positions while also riding the stock down. The shares that hedge funds no longer wanted began to be picked up by passive funds leading to selloffs by the active funds which pushed prices to this level.

&#x200B;

With passive funds holding the bag, the hedge funds which lead the rally seem to be attempting to push the price back down through a reverse gamma squeeze^(2).

No retail trader is buying 1m+ in deep OTM puts, this is an attempt by hedgies to push the price down.

We can also see this from the massive shift in options volume. $190B of calls open interest and over $250B of puts open interest, a massive put skew. This is especially significant because ""To put it in context it is equal to the combined $AAPL and $AMZN bullish skew or if you’d rather to the combined  $BABA, $FB, $MSFT, $GOOG and $WMT combined."" reflecting extremely bearish sentiment in an very very bullish market.

Once the reversal begins there will be nothing stopping it as OTM puts get less and less OTM. There are no shorts left to be squeezed and the bag holding passive funds which are largely barred from holding derivatives will have no way of rebalancing the options skew.

I know these are difficult times for this sub and it’s almost impossible to post something solid which is not about the current meme stocks.

Instead of jerking to some porn i did some research on PLTR and want to share my DD with you. This might be a longer text for your love dopamine level so maybe you should grab some your Adderall before.

The following text might you give your eyes aids since English isn’t my native language. I will try my best.

**Palantir as a Company – the beginnings**

PLTR was founded by some people and one of them is Peter Thiel who worked alongside with our holy papa Elon at PayPal. As a payment-service they had concerns about money laundering and founded PLTR to tackle this issue early. The CIA also funded PLTR (they are always funding stuff like this – Siri as example). This actually might be the reason why people think that PLTR is a company which aggregates data and do data analysis for the government….but this is not accurate and not correct at all if you see the big picture. I will explain this point later.

You retard still reading? Nice here some rocket emoji’s to pump your dopamine and keep you happy. 🚀🚀🚀

Let’s start with the DD

First of all my POV is looking for a midterm to long term investment in PLTR. My valuation considers PLTRs current state and predicting from now on for the next few years.

&#x200B;

* **1. The Management**

Before I start with the product I rather start with the management. You can sell the nicest thing in the world. I can guarantee you that the product definitely won’t be considered as the nicest thing after a while if you have a shitty management (Intel). With Peter Thiel on the leaderboard we got a competent asshole and CEO is Alex carp (co-founder) Peter Thiel is well known and Alex Karp is one of us. He yolod his heritage into some business and become a chad. Seriously tho, I trust Peter and if Peter holds on Alex since Decades so do I. Peter proved so many times how cunning he is and showed how to pick adapt problems early and create solutions.

&#x200B;

* **2. PLTR Business model/ products**

Before we understand how important PLTRs products are we have to understand that we are simpeltons who don’t have any business with PLTRs. We create data. We don’t fuck with it. We creating with using our phones or working in the office. Only a few of us may working with accumulated big data. PLTRs customers’ base isn’t neighbor Joe or Aunt Nancy. The products they offer are not even for midcap companies they are more designed for whole industries and governments. That’s the reason why their products aren’t so tangible for many people.

PLTR basically offers systems to big companies/governments which import their data into these systems. PLTR doesn’t sends workers to the client to collect data and analyse it. They sell platforms. They got 2 Products called “Gotham” and “Foundry” You may think wtf is this guy talking about? Let me explain it in 2 examples:

First example is Syria with Gotham. It was impossible in the country to know who the good guys are and who the bad ones are. I know u muricans only know yourself and the rest of the world is the “rest of the world” for you. But this wasn’t so simple in Syria you had many factions with different intentions and some of them were allies and some of them were enemies. The lack of information or the ability of recognizing and sorting these information’s are crucial in a war. PLTR solved the struggle with creating a map which provided resilient information for the marines so they can operate safely. Civil problems over there could also be fixed.

[https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/)

Actually what the John Hopkins University does with the covid numbers and the map, is some sort of what PLTR offering with their solutions. There are rumors that the tracking of Covid and the vaccination will be done by PLTR.

In their S1 Form PLTR describes it this way

“Gotham, our first software platform, was constructed for analysts at defense and intelligence agencies. They were hunting for needles not in one, but in thousands of haystacks. And they did not have the software they needed to do their jobs. In Afghanistan and Iraq, soldiers were mapping networks of insurgents and makers of roadside bombs by hand. Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps U.S. and allied military personnel find what they are looking for.”

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406\_11](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406_11)

The second example is about “Foundry” and it’s directly from the S1 File of PLTR (page 121)

“An Airbus A350, for example, has five million parts and is built by hundreds of teams that are spread across four countries and more than eight factories. Companies routinely struggle to manage let alone make sense of the data involved in large projects. Foundry was built for them. The platform transforms the ways in which organizations interact with information by creating a central operating system for their data.”

Both of these systems solving big issues with less effort. The arms industry as example would took billions for drones and stuff in Syria for the same job. The important fact is that PLTR does not spend so much resources for new clients they only have to provide access and support for their services and the client feeding the “machine” with data.

The key point is to understand that PLTR benefits very huge from economy of scales. This is very important since their costs for additional revenue is basically flat while the profits growing exorbitant with new customers. They offer a software and platforms and not kind of services where they need man power. All they do is working on their platforms and improving it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **3. PLTRs big issue during the last decade**

Peter Thiel was a great supporter of Trump and funded his elections campaign. The market thought that when trump wins then PLTR will get all the government (especially military) contracts.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html)

But this didn’t happened. Peter got cucked by the huge authority apparatus in pentagon. These dudes loves bureaucracy and they do it for a good reason. If you retire from your job in pentagon you usually get a high paid luxurious position at Lockheed, Raytheon or Bae Systems to make additional free money for your retirement. Many thousand people working in pentagon just to select and buy stuff for the government. They spending billions of dollars for purchases and then PLTR came around and said like „look guys we can do this job for a few millions instead billions“. Of course the arms industry was pissed and the pentagon boomers helped them out. PLTR got constantly scammed from boomers and didn’t get the contracts. This was also the „swamp „trump was talking about.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army)

A fun fact to this matter: Before James Mattis got summoned as the Defense Secretary of the USA he was a general in Afghanistan. He ordered services from PLTR despite the fact the pentagon was against it. But the marines praised PLTRs software and valued it over the trash they used to know from the defense/arms industry.

Even with a James Mattis as the defense secretary, trump as president and regardless that PLTR does it better and cheaper than the arms industry, it wasn’t possible for PLTR to get the government contracts.

[https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373)

[https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/](https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/)

How it’s ended? Well Peter’s wife doesn’t have a boyfriend because Peter is the fucking boyfriend of their wifes. All ended at the court and PLTR won. All this injustice ended at the court. The judgements on these cases are true circuit breakers for PLTR. Not only because PLTR spent shit tons of money for law suits. The lawsuits were perfect uppercut hits on the arms industry and they ended some fraudulent behaviors and „best practices „in the government

[https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/)

PLTR will profit from a Biden who wants to decrease the military expenditures. They will get the job done and at the same time the costs will go down. With the recent judgements the door looks open.

* **4. Valuation problems**

I could spam some multiplication on revenue or even a DCF but I think it’s not necessary. Expect the costs of research and development (maybe marketing) the costs of PLTR stood mostly flat in the last quarters. It’s a growth stock and the pricing is mostly in the perspective of PLTR. This is actually all we need to know that the revenue increases while the costs staying mostly flat. Check out the balance sheets at page 12 on the S Form 1.

Let’s talk about the market. The whole market seems overpriced but it isn’t tbh. Due to the low cost of capital there is no alternative than to throwing your money on stocks or on real estate. There is nothing with a solid interest rate around (not even in emerging markets). At the stock exchange like in 70s, the companies had to offer a return, a perspective which should be more attractive as putting your money on a saving account with 8% interests without risks. These times are gone since the 2000s. So before people discuss insane valuation they should check out the fiscal and economical policies.

Now back to PLTR and why the price is difficult to set (cheap imo). First of all PLTR did a direct listing without an investment bank for their share offerings. Its lacking of the valuation which they usually would get through such a process.

PLTR wanted to do IPO with Morgan Stanley but it was mess.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears)

Morgan Stanley proved themselves many times as stubborn communists when it comes to valuations. I mean you guys remember their disgusting price targets for tesla like 100$ post split or stuff like that.

These guys are very focused on numbers and I know it’s difficult to price in the potential and perspectives. But you can’t ignore these things for a fundamental valuation. If you want to consider these things in the price you have to understand the business of the company.

This ended that one team at Morgan Stanley valuated PLTR with 5 billion while another team thought they worth 40 billion.

[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html)

How is this difference possible and why is this happening? Because people don’t understand what they are valuating. This happened a lot in the last decade because the decision makers in these banks and many analyst don’t have any idea which metrics they should use on companies like that. They are using the metrics from classical industries on new business. They freaked out when Facebook was valued with 100 billion as IPO. Same with Twitter and in the last years it was Tesla. They said apple going to tank every damn year in the last decade. I honor Warren Buffet so much since he has the dignity to realize that he don’t understands something but at the same time he sees the potential and the trend. That’s why he hired 2 Chads who bought Snowflake for him. The transformation and the generation change didn’t happened yet. That’s why they try to use the metrics from Caterpillar on Tesla.

Guys the whole market is mooning with the cheap liquidity. Pennystocks and zombie companies transforming into billion dollar market cap companies. Facebook as IPO had a market cap of 104 billion back in 2012. At that time it wasn’t possible for Facebook to monetize their users with selling ads. They just paid 100 billion for the potential in more difficult market conditions.

Look at the IPOs like doordash, Bumble. I’m not going to call this a bubble. Just check out their business cases and use the metrics. Maybe its easier for people to understand Bumble and Doordash…

On page 12 of the S1 (balance sheet) Form you can already see the huge positive trends in PLTRs revenue and their costs. All this without all the positive events and contracts PLTR recently got.

PLTRs valuation is difficult and I think it’s miscalculated by pessimistic communist who don’t understand that their products are game changers for industries, governments and defense forces. Because of these points I think there is huge price potential for PLTR

&#x200B;

* **5. Risks for PLTR**

Despite the general market risks PLTR mentions at page 29 of the S1 Form the competitors as the main risk: “We face intense competition in our markets, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.” The S1 Form didn’t aged well. Actually I don’t think that PLTR would have any trouble with offering new shares. Also with Peter Thiel as one of the founders the financial side should be stable.

As PLTR competitor people use to mention IBM. The boomers from IBM already surrendered with their Windows95 computers and decided to cooperate. The biggest threat would be big tech with big money like AMZN or APPL. You all now the stories about APPL and Spotify or AMZN and all the merchants. Even if the big players would step into PLTR markets it would be difficult for them since PLTRs products doesn’t rely on an Amazon store or on apple devices. PLTR is years ahead with their products.

I think the greatest risk (still) are the boomerish arms industry and all the boomers in pentagon and other authorities.

There are very corrupt infrastructures when it comes to decision making and assigning contracts. People fear changes but they can’t avoid the changes. With the recent judgements we can see a turn on the tables but the transformation will still take time. It’s a circuit breaker with an avalanche effect.

The risk factors on page 16 on the S1 form mostly aren’t relevant anymore. People complained that PLTR wasn’t profitable for 18 years. Well PLTR was never designed to be profitable and Alex Karp once said “love us or leave us alone”.

[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html)

But even this changed recently. PLTR became profitable in 2020 with 130,000,000§. Now the same people complaining about how high the stock price compared to the profits. Well just you wait.

&#x200B;

* **6. Conclusion and Outlook**

If you still reading I have to admit that this was a lot text and i am sorry again about the lingo. Let’s connect the dots and bring this information to a point

1. The boomer coalition in the pentagon and in the arms industry is taken down by PLTR. They will able to get the governments contracts and the classic arms/defense industry is no match for PLTR products. The judgements of lawsuits were catalyst and the effects should be already shown in the next earnings. These were such underrated events but I think there still will be some odds but PLTRs situation is much better as it was a time ago. The chains are off!
2. Military expenditures rising worldwide

&#x200B;

[https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion)

With Bidens presidency we will see more disruptive technologies chosen by the government. Biden want to reduce the military expenditures. PLTR is able to provide better service for lower cost. Not only the recent judgements also the political change will help PLTR. Ironic if you remember that Peter supported Trump and getting his tendies from Biden.

3. PLTR superior products profits hugely from economy of scales. They don’t have any significant costs when they acquire new customers. Making the big data usable for decisions making is already very important and step by step people realize that this issue growing fast. We creating everyday more data than we did yesterday and leaving the majority of it as trace and unstructured data. We don’t work with it but big Institutions does.

Here is the passage from the S1 and I fully agree with it:

“The systemic failures of government institutions to provide for the public — fractured healthcare systems, erosions of data privacy, strained criminal justice systems, and outmoded ways of fighting wars — will continue to require both the public and private sectors to transform themselves. We believe that the underperformance and loss of legitimacy of many of these institutions will only increase the speed with which they are required to change.”

4. PLTRs value. The current situation of the market with tons of liquidity seems like a bubble. People don’t know what to do with the cheap capital and people throwing it even on meme pennystocks.

Facebook had his ipo back in 2012 during much harder market conditions as now. The valuation of Facebook was over 100 billion and people called it insanely overvalued. They did it because Facebook didn’t had a way to monetize their users (especially on mobile platforms). Facebook has a market cap of over 750 billion now and nobody calling it over valued.

A remember the recent examples? Bumble?! Bruuuh. Don’t get me wrong if you invested in Bumble but they have nothing special to offer and their business case can easily copied or improved by others. Its shows the current state of our market with the crazy liquidity that even zombie companies got astronomic valuations. Use these metrics on PLTR with great products, great management, low cost base and less odds as ever before….

PLTR price is wrong imo especially in this market and with PLTRs current state and perspective.

5. Do you use PLTR? Me Neither! It’s not designed for us and we have to inform us about the success. PLTRs new contracts and their future are shining bright. With the settled lawsuits the sky is clear for PLTR. But their customer base is not only America. I’m not a murican and 3 weeks before I just find out that the police departments in our state using PLTR products. I don’t need to link endless evidences here since you can google it by yourself and see how many contracts PLTR recently got. Especially after the circuit breakers we talked about.

I have genuinely trust into Peter Thiel and Alex Karp that their will make the best of PLTRs potential. The odds getting removed and the demand for PLTR is increasing.

If all these information would priced in correctly we would have a share price of at least 60-70$.  With upcoming and ongoing positive events PLTR share price should soar more..

**What’s next?**

Now we have earnings ahead and the lock up period ending.

For the earnings I think the number will be fine and keep up the positive trend on revenue with a disproportionately trend of the costs. The most important part will be guidance for 2021. We should listen closely and see if the magic is already happening.

The second event is the ending of the lock up period. You all remember the end of the lock up period of Nikola? Just 1-2 days after they announced they don’t got the GM deal? The stock tanked – for a good reason. You know the guy Trevor Milton.

But in PLTRs case everything is different. Despite the successful deals they got, does a guy who says “love us or leave us alone” sounds like someone who going to drop his shares at the first possibility? I don’t expect such a behavior from Alex Karp and neither from Peter Thiel. If some employees drop their shares it should be fine.

I would appreciate if the stock prices would go below 3ß. It would create a healthy bullish chart pattern and would be actually a nice discount to get in or stock up. I don’t think that the shares going to dump a lot because of this event. The earnings and the guidance are more important and the key events if you want to invest mid – long term.

What does all this means for you? Nothing! Please don’t do any market activity based on my DD. I’m just sharing my knowledge and looking for critics so I can reevaluate my theses. This is not a financial advice.

My hearts bleeding for all the GME holders. My last Reddit account got banned because I criticized “the pumpers”. In one of the comments I called the mods gay and got banned permanently (bye bye 20 k karma). If you are new to this please don’t do any decision based on this so I can sleep gladly.

I’m not well positioned and not trying to pump this stock. I have 70 shares and a CSP. Fair play and fuck all the bots and pump and dumper we recently got in the sub!

Leave an upvote if this post helped you. I need some more karma to be able to shitpost everywhere again!"

I present to you The Curious Case of Benjamin Butto....err Black Berry. ($BB),398,112,2021-02-13 00:48:09,"Listen up reta.....err, I mean memelords.   I know we’ve all moved on from the meme era into the weed era (and  hopefully people stick around that one due to the fundamentals for a  while, but if not....) and soon to be a redux of the vehicle era, but  there’s one meme stonk we need to have a real, honest heart-to-heart  about (and hey, it even ties into cars):  Let’s talk about Blackberry  ($BB)

# First,  let’s get some misconceptions out of the way: 

&#x200B;

Blackberry was never a  short squeeze stonk, even though it ended up getting roped in with the  other squeezers we were denied squozing  because of Wall Street cheating.  A lot of people thought it was and  that’s simply not the case.  Blackberry was, is, and always will be, a  phoenix rising from the ashes story, nostalgia peppered with  functionality.  You know, kind of like how you sometimes go watch some  classic porn to beat off to and don’t stop to think about the fact that  the actress is now in her 60’s and probably has super saggy tiddies.

Next  misconception:  It’s not a Boomer mobile phone company.  They don’t  make phones anymore – phones that are branded with their logos are made  by another company that pays licensing for the logo and some of the  patents.  Blackberry sold all their mobile patents months ago.

Third misconception:  No matter how much we ask,  they’re never changing their name back to Research in Motion so that we  can talk about Rim-jobs.  Sorry, just isn’t going to be a thing.

So  what are they?  It’s simple really:  They’re now an enterprise level  software security company.  When you think about it, it’s not such a big  pivot, given that their security encryption in their heyday was so  powerful that they ended up having to set up offices in certain nations  because it was impossible to crack and ran afoul of certain  international laws.

# Let’s take a dive into the financials before we get into the story:

At the time of this writing, BB is a 7 billion dollar  company with shares trading in the $12.50 range.  Even after the meme  war collapse, they’re still worth double what they were when the ball  dropped in New York City with absolutely nobody watching in person and  everybody at home wondering why even Anderson Cooper was using an autotuner.   They generate a hair over a quarter billion dollars in revenue each  quarter over the last year and in 2020 had a negative EPS of about 32  cents a share as they retooled, though they trimmed that to .23 cents a  share for their last quarterly earnings report.  They have about a  billion dollars in cash on hand and receivables, and they have about  half a billion dollars in debt.  It’s not a great fiscal outlook there,  but it’s certainly manageable for a growth company (which is what they  presently are).

# Where do they make their money?

Almost  half of their revenue is legacy income from selling endpoint management  and secure communications licensing.  A third of their revenue comes  from licensing their patents.  Oh, they also own Cylance, for you IT  help desk monkeys.

**That shit’s pretty boring, not gonna  lie.**  Your wife’s boyfriend might find it interesting, but only because  he can use it to laugh at you that you know this shit.  But the rest?   The rest is where things get interesting.  Blackberry Radar is a fleet  management solution, and the most interesting thing is....well, for  that, we have to go back in time for a moment:

# (Wayne’s World flashback/dream noises)….

July 29th,  2017.  Las Vegas Nevada.  50,000 of the world’s most feared hackers  descend upon Sin City for a weekend of debauchery, drinking, and talking  about all the new and interesting ways they found to break shit or in  general cause chaos - aka DefCon 25, which was NOT cancelled, contrary to what you might have been told.  A young hacker from Wisconsin positively stuns  everybody at a panel by revealing how it is that he found he could  effectively hack almost every late model vehicle on the road that  possessed connected features – from range and while the vehicles are in  motion – using.....music  theory.  It’s an absolutely stunning revelation, something matched only  by how terrifying the implications of it are.  And all anybody needed  was a $300 RF modulation tool.  Using this, he found he could take  control of every mass produced  car on the market except those made by Volkswagen Group and Tesla, and  those only because they had randomized frequencies they used.  This guy  fucked.  This process was so dangerous that, for one of the only times  in DefCon’s history, they didn’t publish the how-to publicly.  Oh, and a  team from a then relatively unknown EV company in China called $NIO won  the car hacking capture the flag tournament in less dramatic fashion.   If you didn't hear about any of this, it's because you were too much of a square to be there.  Sucks to be you, chump.  Something had to be done.

# Enter Blackberry

I’ll  spare you all the things that have happened since then, but what you  need to know is this:  Blackberry came up with a solution to defend  against this and a myriad of other problems (not to mention Europoor  compliance in the form of ISO 26262) not to mention autonomous security  - and their security software suite (QNX) is now on almost every new  car rolling off a factory line today.  This software is also critical  for EV’s, because it controls battery management ECU’s (that’s the shit  that makes it so you don’t have to drop 10 grand on a new power plant every 2 years).  Or, for those of you with IQ’s of 60:  Computer make car gooder.

# OK, so that’s cool.  But how does this get me TENDIES, man?  How much can these guys make?

They’re  coy about this and won’t give hard numbers, but there are ways we can  estimate what they’re pulling.  But to do that, we need to go back in  history again, and take a look at a stock nobody cares about

# (More Wayne’s World noises)

Enter:   Nuance Communications ($NUAN).  You’ve probably never heard of these  guys, but you and almost everybody you know has used their products at  some point.  They used to be best known for their Dragon Naturally  Speaking software suite, which your grandparents who decided they were  too old to figure out how to use a fucking keyboard bought so that they  could talk to their computer and send you messages that you hated  getting unless it came with a 20 dollar  bill, but which they thought you cherished forever.   However, at some  point around 2010, IBM – whom the Nuance CEO at the time was close  friends with the management of, literally just \*gave\* about 125 patents  around voice recognition to Nuance thinking that they were worthless.   Nuance took these patents and – for a brief moment – became one of the  coolest techs on the planet, because their tech is what made Apple’s  Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, Samsung’s whatever it was  called and a billion other voice recognition platforms work.  That is,  until Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Steve Ballmer, and everybody else Nuance  was dumb enough to trust to let look under the hood of their secret  sauce came along and all stole the IP to made their own platforms, leaving  Nuance rotting in a hole in the desert.  But one of the really cool  things Nuance expanded into before they went full retard was  they bought a couple of companies around 2013 or so– Tweddle and some  other company I can’t be bothered to look up – and got into the  connected car space.  At one point, Nuance’s Dragon Drive virtual  assistant was in every new car made by 9 of the world’s top 10 auto  makers.  

# OK, dude, my wife’s boyfriend is asking me to bring him a beer.  Can you speed this along?  What does this matter?

It  matters because we can look at what $NUAN was getting in licensing for  putting their virtual assistant in these vehicles, and use that data to  extrapolate an estimate of what $BB is getting for their software.  With  just their 9 car makers at their back, they were generating over 300  million dollars a year – and that was almost a decade ago, and just for  something that would tell you where to pick up your Down’s Syndrome  medication. Add a premium for security, include all the auto makers,  carry the one, smoke a bowl to help you concentrate, adjust for  inflation.....

This  is a market worth about...oh, roughly 750 million dollars a year for  Blackberry on the conservative side once they actually start charging a  market rate for this product.   Right now, they’re adopting the same  go-to strategy Microsoft has been employing with Azure, which is to  basically GIVE it away in order to gain market share and penetration,  and then send Fat Tony to collect once the car maker is reliant on it.  Plus  all the other stuff we already glossed over because it’s boring as  shit.   Applying the average multiple of earnings for cybersecurity  firms out there, their lack of competition in the space, etc. And you  come up with a market cap valuation target of....oh,  roughly between 45 and 50 billion dollars once they’re firing on all  cylinders.  And they don’t have to worry about Google or Apple throwing  10,000 engineers at this to make a competing product, because it’s just  not worth it to them, so they’re largely gonna get left alone.  

Or, by using maths....a  share price of somewhere in the neighborhood of $87.50.  Give or take  10 bucks.  Make it 15 to the downside, just to be safe.

# Yeah man!  Cool.  So I’m in.  It’s gonna go to that by like, Friday or something?

An enterprise level cybersecurity company with a sub 10 billion dollar valuation is basically unheard of in this century.   But this is not a burn play where you’re gonna  get 50% gains every day with no work.  It’s a company that’s going to  have to melt up to that.  It still won’t be to that point this time next  year. 

BUT....that  doesn’t mean it doesn’t have a great story.  It just means that this  isn’t something you do a 0DTE YOLO on and expect to get something out  of.  And making an Avengers meme about it isn’t going to send it to the  moon.  This is something you buy and stash in a musty corner of your  portfolio so you can tell your Boomer parents that you’re being  responsible with your investing and you were just joking about betting  your inheritance on weekly FD’s for shitty online dating sites where the women have to talk to your sorry ass first.   Oh, and it’ll make the lambo you buy with the money from this safer.

Because I know it matters, here are 69 rockets so you apes understand what all this meant.

.....no, there aren't going to be any rockets.  I lied.

Disclosures/Positions:  I am long $BB, holding 100,000 shares @ $7.67 average and another 5000 January 2022 5c’s.

&#x200B;

# TL:DR:  $87.50

# What is Yandex?

Yandex is a multinational corporation that operates primarily in Russia, Europe and ex-Soviet bloc offering a wide range of services. Primarily their revenues are from being a search engine, taxi services and other segments. Currently they offer more than 70 services (Streaming subscriptions like Netflix, Yandex.Music like Spotify, Classifieds ads, self-managed subscriptions for ad campaigns, self driving cars, deliveries, marketplace and a fuck ton more)

&#x200B;

As you can see Yandex has been seeing consistent revenue growth since 2017. Recently, its delivery service has begun turning a profit and is widely used among the citizens of Russia.

Read that again. **A Taxi/food delivery service is turning a profit.** That is a big accomplishment. Have you seen Uber or DoorDash turn a profit?

Check the 2018 & 2019 numbers. Now, do you want to know something else? **They currently have enough cash (1.1b$) to cover all their current total liabilities or all their convertible (one or the other) at any time they need.**

In addition, they've repeated in their financial statements that the liquid cash they have **is enough to cover operating costs should the pandemic continue.**

This tells me they're not gonna lay down like a bitch and cry to daddy when a white swan curve ball is thrown at them (I'm looking at you airlines)

This is just a brief overview as their business model is pretty extensive and by this time you lovely bastards have already bought OTM calls expiring this weekend. (Don't yo, this is a long term play)

**Yandex.Lavka**

1. Grocery delivery within 5-12 min is the goal. Some sites are achieving this already
2. Takt time per grocery item bagged is 10s. Takt time is the amount of time it takes to complete one process.
3. Groceries are then transferred to drivers for delivery (think Amazon Prime Now)
4. In order to reduce costs, additional lavkas in high concentration areas will be built.
5. Not all but some Lavkas are kitchens where actual food is cooked
6. Yandex Rover is making deliveries (actively) in three different locations. Currently a test but with the goal of going 100% driverless for deliveries and reduce costs.

1. Their current primary growth segment. They've recently acquired Sberbank's stake (Russia's most influential and one of largest banks) and now own 100% of market. Their goal is to rival other marketplace and ecommerce companies such as [Ozon.ru](https://Ozon.ru)
2. They currently have fulfillment centers and are in the process of building additional ones. Does not want to store its own Yandex branded products but wants to become a pure marketplace that offers fulfillment services for sellers and makes it easier for customer (cliche, but think Amazon)

&#x200B;

**Yandex.Go**

1. Offers delivery services to residential and commercial customers (stuff ranging from documents to pianos)
2. More than 100k deliveries made per day on other customers orders
3. ""Delivery with a click"" which delivers the orders to nearby lavkas (think Amazon locker). Delivery goals are to be within 15 min.

&#x200B;

**Yandex.Cloud**

Not much to say here but theyre offering cloud services to companies. Main competition Amazon AWS

**Yandex.Maps**

Same as above. Main competitor Google Maps

**Alice**

Yandex's dedicated AI. Currently has 45+m users, mainly in speakers, navigation, Yandex App

**Yandex.Search**

Their actual search engine that makes up bulk of their revenues.

1. What I loved seeing in their recent financial statements is that **while search engine revenues kept increasing, their TAC (traffic acquisition costs, the cost Yandex pays for others to refer customers to them) is decreasing.** What does this mean? It means customers are going directly to Yandex instead of using a medium. **Think**, why the fuck unless you're a boomer would you go to google, search for 'amazon' when you can go to amazon directly? This is actually a legit problem Google faces as Amazon cuts down on their revenues by not allowing customers to see Google Ads.
2. TAC decreased nine months ended Sep 19 to Sep 20 by 16% while total ad revenues grew by 1%. Read that again god damn it. **They're paying 16% less while maintaining their ad revenues, their biggest segment!**

**Yandex Self Driving Group**

Yo. This shit. Is. Legit.

Let me tell you about the streets of fucking Moscow. Dirt, snow, murky (or none at all) traffic lanes, chaotic drivers, alleys tighter than your uncles anus when JNJ took another -1.5% hit on his portfolio. And they STILL managed to develop an autonomous driving vehicle that navigates through all that shit without user input.

They currently have logged over 5.5 million miles using autonomous driving in Tel Aviv, Michigan and Moscow. That is a big fucking deal. They also have a partnership with Hyundai.

**However**, coming straight from their engineers it will take several years before fully autonomous driving can EXCEED human driving. This means it will take several years for perfection, whos to say sales cant happen before that?

# Other stuff

They sponsor educational camps and programs that focus on hard sciences in Russia (Physics, mathematics, engineering) and they continue to choose talent from these areas. This lessens the reliance on foreign specialists from the US/Europe to develop their products

They focus heavily on customer service and truly understand their core audience. I am telling you, Russians (especially those born in Soviet era) is TOUGH to accept technology. And yet they've done it by Yandex.taxi and Yandex.Lavka .

I'm kinda of a gay bear for our stock market right now, I feel like we're running on fumes with the stimulus cash and might see some extreme volatility in short term in US stocks.

Institutions have loaded up on Yandex since late 2020. Don't ever take this as a tell-tale sign to buy, but rather as one part to consider

# Gay Bear cases (in this case I am also a gay bear)

Russia is not stable politically - things can be done under the table.

* True, fair risk. But more or less the same thing in US except it's official (lobbying, insider trading, congress hearings that are just a facade)

They're too over-extended in their segments. They're focusing on all at once instead of focusing on what they can do really well.

* I would be concerned about this if their cash flow, revenues and net incomes would be decreasing YoY. However their current trajectory is that theyre consistently increasing. Also, think about it more simply - if they have these specialists working on all these segments, they can easily sell them off for a profit. Yandex.Pay was a cashless payment system that was 100% sold off to Sberbank. It is something that Yandex created and then re-invested those proceedings to their different ventures like Yandex.Market

What else you got? I am legitimately interested as my overconfident ass has 50% of his portfolio in this.

Do we have the power to move the stock market or not? Just 2 weeks ago the overwhelming sentiment was ""this is the hedge funds game, we're just trying to catch a ride. Individual retail investors can't do shit to move markets. We're hyennas picking at Zebra carcasses, but sooner or later the Lions are going to come back and reclaim their feast."" 

Now it's a complete 180. I'm seeing tons of outrage from people who got burnt today on their weed calls. Acting like this lot of new degenerates came in and pumped the price before bailing, thus crushing the overall market. 20% gains for them cost you tens of thousands on your call options. Well, how much blame does the media get? 8 million people in this sub is a lot, but how many people does CNBC, Fox Business, The Wall Street Journal, Market Watch, The New York Times, etc. Reach? When they all band together and spend 2-3 full trading days only talking about ""the new Wall Street Bets move"", how many day traders come running? Just Google ""Wall Street Bets weed"" to see what I'm talking about.

We're either being played, or it's actually us having this big of an impact on the market. I don't know the answer. So let's look at both scenarios. 

**We control the market**

This is dope! We can work with this, and grow into it, but first I want to get something off my chest. FUCK YOU! Talkin bout ""degenerates ruining my weed plays"". Bitch, what have you been chortling about with GME this whole time? ""💎🖐🦍 Gang got greedy and forgot to hedge profits."" 
""I took my gains at 300 like a pro."" 
""It's so funny how the smooth brains got left holding the bag."" 
Preaching about holding the line in January while you turned 100 @ $5 into 15 @ $50, then switched to pissing on ""bag holders"" for ""getting played"" in February. 

If we truly have the power to move markets, then the $10's of millions in profits everyone took is what brought down the rising market caps. It also bailed out the shorts who were/are less than halfway done covering (TLRY has high SI too). Then we went and did the exact same thing with weed stocks. Don't hate the player, hate the game right? Ultimately, something tells me stocks don't move up when everyone is trying to play with house money. Definitely can't ""hold any lines"" with house money either. We should invest in stocks we care about for their long term potential; any squeezes or pumps that potentially come out of that are just an added benefit.

**We don't have the power to move markets** 

That's cool. We're still getting blamed for it, though. Not just from salty weed ""bag holders"" in here, but from all of the media. We got blamed for this meteoric rise, and within 20 minutes of the tank in pre-market CNBC was already pointing the finger at us. Weed Stocks have been on the rise for 3 months, if you guys were just riding a wave none of us ""retail traders"" have any control over, then what crashed it? I won't speculate on that because it falls under ""conspiracy bullshit"" but we should discuss it. I posted [this thread this morning](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhm0wz/were_weed_stocks_and_silver_pumped_by_hfs_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) claiming it was a diversion attempt away from GME, and urged people to ""cash out their gains before it crashes."" I wrote it before the price tanked. The mods deleted it, and rightfully so. I don't have any evidence to back up that theory. What I'm trying to say now isn't about GME either. 

However, if we don't actually have any control over the stock market we should be using the media manipulation to make fat gains before we get fucked by big time day traders and algorithm options trading. As soon as they dump a trend on us, we should dump that trend. If the price follows immediately, we'll know we actually have control of these markets, if it doesn't we'll know we're getting played and figure out why. What do you guys think? Quit ""REEEEE""-ing all over the place and let's figure this shit out!!

P.S. RIP to all the people who bought both TLRY and GME at their peaks and still have no idea what happened.

Understanding The Market Requires You To Understand Market Psychology

Check out my profile for stock Analysis by request.

Stock market intraday patterns – all times are in Eastern Standard Time!

When day trading the US stock market you may notice certain patterns, based on the time of day, that occur more often than not. These patterns, or tendencies, happen often enough for professional day traders to base their trading around them.

9:30am: The stock market opens, and there is an initial push in one direction. Highly volatile!

9:45am: The initial push often sees a significant reversal or pullback. This is often just a short-term shift, and then the original trending direction re-asserts itself.

10:00am: If the trend that began at 9:30am is still happening, it will often be challenged around this time. This tends to be another time where there is a significant reversal or pullback.

11:15am-11:30am: The market is heading into lunch hour, and London is getting ready to close. This is when volatility will typically die out for a few hours, but often the daily high or low will be tested around this time. European traders will usually close out positions or accumulate a position before they finish for the day. Whether the highs or lows are tested or not, the markets tend to ‘drift’ for the next hour or more.

11:45am-1:30pm: This is lunch time in New York, plus a bit of a time buffer. Usually, this is the quietest time of the day, and often, day traders like to avoid it.

1:30pm-2:00pm: If the lunch hour was calm, then expect a breakout of the range established during lunch hour. Often, the market will try to move in the direction it was trading in before the lunch hour doldrums set in.

2:00pm-2:45pm: The close is getting closer, and many traders are trading with the trend thinking it will continue into close. That may happen, but expect some sharp reversals around this time, because on the flip side, man traders are quicker to take profits or move their trailing stop losses closer to the current price.

\---

3:00pm-3:30pm: These are big “Shake-out” points, in that they will force many traders out of their positions. If a reversal of the prior trend occurs around this time, then the price is likely to move very strongly in the opposite direction. Even if the prior trend does sustain itself through these periods, expect some quick and sizable counter-trend moves.

As a day trader, its best to be nimble and not get tied into one position or direction. Many traders only trade the first hour and the last hour of every day, as these times are the most volatile.

3:30pm-4:00pm: The market closes at 4pm. After that, the liquidity dries up in nearly all stocks and ETFs, except for the very active ones. It’s common to close all positions a minute or more before the closing bell, unless you have orders placed to close your position on a closing auction or “cross”.

Trade Entry Checklist - Things to Consider before entering a trade

1. Portfolio fit – Make sure you diversify your portfolio. If you have 9 open bullish positions, consider a bearish stance elsewhere to balance your portfolio and reduce risk.
2. Liquidity Check – If the stock you are considering has enough stocks traded per day. This can easily be found on Yahoo! Finance – look for “Average Volume.” Look for contract strikes that have at least 1,000 contracts of open interest – this minimizes bid/ask spread and ensures market liquidity so that you can actually enter/exit trades easily.
3. IV Percentile – Example: AAPL has IV of 45%, but IV percentile of 85%. This means that 85% of the time over the last year, volatility will be lower than it is right now as it’s current actual IV (45%). Likewise, if GOOG has an IV of 45% but an IV rank of 25%, then only 25% of the time over the last year IV was lower than it’s current value (45%). This means we have a 75% chance that IV will increase on average, meaning it’s current volatility is low – and we want to buy into that. If IV is between 70%-100% you will need to actively monitor that trade, higher risk.
4. Options strategy - Pretty straight forward- If IV is high and the price of the underlying is also high, we can eliminate bullish strategies and focus on bearish, and vice versa.
5. Strike Price – First you need to determine if you want an in the money (ITM) or out of the money (OTM). An ITM option has a greater sensitivity – delta – to the price of the underlying stock. So if the stock price increases by a given amount, the ITM call would gain more than an ATM or OTM call. This also means it would decline more than others if the price falls. ITM calls are more expensive as well – higher intrinsic value.

Next consideration is risk/reward. An ITM option carrier less risk, but costs more. If you only want to stake a small amount of capital in a trade, an OTM position may be your best choice. OTM positions are riskier, cheaper, and potentially much more profitable if the stock surges past your strike price.

6. Expiration – Date similarly to strike price, the further out a contracts expiration is, the higher the premium because time is on your side. There is a higher chance of the stock meeting your OTM target price given a year to do so, compared to a week. This is called Theta – a quantification of how much value is lost due to the passing of time. Theta also grows exponentially as you near the expiration date – your $190 strike call will be worth very little if the call expires tomorrow and the stock is at $180 because the probability of the stock reaching $190 is low.

7. Position size – This is important – BIG TRADING POSITIONS WILL EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF BLOWING UP YOUR ACCOUNT. We suggest you place trades utilizing only 1-5% of your total account value, with an emphasis on the lower end. Play it safe, round down. It’s much easier to recover from a -5% loss than -80%.

8. Future moves – Think beyond what’s going on with a stock than just in the current day – unless youre scalping. Is there an earnings report coming up? Can I roll this into the next month if I need to? Is there an upcoming dividend payout? Take the time to plan your positions and don’t rush your entry – You want to ensure the best possibility of success. I’d take $500 profit with a 90% success rate over $750 profit with a 50% success rate any day. You want to build consistency, and plan your positions before you take them."

Summary

Rocket Companies (RKT) is a fintech company that operates several brands including the flagship Rocket Mortgage. I think RKT presents an opportunity to buy serious value at a cheap price, because the market has not priced in the underlying fact that RKT is a tech company akin to Square, Paypal, etc.

RKT has disrupted the lending industry and has embraced a fully digital ecosystem, which will continue to drive customer acquisition and retention in the future
RKT spends considerable money and resources on UX/UI development, client experience, and marketing. This will also help drive their continued expansion into the lending market.
The RKT “ecosystem” provides a “full cycle” solution for everything related to real estate transactions and insurance. They serve real estate professionals looking to generate leads, develop those leads, better serve their clients, and make every stage of real estate transactions smoother. From the client side, they similarly just make everything easier - it’s an app, it’s online, it’s doable from home and it’s not complicated. There’s an inherent advantage in what they’re doing here because closing on real estate transactions has always been something that’s complex, unpleasant, expensive, and not well understood. You need lawyers, you need agents, there’s a ton of paperwork, it sucks. RKT is changing all of that.
RKTs balance sheet, income, and liabilities support a stock price several times higher than the current one in my opinion.
RKT is currently stagnant in price, and the market appears to be pricing it like a traditional mortgage company, not a rapidly growing tech company (which they are).
RKT has been around for decades (skips the startup costs that will provide barrier to entry for newer companies looking to do what they’re doing), but somehow seems to still be leading the tech charge in the industry. That’s a unique and potent combination in my opinion.
RKT needs a catalyst to get the market to value it as a tech company instead of a lending company. Once that happens, and I expect it to sometime within the next year, RKT should approach an appropriate valuation such as 20x earnings. That’s an estimate I pulled out of nowhere, but is commensurate with the low end of P/E ratios for companies I see as similar to RKT.
Key Point - RKT is Priced Like a Legacy Mortgage Company

The average estimate for 2020 year end revenue is $15 billion, and the yearly earnings estimate average is $3.85 per share.

This estimate gives a ttm P/E ratio of just over 5.5. The sector median is something like 8-12, which makes RKT cheaply valued relative to the earnings it produces, even compared to the financial/mortgage sector. What’s key here is, I don’t think that’s really an appropriate comparison. I would place them more in line with companies like Square (ttm P/E ratio of 325x lol), PayPal (ttm P/E ratio of 69x, nice), or Fiserv (ttm P/E ratio of 24x). I used Zacks for all of these P/E ratio lookups.

Let’s assume RKT is conservatively worth 15x earnings, and that it hits the estimate of $3.85 eps. That would put its fair value right now at $57.75 per share. I think it’s worth more than that but, we all should do well to remember that it’s really only worth whatever the market will pay for it.

Key Point - Catalysts

This thing needs a catalyst. Right now I am loading up. I’m buying shares, I’m selling SHORT TERM covered calls to reduce basis on those shares, but I will be stopping the sale of those covered calls within a couple weeks most likely. The Q4 earnings announcement will be on 2/25. I am not sure that the actual earnings numbers will be enough to wake this thing up, although I expect them to be good. But if that announcement comes with discussion of their focus for 2021 and beyond, and gets the market thinking about them as a tech company first and mortgage lending company second, things will start to heat up. I don’t know when the real catalyst will hit that triggers the run-up, but I think it could start with the Q4 earnings call. I am looking at $21 as the floor for this stock, and I expect the price to double within a year. I will be acquiring OTM LEAPs, expiring next spring.

Supporting information and background follows.

The Business

RKT is in the business of providing solutions to financial transactions, including mortgage origination and refinancing, auto lending, and more. Specific subsidiaries and my simplistic view of how they interact:

Home Financing

Rocket Mortgage - The mortgage company. This is a prominent “public facing” part of the Rocket ecosystem.
Amrock - Amrock provides title insurance, property valuations, and other solutions. I see this as “supporting infrastructure” to keep clients within the rocket ecosystem where they would otherwise need to go elsewhere and is part of what makes RKT a one-stop-shop.
Amrock Title Insurance (ATI) Company - basically does underwriting for Amrock. The “business end” in my simple understanding of the world.
Nexsys - provides a streamlined approach to the closing process with their Clear Sign and Clear HOI technologies - taking care of closing day authentications and sharing of homeowners insurance information.
Lendesk - Lendesk specifically provides solutions for the mortgage market in Canada
Edison Financial - Basically the “front end” of Lendesk that Canadian clients would interact with.
Home Sale and Search

Rocket Homes - Rocket Homes is a proprietary home search platform and real estate agent referral network. Basically this matches buyers, sellers, and agents, and is a key aspect of keeping clients completely working within RKT for all aspects of real estate buying/selling/financing.
For Sale By Owner - A digital marketplace designed to let clients buy and sell real estate on their own. I think it’s absolutely brilliant that RKT owns this, but more on that later.
Auto & Personal Financing

Rocket Auto - Supports rental and online car purchasing platforms.
Rocket Loans - online personal loan solutions for clients.
Media

Core Digital Media - a major advertiser in the mortgage, financial, insurance, and education sectors.
Lower My Bills - this company is basically a “portal” business model that connects people with providers of various loan and insurance products.
Services & Technology Development

Rock Connections - Basically a sales and support platform that handles appointments, prequalifications, generating leads, and data analysis among other things.
Rock Central - I will generalize this as “business support”. HR, administration, etc.
Rocket Innovation Studio - A tech incubator to gather and engage top talent and ideas.
Recent Acquisitions

RKT, through Lendesk, acquired Finmo back in October of 2020 (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-subsidiary-acquires-fast-182042594.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALnvnNBoglSnmMP0O61AqgXBJokNS53LjJYuG3NvYKhayp4I6ZH2RpfmFUbSsCAU4xmnBNGMTwiEG-Ly29EabVy1-OjPIGfkYoQ3389gn3Edebs9sIwWOy1tPzqjRwOwwGA_PWg0cNzEFCe7HBTilMwADUT_y0QxWw8vizWecGcv) Finmo is a rapidly growing Canadian digital mortgage platform and this acquisition I think was perfect - it shows RKTs dedication to embracing a fully digital experience, and making sure they’re the ones leading that charge.

Management

I do not have much to say here, aside from this. The RKT team is not the new kids on the block, they have decades of industry experience. Also, I value leaders that make people feel valued. And on that note, under CEO Jay Farner Quicken Loans has been in the top 30 of Fortune’s “100 Best Companies to Work For” list for 17 consecutive years.

Financials and Growth

When it comes to the numbers, RKT is killing it. I don’t want to just spout a bunch of numbers that anyone can easily go look up so here’s a couple that stood out to me from the Q3 earnings announcement and related data:

$4.63 billion in revenue, which is 163% YoY growth.

From that revenue, they beat EPS estimates with $1.21 for the quarter vs $1.09 expected.

Net income was $2.4 billion which represents a YoY growth of 365%.

Closed loan volume YoY growth was 122% to $89B.

Net rate lock volume was $94.7 Billion (101% growth).

RKT has brought in $13.1 billion in revenue in the first 3 quarters and seems to be on track to close out Q4 with yearly revs above $15 billion.

That’s awesome but what I really like is that they pair this amazing growth with $3.5B cash on hand. That’s great because I want them to be able to scale as they grow, and make acquisitions as needed (see Finmo) to ensure they can keep that growth going without getting overextended and failing to capitalize.

RKTs ability to recapture clients is one of the keys to their future success in my uneducated opinion. Their recapture rate is 4.6x the industry average. The Q3 earnings transcript includes a statement by the CEO on how when interest rates fall, retention rate falls, refinance activity is larger. The high recapture rate RKT has serves as a natural hedge to their retention of existing clients because their recapture is so much higher than average in the industry.

Quick aside - RKT announced a $1 billion share buyback program. They’ll be able to repurchase shares from time to time starting Nov10 2020, ending in two years. I don’t love the idea of share buybacks because I think this can be detrimental to actual business growth for the sake of shareholder value. However, with the large cash position RKT has (and it doubled from December 2019 to September 2020) I think this is a reasonable way to deploy some of that cash for now.

Ok so what about valuation using DCF, free cash flow analysis, something like that? Honestly I’m not convinced this is as useful as some people make it out to be. It’s nice to know what the numbers indicate, but I don’t spend a lot of time worrying about an exact price target based on anything like this. That said, you can crunch the numbers yourself or check out something like the Finbox resources:

https://finbox.com/NYSE:RKT/models/dcf-growth-exit-5yr

I don’t believe that fair value estimate for an instant, but it's a part of the puzzle to consider. Finbox has various models you can check out, but it’s also just a nice place to view aggregate data other than directly from the SEC filings.

Product Channels

RKTs direct-to-consumer channel is their main source of revenue right now, but I think they will be successful in their efforts to grow their partner channels as well. Why do I say that? Numbers don’t lie:

Direct-to-consumer Q3 growth: 131% YoY ($53.5B closed loan volume)
Partner Network growth 127% YoY ($29.6B closed volume)
Adjusted Revenue for Partner Network is up 502% YTD vs 2019 ( see Q3 earnings transcript)
The partner network volume is a little over half of the direct-to-consumer volume but the growth rate is just so damn juicy. That revenue growth is hellathicc.

Current Market and outlook

Right now, rates are low. The average 30-yr mortgage fixed rate is 2.92% (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/mortgage-refinancing-surges-but-high-home-prices-stop-buyers.html)

I cannot say how long interest rates will remain low but I believe RKT is positioned to continue to grow regardless of what rates do moving forward. They just cover so much of the space, and they do it with a focus on applied technology.

Here’s some blatant speculation. I think as we move into 2021 and the vaccine becomes more prevalent, millennials will buy, sell, and borrow against real estate with renewed intensity. I think RKT is uniquely positioned to capture that market.

I did some research and agree that this could be a big win. Here are my thoughts .  


The CME Group ($CME) is a U.S. based global market company whose subsidiaries include; Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Chicago Board of Trade, New York Mercantile Exchange, The Commodity Exchange, as well a 24.4% stake in the S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC.  


Yesterday the bears had a field day with $CME resulting in nearly a ten-point drop from the previous days high. The 3.5% drop put the price at $185.20 as of the markets close; this is despite a surprise increase in earnings and a marginal decrease in year over year.   


$CME is currently trading 40 points below its 225 high last February and has a market cap of $66B. However, the company's total assets exceed $117B ($35B more than the previous year) and shareholder equity is approximately 40% of the current market price at $26B.  


This alone is enough for me to believe that the stock is undervalued. By comparison, $AMZN's asset to market cap comes in at 13.55% and their shareholders equity is a mere 5.6%.  


This analysis is strictly quantitative and doesn't account for some very important qualitative aspects that could be cause the stock to rally.    


As many of you degenerates already know the CME group has created some exciting new futures and options that I cannot mention here but feel free to google it!  


Another important factor to consider is the massive $1.9T stimulus that is slated to make its way to the people over the coming weeks and months. As we have already seen from the previous covid stimulus payments - there will be a significant increase in retail investment more specifically an increase in options and futures trading and $CBE will probably be a major beneficiary due to it\&#039;s subsidiaries.  


In conclusion, I think this is a great opportunity for us . Time to add more diamonds to our hands bois. Let me know your thoughts and what the best play would be?"

**THESIS**

Workhorse (WKHS) is a self-promotion scheme more than anything else. It has a history of making grandiose claims of massive contracts with big respectable corporations, yet *somehow* they never see revenue or sales from them. And finally, the USPS has zero interest in dealing with WKHS, because they already kicked them out of the contract bid before.

In short, there is a near-zero chance that WKHS will see any significant portion of the USPS contract.

Part 1: History of Self Promotion

Part 2: The USPS Contract

Part 3: WKHS Manufacturability

Part 4: Positions or Ban

\---------------

**PART 1: HISTORY OF SELF PROMOTION**

WKHS has a history of claiming big contract wins. Yet time and time again, these contracts never materialize to any significant sales. Lets review:

* [In 2017, the CEO claims they had $300 million in pre-orders](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1113616_workhorse-ceo-300-million-in-preorders-for-plug-in-hybrid-pickup-trucks?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)
   * Near-zero revenues for the subsequent 4 years, need I say more?
* [UPS orders 950 vehicles](https://www.trucks.com/2018/06/14/ups-order-950-workhorse-electric-delivery-trucks/)
   * In reality, WKHS delivered 50 vehicles in 2018. [Workhorse still boasts about UPS as a ""blue chip customer.""](https://workhorse.com/company.html?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) But the standing 900 vehicles are *on-demand*, so UPS could do a test run with the first initial order. How'd it go? [Workhorse has been removed from UPS's sustainability reports.](https://sustainability.ups.com/media/2019-progress-report.pdf)
* Fedex ordered 20 trucks in 2016
   * Only 2 were ever delivered. [They tried to make a whole press-run about the one delivered in 2018.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/05/01/1493806/0/en/Plug-Power-and-Workhorse-Provide-FedEx-Express-With-First-ProGen-Fuel-Cell-Powered-Electric-Delivery-Van.html)
* Several other examples of press releases for small amounts of trucks ordered. Many only have a small fraction of the ordered amount delivered.
* Most importantly, as far as I can tell, there's NEVER BEEN A SINGLE RE-ORDER.
* [Now the company boasts of an order for 6320 vehicles](https://ir.workhorse.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/162/workhorse-receives-purchase-order-from-pride-group)
   * Let's take a look at that fine print: ""The order is split between Workhorse’s C-1000 and C-650 models and is subject to various production and delivery conditions."" Yeah, we'll see how that goes.

\---------------

**PART 2: THE USPS CONTRACT**

There is a near-zero chance WHKS will see any significant win from the USPS contract. This is best conveyed by the below timeline and the statements from the competing bidders Oshkosh-Ford.

First, lets go over the situation. The USPS has been looking to find a partner/s to replace its long-life vehicles. This is a massive fleet, and the contract's estimated value is around $6.3 billion over a few years. The Workhorse timeline in this multi-year bidding process is below, but the takeaway is that there are three bidders left:

* Workhorse
* Ford-Oshkosh
* Karsan-Morgan Olsen

*I'll get in to the bull arguments and the zero-emissions vs hybrid vs diesel issues further below.*

Here is a timeline of our Workhorse bid (CREDIT TO FUZZY PANDA RESEARCH):

1. In April 2015, Workhorse advances from 40 interested suppliers to the top 15.
2. [In September 2016, **Workhorse fails to advance to the top 6.**](https://www.postal-reporter.com/blog/usps-awards-37-million-in-contracts-for-next-generation-delivery-vehicle-prototypes/)
3. Later that month, Workhorse joins a team that did advance, VT Hackney.
4. From 2017-2019 USPS tests 50 prototype vehicles
   1. In Spring 2018, a USPS employee was hospitalized when a VT Hackney-Workhorse vehicle's brakes failed and the vehicle ran uncontrollably downhill. Testing was paused for their vehicles.
   2. Other failures during testing reportedly include: Vehicle running out of range (stranded), suspension broke when hitting railroad tracks, door failures, safety belt failures, and motors failing.
5. In November 2019, VT Hackney sold its stake in a potential $6.3 billion contract to Workhorse [for a mere $1m + $6.6m WKHS stock](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1425287/000162828019013414/wkhs-20191031.htm).

So, given the above, how are WKHS bulls so optimistic on their chances of winning? Well, it has to do with Biden's statements that he wants to [replace the entire US fleet with EV](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/biden-starts-the-electric-vehicle-race-with-big-plans-to-replace-the-federal-fleet-11611697897). He's also made comments on targeting a large percentage of zero-emissions vehicles. Remember, Karsan-Morgan Olson's proposal was a hybrid. And Oshkosh-Ford's proposal was Diesel. Only Workhorse had a true zero-emission proposal.

I use past tense because these are dynamic situations. And recent comments by Oshkosh management indicate that they plan to leverage Ford's recently announced E-transit (100% electric) as a potential option. See the following statements:

>“We’ve got a very strong, very comprehensive bid that meets all of the needs of the U.S. postal service. So I mean, I’ll repeat that, we do meet all the needs of the U.S. Postal Service. Meaning, if they want, under the Biden administration, more weight toward one type of propulsion than another, we’re ready for that. Now we’ve got our fingers crossed. We believe we’ve got high reliability solutions and hope to have good news at the next earnings call,” John Pfeifer, president and chief operating officer of Oshkosh, said in a call with investors last week.  
>  
>Pfiefer said he expects the Postal Service to make a decision in March. [\[Source\]](https://www.trucks.com/2021/02/01/electric-mail-trucks-make-sense/)

And in the very recent earnings call (you can google transcripts, this website cannot be linked):

>**Michael Shlisky (Analyst)**  
>  
>I also want to ask a quick follow up on another question about the USPS contract. Your opinion is based on the Ford Transit, I believe, and we've gotten since this last quarter, we just announced we just heard the announcement of the new Ford e-transit coming out here in 2021 so you comment that you can address whatever the USPS’s needs are as far as our power train. Is it as simple as just substituting the transit for the e-transit or do you have to have a special reopening on the contract and new approval to kind of make that switch?  
>  
>**John Pfeifer (COO, Oshkosh)**  
>  
>So there's limited things that I can say about this program, not because I don't want to but because we're under a pretty tight confidentiality with the USPS. We don't have to reopen anything to address the needs that as they evolve with the contract. I really can't comment on the transit ban, because of confidentiality, but I can say that we don't need to go back and have some arduous task of reopening an agreement if the contract goes one way or another, we will not have to do that.  
>  
>**Wilson Jones (CEO, Oshkosh)**  
>  
>I think the foundational statement there is we furnished a program vehicles that meet their current and future needs. I think that's the best way to leave it, Mike.

So USPS has the following options:

1. Work with the no-name vendor with a history of catastrophic vehicle failures in its small testing batch.
2. Work with Oshkosh-Ford to update their proposal to include some reduced-emissions diesel vehicles for 2021/2022 delivery. These can be used in the future for rural environments with limited charging infrastructure. The 2022-2025 deliveries could be electric vehicles based on the best selling cargo van, the Ford Transit (E-transit).

Note the specific situation in #2 is pure speculation on my part. But either way, it is not a hard choice. Ford-Oshkosh has this in the bag. \[I haven't gone in to why Karsan-Morgan Olson isn't a strong candidate, since it seems like that is universally understood. I do believe they are likely a solid backup for a small % of the USPS contract, though.\]

\---------------

**PART 3: WKHS MANUFACTURABILITY**

I'll keep this short because it is already getting long. Workhorse has never produced its vehicles at this scale, ever. This is a massive risk. There's zero reason for USPS or others to take that risk on. I know, WKHS bulls say ""Lordstown"" like it means something.

This means nothing. Having a facility is not enough. Cars have tens of thousands of complex moving parts and require precise assembly and process controls.  If you don't work as an engineer, you cannot imagine the effort that comes in to developing, maintaining, and scaling a manufacturing process this complex. Until Lordstown can demonstrate that it can crank these vehicles out, it is simply a manufacturing space.

\---------------

**PART 4: YOLO**

Ford calls, Oshkosh calls, Workhorse puts. For those less risky, be sure to buy April calls and puts, since the USPS contract could be announced in late March. I have enough fodder to double down on FDs if my current March 19th OSK and WKHS positions expire before a decision.

No EBITDA? Don’t let yourselves get caught up in the hype brother monkeys. **EDIT: Stock go down. I have been wrong many times and this is in no way advice**

**EDIT:** Because some are bringing up ""hurr durr bad multiple choices"", here are some quick comparable companies:

OrganiGram: 21.7x

Aphria: 18.3x

Aurora: 18.6x

HEXO: 16x

TerrAscend: 31.7x

**EDIT 2:** My bad I had the wrong conversion rate. It's late where I am. Just updated to reflect that. The point still stands: It's not that I'm bearish on weed as a whole - I think TLRY's rise compared to its peers in the industry is may present a bear opportunity.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Listen up y’all. I know we hate contrarians here, but hopefully, some of you monkeys can put on your thinking hats for a second and gather ‘round. Remember, true diamond hands don’t care if the stock goes up or down, they observe the facts and make sound decisions based on them to amplify their own profits. Now let’s learn some basic corporate finance together.

We need to talk about TLRY.

As you all know, TLRY spiked today…and the day before…etc…up to almost $70 per share. Some of you made money on calls, and I’m proud of you, but this pump is going to end and I’m here to explain why.

Obviously, everyone is going to point to the obvious to counter my short term bear view - the merger with Aphria. I’m not going to waste your time telling you why this merger might not even happen; no - instead I’m going to humor you and assume it does in my simple analysis. I’m going to use only numbers directly from TLRY’s merger announcement presentation, which you scrubs can find [here](https://ir.tilray.com/static-files/42b99b9b-5574-499d-b266-aabd0393103e).

Let’s start with two basic facts:

TLRY Current Share Count: 158.3 million

APHA Current Share Count: 316.7 million

Now, the merger proposal says essentially this: the two companies will become one company – nothing will happen to TLRYs stock (it will roll over into the new company), but Aphria’s stock will be converted into TLRY shares at a ratio of 0.84:1. This ratio is our first new term of the day: the conversion ratio.

We can multiply the Aphria share number by this ratio to get the number of shares it converts into pursuant to the merger. The resultant number is about 282 million shares. Now we add this to the number of TLRY shares that roll over, and we have a total outstanding shares post-merger of \~440 million. This number is called the Pro-forma shares outstanding.

Now, we take the Pro-forma shares outstanding and multiply that by the share price (everyone is saying this whole pump is share-price merger arbitrage anyways) to get the Pro-forma market cap: a whopping $30 billion US dollars!

Carrying on with the valuation…we add the merged company’s debt to the market cap to get enterprise value (I'm not worrying about cash for you hardos out there, just trying to illustrate a point here) – and we get an enterprise value of 31ish billion dollars. This is essentially the value of the Company as indicated by the market.

Now we can start looking at multiples. You may be asking yourself, young monkey, “Why do multiples matter?”. Well, they essentially give us a way to value stocks relative to one another. This type of valuation, simply enough, is known as relative valuation and is used every day by the top investment banks and hedge funds in the world. One useful multiple in sales-driven businesses like this (especially those with no positive cash flows) is the enterprise value to revenues multiple. Generally, companies trade in a range that the market considers fair. Google is trading about 7x for example. Tesla is at 20 something. Other weed companies are in the 20s geenrally. We can calculate this ratio for the merged company in question using the combined revenue figure provided in the merger documents and it comes out to…..43.9x. Let me say that again: 43.9x. That’s saying this weed company that makes virtually no money on a net basis should be trading at higher multiples than even Tesla, one of the most historically high multiple stocks out there. This is so, so, so overvalued. A classic pump.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xzvunu13trg61.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=0534676fa415203dce905ff045d66bb79e37695d

Just for shits and gigs I did this same analysis just looking at TLRY as a standalone company in the event there is no merger, and at current prices, the EV/LTM Revenue multiple is even higher at 60x. 60!

I just want to make sure you all don’t get shafted here. You should not be paying this much for a Company with no earnings. Notes these numbers are conservative - I'm not even accounting for further dilution from insider options and convertible securities because you apes probably can't handle it. And don’t tell me “it’s about the potential”. Potential isn’t realized through a press release, and you know it.

Furthermore, legalization takes a long time to implement and these guys aren’t even US focused. Seriously – read their securities filings.

Also, keep in mind this merger was announced in December, and nothing materially altering profitability has been announced since then. WHY THE RUNUP? You're getting fleeced lads."

1) BB has nothing to do with smartphones. Throw those 2007 notions out of your mind and bring yourself to the future

2) Whilst the whole stock market has been pissing themselves for years over EV/AV industry speculation, the reality is that these are hardware companies with low margin, and limited scale potential.

Even Tesla, owned and run by the richest man in the world, has yet to build more than 500,000 cars in one year. Meanwhile Tesla competitors springing up everywhere with both new challengers such as NIO and old money fucks getting into EV such as VW and GM (GM in December 2020 announced 100% by 2030 all cars would be 100% EV).

THE REAL FUCKING MONEY is not in EV production which has low margin and low scale, but in data monetization which is high margin (and being software) has unlimited scale. In the same way that Google makes only $18Bn revenue from hardware sales (phone, nest sales etc) but makes $120Bn from data monetization, $BB is going to to the fucking moon with $200BN revenue + by 2030 with 10% net whilst Tesla and other big auto are fighting over 4% margins (Tesla net profit in 2020 = 4% whilst **BB sat at a juicy 10.15%**).

This industry is going to the fucking moon, and BB is the only one with a front row ticket 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. This shit is like investing in Google or Amazon in the year 2000, by the time the mainstream saw the potential 5 years later, shit was already at pluto

A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.

Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.

Fast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot program but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?

SONY? Blackberry QNX. Baidu? QNX baby. XPENG? Blackberry as well. If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? Li Auto But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using Nvidia DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both Canoo and Hyundai makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.

You might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀""

3) BB is a cash flow positive, growing company with near nil competitors in an industry that is skyrocketing. Despite this, the boomer fucks who still believe BB is a smartphone company, have in their own glorious act of autism, have massively shorted BB bringing the share price down. 

BB is a growth company in a growth industry, these hedge funds are going to need to borrow more money if they want to buy tendies after the wider market realizes the market inefficiency that is an undervalued BB. u/Tradergurue went into a lot of detail in his $BB short interest post here [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short\_interest\_in\_bb\_its\_increasing/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short_interest_in_bb_its_increasing/) 

TLDR: hedge funds caught with their dicks in their hands are about to get Royally Fucked as the market corrects itself with a BB rise over the next month"

Those of you getting bent about if it's over or not clearly do not understand how the game is played, but props for trying to learn.  It's never over, stonks go up and stonks go down, every fucking day.  The object of the game is to buy a yacht before you go broke.  If you are losing your ass, this is a good time to google the term 'hedge'.

In the meantime, let me share what I have learned after many losses.  If there is one thing that big bank accounts enjoy more than manipulating us retail traders, it's manipulating each other.  Us retail monkeys are the side show.  

Sure it's fun playing poker with your wife's boyfriends little brother because you know you are going to win.  But that is not where you make your money.  You make your money at the casino sitting across the table from a bunch of other drunk high rollers with money to burn.

It's pretty safe to say there are some 10 figure bank accounts circling the drain right now looking at fails-to-deliver data and bargain prices with their mouths watering getting ready to checkmate the fuck out of their competition before they even know what happened.  

It's also safe to say that nobody cares if you sell it now or pass your shares down to your wife's boyfriends grandchildren.  This place is not here to tell you what to do, it's here to put people's heads together and get some other opinions about how retarded you are so you can make your own decisions.  We are not trying to beat them, we are simply taking our seat at the table. And also trying to buy a yacht."

RKT will achieve this the same way Amazon became the powerhouse of e-commerce and that is through their unique culture.

Both AMZN and RKT have powerful cultures that are built around  “shocking rules"" — rituals and practices that are memorable, and so bizarre, that people inside the organization encounter almost daily, and that people who hear about them wonder why they are necessary.

My second DD will be devoted to RKT's shocking rules and their one-of-a-kind culture. RKT DD Part III will focus on Rocket's vision to make Detroit the fintech capital of the world by doing much more than just writing loans.

But for my first DD I want to address the elephant in the room: RkT StOcK HaSn'T DoNe ShIt.

Yes you drooling shit-for-brain autists are correct, RKT has performed very poorly in a market where nearly every company is hitting all time highs.... But what you pea-brained dip shits don't understand is that you are believing exactly what the institutions want you to believe: which is that RKT isn't a buy. When in reality, RKT is a gold mine and the fat cat tutes know it.

RKT DD Part 1 will explain the market manipulation RKT is experiencing, how it works, who is doing it and why they are doing it. I will also discuss another successful company that experienced this in 2012 and how I believe RKT will have a similar outcome as the company I mention.

I wanted to include as many pictures in my DDs as you guys have chromosomes so please...

Enjoy retards. and oh yes: Fuck the tutes.

TLDR - refer to the end of the Google doc above.

Edit: this stock will be at least a 6 bagger 10 years from now. That said, we don’t know how long the tutes will control RKT. It may be safer to buy RKT shares and RKT calls that expire in June or later. You guys will make money on this trade trust me - just don’t be greedy and go for weeklies; making money off those is far from guaranteed.

Double edit: with over 40 percent short interest, a $1B buyback (that cuts RKT’s float in half) zero insider selling and potential catalysts - RKT could easily squeeze into the $50s in the near term if the stars align. And if it doesn’t squeeze, this shit is still going to melt up. You’re not investing in fucking bed bath and beyond here."

The size of the move depends mainly on two things:

\- The market cap of the company: for a huge company like JNJ, any event will generate only a tiny move, whereas the value of a penny stock can +10x after a successful event.

\- Size of the addressable market: does the drug treat a rare disease or a common one? The larger the size of the market, the larger the move would be.

Drug approvals are a long process that can take years, but in some instances, the FDA grants priority date to certain drugs. These are referred to as PDUFA events.

Here's a list of the ones (with market cap > 1 billion to avoid my post being removed) coming up this month:

I have added what the drug does (from a quick google search) + addressable market size (basically just my intuition, without any data to support):

* 11 Feb 21 [$REGN](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/REGN) Evinacumab (high cholesterol), addressable market: small
* 15 Feb 21 [$GTHX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/GTHX) Trilaciclib (designed to improve outcomes of patients who receive chemotherapy), addressable market: large
* 25 Feb 21 [$SRPT](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/SRPT) Casimersen (Duchenne muscular dystrophy), addressable market: small
* 28 Feb 21 [$REGN](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/REGN) Libtayo (metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma), addressable market: small
* 28 Feb 21 [$BPMC](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/BPMC) Pralsetinib (metastatic RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer), addressable market: small
* 28 Feb 21 [$ATNX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ATNX) Oral Paclitaxel (metastatic breast cancer), addressable market: medium

My positions:

I have invested some money only in SRPT and ATNX. In SRPT, because it had a huge drop recently and I hope an approval will trigger a recovery. ATNX because I think the treatment being in the form of a pill is a winner. I haven't researched the rest.

However, some of you made serious losses these past days. Some of you have been bystanders, maybe watching close relatives or friends invest in $GME. As autists, we must hold together. Please check on your relatives or family members that have invested in $GME. No ""told you so""s but with genuine interest of their mental health. Offer them your empathy (google it, autists) or just a moment of silence together. You might make a greater impact than you think.

# 1) Institutional Ownership of GME is over 100% of the float.

Blah blah blah, what's the big deal? Well consider this for a moment. If we assume that these institutional shares are essentially not in daily play (not exactly true because some of them are shares held for smaller accounts or whatever, but ignore that because diamond hands probably hold an equivalent amount to that portion), and we go ahead and assume that those institutional shares cannot be bought to cover a short (which they can but not easily/not quickly)...then:

EVERY SINGLE SHARE TRADED ON THE MARKET IS A SHORTED SHARE THAT IS OWED TO SOMEBODY.

That's right, every single share traded on the market is ACTUALLY AN IOU. That's INSANE. And for every share we (as retail investors) buy, that's an ADDITIONAL IOU.

I literally can't overstate how insane this is. This isn't just a short squeeze where there aren't enough shares....there are literally LESS THAN ZERO UN-SHORTED SHARES TRADED. This goes so far beyond a liquidity issue, I honestly don't know how clearing houses are even functionally capable of obtaining GME shares anymore. This thing will explode soon, because every share bought is just compounding IOUs at this point (on avg, obviously).

Forget the moon....🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 to some kind of permanent orbit.

# 2) Price movement during the meteoric rises

On Monday, Jan 25th, we had some huge spikes but only slightly positive movement. On Tuesday Jan 26th, price slowly climbed at an almost perfect line. This, I believe, was some shorts carefully, slowly covering and/or retail buying excitedly and/or a gamma squeeze due to the unexpected situation where every call from the Friday before ended up being ITM. Then between Tuesday and Wednesday, price **SHOT up afterhours from $150/share to $350/share**. Bloomberg had an interesting article regarding how approx. only $45m was needed for this price movement. On Wednesday, Jan 27th, the stock essentially traded sideways, with some big volatility. Then on Thursday, Jan 28th, many brokers suddenly restricted the ability to buy GME and the price fell sharply, but then rose again with additional movement after hours (likely MM's covering the newly ITM calls before Friday, perhaps some shorts covering). On Friday, Jan 29th, a twitter account belonging to one ""Kjetill Stjerne"" who may or may not be a reclusive Viking billionaire, tweeted that they would ""hold the line"" in light of the brokers closing and posted a bash script with a piece including something like ""hunt=shortsells"". While nobody can confirm if this is true (though he was for sure someone early on the GME boat, we don't know if he's actually wealthy, etc), all of us who watched the Level II Data stream on Friday saw that many of the ladder attacks (aka, rapid share dumps and/or shorts, below ask price and sometimes below bid price) were suddenly stopped when compared to previous days, and the stock, while very volatile, closed at $325 (essentially, sideways movement again, but with huge spikes/dips) leaving lots of call options ITM.

After Friday, the stock dropped starting Monday. It closed Monday at 225, and Tuesday at 90. I believe this was due partially to people selling (and panic selling), but also due to people shorting. It's important to note that volume was HIGHEST DURING the Friday before last, and then last Mon/Tue. Once the stock rose above $325, volume stayed relatively low and dropped until Tuesday.

What does all this mean? My opinion is that the spike was artificial. Someone intentionally raised the price using afterhours movements (why? I can hand-wave and give some options...but it's all speculation), and opinion of the stock was high enough to sustain that high price for a little while. Once that was evident, brokers across the board suddenly restricted the ability to buy shares (not just Robinhood), likely due to increased clearinghouse requirements, thus locking out retail investors. I personally also believe the Viking was legit, and he's the reason the price stayed up on Friday in the absence of retail buying, but that's my personal opinion. Which brings us to discuss the broker restrictions:

# 3) Broker Restrictions

**IT IS CRITICAL TO NOTE THIS**[INTERVIEW](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/28/interactive-brokers-restricted-gamestop-trading-to-protect-the-market-says-chairman-peterffy.html)**:**  This chairman of IBKR, one of the brokers said this: ""We are concerned about the ability of the market and the clearing systems, through the onslaught of orders, to continue to provide liquidity. And we are concerned about the financial viability of intermediaries and the clearing houses"". In other words, there were so many shares of GME traded that it seems they were having **TROUBLE TO FIND THE SHARES and/or THE CASH TO BACKUP TRADES**. He also talked about how he ""saw this squeeze going to infinity and so they stopped it to prevent losses"". So brokers began to call margins on margin accounts, liquidating stock and options, sometimes very conveniently at the lowest price of a dip. E-toro ""accidentally"" set automatic stop-limits. Robinhood restricted buying to one share, etc. etc. All of which led to a drying up of the BUY side of the books, allowing the SELL side to push price down far more easily than normal.

# 4) Media Manipulation

It has become blatantly apparent that the news media is generally ignorant of the situation, whether willfully or not. From articles about the ""short squeeze"" in NOK or BB (neither of which is significantly shorted), to an endless litany of articles about how ""reddit"" or the ""reddit army"" has moved to Silver despite only a single post in the sub about it, or Biotech, etc. The silver one is my favorite because EVERYONE reported that...but it was practically absent from this sub. Smells really fishy.

Ever since Wed, Jan 13th, the media has been reporting that ""the short squeeze has happened.""

The best examples, in my opinion, is if you watch the ""new"" articles after doing a Google search of ""GME."" You'll find that in general, whenever GME starts to rise, there are suddenly ""new"" (not actually new but updated so that they look like they came out just now) articles bashing on Gamestop, retail traders, the ""frenzy"", WSB, or speculation in general. (my personal opinion, based on what I've seen)

# 5) Bot accounts

There's been a massive influx in this sub of [bot accounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lafh4d/in_case_you_needed_proof_that_there_are_imposters/) that seem to generally be negative on the GME situation.

&#x200B;

These are a general summary of the reasons that people feel like it's still worth holding GME.

If the news article writers tried harder to find the truth (please, DM me, I'll help), instead of blatantly making things up (re: Silver squeeze, NOK squeeze, BB squeeze, other ""next targets of Reddit"", Qanon comparisons, etc);

if Citadel (a market maker) didn't give a loan to Melvin (a huge GME shorter);

if Citron research hadn't tweeted on Jan 19th that they would discuss reasons for shorting GME (**the next day**) just as GME dipped suddenly during a rise (and then postponed it because they forgot about the inauguration)...and proceeded to give REALLY unconvincing reasons.

if people didn't see evidence of attempted stock manipulation in this subreddit by new accounts;

if the price movements weren't extremely suspect and rapid;

if there wasn't constant reporting about ""shorts have definitely already covered"" for weeks;

if we hadn't seen hundreds of articles about how WSB traders could never understand the fundamentals (while I've seen more fundamentals in the DDs here than in any news article about GME);

Edit: if the GME and AMC graphs hadn't been paralleling each other for a week;

**if brokers almost across the board hadn't SUDDENLY restricted the ability for retail investors to BUY but not SELL shares and/or options**;

if institutional ownership wasn't over 100%, and shorters hadn't been so greedy as to short up to 138% of float (it's lower now, but it's still **insanely** high imo);

**and finally IF there wasn't a convincing turn-around story and evidence of it;**

First of all, fuck the suits and GME 💎🙌🍌🦍💎🙌🍌🦍💎🙌🍌🦍💎🙌🍌🦍 I have 3 shares at $300 and I just want to see all the short sellers get burned. But for a core position, Ford isn't bad.

**It's a value stock**. Ford is extremely cheap. From 2008 onwards, and again in 2020, Ford has a company that has been left to die. It is also an industrial, which puts it in the realm of boring companies that will benefit from the rotation of it does come.

If you want to talk fundamentals, PE is something around 8x right now, which makes it in the same realm of freaking Tyson Foods, which last I checked, was responsible for taking things off a carcass, putting it into small bags and selling it for 79c/lb for autismos to REEEEEEEEE over.

If you want to talk options, dude the underlying is basically $10. That makes options cheaper. And the IV is basically 30-50% on reasonable strikes and exps (say 10% OTM 1mo, 20% OTM 2mo etc). This means for a single GME option (I don't care which one), you can have anywhere from 100-500 of F ones. People dumping their entire life savings on 20c options is what the sub was built on.

**Gubmit money**. This is nothing new ([meaning we saw it during the Obama era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_incentives_for_plug-in_electric_vehicles#United_States)). You bet there will be incentives for both companies and consumers in the September budget. This also has the tailwinds of Biden's ""plan"" of buying all American and electric for the Federal fleet. Ford will absolutely lowball the shit out of everyone else because that's what Ford does when faced with these [morally-questionable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Pinto), [profit-enhancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestone_and_Ford_tire_controversy) situations. Ford these past few weeks have been trading like a green company like Sunrun and a few others. Yes GM will probably do the same thing, but GM doesn't have this next point which changes the situation.

**So what if it can become a tech company?** Yeah, it's never going to happen. I would never buy a phone from Ford for example because you know Ford can find a way to make the plastic rust. But the [Ford-Google dea](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/ford-and-google-sign-six-year-deal-for-android-in-car-apps-cloud.html)l goes beyond just installing android on cars. Ford will absolutely sell user information to Google (kinda like how RH sells it to Citadel). Google wants this information because it wants to get into the self-driving car business, and the deal allows it to leapfrog TSLA by not having to build their own cars, network and ecosystem. The data is probably more valuable since you have a wider view of the entire US driving demographic.

GM does not have this. GM does not have anyone to prostitute their driver data to. Sure, GM can do that, but GM is expensive and their small cars business will be absolutely killed by the deluge of new small EV manufacturers over the years.

So... don't do anything crazy like $15c March 2021 because there will be no GME-esque short squeeze (even though yeah VW was a car company and earnings are this afternoon). A 40% gain over 11 months is very reasonable. And again, the options are very cheap ($1.50).

**Risks, disclaimers etc etc:** Hi Mr. SEC, this is not financial advice. I do not drive a Ford because I don't want to be stranded on the side of the road. Apple car might lead to a drop in Ford but thankfully in the US, Ford has stopped producing small cars. If I lose it all, please feel free to find this post again and drop an F in the chat."

As a fellow retard I’m not well versed the mechanical jargon of wall street. I know enough to understand what is going on, but I’ve always stayed away from shorting, margin, or options. So honestly, my smooth ape brain hurts reading about short ladder attacks, ITM/OTM contracts, and naked shorts. I’m sure the 6 million new subscribers feel the same way. So I’m going to break down in super simple terms why I’m still holding the stock.

First though, it’s important to face reality. This movement to take on the hedge funds has died down. WSB was getting over 1 million new subscribers per day and now it’s only gaining maybe 100,000 subscribers. The google trend data for GME stock shows significantly less traffic. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d3wb3rberef61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=95dcdb0f6da867d48f75d4c550ecf3022e2d9d9e

Also, a ton of paper handed fucks sold their positions and gave billions back to the hedge funds. 

Since there are less people joining and at lot of people who have sold out of GME, there is a significantly less of a forced short squeeze. BUT IM STILL NOT SELLING. WHY? I’ll break it down with super simple math that even an ape can do.

According to Yahoo Finance there are 47 million shares in the public float. Meaning shares available for the public to trade. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lnzbtfifref61.png?width=473&format=png&auto=webp&s=22ebb708330316cf3f3c2f0ece4ae1049c9a8506

&#x200B;

There are 8.5 million subscribers on WSB. If each subscriber held an average of 5.5 shares, WSB would control the entire float! If the entire float was owned by WSB, then WSB would literally control the price of the stock. 

Yes, I know that not all 8.5 million subscribers are going to buy GME. And even if WSB did, a lot of retards have paper hands and would sell early. Also, many subscribers are just here to enjoy the show or are bots. 

But let’s pretend that just 25% have diamond hands and buy GME. That would mean there would be 2.125 million people buying the stock. If 25% each bought an average of 22 shares, WSB would control the entire float. 

2.125 million x 22 = 46.75 million

This is definitely possible, although not probable given the recent developments. However, the risk vs reward is still very lucrative.  I created a probability table and assigned a probability of GME hitting certain prices. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l2yc12qhref61.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=36dc52815b342660fef85a02e08597c2d924ad65

According to my table, I estimate that the probability that GME will go to $75 or less at 73%. However, in the event that WSB controls the shares of GME, the price would skyrocket. It doesn’t matter if the short interest is at 100%, 50%, or 25%, there will be shorts that need to cover and there will be no supply. 

I believe I’m being very conservative with my estimates on the upside. I assign a 27% chance that the price of the stock would go to $150 or more. Out of the 27%, I only give a 1% chance that the price will go to 2000. 

If you take all of the prices and assign a probability to each price, you get a weighted average price of $182

Given the current price of $89 that would represent a 104% return. 

To be clear, I am in no way telling WSB to buy GME in order to gain control of the price. I’m just saying, if WSB happens to control it, the upside will be significant if one were to get in at this price, but what do I know. I’m just a monkey, ape, retard, idiot, autist, blah blah blah.

I will start first by saying: I’m new here, but the shit I’ve seen the past few weeks has been mind blowing.

**1.Past Posts and A Few Nitty-Gritty Additions**

Many of you have seen the DD done by u/johnnydaggers   [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/) (you STILL okay bro?), as well as the information on this website: [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) (If you haven’t read this yet fucking do it right now, and read the whole thing.)

Now...I’m a skeptical as fuck autist. I don’t just believe anything at a glance, and a lot of the information contained in the white paper “Counterfeiting Stock 2.0” doesn’t contain many links to the cited supporting documents or specific references...and that troubles the autist half of my brain. So I decided to at least spot check and zoom in on a detail that caught my eye. 

&#x200B;

**ZOOM-- ENHANCE!**

(See: Counterfeiting a Stock 2.0 - Part 6-  Why does this continue to happen?)

* Both houses of the Utah legislature passed a bill that required daily disclosure of fails–to–deliver, including identifying specific companies and the specific broker dealer positions in that company. The bill also outlawed naked shorting of companies domiciled in Utah. The industry threatened litigation based upon federal preemption and backed the state down. The bill was not signed into law.
* In February 2007 the SEC determined that the hedge fund industry did not require any additional regulation — they are virtually unregulated. This may be the height of arrogance.

I searched for the specific bill the author mentioned in Utah. (For those of you who don’t know, you can look up all laws proposed and passed at the local, state, and federal level. They document all of this shit.) Well, I found it and read enough of it to satisfy my semi autistic brain:

[https://le.utah.gov/\~2006S3/bills/sbillenr/SB3004.htm](https://le.utah.gov/~2006S3/bills/sbillenr/SB3004.htm) 

For those of you who are less autistic than I am, here are the most important parts:

Here’s what the authors of the white paper got wrong though, the bill passed almost unanimously and WAS signed into law ([https://le.utah.gov/\~2006s3/status/sbillsta/SB3004.htm](https://le.utah.gov/~2006s3/status/sbillsta/SB3004.htm)). However, it was repealed later. Again, with an overwhelming vote: [https://www.investmentnews.com/utah-votes-to-repeal-fail-to-deliver-law-7720](https://www.investmentnews.com/utah-votes-to-repeal-fail-to-deliver-law-7720) 

It seems they were bullied into doing this by SEC and SIFMA (Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association). This is the first time I’ve heard of this player in the game. They are an advocacy group supporting the rights of the securities industry (lol). They are staffed mostly by big players in the banking and securities industry. They are a “non-profit” with a CEO who is compensated almost $3 million/year. This number is from the CEO in 2012, I can’t for the life of me find any info on salaries after that date so I can only assume that it’s higher now. (info from: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities\_Industry\_and\_Financial\_Markets\_Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_Industry_and_Financial_Markets_Association).)

Look at all of the cool things they are doing: [https://www.sifma.org/resources/archive/news/](https://www.sifma.org/resources/archive/news/) 

&#x200B;

**2.Back to the Self-Incriminating SEC doc**

If you haven’t yet, look at this report below, read the first 3-5 pages at least. It’s an executive summary, published BY SEC, about counterfeiting shares and the roll it played in the financial crisis of 2006-2008. 

[https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf) 

THEY KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING. FUCKING READ THAT REPORT YOU FUCKING RETARDED AUTISTS. IT’S PUBLISHED BY THE SEC AND SUGGESTS THAT WE MIGHT BE BUYING COUNTERFEIT SHARES THAT ARE BEING CONJURED INTO EXISTENCE RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR FACES. 

OUR STRATEGY TO BUY AND HOLD IS PROBABLY THE BEST THING WE CAN DO, BUT WE MIGHT BE PUTTING SOME MONEY BACK IN THOSE FUCKERS POCKETS FOR THEM TO RELOAD. WE (retail investors) MIGHT OWN MORE SHARES THAN ARE EVEN SUPPOSED TO EXIST, NOT COUNTING WHAT OTHER INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER SHAREHOLDERS ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE.   


FUCKING REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

&#x200B;

**3.What does this mean??**

If this is true, and as pervasive in the system as all of this shit suggests. They could be stealing billions, if not fucking TRILLIONS of dollars every year, at everyone else’s expense. When I say everyone, I mean fucking EVERYONE, the entire world economy revolves around the US market. The fraud here creates excess capital in the system that isn’t backed by any real securities, i.e. inflation. Your money is worth less when these fucks start counterfeiting shares.

&#x200B;

Explanation in retarded ape terms:

Let’s say you and your friends have 10 **🍌**. You each paid one **🍗** (tendie) for each **🍌**. Each **🍌** is still worth 1 **🍗** and you can trade it in at any time. (We’ll assume that the value stays constant, doesn’t really matter if the price goes up and down for this example as it obviously would in the stock market). But uh oh! Here comes a **🐍**. He made 5 fake plastic **🍌** and he decides to sell them to you retarded apes. You each pay him about one tendie for each fake **🍌**. Now there is a larger supply of **🍌** than there should be! Let’s say in total that it cost you all 14 **🍗** for all 15 **🍌** (due to the reduction in price caused by the surplus **🍌** in the system). Mr. **🐍** slithers off with 4 **🍗**!!! You and your friends now have 10 real **🍌**, 5 fake **🍌**, and you paid 14 whole **🍗** for them! Silly retarded apes. Oh, and since you and your dumb fuck friends can’t count at all, and/or lose count every 3 days, you have no fucking idea how many total **🍌** there are!

&#x200B;

**4.What Else Can We Do Besides Staring At Tickers and Scrolling Through Memes?**

So what do we do? Well...I think the place to go now is to raise as much hell as we possibly can while we continue to **💎🖐️🖐️💎**. We shouldn't just sit around waiting for the Robinhood hearing. Fucking Feb. 18th?? My thought is that Robinhood might just end up being the fall guy; mostly a distraction from all of the other shit going on. It may have even been legitimately out of RH’s control to some extent. Vlad claimed that their clearing house suddenly demanded $3 billion more from them in collateral, leaving them scrambling. Meanwhile, the HFs are still up to their dirty tricks. 

ALL of the responsible parties need to be investigated and held accountable. This could even include the NYSE itself, DTCC (for either clearing fraudulent transactions or failing to resolve the FTDs), Citadel, Melvin Capital, and SEC. Hopefully this would be done by a committee completely independent from SEC, maybe it would even be the DOJ. If the “counterfeit stock” theory is true, and actually, even if it is just good ol’ fashioned market manipulation, then all of them, at every level are complicit in this. This isn’t an isolated case as others have pointed out.They are all trying to cover their asses here to “protect the integrity of the entire marketplace and the interests of investors.” Translation: fuck with it however they want, in whatever way benefits them and maintain the status quo.

\- First of all, fuck you, that monkey spent a few hours researching and compiling this shit. 

\- Specific details in “Counterfeiting Stock 2.0” verified. Lends a little more credibility to it imo.

\- We \*might\* be fueling some of the HFs ability to keep going in this fight by purchasing their counterfeit shares. But our best option is probably still to **💎🖐️🖐️💎** and buy the dips.

\- Open the floodgates! File Complaints, email your local and national reps, and reeeeee

# Tired of all the GME (🚀🚀🚀) deepthroating recently?

(obligatory fuck you Melvin, fuck you Shittron)

Here's my DD on Cassava Sciences, a biopharmaceutical company developing Sumifilam, a new Alzheimers drug.

**TLDR: CASSAVA Sciences got 68% of its operating costs paid in grants by the NIH in order to fund a groundbreaking Alzheimer's drug that's about to get fast-tracked to market to treat all of our dementia-riddled grandparents. SAVA gets a $286 price target assuming phase 3 success and my autistic math says that gives a $186 current fair value.**

A few days ago, this article got published on Seeking Alpha:

>**4 Reasons Cassava Sciences Could Be The Best-Performing Stock Of 2021**

There’s a lot of good info in this that we don’t have time to get into but I’ll focus in on one key point the author makes:

>**Simufilam is a Shoo-In for Breakthrough Therapy Designation**

Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) means it will be accelerated through phase 3 trials to market *40% faster* than non breakthrough drugs.

If Simufilam gets BTD, this is what will happen to the stock price:

[Immunomedics gets BTD on Trodelvy in 2\/5\/16](https://preview.redd.it/exy4vyadtaf61.png?width=1872&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d70aa788c46f54f29bd51d4027c4eb22fb87f99)

Let’s zoom out a little bit:

[🚀Immunomedics 🚀Acquired 🚀In 🚀$21B 🚀 Deal ](https://preview.redd.it/mplmcot7taf61.png?width=1840&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ef980e1c472c0725134d42201fdc9f7661afd93)

***What are some good indicators Sumifilam will get Breakthrough Therapy Designation?***

According to the FDA:

>A Breakthrough Therapy is a drug:  
>  
>intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and  
>  
>preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development

Sumifilam satisfies both of these requirements and you can bet your autistic ass that our octogenarian politicians are pushing for this type of groundbreaking Alzheimer drug research to receive virtually unlimited funding and a regulatory pass.

Cassava Sciences received government research grants totaled $1.8 million in 2017, $3.0 million in 2018, $4.7 million in 2019, and $3.4 million the first three quarters of 2020. ***$3.4 million.*** That means that the US government paid for **68%** of the operating costs of this company 2020. This is even more indication that Sumifilam will get the green light from the FDA when it comes to BTD.

***What's a reasonable price target on SAVA?***

A quick google search reveals 60-70% success rate on phase 3 trials. If we assume the author of this article is correct about his **$286** price target after successful phase 3 trial, we have to give SAVA a **$186** target based on EV. (Disclaimer: I am in no way qualified to give anything a price target)

If you have any more questions please read the fucking article, it's too long for me to finish.

Whether attributed to more retail investor involvement, stimulus from the government, lack of spending elsewhere, the Fed, etc, some companies are the chosen ones for the high valuations while others don't get the privilege of being among WallStreet's favored.

&#x200B;

For the apes / autists in the group, company valuation is also called the market cap. It's the share price \* outstanding shares (not just float shares).

&#x200B;

GME Market Cap (Valuation) at $300/share assuming the number of outstanding shares is constant, would roughly be $21b ($300 \* 69.75M shares).  The main metric to compare companies valuation justification is the EPS or earnings per share. This is often just called a multiple. That is, if the EPS is $1 for the year, the PE is 300 at a $300/share price.

&#x200B;

Generally, companies within the same industry would have similar PE ratios but it depends if it's been blessed or not by the WallStreet powers.

&#x200B;

According to CIS Market, the average PE ratio for Internet, Mail Order, and Online Shops is 77.13 with the retail sector overall at 47.36. Ulta Beauty Inc (ULTA) which is an in-person salon retail has a wopping 72.42 valuation with an annual consensus of $3.94 EPS. Source: [https://csimarket.com/Industry/Industry\_Valuation.php?s=1300](https://csimarket.com/Industry/Industry_Valuation.php?s=1300).

&#x200B;

Now GME does have some baggage in that it hasn't had a profitable year in 3 years with the pandemic really hurting it. In addition, its debt to assets ratio has been steadily rising since 2017 to as high as 87% as of Q3 2020. But, the turn around has been looking good with it's profit margins as well increasing and the last EPS of -$0.29 was a massive surprise to the estimate of -$0.85. The consensus for the year is -$2.07. But when there is a mass pandemic and people aren't shopping, I would say this is pretty good all things considering.

&#x200B;

🚀🚀🚀🚀Now, given Ryan Cohen's appointment in helping the company make a more digital transformation, the challenge will be capital. Innovation and growth costs. GameStop has a lot of assets though in the form of real estate. If they are able to reduce costs while growing their digital footprint both through game services like Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, or Steam, and eCommerce sales for older nostalgia games, they could very well reach $3-$5 EPS within a couple of years (that is roughly $0.75 - $1.25 per quarter). At a $4 EPS (in between the two), this is only a 75 PE ratio which is not farfetched at all especially inline with the Internet / Online Shops industry as the company reinvents itself. While debt will continue to be a drag on the company in the short-term, I think there is plenty of opportunity for GME to innovate here. 🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

What Wall Street doesn't want you to see is that they've valued and supported bullishly many other companies at high valuations. TSLA P/E ratio is 1,380.65 whereas the current auto industry PE is 20.4. Toyota is 14.86. Even some of Wall Street called TSLA the 4-WTF Chart of the year - [https://wolfstreet.com/2020/12/12/tesla-the-quadruple-wtf-chart-of-the-year-it-should-just-sell-shares-on-autopilot-at-huge-prices-and-exit-sordid-business-of-making-cars/](https://wolfstreet.com/2020/12/12/tesla-the-quadruple-wtf-chart-of-the-year-it-should-just-sell-shares-on-autopilot-at-huge-prices-and-exit-sordid-business-of-making-cars/), but alas all the bears have kinda called it quits on TSLA with short interest at it's all time low. The valuation doesn't scare them with price targets above $1k. The difference? Enough people said f-u WallStreet, we like the company and believe in it so we are going to buy it and hold and don't care what you say and do.

Position Disclosure: 20 $F 11$ calls for 2/5, 6 $IDEX 5$ calls 3/19

There's a fireside chat this Thursday where they lay out their EV strategy but here's why I'm in safe calls

1. Ford outsells NIO and TSLA byyy farrrr!
2. Partnership with Rivian isn't forgotten and a team committed for a futuristic EV design (more people like how the All-Electric Ford F150 looked compared to the Tesla Cybertruck (and won it in a tug-of-war battle recently) 
3. GM is trading at more than 4x the price of F (buying Nikola and faking a EV Hummer video)
4. Back in 2014, the Ford navigation was using $MSFT Cortana's voice for their entertainment / engagement. I'm sure $MSFT wanted to partner with Ford but had to settle something like $GM because it was already talking with $GOOG (which has most chance of creating driverless cars).
5.  Ford unlocked it's CANbus that year and let developers go to town with their apps. For a moment their cars were used by $UBER and some private researchers in their driverless fleet

It's not gonna move to $50 but it definitely has potential to reach $20 imo. The price action is slow so many of the contracts (at the money) are cheap."

lbitv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbitv7/how_and_why_nok_will_reach_the_moon/,How and why NOK will reach the moon?,318,69,2021-02-03 16:06:28,"NOK will colonize the moon and bring 4G to barbaric aliens! NASA selected Nokia exclusively to build the first cellular network on the moon. 

[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/20/talking-on-the-moon-nasa-and-nokia-to-install-4g-on-lunar-surface](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/20/talking-on-the-moon-nasa-and-nokia-to-install-4g-on-lunar-surface)

First, in regards to Nokia’s business. Nokia, unfortunately, doesn’t manufacturer phones anymore. Nokia sold the right to produce Nokia branded phones to HMD Global while retaining the right to have some input. Nokia’s current business concentrates on mobile networks such as 5G, network infrastructures, and cloud services. In other words, Nokia business pertains to the most basic component of our modern civilization. Especially so the Post-COVID world where networking is even more important than before. Think of the Tesla cars. They are connected to AT&T cellular networks which are built by Nokia. Nokia will be leading the networks that would eventually enable automation. And when that happens, Nokia will have a continuous revenue stream. 

[https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g](https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g)

Nokia is leading mobile networks with 27% of the world (excluding China) market share of 4G and 5G. It currently holds more than 3000k patents for 5G. Nokia other major competitors are Ericson, Huawei, and ZTE. Some countries of the Western hemisphere and the G7 banned Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE from operating in their countries. I suspect this will continue in the future. Leaving us with only Nokia and Ericson. But couldn’t a Mega-Cap such as Google or Tesla somehow eliminate NOK and ERIC? NOK holds more than 3000 patents already. So there is a strong barrier of entry into such a business. That won’t happen unless Nokia licences a patent for such a company. In this hypothetical scenario, the Mega-Cap would have to acquire Nokia. Which in turn will raise the price of the stock. I think this is the case that is similar to MSFT under Ballmer’s where the stock price was stagnant for many years. But slowly surged under Nadella. Though given the catalyst of COVID-19, I think the surge will happen quicker with NOK.

At 4.53 a share. NOK P/E ratio is 30.81x. Which is a small discount in comparison with the S&P 500 which has P/E ration of about 39x. This establishes Nokia not only as a growth stock but also as a value stock. The lowest that NOK dropped to was 2.34. Which happened back in March. At the current price, I believe that NOK is well within the margin of safety. 

With that being said, there are some problems that should be addressed. The income trend in the past few years is problematic. But this can offset by the fact that NOK has contracts well into the future with many nations states and private companies that should generate ample income until NOK is able to eliminate Huawei and ZTE and in turn, dominate the market (With Ericson). Also, Nokia is spening billions on research 

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-proximus/nokia-wins-5g-contract-from-proximus-luxembourg-idUSKBN28P0WJ 

The second complication is that Biden or other G7 leaders could potentially reverse Trump’s ousting of Huawei and ZTE. I don’t think this is likely. But it’s certainly a possibility. But even if it happens. Nokia will still have a big market share. And 100% market share of the moon and will always have a priority over Huawei and ZTE for government projects for reasons of national security. Also, there is a substantial amount of money spent on R&D which will I believe will be a catalyst in the future surge in NOK.

It should be worth noting that just one day after RH banned NOK, Blackrock released an amendment to their ownership of NOK. Increasing their shares by  21,140,777 shares. 

Form SC 13G/A Nokia Corp. Published: 2020-02-05 12:16:19

Even though at this point Blackrock owns 5% of practically everything. The increase is a good question. 

Now you might ask me why not Ericson? ERIC is also a good stock. But I see more value in NOK. Also, the fact the NOK is working on 1 Terabit per second internet, and that it will bring 4G to the moon, and the fact that Nokia is #1 by patterns give it an edge in innovative growth. 

Final words: GME to the moon and pigs get slaughtered."

There’s a ton of language in there about “strengthening essential data systems”. There is also an acknowledgment that such task may “require new technology”.

Some relevant language from strategy:

“Directs relevant federal agencies to collect, produce, share, analyze, and collaborate with respect to data supportive of COVID-19 response and recovery efforts.”

“Assist localities that struggle with public health infrastructure challenges that limit effective reporting or managing of COVID-19 data. The federal government will focus on states and localities that continue to struggle with antiquated data systems, especially jurisdictions that have trouble connecting testing laboratories and public health agencies to support case investigation, contact tracing, and support services for isolation of potentially exposed individuals. The federal government will work to surge personnel to assist with manual processes
in the near-term and develop data technologies to automate in the long-term.”

Where is all this new technology coming from? 🤷🏽‍♂️

In comes CLOV:

THE CLOVER ASSISTANT 

You have the exclusive opportunity to use Clover’s technology, the Clover Assistant. The Clover Assistant is designed by doctors for doctors to help enhance patient care and reduce administrative burden. We take advantage of Clover Health’s expansive data platform to deliver actionable and clear information, taking into consideration unique, patient-specific clinical data, needs, and circumstances. With a personalized design that focuses on proactive care, the Clover Assistant synthesizes and analyzes each patient’s information and makes real-time, personalized, dynamic, evidence-based recommendations right at the point of care.


ALSO read around and found that there have been a few bills introduced in congress over the past few months around data and privacy related to health. 

What do I think?

1. Biden = healthcare and he’s looking to score big there. This will be a focal point. You know ThE fIrSt 1o0 dAyS

2. The language in Elizabeth Warren’s bill is super specific about protections on how patient data is stored, anonymized, and shared. Okay... 

3. Pharmacy’s partner up with fed for covid vaccination and the day before clover issued a statement around getting covid vaccines. 


4. Now all of that sounds great. However, why the sudden rush to introduce bills that are clearly addressing a concern around patient’s health data? It raises all sorts if questions for me like:

Who’s collecting this data that you’re so worried about its use and privacy?

Where are these concerns coming from? What is it that we are protecting ourselves from? Is that not weird y’all? Anyway, I guess the point there is that there is clearly some big push to collect and use our patient data by the government (pretty scary imo). Plus you know, google backed Clover. Which leads me to believe, based on the language around new technology in Biden’s initiative, that they are going to have to acquire this technology from somewhere. Where from though? 


Anyway, I’m excited to see how this narrative plays out in the coming weeks and months. Healthcare is a heavy political space, especially under Biden. Based on recent news, something is brewing. Too many coincidences lining up.

""*The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy."" -* ***Sun Tsu - The Art of War***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The above is fitting in so many ways, as are many other famous quotes from a long time ago... We may be in a modernized digital world, but the fundamentals remain the same.

This is a long post, and I apologize but rather than just join the echo chamber, and shout 💎🤲🚀 etc.. Let's take a minute and really assess where we're at and where we've come from. This IS NOT telling ANYONE to 📄🤲 .. Quite the opposite in fact.

As it stands I bought at $325, the night shit really turned pear shaped (on paper) and I watched the initial investment jump up to just short of $500.. I was grinning about it, thinking I'd timed it just right..

Moments later, the market was halted, share buying restricted, prices began to plunge.

And continue to plunge.. day after day.

I have then watched the shit storm unfold between then and now, but I've learnt a BUNCH and become almost addicted to wanting to know more.

&#x200B;

**KNOWLEDGE IS POWER**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We have all heard this a MILLION times in our lives, but it's true. And the more you educate yourself about this current situation, regardless of how it resolves, the more it will help us all in the future. This is just the beginning.

The market will not be the same after this, the SEC investigators, super autistic apes, politicians, billionaires, people from ALL walks of life, and levels of varying smooth brains will look further into this and explain clearly how it all went down. Lap the knowledge up. It will help you in the future as part of WSB or solo.. it **WILL** help.

I mean fuck. Netflix is already making a movie. People will be talking about this for a long time yet as the trade that changed how Wall Street does business. (I agree with all the others too.. give them a happy ending! 💎🤲)

What I'm getting at is this kind of fuckery with the ladder attacks, the blatant FUD campaigns on the media, the bots, the busted brokers, trolls and everything else that has been thrown against you is you learned.

You learned what Wall Street is capable of, what they will stoop to, what to expect next time, how they are doing this, the tactics they use.. And just for a second, place yourself in their shoes.

The big guys have the lifestyle that many of you can only dream about, and if you have that.. you will do \*ANYTHING\* to protect it. The rich don't get rich by being charitable, and sharing their wealth freely with the smaller guys. They get rich by TAKING, USING, and ABUSING and employing any tactic they can to their advantage to achieve their end goal of financial domination.

&#x200B;

**We're different.**

&#x200B;

For the first time, in the history of the internet we  have come together - People say it could have been any company.. But think about this:

GameStop (EB Games for us Aussies) is a place where you STILL go, regardless of Steam, Epic (yuck), GOG, and all the other online retailers..

GameStop shutting its doors, would be similar to when the old arcades (Time Zone excluded..) shut their doors, and became a thing of the past.

How many times have you walked through a shopping center and stopped in to your local GameStop or EB Games and browsed for a gift for a loved one, a quirky new shirt, the pre-owned console games, D&D stuff.. The list goes on.

**GameStop is still relevant** \- And by the luck of the gaming gods **$GME** was the share that the big brains ( Yes, people like /r/deepfuckingvalue ) spotted and deemed to be a good investment.

&#x200B;

Now, think further along - If the stocks were something mundane... like **Gourds** (Fuck off copy pasta bots.. you're mildly annoying and none of us care. We enjoy clicking the 💩 reactions on your repetitive, shitposts)

Do you think the online community would have rallied and banded together internationally to support it? Fuck no.

This is a magical, rare, fucking unicorn of a stock. It's circumstances, and nature of the company tied into a neat little package for us to love and hold.. (forever 💎🤲)

We are gamers, we are tech savvy, we have the ability to open broker accounts online without any previous experience, we know how to research more than just using Google, we are the perfect audience to start a global movement. Which we have done.

So when the whispers of WSB began, and word slowly began to spread around the interwebs, you guys heard it. You took the time to investigate.. and shit post a lot.. and come up with almost a whole new sub culture lingo to go with it (Okay, maybe WSB had that for a long time before the new arrivals.. but we love it)

The point is, you spent time, learned and I implore you to keep learning until that smooth brain.. isn't so smooth.

# We are the perfect demographic and GME is the perfect stock for us and those two factors have lead us to a point where the entire world, gamers or not have become involved. This. Is. Huge.

Right now there is a lot going in our favour - **Do not judge this epic event by the share price alone.**

*Initially I wanted to post pics, graphs, explanations about everything you can readily find online so you would be educated, so you would know that this isn't over yet, far from it in fact. But, the more I look around, the more I see people who just need a nudge to investigate things themselves.*

&#x200B;

**REMEMBER: KNOWLEDGE IS POWER**

&#x200B;

Due Diligence is needed. Invest only what you can afford or risk. No-one can tell you specifically what is best for you so RESEARCH that smooth brain.

&#x200B;

💎🤲 until the end. I just like this stock.

*Redefining gaming, eSports, and streaming*

Company Overview

Corsair Gaming is an American computer hardware and peripherals company founded in 1994 and headquartered in California.

They acquired Elgato Gaming in 2018 to expand to the streaming gear market, Origin PC and SCUF gaming in 2019 to expand into the custom-built PC systems and console controllers markets, respectively, and during 2020 they acquired Gamer Sensei and EpocCam, and partnered with Pipeline to grow into the gaming and streaming coaching market.

Corsair went public on September 23, 2020, with its IPO priced at $17, valuing the company at about $1.3B.

Understanding the Business

**Value Proposition**

Corsair provides specialized, high-performance gear for gamers and streamers. Their products are designed to provide speed and reliability for competitive gaming, high quality content for streamers, and powerful PC components that allows gamers to run modern games smoothly.

**Revenue Streams**

Currently, Corsair groups its product offering into two segments: gamer and creator peripherals and gaming components and systems.

Gamer and Creator Peripherals:

which represents around 25% of net revenue, includes gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets, streaming gear, and high performance console controllers.

Gaming Components Systems:

which represents around 75% of net revenue includes computer cases, power supply units (PSU), high performance memory products (40% of net revenue), and custom-built gaming systems.

Acquisitions and Partnerships:

During 3Q 2020 Corsair acquired Gamer Sensei, a gaming coaching platform, EpocCam, an app that allows iPhones to serve as a webcam, and partnered with Pipeline, a course-based education platform for streamers.

Industry

**Market Size**

According to Jon Peddie Research, the global gaming and streaming gear markets is expected to reach $40B by the end of 2020. Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1.05% CAGR until 2022. However, during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10% year-over-year.

Additionally, DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video-game coaching market surpasses $1B.

**Industry Fundamentals**

Growth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals.

Popularity of gaming is increasing:

According to Newzoo, there are an estimated 2.7B gamers worldwide, which are expected to spend $159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.3% CAGR to exceed $200B by 2023. PC and console gaming represents 51% of the total market, and mobile gaming 49%. Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market.

Tech-driven improvements in game quality:

Advances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences. This in turn, places increased demand on high-performance computing hardware.

Increasing gaming and streaming engagement:

Some interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks’ State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include:

* On average, video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games
* More than 38% of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves
* Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming, missed sleep is the most pervasive
* Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18-25 year olds.

**The eSports and streaming flywheel**

The rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers, sponsors, advertisers, team owners, and leagues to the eSports industry. Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high-performance gameplay, which in turn brings more viewers.

Competitive Landscape & Risks

**Competition**

The gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition, constant price pressure and rapid change. Competition across Corsair’s product offering includes:

**Gaming keyboards and mice** \- Logitech and Razer

**Headsets and related audio products** \-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX

**Streaming gear** \- Logitech and AVerMedia

**Performance controllers** \- Microsoft and Logitech

**PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases** \- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake

**High performance memory** \- G.Skill, HyperX, and Micron

**Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs** \- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower

**Competitive Strategy**

The company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.

**Market Share**

According to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.

**Growth Strategy**

Move into the Asia Pacific region:

The Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.

Complimentary acquisitions:

Corsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.

New Markets:

Uses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.

**Threat of New Entrants**

Because of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).

**Threat of Substitution**

A significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair’s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.

Cloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user’s system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.

According to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.

Additionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.

**Moats**

There does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair’s market share across their product offering.

**Other Relevant Risks**

Due to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.

I'll start by explaining the difference between Box Office sales vs Streaming.  Streaming is like DVD sales, where the production company must sign over rights to the movie to the service which eliminates any chance at residuals such as Box Office sales which is where a majority of their profit lies.  My theory is that this is why we've only very few ""good"" movies recently, most of the production companies are sitting on their canned file waiting for COVID to be over.

Why I think AMC dropped the ball...  AMC, like other movie theaters already have agreements in place to share ""Box Office"" proceeds with the production companies.  I'm not sure why they wouldn't get creative and offer this same model up during COVID and get a leg up on their competition (Amazon, Google, etc...).  My guess, the same reason that I had to spend an hour doing DD just to find out that the only reason I could see them being viable into the future, they ALREADY had a product for and just don't do anything with.  Their leadership is completely incompetent and the company was being shorted into bankruptcy for a reason.

AVOID AMC like the fucking plague stock that it is..."

lb6xay,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb6xay/bad_new_for_robinhood_the_bleeding_edge/,BAD NEW FOR ROBINHOOD- THE BLEEDING EDGE,1,0,2021-02-03 05:27:14,"Dear Reader,

The wandering, merry, swashbuckling, and now nefarious exploits of Robinhood – aka “Robbing the Neighborhood” – have now achieved legendary status.

Announced last night, the online broker suddenly raised an additional $2.4 billion from its shareholders. This comes on the back of an additional $1 billion raise and just after Robinhood maxed out its lines of credit to stave off a liquidity crisis.

Prior to getting its hand caught in the cookie jar, Robinhood had raised about $2.1 billion from its founding in 2013 until its Series G round last September.

And in the last five days, it has raised $3.4 billion – not counting the nine-figure sum of debt it pulled from its lines of credit.

Investors had a hard choice to make. They could let the crisis occur and see where the chips fell… or they could go all hands on deck and throw money at the problem.

At $3.4 billion, we know what their decision was. And I suspect they invested once again at very attractive terms. After all, they held all the cards.
Rightfully so, Robinhood’s users have been fleeing the online stock trading platform in droves. And they have been vocal about it.
Nearly 100,000 one-star ratings for the Robinhood app appeared in the Google Play store in the hours following Robinhood’s shenanigans last week.

This quickly resulted in the feared one-star rating for the app. It’s not surprising considering that Robinhood’s users were hoodwinked out of more than $1 billion in profits.

Google began to systematically remove negative reviews of Robinhood. 
And suddenly, as if nothing happened at all, Robinhood was back at a four-star rating on the Google Play store.

Since then, thousands more negative reviews have pushed down the rating again. Of course, those reviews could easily be removed just as the previous ones were.

It sounds insane… but not when we think about who is involved.

Some of the most powerful venture capital firms in Silicon Valley are backers of Robinhood. Two of them, Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins, were also early investors in Google.

But the Robinhood backer that really makes me chuckle is CapitalG – formerly known as Google Capital.

Google’s private equity arm invested in Robinhood’s Series D round. And GV (aka Google Ventures) invested in Robinhood’s first two seed rounds back in 2013.

In short, Google has a heavily vested financial interest in Robinhood’s success. By my calculations, Google’s total stake in Robinhood will be worth more than $1 billion on a successful initial public offering (IPO).

That brings us to Robinhood’s public offering. Talk about bad timing.

Robinhood had been planning to launch an IPO this spring. The moment was seemingly perfect: great equity market conditions… professionals working at home with more time to spend online… a rapid rise in Robinhood users, rivaling the best online brokerages… and a fantastic IPO market.

All these factors made an IPO a perfectly logical thing to do. Robinhood couldn’t have asked for a better setup.

But now Robinhood will be forced to access the public markets… and not on its own terms.

Its largest investors had little choice but to pony up $3.4 billion to help Robinhood avoid a liquidity crisis, potentially risking billions in investment profits.

But it will come at a price. Those shareholders will insist on an IPO in the coming months to ensure that they get their money back quickly.

I wouldn’t be surprised if the timing for the IPO is written into the deal terms of the emergency raise. That essentially guarantees a liquidity event in the very near future.

My prediction? Robinhood and its backers will try to dump shares on unsuspecting retail investors at an inflated valuation. They’ll take billions in profits off the table and call it a day.

I won’t be one of them.
Can Robinhood repair the damage that it has done to its brand and reputation? In time and with the right changes, yes.
But I see a bigger opportunity. The doors are wide open for the next accessible, mobile-first trading platform – one that provides transparency in its business model and has the financial wherewithal to avoid a liquidity crisis.

This could be another high-growth private company building a new platform. Or it may be from a company already in our midst like Square’s Cash App.

Either way, we’ll only invest in bleeding-edge technology companies that take great care of their customers. And we’ll avoid those that kick their customers down a dark alley where nothing good ever happens."

Part of the vision of GME's future is their takeover of the esports industry. It could be a lounge for casual/competetive gaming, a training studio, and of course, a retail giant for all kinds of games, collectibles?, and PC's. What do you need for this? Space. Dave & Buster's already has the infrastructure - hell, they've already done 3/4 of the work for you. All GME has to do is some light renovations/remodeling, add/remove games, and change the signs (what kind of name is ""Dave & Buster's"" anyway?). Gamestop....I mean D&B... also has food/drink, areas for the kiddos to play, and is a spot to go watch live events (MMA/Boxing, Superbowl, etc). More revenue streams for GME.

&#x200B;

PLAY's market cap is currently 1.62B. There are 140 locations (89 currently open from a quick google search). The others are currently shut down due to Covid, so it would be a perfect time to start renovation on those. Many of these locations are in Malls (can't find the exact number). Malls may seem like they are dying, and many of the stores in them are. I believe malls are here to stay, but they won't exist as the retail experience we remember from our childhood. Many malls are still thriving, and those that are have adapted to become experiential social zones, with retail as an added bonus.

I hate to say it, but I think the jig is up and I'll show you my reasoning. In this document:

1. Melvin was telling the truth about covering their entire short position last week (.
2. Why the GME chart doesn't match the VW chart
3. If all the shorts have covered, then why are there no shares available to short?

# 1. Melvin Capital DID close their shorts last Monday

[Melvin Capital announced last Tuesday they closed their short positions](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/hedge-fund-targeted-by-reddit-board-melvin-capital-closed-out-of-gamestop-short-position-tuesday.html). There is more than enough evidence they accomplished this last Monday.

First, check out GME price action and volume last Monday (1/25). I want you to pay close attention to the period between 10am and 11am.

[GME price action and volume on 1\/25](https://preview.redd.it/vn98pna6p3f61.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=73b9000a233bd0a522fa6d25c68ea4025bbecc92)

Now take a [Look at Melvin Capital's last reported holdings](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link). From what I can tell, it looks like Melvin liquidated a percentage of their positions across the board. I chose to sort this chart by % Ownership with the thinking that selling a stock for which you have high ownership is sort of a reverse squeeze (you create a large amount of float in comparison).

For their top owned holding (8.7% of shares owned)  **L Brands** (ticker LB), notice the price action on 1/25. They liquidated their holdings from \~10am-11am, which coincides directly with the jump in GME price.

[LB Brands price and volume action on 1\/25](https://preview.redd.it/e99gwq6io3f61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e3b9f78b6892dfadf936a087398917f9d1865e0)

Furthermore, we can get a very rough estimate at how much Melvin raised to cover their GME shorts. From [Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/LB:NYSE) we can see LB volume on 1/25 was 17M shares. If we look across the previous 4 Mondays, the average volume on a Monday is <3M shares. It's likely that when Melvin offloaded their shares, they caused stop losses to trigger and unintentionally caused others to sell their shares, but if we assume Melvin raised the cash from all the sales, they made \~$200M from LB sales alone.

Here's another holding (7.2% Ownership) American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) with the same price and volume action. The volume on 1/25 was 13M vs 3-5M for previous Mondays. Using the same napkin math as above, we get \~$200M netted above average volume.

Extrapolating this across their 119 holdings they could easily have raised the capital required to close at least most of their GME position. Although there is no data on their short position, assuming it was 10x their reported position in GME puts (50M), they could have easily covered the position in trading volume that day (178M)

[American Eagle Outfitters price and volume action for 1\/25](https://preview.redd.it/h75olhmgr3f61.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=0390813919218e2cd528b6737df9bf576f00a22f)

Although I checked for quite a few of their holdings and saw the same pattern, I'm a retard when it comes to making these graphs and I'll leave it as an exercise to further validate.

# 2. Why isn't GME going to rebound like VW?

Most of you have likely seen the below graph used to describe the VW squeeze in 2008. One of the most notable parts about the graph is the massive drop in VW price right before the squeeze - why did that happen?

[Volkswagen AG share price during 2008 short squeeze](https://preview.redd.it/kgnshh3os3f61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdfcad33bff94490b2b0301e13befa602b854673)

[This is a great article I found gives a mostly objective view on the VW short squeeze](https://www.ft.com/content/0a58b63a-4294-3e07-8390-c3aabef39a26) and I think /u/notasabretooth gives a good explanation [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l624yc/why_did_vw_dip_before_the_big_squeeze_in_08/gkxu360?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) The great financial crisis crashed markets globally and VW followed suite - in fact, when VW stock began to fall, short sellers doubled down on their bets as VW was not in great financial shape which caused the very noticeable down spike in the graph above. Porsche had other plans, however, and announced to the world that it had stealthily accumulated shares and now \~90% of VW stock was out of circulation. This caused the sharp uptick and I would point out that there are no further rebounds following the initial squeeze.

Although GME still has many shorts, many of these shorts are likely not the ones that started before the squeeze and instead sold near the top with a much better cost basis. In fact, one of my subscribed newsletters sent out the below sage advice 4 days ago - and if I was smarter I would have listened :)

>""GME is one of the greatest shorts of all time. If you can get the borrow… short it he told me. ""

# 3. If all the major shorts have covered, then why are there no shares available to short?

This was another thing that had not been sitting well with me. If there are no shares available to short sell, then how has the number of shorts decreased? 

First, touching on above - the current short sellers likely have a much higher cost basis and are unlikely to be squeezed like those caught in the initial squeeze. 

Second, it's not clear how shares are made available for borrowing. I found [this very informative article](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investor-education/can-my-broker-lend-out-my-shares-to-short-sellers-without-asking/article32393872/) which gives the meaningful lines of text

>If you want to short sell a stock, your broker needs to call his or her firm's loan desk to see if the shares are available for lending... If the firm does not own it in their own portfolio they have to attempt to borrow the stock from other firms.  As a client of a firm, **your shares cannot be lent out to someone who is looking to short sell**. Shares are held in trust for each client and are kept on separate books. 

If this is true, then the GME squeeze was likely a victim of its own success. By retail investors buying all the stocks, we prevented a continuous short squeeze by evaporating the supply of shortable shares."

They're not the same.",341,40,2021-02-03 00:58:34,"The media has been covering WSB absolutely atrociously. WSB stocks have been rising and falling together for days now, even though they are very different stocks that people are in for very different reasons. This has the potential to create some bargains. I wanted to do a quick rundown for those who are unclear on why. The stocks I'm going to cover are GME, AMC, BB, NOK, and I'll touch on SLV (and why it's not a WSB stock)

**GME: The squeezening**

GME was trading at $4 a share 6 months ago. People on Wall Street were treating it like it would be the next Blockbuster. The fear was the people would buy their video games online and make the company obsolete. Hedge funds started heavily shorting it, expecting it to go bankrupt within a few years. Even if it was, 138% short interest is insane. They were asking for a squeeze. 

Also Gamestop is not that much worse positioned than any other brick and mortar retailer. The pandemic cost them in the short term, but they can survive. Is Macy's going out of business because of online shopping? Maybe eventually, but for now they're trudging along. Gamestop even has some advantages over other retailers, in that they can buy used games for pennies on the dollar and resell them for dimes on the dollar. If you do that with clothes you're a goodwill. In other words: **we like the stock**

There was really good news concerning vaccination, so the pandemic sell-off started reversing. As the stock price came back to pre-pandemic levels, Ryan Cohen joined the board (previous CEO of Chewy) there was hope for the future trajectory of the company. This absolutely screwed the short sellers, leading to the short squeeze. Gamestop has become a short squeeze play. It's speculative right now. It won't be worth $500 a year from now, and no one believes that. But it also won't be worth $4 a year from now. 

**AMC: GME's little brother**

AMC has a similar story to GME, except less hope. The cinema industry has been decimated by the pandemic, but that doesn't mean that the company is closing imminently. The company became undervalued, and with hope that the pandemic was coming to a close, the price started coming back to pre-pandemic levels. Short sellers got caught with their pants down. They got squoze, and lost a ton of money.

AMC is different that GME in that cinema's were having huge problems even before the pandemic. Also unlike GME, there is no e-business guru joining AMC's board. I think GME has hope long term, whereas I am much more skeptical for AMC. The short squeeze means that the stock will have crazy volatility in the short term, but long term I'm not sure where it ends up.

**BB: Not GME**

Blackberry is known for making cell phones for boomers, but they have shifted dramatically. At this point, Blackberry is a cybersecurity company:

https://marker.medium.com/how-blackberry-yes-that-blackberry-became-a-cybersecurity-company-efae02912751

BB is also interesting because they are really involved in the cybersecurity of self driving car technology:

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackberry-software/blackberry-launches-cybersecurity-software-for-self-driving-cars-idUSKBN1F42LX

And with the solar winds hack, they were listed as a possible beneficiary. 

Blackberry has a partnership with Amazon, and has partnerships in China as well. BB is nothing like GME or AMC. It's a medium risk high reward stock that could hit $100 within 5 years or could do nothing. 

**NOK: Definitely not GME**

NOK is similar to BB in that people think of them for their phones, but they... don't do that anymore. NOK is a 5G company now. They have 2 major competitors in Europe, Ericsson and Huawei. Yes, that Huawei. The one that no one trusts because they are probably selling your data to China. It is likely that Huawei gets regulated out of Europe, which is a gift to Nokia. The company has partnerships with T-Mobile and Google:

https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/nokia-nok-secures-key-deals-145002461.html

Nokia is a low risk medium reward type of stock. It's trading at around $4.50 right now. I would be surprised if it didn't hit $5.50 by EOY. But I would be just as surprised if it hit $9. They look to be giving out a consistent dividend, which might bring some big pension accounts on board. 

**SLV: Not a WSB stock**

I think I saw 1 post on SLV here, and suddenly it is a WSB stock in the media. Someone posts here about SLV every once in a while, talking about silver to gold ratios or some shit. SLV is a scam. SLV does not create value. It's a commodity. Institutional investors are all over it. There's no law that says it has to have some ratio to gold. Literally the first law of the stock market is that past performance does not determine future results. 

Notice how SLV is the only stock out of all the ""WSB stocks"" that is not trending together. GME, BB, NOK, and AMC are wedded to each other even though they are obviously very different. SLV does it's own shit. I really think this SLV thing was just a way for some hedge fund to cover some sneaking shit they were pulling.

**ALL THAT SAID**

If GME or AMC crashes after the squeeze and that leads all the other ""WSB stocks"" to crash, BB and NOK present huge opportunities. I personally am going all in on NOK if it goes under $4 a share. 

**TL;DR**: GME and AMC are short term, high risk, high reward short squeeze plays. BB is a longer term, medium risk, high reward play. NOK is a longer term, low risk, medium reward play. FUCK SLV."

What happens if everyone holds and no buying occurs? **They can drive the price down as much as they damn well feel like, causing more and more people to sell in the hysteria.** 

There are so few shares out there that could even remotely begin to cover their damn positions with (remember, they shorted over 100% of shares before this whole run up) meaning they HAVE to cover their asses eventually and the ladder attacks cannot go on as long as we BUY to REDUCE their efficacy and HOLD to force the demand upwards and reverse this momentum they are creating. 

**WE ARE NOT GUARANTEED A SHORT SQUEEZE**

We need to make that happen ourselves. Right now, we are at the precipice of the squeeze. Either it happens, by us buying whats left (NOT ON RH, OR OTHER RESTRICTED PLATFORMS) or we hold like the real retards while these rich fucks laugh their asses off and double down their short positions to do what they have inevitably been doing this whole damn time, which is making money on the way down.

A certain 5G stock #knockknock has been getting hype for a few weeks now and it has REASONABLY been ignored because we support our brothers fighting the good GME fight.

NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT

everyone keeps complaining about how high of a float this stock is. 

I GUARANTEE you that is not an issue. The publicity that this got this week was unprecedented. We bought so much that these fucks are restricting us from buying a leading 5g stock that has been around since 1865. My broker told me I had to cancel my sell order because it was stuck in citadels order book. What the FUCK does that mean? We are being suppressed for a reason. HEDGE FUNDS LIKE THE STOCK

And guess what motherfuckers!? I LIKE THE GOD DAMN STOCK TOO!

Price target $50+:

1. Most essential 5G patents in the world
2. Fastest 5G speeds recorded
3. Controls over 27% of the 4/5G market
4. First company contracted to set up internet on the moon (NASA)
5. Will receive MULTI-BILLION dollar settlements from ongoing litigations with Mercedes Benz and Lenovo
6. Technology provider and main collaborator of the National Security Center of Excellence 5G Cybersecurity Project (Federal 5G project)
7. Selected to be the main collaborator of the Hexa 6G European Union Project
8. Has pending Department of Defense contracts yet to awarded
9. Just sealed a contract with TMOBILE for US 5G roll out.
10. Has and will take market share from Huawei, already has secured multi-year deals with important Chinese companies
11. Blackrock increased their position to 333,000,000 shares during 2020, an increase of 21 million shares held from the year before (7% increase)
12. May also be getting back into the phone business as they are manufacturing phones in India
13. Vanguard Capital owns 160,000,000 shares and is continuously buying

Okay fellow retards,

loooong time lurker and europoor autist. So excuse my spelling. Let’s brake some things down:

SILVER:

It’s   a real well played scheme on this. You have to remember there is a   dragon in the east, where people have a historically deep bonding to   silver. And the dragon looooves to take a gamble. So, number one   priority for Melvin and hedge fund friends is to distract the dragon   from GME with shiny silver. Imagine HFs did not throatfuck GME on   Thursday and the dragon banged into the marked, heavy. This uprising of   the dragon is exactly what this autist observed by comments on wsb late   Wednesday, early Thursday. If HFs didn’t screw the market exactly this   moment and pulled some silver shiny stuff out of their pockets, they   would have already been toast.

Besides   that, try to find silver shorts/put options for a reasonable   spread/price which are also available to buy. I tried the whole day   yesterday but at least at my europoor broker I couldn’t find a single   one. What tells you that? Looks like **smart money is not buying the silver rush**.

&#x200B;

ANTI GME  BOTS:

These guys are getting their **bots more and more angry and aggressive**   over the last 24h. But why would they still take the effort, if they  already hit their targets? All this shows to my retarded autist smooth   brain is that they are in deep fear! Hey, bot guys I just want to quote   one of your clients: “What's your beef with me. I'm just trying to make  a  living just like you” ...I hope you guys got payed in advance,  because  your clients will likely go out of business!

Anyways... just to repeat **the obvious: They try to create fear among you retards** and make your diamond hands become weak ass toilet paper!

To   close this part I just want to quote some famous investor from Omaha:   (Be) “fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are   fearful.” I’m an autist, I don’t feel fearful at all. I simply can’t…   But for some reason the bot guys are. They seem fearful as fuck to me.

&#x200B;

SHORT INTEREST RATIOS:

So I hope most of you guys realized, they simply changed the formula to calculate **SI rates**. It’s basically **still \~120%**.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read\_this\_they\_are\_screwed\_numbers\_dont\_lie/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/)

In science you would say they normalized the standardization:

You   take your observed value also into account and add it to your base   value. Eventually your maximum number can only be <=1 or in other   terms <=100%, In this specific case you take your number of shorted   stocks and add them to the float as a base value. Then you divide your   number of shorted stocks by the base value (including shorted stocks)   which can only be smaller then 1 or 100% in respective. ...inflate the   base to make things look completely different… Anyways my smooth brain   is able to convert the equation to the old standard (shorts/float) which   is based on S3s latest 55% short interest rate (Just to make it easy  for your autist brains):

shorts/(shorts   + float) = 0.55 → 0.45/0.55 shorts = float  -> 0.81 shorts = float   →  shorts = 1/0.81 float = 1.23 float or 123% of float.

[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448)

...in   addition you have to keep in mind, big players always have taken fines   and trials into consideration as costs. I don’t know what the fines  for  misinformation regarding number of shorted stocks are, but if you  are  scared to death you should:

First   of all, not show it to your retarded smooth brained enemies by   recruiting bot armies, obviously lying, silver bullshit, other FUD,   ...you name it.

AND you are   willing to take any risk to survive. ...or fines   ...in this kind of   situation probably any kind of fines no matter what.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But  why would they do this? Whats their business with the Hfs? You ask  yourself? You guys are threatening soooo many business models in   finance. And this is the real **game changer**!

Keep   in mind: On stock markets you mainly trade the future. You have to  make  scenarios for the upcoming future. And there is a horrifying  scenario  for boomer financial services arising at the horizon. But  first let’s  bring it to the crucial point first:

Look for **information asymmetries**,   google it or whatever… That’s what it’s all about in the end. That’s   the main reason why big players make shit tons of money from small   players. It’s all about information sovereignty. Or the information   monopoly… however you call it. The one who is (quicker) capable to   gather more accurate information and hide it from others, wins. Like   buying your investment decisions and order limits from RobinHood.   Sometimes it’s even enough to convince your enemy that you are in   possession of better information. (By the way, this fight about   information sovereignty is exactly what you can observe right now. HFs   try to convince you retards that they have better and more accurate   information about the whole situation.)

So, lets come back to the bullet point:

Imagine   a huge crowd of people on social platforms gathering more and more   accurate information and take investment decisions on that. Because of   declining information asymmetries constantly draining money out of it.   This will drastically change the current state of the market in means of   clients to financial service provider relations. Making it a more   liberated, fairer market in some kind. ...the whole industry would lose   trillions in the future. So yeah, you guys did it. You scared a big   chunk of the whole financial sector.  Not with GME in particular but with this way of investing.   Therefore from the financial industries point of view this transition  process MUST be stopped and delayed at any cost. This is literally the  clusterfuck for boomer financial services! And the worldwide media and   wsb are the battlegrounds right now.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But   hey, I’m just a short minded, stock loving retard, having a lot of fun  on this! GME to the moon! Planing to buy some dips today because I’m  way  to autistic to feel anxious about ridiculous 100 stocks short  ladder  ping pong.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR: GME, trillions, to the moon!"

It's Only Just Begun.,116,8,2021-02-02 22:22:42,"Been watching the whole Gamestop thing unfold since November on WallstreetBets (WSB) and holding some shares since $40. WSB has grown from 2 million members last Monday to 8 million just a week later, and they have revealed an amount of corruption in the open market more than I could have previously believed. I'm proud of the major newspapers reporting most of the event accurately so far, while all the major TV stations (CNBC, CNN, Fox, etc.) are blatantly lying and saying WallStreetBets has moved on to invest in Silver. They've given up on trying to say Gamestop is a lost cause because that just put fuel on the fire. Now they are trying the tried and true method of ""divide and conquer"".   

The financial system doesn't seem to realize how many young investors they have pissed off. They haven't reported on are all the people who used their Gamestop winnings to buy video games and consoles to donate to children's hospitals, or the billboards across the country this week in Hartford, NY, Boston, Denver, and even in front of the NY Stock exchange itself showing something similar to ""WE'RE NOT LEAVING, GAMESTOP TO THE MOON"".   

Today, STAKE, a broker in Australia akin to Robinhood (RH) is now preventing people from buying the stock after it has dropped about 60% in one day. They let you buy it when it was worth $300 and $400, but not at $150. Seems fair right? The google store removed an inflow of thousands if not millions of negative reviews from the RH app when RH prevented buying. Facebook has deleted groups talking about the stock and actually protected groups talking about the fake silver investment. Not that Apple is a saint but they actually allowed all the negative reviews and now \~1/3 of the RH reviews are 1/5 stars. 

I'm happy that when many brokers in the US shutdown buying the stock last week that people from Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia, etc. posted their portfolios--posted that they were here to support Americans and buy when we were prevented from buying. The media sells the ideas of republican vs democrat, gay vs. straight, Christian vs. Jew, native vs. foreigner, male vs. female, black vs. white. These are all to distract you from what the real battle has always been and always will be: the poor vs. the rich. Not the rich that may deserve to be rich--the rich that have made their money off scamming, stealing, and rigging a system that influences the entire planet.

We caught them with their pants down shorting a stock 140%. How do you sell 140% of something you don't even own? The media says the short squeeze is over. They said it was over a month ago on CNBC when Gamestop was worth $20 (a 100% increase in a week). Then they said it was over when it spiked up to $40. Again when it hit $150. Its not over. Its only just begun because there is no way for them to buy back 140% of a stock when we are proudly holding a decent percentage of it and refuse to sell. These Wallstreet firms will either change the rules of the game or go bankrupt. Either way stay tuned for more news when it spikes up again later this month."

I'm just trying to make a  living just like you” ...I hope you guys got payed in advance, because  your clients will likely go out of busyness!

Anyways... just to repeat **the obvious: They try to create fear among you retards** and make your diamond hands become weak ass toilet paper!

To  close this part I just want to quote some famous investor from Omaha:  (Be) “fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are  fearful.” I’m an autist, I don’t feel fearful at all. I simply can’t…  But for some reason the bot guys are. They seem fearful as fuck to me.

SHORT INTEREST RATIOS:

So I hope most of you guys realized, they simply changed the formula to calculate **SI rates**. It’s basically **still \~120%**.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read\_this\_they\_are\_screwed\_numbers\_dont\_lie/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/)

In science you would say they normalized the standardization:

You  take your observed value also into account and add it to your base  value. Eventually your maximum number can only be <=1 or in other  terms <=100%, In this specific case you take your number of shorted  stocks and add them to the float as a base value. Then you divide your  number of shorted stocks by the base value (including shorted stocks)  which can only be smaller then 1 or 100% in respective. ...inflate the  base to make things look completely different… Anyways my smooth brain  is able to convert the equation to the old standard (shorts/float) which  is based on S3s latest 55% short interest rate (Just to make it easy  for your autist brains):

shorts/(shorts  + float) = 0.55 → 0.45/0.55 shorts = float  -> 0.81 shorts = float  →  shorts = 1/0.81 float = 1.23 float or 123% of float.

...in  addition you have to keep in mind, big players always have taken fines  and trials into consideration as costs. I don’t know what the fines for  misinformation regarding number of shorted stocks are, but if you are  scared to death you should:

First  of all, not show it to your retarded smooth brained enemies by  recruiting bot armies, obviously lying, silver bullshit, other FUD,  ...you name it.

AND you are  willing to take any risk to survive. ...or fines   ...in this kind of  situation probably any kind of fines no matter what.

But  why would they do this? Whats their business with the Hfs? You ask  yourself? You guys are threatening soooo many business models in  finance. And this is the real **game changer**!

Keep  in mind: On stock markets you mainly trade the future. You have to make  scenarios for the upcoming future. And there is a horrifying scenario  for boomer financial services arising at the horizon. But first let’s  bring it to the crucial point first:

Look for **information asymmetries**,  google it or whatever… That’s what it’s all about in the end. That’s  the main reason why big players make shit tons of money from small  players. It’s all about information sovereignty. Or the information  monopoly… however you call it. The one who is (quicker) capable to  gather more accurate information and hide it from others, wins. Like  buying your investment decisions and order limits from RobinHood.  Sometimes it’s even enough to convince your enemy that you are in  possession of better information. (By the way, this fight about  information sovereignty is exactly what you can observe right now. HFs  try to convince you retards that they have better and more accurate  information about the whole situation.)

So, lets come back to the bullet point:

Imagine  a huge crowd of people on social platforms gathering more and more  accurate information and take investment decisions on that. Because of  declining information asymmetries constantly draining money out of it.  This will drastically change the current state of the market in means of  clients to financial service provider relations. Making it a more  liberated, fairer market in some kind. ...the whole industry would lose  trillions in the future. So yeah, you guys did it. You scared a big  chunk of the whole financial sector. And I simply love you retards for  doing this!!! Not with GME in particular but with this way of investing.  Therefore from the financial industries point of view this transition  process MUST be stopped and delayed at any cost. This is literally the  clusterfuck for boomer financial services! And the worldwide media and  wsb are the battlegrounds right now.

But  hey I’m just a short minded, stock loving retard, having a lot of fun  on this! GME to the moon! Planing to buy some dips today because I’m way  to autistic to feel anxious about ridiculous 100 stocks short ladder  ping pong.

TL;DR: GME, trillions, to the moon!"

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/02/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-2-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow looks for back-to-back gains after last week’s decline

> * The Dow is set to rise over 200 points at Tuesday’s open, looking for a second day of gains after last week’s nearly 3.3% decline. The 30-stock average Monday clawed back 229 points of Friday’s 620 point drop as Wall Street appeared to shake off concerns about the speculative retail trading mania that largely drove the market’s worst weekly sell-off since October.
With gains Monday, the Dow and S&P 500 were once again positive for 2021, joining the Nasdaq. However, the three stock benchmarks remained below last month’s record closing highs, with the Dow over 3% away and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each about 2% away. Google-parent Alphabet and Amazon are set to report quarterly earnings after Tuesday’s closing bell.

*****

> # 2. GameStop’s decline accelerates as Robinhood raises more money

> * GameStop continued to lose ground in Tuesday’s premarket trading, with shares of the volatile retail investor-favorite sliding 40% to around $133. The tumble follows a more than 30% drop during the regular market session Monday after last week’s 400% gain, which saw shares as high as $483 each. Before Tuesday’s open, the stock had gained more than 1,000% in 2021 as users on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum talked up the videogame retailer and crushed short-sellers betting against the stock.
Robinhood said it raised another $2.4 billion from investors to weather the extreme market swings due to the trading frenzy in GameStop and other heavily shorted stocks. The overall $3.4 billion the online brokerage has mobilized since Thursday exceeds its total funding amount since its founding in 2013.

*****

> # 3. Pfizer raised full-year guidance after mixed quarter

> * Pfizer expects to sell about $15 billion in coronavirus vaccine doses this year, the U.S. drug giant said Tuesday as it reported mixed quarterly results. Adjusted fourth-quarter earnings of 42 cents per share fell 6 cents short of expectations. Revenue in Q4 rose 12% to $11.68 billion, exceeding estimates. Pfizer also raised full-year guidance. Shares were flat in the premarket. Pfizer has said it expects to deliver 200 million doses of its two-shot vaccine to the U.S. by the end of July.

*****

> # 4. Democrats move to go it alone on Biden’s Covid relief package

> * Democratic congressional leaders took the first step toward passing a sweeping coronavirus relief bill without GOP support, as President Joe Biden on Monday heard out a much smaller plan from Republicans. The Republican lawmakers on Sunday put forward a $618 billion counteroffer to Biden’s $1.9 trillion rescue package. The GOP proposal would send a smaller $1,000 direct payment to many Americans, and extend a smaller $300 per week federal unemployment benefits boost and only until June 30. Biden left the door open to passing a bill without Republicans if he cannot reach a deal with GOP lawmakers.

*****

> # 5. CDC requires face masks on airlines, public transportation

> * Travelers on planes and public transportation, like buses and subways, are required to wear face masks, staring Tuesday. To curb the spread of Covid-19, the CDC issued the mask-wearing rule late Friday that builds on executive action announced by Biden on Jan. 21. The enforcement, which could include fines, will be handled by the TSA and other federal, state and local authorities. The order extends to waiting areas such as airports, train platforms and subway stations. Airlines already require masks and have banned more than 2,000 passengers for refusing to wear one.

If any of you cutie pies weren't busy eating crayons and looking at your bedroom wall whilst trying to comprehend the deeper meanings of life, you'd probably have an actual job. The irony here is that I'm going to go about my career in movie production(I know it's not an actual job don't mock me) and what's been going on there for the past few years after Netflix started their expansion. [This](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bOTyoAE6VrRCAZ5GEOg3J?si=Vw4NHRN_TFSsXnCVcleURg) is a really good podcast episode , which I'll TLDR for you cause you retards can't keep your peanut-sized brains concentrated for more than 3 minutes:

Netflix and Amazon have only been gaining profits since covid came to the west and their counterparts - the movie theaters have only been suffering losses. As with any business this creates enormous leverage for both of these companies to  buy off an entire franchise in order to completely monopolize the market.( I don't mean to judge, this is just natural). I guess you could argue that streaming is way more convenient, but if you were to actually read up on that Google Scholar research you'd realize this is not the case for the community and 🦍 just want to look at big screens. The platforms just need more places to display their prepaid Hollywood star-packed productions so that they can earn that sweet sweet money, because you'll all go watch that movie, because of that hot actor/actress (that's right I don't discriminate). And even if that isn't the case(highly doubt it), you'd still watch it because it's Netflix. It's only but natural for them to want to want to buy stocks of movie theaters at a discounted price. Does this remind you of something you should be doing right now? 

All in all this is just some industry insight argumentation that only supports not selling anything be it GME(which hasn't shifted to online only because chairmen didn't want to have to fight with Mr. Bald Headed Smeagle Jeff Bezos(we wouldn't have been in the position we were today if it had)) or AMC, but don't follow it as financial advice, because I, like you, am retarded too."

You can protect yourself to a degree by learning at least the very basics of how markets work. This post will explain to you how prices work on an exchange, and why ""short ladders"" are not even a coherent concept.

**How markets work**

Exchanges have [order books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_book) in which they track interest in a stock. Orders to buy and orders to sell stay in the order book until someone submits an order that matches their price.

The highest price present on buy orders is called the *bid price*.
The lowest price present on sell orders is called the *ask price*.
The difference between the two is called the *spread*.

When you submit an order to the exchange, it trades at the best price it can get. If you're selling, it will sell to the highest bidder even if you said you were willing to sell for zero.

It is possible for companies to trade off-exchange, but when you are looking at the price of a stock on Google or wherever, the price is based on trades that took place on the exchange. For this reason it is common if you're looking at a feed giving you prices in real time to see the price going up and down between two prices for a number of seconds as people sell at bid price and buy at ask price.

**Why short ladders are not possible**

Short ladders are described as two hedge funds selling back and forth to one another at an increasingly lower price.

This makes no sense for the following reasons.

* Off-exchange transactions do not result in ticks. Nobody sees them.
* You cannot target another participant on the exchange to sell to. You have to go through the order book.
* If the order book has $10000 of bids at $100, you cannot drive the price down to $99 except by selling $10000 of stock at $100.

This is a theory made up by someone who has no knowledge of how markets work - if they understood the basics they would at least try to make it believable.

If you google ""short ladder attack"" you will get a bunch of hits on Reddit, [a StackExchange question](https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/135807/closing-shorted-positions-via-short-ladder-attacks) debunking it, and pretty much nothing else of note. If you google ""short attack"" your top two hits are a description from CFO.com of companies releasing a report at the same time they short e.g. alleging financial irregularities, and a piece of frothing madness from SeekingAlpha where some nutter in 2014 makes up a bunch of nonsense involving ""counterfeit shares"".

This is not real."

To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or ""counterfeit"" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.

Much of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.

One thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**Methodology**

I'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.

**The Code**

    from collections import defaultdict
    import time
    import requests
    POLYGON_API_KEY = '<ADD YOUR API KEY HERE>'
    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY
    
    data
    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))
    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm
    for line in f:
        parts = line.split('|');
        date = parts[0]
        ticker = parts[2]
        try:
            fails = int(parts[3])
            price = float(parts[5])
            value_of_fails = price * fails
            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)
        except ValueError:
            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')
            pass
    
    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():
        day = int(date[-2:])
        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))
        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])
        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] > 10000000, sorted_stocks)
        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:
            val_of_fails = data[0]
            num_fails = data[1]
            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))
            res = req.json()
            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':
                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))
                continue
            else:
                try:
                    volume = res['volume']
                except KeyError:
                    print(res)
            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)
            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100
            print('{: <6} ${: <5} {: <9} / {: < 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))

Here's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.

If everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value > 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.

I'll let y'all discuss what this means in the comments. Have Fun.

EDIT - Someone pointed out a mistake in my script. Fixed, and added a bit more data

EDIT 2 - For those without enough brain wrinkles / attention span to interpret this - There may have been shady shit in the first few days of Jan, but doesn't look like anything went on in the second week. Will need to wait till Feb 15 to see data in the last few weeks of Jan. I'll probably do some more analysis when that time comes"

They are doing everything they can to manipulate and induce panic selling, so they can buy in to cover shorts as low as possible. THE FRENZY OF BUYING THAT IS COVERING SHORTS STILL HAS NOT HAPPENED. Hold strong and buy the dip. They are trying to ride out this movement and squash it with disinformation. Also, this is not financial advice, I am dumber than a second coat of paint. I just really like the stock.

Was mostly trying to point out the large dip JUST before massive squeeze. Apologies because I realize the chart I pasted kind of sucks, but google it for yourself because fuck you. Hopefully you realize that short positions eventually have to buy back the shares they borrowed. That is the real squeeze. I know that VW and GME are not the same situation, because I recognize GME is much more volatile and much more potential to squeeze higher. Lower float, higher short interest, legion of millions of retards, etc.

Thursday (28th Jan): MM's/HF's executed a clear ladder attack - trading large stock holdings between each other, gradually lowering the offering each time. What did this do? Trick the market algorithms into thinking there was a mass sell off. Was there really? **Fuck no.** Did we sell? Fuck no! Did we 💎 HOLD 💎? Obviously.

In the hours and day following their attempt of BLATANT ILLEGAL MARKET MANIPULATION, the stock rose again to +300, an honest representation of the situation, because none of us Ape's sold!

The cock jockeys at Wall Street have now had the entire weekend to think of a strategy to keep us at bay. Tried to hype SLV to distract and used media contacts to alter the story. What they are now doing is using a similar form of laddering to keep the main stocks at bay. **In other words they will try to keep the stock stagnant.** I wouldn't be surprised to seem them lever the price UP, to raise hopes only to ladder DOWN again to again alter the ""squeeze"" story.

They will do EVERYTHING in their power to come out on top. The amount of blatant illegal acts they committed last week proves this. There are literally no rules they will not break on their quest to cause panic and ultimately get us retards to sell our positions (obligatory fuck RobinHood & IBKR).

**\*\*THE IMPORTANT PART:\*\***

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

No matter what people say or what you hear in the media - THEY CANNOT CLOSE POSITIONS UNLESS SOMEONE SELLS. Simple as that. The short float is more than the physical amount of existing shares^(\[1\]). Bottom line.

Now with this said please fucking read this:

^(\[1\])[Why $GME short interest appears to have fallen when in reality it has not.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lag1d3/why_gme_short_interest_appears_to_have_fallen/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

TLDR: *""the statistics might be correct, but the true short interest is still the same as before!* ***THE SHORTS ARE NOT OFF THE HOOK!""***

Short float is clearly not the be all and end all. Do not fall into this trap.

***I hope new retards that just joined WSB realise that this struggle between Retail Investors & Hedge Funds may take longer than you think.*** No one knows when (or fucking IF) the short squeeze will take place as expected. Be ready to HOLD for 2-3 weeks or even longer. We may have the an upper hand, but the hedge funds aren't stupid. They have been taking your boomer parents\* hard earned money for decades so be ready for several weeks of FUD, misinformation, and restrictions. Don't invest more than what you can lose. Be logical, go out, exercise, eat and sleep (stop looking at that fucking line 24/7). Try not to stay glued to the screen.

Helmets on. Cheers to remaining space-cadets together.

I know that they are a dark cloud of secrecy but DFV (and others who first had this GME stock idea) were able figure out that Melvin Capital was the one who was short. Where did he (and others find this info)? Since then, the news and everyone else has mentioned Melvin Capital so many times that we are taking for granted how and where this information is tracked? Given how much manipulation hedge funds are taking part in, it would be a huge asset to see as much information as we can about their positions.

**(2)** No one should make any decision on GME (or any stock) on emotions. Successful trades are the ones that are made based on on data.  That means we need accurate short data. What is the best resource for short data that is most accurate and most frequently updated?

**(3)** According to the below short info websites, I am seeing that there are 61.78 million short interest. If this is accurate, then GME will at some point go into a short squeeze. Its just simply the data. If not today, then tomorrow. If not tomorrow, then the next day. I think the key would be a trigger which would overwhelm the suppression. An example of a trigger would be a positive earnings release or some new positive development in their strategic shift to e-commerce. If we have to wait, so be it. Why? Because we do not pay margin to wait. They pay margin daily for shorting. Remember that.

[https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2)

**(4)** For those of you who participated in the Tesla short squeeze, are there any lessons learned that can be applied to GME? There were a ton of shorts on Tesla. But Tesla kept announcing new exciting things and churning out improving delivery/profit numbers. The shorts got squeezed. Did these hedge funds try to short ladder Tesla? I'd imagine that the amount of positive news overwhelmed attempts to suppress Tesla stock price? Maybe that is what will happen with GME? GME is not Tesla but it does have tremendous potential with Ryan Cohen and a potential move to e-commerce. I'm wondering if maybe we will trade flat like this with ups and down until we get some kind of positive news trigger and then it will initiate a larger squeeze and perhaps will happen over a long period of time? Tesla, for example, rose dramatically in 2020 but it was kind of spread out through the year. If so, then we just need to be patient.

**(5)** I am seeing a lot of newbies ask very stupid questions. Please stop asking what the next GME is or what trade you should make or how high GME will get to or what price is a good price to buy at or what is an option. If you are asking these kinds of questions, then stock trading might not be for you. Why? Because you are not understanding what we do here at WSB. We don't give anyone instruction on what to do or what not to do. We discuss ideas, we discuss different options. There is an expectation that you come to WSB with basic knowledge. When you decide to do a trade or not do it, it is purely your decision. And then you live with the loss or gain. And please please use Google to learn the basics instead of coming here and asking what an option is.  I know mods are overly pressured right now in all they have to do with the extra members but perhaps we will need to consider banning people who ask these kinds of questions."

Look at the chart, look at the dates, compare to GME. We could fall even lower, we can only win by not selling! SOON💎🙌🏻🚀

This month I have learned that the world we are living in is rigged. I have learned that the media that I was watching before are lying. I have learned that there are almost no consequences to market manipulation as it is cheaper to pay fines then actually lose. 
I think as a community we have learned so much more about the financial system and who is and who is not on retail investor’s side. 

I could never have imagined that the media can be so easily manipulated. Today’s news about the silver got me laughing good when I first saw it, but then I started to get worried. This kind of manipulation is hard to withstand, especially for small investors like us. A stock dropping from 350 to 188 is worrisome. 

However it means only one thing, and it is that they are on their last days of existence. I have no idea what more shady manipulation they will come up with. But one thing is for sure, If everyone hold, there is just no way that they will be able to win it. I don’t care how much they manipulate us, how much they are paying others to say things. The only thing I care about now is that they lose and we win. They have not closed their positions, they have lost half of what they own. Think about stepping into their shoes, think about losing cars, yachts, wealth generally that everyday normal people will never have. I would for sure do anything in my power so that normal people would not take it all away from me. Think about how bad they will look for the rest of their lives if they lose to a bunch of retards on a Internet forum, they will not only loose money, but clients too. 

What I am trying to say is that it is up to you now. It can even take a bit longer then we anticipated. However if you sell, you will lose, and if you lose other normal people will lose, and if normal people will lose then the wealthy hedge funds and wealthy greedy people will win. I could cash out now and still make about 300 percent, I have been thinking about it. I came to a conclusion that being retarded is what makes us so strong. I don’t give a fuck about small amount of money, I want to cash out big time, over 1000 USD per share big time. I want everyone of you to look at the Volkswagen chart when it squeezed. How many days it took, and how low it fell before that happened. If GameStop falls to 100 so be it, if it falls even lower, SO BE IT. you are in control, the only way out for them now is that everyone will just get tired of this and sell. 
We could win big time here, we could tell this story years to come, sitting in the bars, sitting with our kids, sitting with our friends, and sitting here together. A community where people from all over the world came together and fucked over some wealthy dicks that feed on normal people like us. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎

tl;dr

AMC is the global leader in a $17 billion dollar industry that’s been beaten senseless to the ground with so much room to run. After pioneering deals with streaming services, buying out their competition, and upgrading their facilities worldwide, 80% short interest is highly inappropriate for its TRUE fundamental value — $69.69 a share.

*🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀$AMC TO $69.69🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀*

*🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀$AMC TO THE MOON🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀*

\---

""I'm questioning whether they\[WSB\] are actually doing the research when it comes to things like GameStop and AMC ..."" *- clueless* [*CNBC dude*](https://youtu.be/DYZHtF-tV0k?t=97)*.*

I fuckin miss movies. And when I say movies, I mean the whole damn experience. I wanna buy my $15 popcorn, pour an ungodly amount of butter and jalapenos on that shit and munch in a recliner seat watching in laser 4k quality. I like this company. I like this stock.

For the past few days, I've been scouring Google for news articles and company data. I've also been trying to find some detailed DD in here but they’ve all been pretty limp-dick when it came to AMC. And most of the news articles I've read were surface-level AT BEST with a grim outlook based on first-glance analysis. Guess these analysts are just too damn lazy to dig deep.

Because when we dive into these issues, we can easily see that the theater giant may not be in as bad a situation as the media/analysts are claiming.

In fact, I believe that **AMC is absolutely misunderstood, overlooked, and** **undervalued.**

Here is why I am more confident than ever that $AMC will not only reach $30 but is in the perfect setup to see ATHs and WELL ABOVE.

# I. Ugly Start, Beautiful Setup

Chances are if you are currently holding a significant position in $AMC, then most likely you've already read up on the company and its current standing in the cinema industry. You've probably read about how the corporation has nearly [$5 billion dollars worth of debt](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/amc-could-benefit-from-bankruptcy-analysts-say.html) with many of its locations still closed as the pandemic remains a global issue. You may have realized that new movies haven't been coming out. But more than that, you're seeing that movies are just being[ released on streaming platforms](https://hbr.org/2021/01/will-movie-theaters-survive-when-audiences-can-stream-new-releases) anyway. You might be concerned for AMC, or even the industry as a whole.

All of these concerns are very valid and based on real uncertainty, but let's break down each of these points and see if they’re as bad as analysts claim.

# II. A Discussion on Debt

Media outlets keep honing in on this debt like it’s an ugly scar of the corporation. But what we need to focus on is why that debt came to be, how the money was spent, and how this debt was a strategic play in order to cement AMC into the new era of cinema-streaming.

We can categorize the money used into four parts:

* **New equipment and amenities**
* **Lease payments**
* **Maintenance costs (utilities, wages, etc.)**
* **Expansion (buying out the competition)**

Pay close attention to the last category because this one is important. Over the past five years, AMC has been [acquiring smaller theater companies](https://tracxn.com/d/acquisitions/acquisitionsbyAMC-Theatres) like [Odeon](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/amc-theatres-closes-odeon-uci-acquisition-become-largest-exhibitor-europe-world-951348). After buying out these companies, AMC then had to suit its ""new locations"" with the standard luxury amenities AMC is known for. This makes for a significant bulk of their debt totaling over $3 billion in just acquisitions. This was the investment that helped **solidify AMCs spot as the world's largest cinema chain**.

On the topic of maintenance costs, AMC managed to raise enough money to [get through 2021](https://variety.com/2021/film/features/amc-ceo-adam-aron-coronavirus-bankruptcy-1234891440/). With ongoing news of vaccines, we can hope their efficacy leads to a speedy reopening near mid-late 2021. But when the economy *does* reopen—and AMC is back at full operation—what will it look like?

# III. The Future of AMC

There's an elephant here.. right in this very room. Yes, streaming and cinema have had some serious beef in the past. In fact, some cinema chains are having tensions with streaming to this day. But what has AMC done in regards to streaming? They were the first to[ settle deals](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/universal-amc-theatres-historic-deal-windows-1234718737/) in order to partner up and take part in streaming revenue.

*Yup, you read that right. AMC is both having their cake and eating it too.*

Why would motion picture companies do this? Why not just end the cinema industry? To put simply, analysts are deeply underestimating the value of the ""cinema experience"". Just as I mentioned in the intro, I miss the cinemas. But I am definitely not alone. But let's not talk about me and the hypothetical ""people'', instead let's talk about research studies.

In a 3-year study done in Korea, researchers found that shortening the window of cinema exclusivity and releasing movies on streaming early[ did **not** have a significant effect on ticket sales](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3749476). And though this is a limited study done outside of the US, remember that AMC is a global corporation and these results have a hopeful outlook for the future relationship of cinema-streaming for AMC worldwide.

*""But wait, you still haven't mentioned what streaming gets out of this?""*

It's not what streaming ""gets out of this"" but rather what these motion picture companies maintain in keeping a healthy relationship with cinemas. During the peak heat of the movie theater-streaming feud, AMC[ halted the showing of Trolls](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/amc-theatres-trolls-world-tour-dispute-1234592445/) and vowed to never show a Universal Pictures film in its theaters again if they were to continue releasing their films on streaming platforms without a proper cinema-exclusivity window. But today, we can see that the tensions have fallen and both motion picture companies and AMC have found a way to mutually benefit each other.

Now besides streaming, AMC has been investing in luxury amenities as seen by their chairs, 4K laser projectors,[ MERV air filtration](https://www.amctheatres.com/amc-safe-and-clean), and ultra-surround sound speakers. With so many locations and so many amenities, they are offering [full theater rentals](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/amc-launches-private-theater-rental-program-111020.html) with high demand during the pandemic. AMC has further cultivated their century-old movie experience into modern times. And this pandemic didn’t just change their amenities.

They had to learn how to[ cut costs and have more efficient operations](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/amc-could-benefit-from-bankruptcy-analysts-say.html) in order to survive. This only spells good news for when they emerge with better operations, more money to spend, and higher valuations. So that begs the question, how high can the company's share price go realistically?

# IV. Valuation

First, let's look at the Movie Theater industry as a whole in comparison to a few other popular entertainment industries:

[Movie Theater US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/movie-theaters-united-states/) **$17.1 billion**

[Casinos US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/non-hotel-casinos-united-states/) $15.7 billion

[Amusement Parks US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/amusement-parks-united-states/) $14 billion

[Music Label Music Production US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/major-label-music-production-united-states/) $9.4 billion

[Music Publishing US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/music-publishing-united-states/) $7 billion

In the world of entertainment, cinema is a very lucrative business.

And, again, who is the largest movie theater chain in the world? Yup,[ AMC](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2020/12/11/amc-worlds-largest-movie-theater-chain-raises-100-million-lifeline-but-it-needs-750-million-to-survive-next-year/?sh=338d2b35257b).

Clueless CNBC dude mentioned that we retail traders[ don't trade with a fundamental reason](https://youtu.be/_KpecK1mvNo?t=1577) but is there a fundamental reason in shorting a $17 billion dollar industry GLOBAL leader down to its grave? Does AMC deserve to die? I surely don't think so.

Now I won't touch upon squeezes in this since I'm sure many of you folk have already read/heard enough about them, but I will leave this quick intuitive[ article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/investing/2021/01/27/short-squeezes-what-to-know/43360347/) about it. And yes, these shorts can and will be squoze once we have faith in our upper valuations and investors(we) begin buying again.

**And buy again we will**. As many users flee limp-dick Robinhood and join one of the real brokerages, their positions/funds will be settled and ready to trade come next week. Where do you think these angry RH refugees will be putting their investments? That's right, exactly into the positions that RH stopped them from buying last week: which includes $AMC.

If you were part of the RH user base and your plays were affected by the blatant market manipulation, it's not only ""not too late"", but I believe it is an opportune time to **BUY**.

How high can it go then? When will I know it's too late to take a position?

So when we talk about valuation, many people fear the uncertainty of a stock rising far past its current value. Well, I think Chamath Palihapitiya[ said it best](https://youtu.be/_KpecK1mvNo?t=1522):

***""Everybody that bought that stock is also underwriting how they want to own it.""***

In our current price-action environment, it's not too ridiculous to see how we are forming the foundations for AMC to continue rising beyond ATHs. We are already hitting nearly $16 on the day and rallying +53% while enduring heavy trade restrictions. Who's to say that this passion cannot continue? Now I’m no expert and can’t tell you how high this can go, but I am personally eyeing $69.69 as a target.

With so many current factors at play including hype, short covers, and ITM options having to be exercised, this is actually the BEST entrance to manifest its ATH valuation and chart some never before seen territory in its price action. **It's like the manifest destiny of stock valuation**. In fact, we may never see this opportunity for AMC again if we don't act now and solidify its value upward.

At the end of the day, prices are what the buyers/sellers settle upon so **WE** can pioneer that value if we damn well please. **This is what a free market is all about.**

*Will there be people that disagree with this?*

*Sure.*

Will people continue to short AMC as it goes up?

*Absolutely.*

Do I think that AMC being shorted 80% and rising is fair?

*Really? See section III.*

But institutions are selling off! Like [Silver Lake liquidating their 44m shares](https://www.barrons.com/articles/amc-entertainment-investor-silver-lake-sells-stake-51611962182).

*Yes, then the next day $AMC dipped to $7.50 and has since recovered…  with AMC $600m less in debt.*

We all know who is shorting AMC, and I am sick of these hedge funds who think they, alone, can decide whether or not a company is worth a damn.

# V. Conclusion - Resurgence

We are at the cusp of AMCs resurgence. Because most of us have been kept from participating in social activities, we can better understand that the public is yearning for a sense of normalcy. Sure we've gone pretty far with just watching movies on our TVs or computers through the pandemic, but that doesn't scratch the itch for many folk.

What you're investing into when you invest in AMC is the entire experience in tandem with its new streaming deals. And having been beaten so low—while still holding such great fundamental prospects— its share price is ready to blow up.

In the future when “The Deep Squeeze” is turned into a movie, we’ll be a part of history.

And you’re going to want to see it on the big screen.

I am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i, titled Manipulation of Security Prices, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that artificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of the laws of the United States. 

Section 78i(a) clearly states that ""It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of any facility of any national securities exchange, or for any member  of a national securities exchange -- **(2)**  To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, *a series of transactions* in any security registered on a national securities  exchange, any security not so registered, or *in connection with any security-based swap or security-based swap agreement* with respect to such security creating actual or apparent active trading in such  security, or **raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.""**

Currently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called ""short ladder attacks"" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i. ""Short ladder attacks"" occur when large institutions in possession of the aforementioned stocks sell them for just less than market value in rapid succession between one another in order to drive the price down. The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity that can be seen here

(Check this from the huge dip last Thursday. No volume but still an enormous dip in price)

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l71yxn/ladder_selling_explained/

check this out

Such blatant attacks readily establishes prima facie case of market manipulation and must be investigated by the SEC immediately. Further silence from the SEC on this matter, which can be investigated quite quickly, not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the U.S. Government.

Finally, section 78i(f) makes it clear that ""Any person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in  violation of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section, **shall** be liable to any person who shall purchase or sell any security at a price  which was affected by such act or transaction.""  


I am calling on you to do your job. The direct manipulation of GME and AMC stock prices is an on-going crisis that directly hurts the public interest and is AGAINST THE LAW. You must act now before it is too late.

Sincerely,

Your Average Retail Investor

Edit: Feel free to copy, share, do whatever with this. I really don’t care. My work is worthless unless something is actually done to stop this. Also, thank your for the awards 💎🙌

Edit 2: if you want to copy this, go ahead, if you’re having trouble, dm me and I’ll send it to you directly

Edit 3: There was a suggestion to post this on Twitter. Whoever wants to can go ahead or dm me if you need to make it smaller. 🙏

Edit 4: So, I have sent this to the SEC, but I expect nothing more than a form letter, which is basically a garbage non-answer (Google it). I’d rather this get some media coverage so feel free to spam this on Twitter or w/e. No credit necessary"

That wasn’t me, for sure. When I checked my email for the reset email, **it was gone**. So now I’m freaking the fuck out because that would mean my email had been hacked too.

Sure enough, I tried to pull up the app on my phone and I was signed out, like holy fuck right? 99% sure that only happens when the password is actually reset, not when someone types your email to *request the reset*.

I went to RH and requested a reset for my email. Clicked to reset and the website said the password couldn’t be reset. So I did the same thing except faster, using lastpass to gin up a safe one immediately. Not sure what the fuck was going on here tbh.

The next thing I did was update my gmail password. Google makes this so freaking complicated that I had to google for a direct link to change it, and that’s now been updated as well.

If I hadn’t been on my phone I wouldn’t have caught this, heck I could have been playing a video game, it scares me to think of it.

All I can say as someone who has always thought 2fa was stupid is USE IT. And use a strong password.

I got a lot of messages after my last post asking for thoughts of the big four, and BB is one that sticks out to me as having high value long term and not just through this current bonanza. 

Many of you have been seeing this ticker posted a few times called BB (blackberry for the less imaginative readers). Now, I am sure many of you new-comers to this sub probably are thinking “What in tarnation? This phone company still exists?” 

Yes. And the kicker? **BB is no longer a phone company**

In case you missed the news, BB is selling their phone stuff and going balls deep into automotive software. Not just any cars, but autonomous and EV. Every WSB autist’s wet dream.  I mean AI and EV in one company? No way this can go tits up!

If you look at older posts in WSB, you will see that BB was getting attention here for a while before the the current madness and many had high hopes that BB could rain in tendies in the near future. I am sure there are many here that have BB for under 10, which are probably the people who saw this potential. 

BB is selling away their phone patents to Huawei and partnering with Baidu (amongst other companies) to work on their autonomous driving technology. Specifically, BB’s operating system will be incorporated to be the backbone of Baidu’s autonomous driving platform. 

The news does not stop with Baidu. This is merely one example of BB’s expanding influence over autonomous driving, navigation, vehicle health protection, and vehicle security. At this point a simple google search with the words Blackberry + vehicle will net you dozens of results for projects they are working on and leading in the automotive software industry. 

All in all, I am very bullish on BB, especially long term.  What this all boils down to is if you think you’ve missed the boat on the big 4, BB may still be a good choice to jump in. Even if it pulls back, BB probably won’t leave you bag holding for long. 

Good luck all and may the tendies be with you.

(This isn’t financial advice)

TL;DR – Hold your GME. BB has long term potential after the current madness is over."

This is not meant as a negative scare tactic but only a potential hypothesis of what may occur.

1. GameStop has the ability to raise a secondary offering by issuing more shares into either the public or private markets. Technically, they can issue 300 million shares. Here is an SEC Filing from 2005 [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312513364182/d569889dex31.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312513364182/d569889dex31.htm)
2. Even if the above SEC filing did not exist they would probably structure something to allow a secondary offering as the market has given them a second lifeline ( Just 1 year ago they were a company worth $200m today they are worth 100x that).
3. It is highly unlikely that GameStop will issue 300 million shares or even 100 million shares
4. I believe it is realistic to think that they may raise $1-2 Billion in a secondary offering probably some portion of debt and equity (not just flooding the market).
5. They could do this by either offering a non-dilutive secondary offering by selling their shares they currently hold, or by causing a dilution event and issuing more shares
6. In a dilution event this would look like adding 10% of shares to the market which will have some impact but doubt it will crater the stock.
7. Google raised about $4 Billion through something similar in 2005 [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondaryoffering.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondaryoffering.asp)
8. In some ways it would be foolish for the company not to take advantage of the current situation and raise some amounts of additional capital.

&#x200B;

TLDR: GameStop will likely do a secondary offering but it will be unlikely flood the market with 300 million shares.

These are just my best guesses not facts."

*Disclaimer I own 23 shares of GME at 273 and I’m bull. This is not investment advice.* 

Are you wondering when, how, if this will all be over you’ve come to the right post. This ENDGAME DD is about no stock in particular and shouldn’t be taken as investment advice.

So your answer? If you haven’t seen this post please check it out. I think it does an ok job at theorizing the point at which a large short has to cover and how we get there.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8t3dm/gme\_endgame\_game\_theory\_best\_scenarios/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8t3dm/gme_endgame_game_theory_best_scenarios/)

User does a great job explaining that there will be massive volatility if we are to go forward. There’s also a good theory of a pre-squeeze price and post-squeeze price where all holders make value $. No squeeze has happened yet, only a small exit of short positions leveraged back into more shorts.

Things the user forgot to mention as a strategy for someone bullish other than buy and hold.

*Other methods can be used to drive up prices.*

Remove your shares from the available short position!! **DO IT NOW then tell a friend**

GOOGLE SAYS: Phone your broker and put an order in saying that you wish to place **your shares** for sale at, for argument's sake, double today's price. As they are 'on order' they **cannot** be lent out by your broker and in turn, you are reducing the amount of **'free shares**' out there that can be used for **shorting** purposes.

Shorts increased their position! [https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today) If you have **any** stock you want to increase in value, set a sell limit order for what you think is “fair value”, another thing brokers are limiting.

Buying accelerates the process way faster! 21 years is the estimate when they will be bust at current $300 value. I think it was an overestimate that can be much faster with buys. Buys with the conviction that the leadership from is now solid. Buys where you trust others to see the company and its stock growing. Buys because you like the stock. Anyone can buy, from almost anywhere! Asia, EU, Canada, US, find out if you can purchase too. 

**Taking away available shares to short and buying could reduce the estimate to an untenable short term position. Period**

The last thing not mentioned is a margin call. Oh did you invest on margin and over-leverage your position on GME like these hedge funds?  Prepare for an unexpected call when the clearing firm calls in and asks you to meet minimum deposit requirements or sells your position. However, this only happens if bulls are **quick and consistent**. Volatility needs to be so insane and price so high that shorts need to clear out and cut losses so quickly that they never have the capacity to short again.

The reason Robinhood said Fuck You, 1 share a piece was that their DTCC deposit/cash on hand requirements went way up. No speculation, just a fact. They, unlike other brokers, have 56% of 13 million known users who have a stake in heavily shorted Gamer Stock. In theory, if 30% more users bought 1 share of a $312 stock that would add $1,216,800,000 of value. Hedges lose long before that, but 56% is rookie numbers, we can get that to 99%.

Now read this: [https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-30/gamestop-gme-short-squeeze-who-will-surrender-first](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-30/gamestop-gme-short-squeeze-who-will-surrender-first)

In theory, just by buying and holding you could force Robinhood and other brokers to call in their investment from leveraged shorts. Ding ding ding. Three shitron lemons just flashed in a row and paid out. 

However, investing isn’t for everyone. Huge volatility for your one allowance of share can be involved. If you buy high and sell low that is as much of a loss as someone who shorted a position that was sound long term. My investment advice has always been only put in what you can lose, never 140%.

Buy a ticket to the show. They could sell out quickly. DVF bought 55,000 tickets at such a low price, but low is relative to what is the current high. 

Personally, I think $300 for your ticket to the show is a good deal for the ***HEDGIES LOSS PORN but you have to hold it to enter***.

TLDR; If you have rocket fuel, we will be going to the moon. 🚀"

$SCHW owns and operates both TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab and has the most to gain from this Citadel/market manipulation fiasco.

**Breakdown of Restrictions by Brokerage: Worst to Best**

**RobinHood: (Worst)**

\- Trading restrictions limiting purchasing power to as little as 1-5 shares on over 50 stocks

[https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys)

\- Allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of GME and AMC during Thursday's trading rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)

\- Liquidity issues: RH is racing to raise 1$ billion from its existing investors as of Friday as many individuals are withdrawing their funds in protest of restrictions

\-Raised margin requirements on many securities

\-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

**Interactive Brokers (garbage)**

\- Trading restrictions on GME/AMC/BB allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of these securities during Thursdays trading Rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)

\- CEO stated in CNBC interview they imposed restrictions to help out hedge funds (and stabilize the market)

\-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

\-Raised margin requirements on many securities

[https://www.investopedia.com/robinhood-latest-broker-to-restrict-trading-of-gamestop-and-others-5100879](https://www.investopedia.com/robinhood-latest-broker-to-restrict-trading-of-gamestop-and-others-5100879)

**WeBull + ETrade (garbage)**

\- Trading restrictions on GME/AMC/BB allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of these securities during Thursdays trading Rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)

\-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

\-Raised margin requirements on many securities

**Schwab/TD Ameritrade (reasonable)**

\- Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

\- Limiting short selling on volatile tickers (limiting trades with unlimited risk)

\- Raised margin requirements on many securities

\- Allowed trading of volatile securities once cash deposits were verified (many new accounts experienced this issue as new funds were not settled)

Both of these restrictions are reasonable as they have unlimited risk and are not trying to be liable for any substantial losses

**Fidelity/Vanguard (Best)**

\- Raised margin requirements on many securities

\- Limiting short selling on volatile tickers (limiting trades with unlimited risk)

Both of these restrictions are reasonable as they have unlimited risk and are not trying to be liable for any substantial losses

Thousands of upset retail investors will be fleeing RH, IBRK, Webull and Etrade over the next couple of weeks. Switching to Fidelity and Schwab/TD Ameritrade.

I would also go long Fidelity investments but it is not publicly traded.

**Schwab Analysis**

**User Growth:**

The amount of brand new retail investors opening up accounts over the past week is ridiculous. GME + AMC + BB pump has been blasted across every media station. Every online brokerage was experience server lag and strain over the past week due to the increased volume from new retail investors. Traffic on these sites were 3-4 times what they normally were during the recent trading frenzy.

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/schwab-vanguard-fidelity-suffer-service-problems-amid-trading-surge-51611773909?siteid=yhoof2](https://www.barrons.com/articles/schwab-vanguard-fidelity-suffer-service-problems-amid-trading-surge-51611773909?siteid=yhoof2)

RH/Webull/Etrade/IBRK transfers - many retail investors will be transferring over their accounts as a result of the trade restrictions and collusion with hedge funds. Listed below are the total accounts at each brokerage

RH: 13 million accounts

Etrade: 5.2 million accounts

Webull: 2 million accounts

IBRK: 700k accounts

Even if only a small portion of users switch brokerages 5-10% we are still looking at 1-2 million new accounts up for grabs between TD/Schwab/Fidelity/Vanguard

More users = more deposits/commission = more profits = stonks go up

**Reputation -** RH/Webull/Etrade/IBRK have had their app ratings and reputation destroyed thanks to reviewing bombing as a result of market collusion. These low reviews will discourage any new retail investors from using their platforms and push them towards TD/Schwab/Fidelity.

**Discount:**

$SCHW is trading at a 17% discount (as of PM on Friday) from its January high all while new retail investors and user registrations and deposits reached an all time high over the past week. Negative media coverage and market sell off this week has caused every publicly traded brokerage company to sell of from their highs. With a market rebound and new user registration data for January this stock will fly past its ATH's and run into the 70's.

**Average Daily Users**

The average daily website users has seen almost a 20% increase from the October 2020 numbers to December 2020 alone. The January numbers will even be substantially higher with TD Ameritrade and Schwab both reporting network strain due to the influx of new investors signing up last week to get into GME/AMC/BB. This trend wont be stopping anytime soon, the retail investor's strength is gaining. Just look at Wallstreetbets alone we had 2.2 million members as of Monday and now we are sitting at 7 million.

**Upcoming Earnings**

$SCHW is going to crush their upcoming earnings for Q1 2021 in April. They acquired TD Ameritrade on October 6. The amount of new retail investors has exploded over the last couple of months. Just look at last years growth in new accounts most brokerages have seen a over 100% increase in 2020 traffic. Their next earnings report for Q1 2021 will be the first quarter with 3 full months of combined revenue from both TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab. There will also be a mass exodus of upset traders fleeing Webull, Etrade and Robinhood by the thousands and transferring their assets into TD Ameritrade and Schwab.

**Future/Longevity of Brokerages:**

TD Ameritrade/Schwab will be one of the few brokerages not being slammed by class action lawsuits as a result of the manipulation today. E Trade, RobinHood, IBRK and Webull will have users fleeing in the masses to new brokerages. Do you really want to leave your money sitting on a brokerages that may have pending lawsuits against it and possible liquidity issues? (looking at you Robinhood)

**Price Target:** Bank of America just upgraded $SCHW on January 12 giving it a $68 target. Stating their has been mass growth in retail users. This was prior to the new user explosion the past 2 weeks. This stock will easily run to $70 once data comes out for January 2021 on the amount of new users and transfers.

**TLDR:** $SCHW will crush its Q1 2021 earnings thanks to an explosion in new retail investors as a result of the media coverage on GME and AMC. Retail traders on platforms that halted trading activity on Thursday will also be transferring their holdings to Schwab + TD Ameritrade. $SCHW is at a discount thanks to the market sell off and will rebound to $70+ once registration data comes out for January.

Position: 02/05/2021 & 02/12/2021 $57 Calls

Calls are dirt cheap as this stock is seen as a boomer stock with low volatility.

EDIT: A few people saying TD/Schw/Fidelity were no allowing GME/BB/AMC trading. This may be a result of your cash not settling. New accounts needed their funds to settle before trading these higher volatility tickers. Any errors popping up may also be due to server strain, I was using TD and RBC in Canada and had issues finding tickers/entering into positions

EDIT 2: Schwab will be giving its winter business update on Tuesday at 11am. I expect them to discuss the massive growth in retail investors which should help this stock bounce.

EDIT 3: talked to a online agent about transferring over investments into Schwab. He mentioned that there has been more transfer requests in the last couple days then all of last quarter causing wait times/rep times to go from 5 minutes on hold to over a hour on average."

l97c0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97c0u/ive_been_trading_silver_futures_august_dont_fall/,I've been trading Silver futures August. Don't fall for their shit by listening to your doomer uncle finally,386,204,2021-01-31 15:25:22,"Background: I've been trading silver futures since August which makes me essentially the expert. I joke but not really.

SILVER: the world's fakest precious commodity. As we are poor people here most of us grew up with the perception that silver has value due to its scarcity. No longer is this the case. Base usage statistics state that about 70% of it is used in the industrial manufacturing sector.

Countries hold many tons of reserves. Just Google silver reserves and understand Peru is sitting on a many year stockpile if all of the aggregate demand suddenly decided to only buy from Peru.  As price rises poor countries will inevitably sell off reserves and there is a strong suspicion has been occurring as silver is up big time this year and tax revenues for all nations are down.

So the ETF SLV is a complete crock of shit. End of week I figure out the max pain option price and just sell a call/put based on it as SLV is determined by the futures price, which is heavily controlled through a large amount of paper contracts on both sides of buy/sell that'll never materialize.  If you go through my post history you'll see me shorting silver this summer and while very profitable, I did blow a bunch per wsb lifestyle, but my day to day futures trading gave me tremendous feel for the pulse of it. End of week is beyond manipulated and while I do not have the software to do so; if you threw it in on your computer to short/long slv/silver futures towards its equivalent SLV max pain price (with the caveat of factoring in only the most recent 30 days max pain which is tough to generate except through watching OI/volumes fluctuate) you'd join in on the JPMorgan train as they're the ones doing it. I'd actually argue instead of taking a buy and hold approach to just do exactly that by end of day Thursday as JPMorgan acts like a crooked circus game operator with ""wild"" Friday swings towards max pain or lack of expected shifts (that then materialize monday) so every person who plays their game for them is one less cent they can't make. My theory is with the etf they've sort of become a traditional bank with their reserve (silver) being turned into a cash generating enterprise via the selling of premium. I estimated they were raking about 10 mil of premium a week and while certainly not earning it all via some expiring itm vs their non covered positions, the amount they do is a healthy and lucrative business when there is no major risk to the underlying when you rig the game and have all of the cards.

Futures are better as you are greater leveraged and can buy after hours. GME after 5pm (edt) Friday moved generally like silver does from 6pm-8pm which I find highly interesting given this now attempt to get us to take our eyes off the target and to rely on many years old articles that are now materially false if you were to Google out this theory.

Long term prognosis is as always - whatever the man says to do in the retail arena, means they want you to hold their bags so at a minimum please disregard.

Tl;Dr hold/buy gme and walk away from the computer, do not buy silver of any variety except to jump in on the manipulation as it trades very predictably particular towards Friday when SLV options expire and triple so when the monthly variety are what's expiring, mods are /"

However, you are allowed to talk to lawyers if you're comfortable doing that and I have personally favorably resolved several financially significant disputes with large corporations have tried to take advantage of me in a very formal way.  

I'd never recommend that to anybody.  It's very scary.  But I can share how I get my ducks in a row when it feels like things are going off the rails so you have that information should you ever need it.

I just saw the post about an error in accessing Robinhood statements, which apparently may be required to transfer assets.  I assume that is the case since Fidelity has this bullet point as the first in their transfer steps FAQ:

**""A statement from your current firm to reference""**

While this may be a temporary technical problem they have lost credibility.  There are already pending class actions from the trading outage that have been posted.  There will be more if they continue to have problems.  I'm sure the nature of those problems, benign or otherwise will come to light through these processes.

If they liquidated your positions without knowledge or consent they provided the evidence for you on that one.  But there could be other issues where it cannot hurt to establish you were trying to do where it could be less concrete.

So I don't know what else might go down, but I think a lot of people like me are done and will move everything out.  I hope it goes smoothly, but just in case you are worried here are the steps I usually take when I feel like a large company is going to violate any kind of agreement or fail in an important process. 

Your level of exposure and confidence may dictate how deep you go on this, but it's my full freight exercising my rights as a customer path.

1. As soon as you hit something that caused you a problem make a screenshot.  Do it again and make another screenshot.  If it involves some actual transaction execution make a screenshot of whatever you are trying to trade

2. Send a customer service ticket with a LOT of detail.  What you were trying to do, what went wrong, anything relevant to the details of the transaction.  Take a screenshot before you send.  It goes without saying, but keep all this stuff organized and in one place

3. Get a Google Voice or similar service number.  You can call yourself and start recording and then call customer service.  When you call be very nice.  The person you are talking to is just like you and mostly they deal with morons who forgot their password.  Tell them you are recording.  If you are angry tell them, but don't BE angry.  I can't stress that enough.  Tell them you sent the support ticket.  Repeat all the details.  I have sent recordings to lawyers on the other side before.  They do the trick.  I have sat in a room with a whole senior management team and several corporate lawyers on the phone and called their bluff when they said they had recordings of me indicating I wanted something other than what I got.  I just kept telling them to play it until they suddenly didn't think it needed to come to that and we started talking what we could do to fix it

4. Call back and do it again.  See if you get the same answer.  Having two employees tell me the exact same thing after the company did the exact opposite to me has paid off before

5. Write this stuff down in order as you do it.  Make sure you have names right.  Ask for best call back numbers, resolution times, any promised restitution (that's also why the recordings), and additional ticket numbers that get opened.  If you have a log it's easy to go back and say X agent told me Y on this day and I can send you the recording in 5 minute

6. Go download all those customer agreements you have to plow through.  Send more tickets and ask them to confirm those are the versions that you agreed to when opening the account or the last update you agreed to.  If policies are changing rapidly it does not hurt to to have a record of what the expectation was.  This is really boring, but who knows

7. If you can get to statements go ahead and save the most recent at least.  If a platform goes down you want to have your account info handy

I hope you don't need any of this and someone can give you some more tips.  However, before rage quitting if something does negatively impact you get organized."

**OBLIGATORY - $GME🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 (YES THAT IS 7 ROCKET EMOJIS SO YOU KNOW IM DAMN SERIOUS).**

It’s ya boy here, ElJefe and boyyyyyy do I have something to share with you!

Hold onto your seats, because what I’m about to share IS a doozy and it might help make a lot of connections with what the fuck is going on related to this whole GME fiasco, that is now turning into some chance opportunity for $SLV to return to the main stage as another **“squeeze opportunity”.**

Listen we all should know by now that the news we are shown is mostly used to control a narrative for a certain group and this is **NO DIFFERENT OF A TIME**.  The thing that is so unique with this situation is how intertwined things are more than you are lead to believe. 

Does anyone find it amazing that 1 company Robinhood) was able capture the attention of millions upon millions of NEW retail investors by simply creating an app that is understandable and is easy to use? Think of it, Robinhood opened the door to change people’s lives by guiding them through the transaction process for stocks and people started to open their eyes and realize that making money to sustain your life doesn’t need to take a whole bunch of your time away from you. 

So here is where the story begins.

Robinhood as many of you know was **heavily** funded by a Market Maker that is known as Citadel (previously Wellington management, which was founded in 1933 by Walter L. **Morgan**(weird coincidence, but maybe popular name in the day 🙃) as the first balanced mutual fund).

Citadel not only is a market maker, but they also are the providers of a certain component of the transaction process known as immediate or cancel interface. Check out “Citadel Connect” - which essentially is known for the immediate or cancel interface that is baked directly into the transaction process for Brokerages. So they have their hand in a lot of cookie jars across brokerages, to say the least. They also provide a system of algorithmic trading that helps automatic trading for their clients and more! Check out their website, it is eye opening the power this single company really has over the exchange. 

Now keep in mind from before, Citadel gave Robinhood a **SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY** to get them going because they saw a huge opportunity with having **MORE** retail traders joining the party and that opportunity was **DATA**. Citadel has instant and live trading data access to every single trade you make (hence why you usually notice an immediate opposing force from the stock you are buying - buy call and stock goes down right away, buy put and stock goes up right away), this is not something you are imagining, Citadels algorithm is literally taking this data in real time, and placing the most favorable trade for Citadel, which usually starts mind fucking you with your position right off the bat. Remember emotional trading will always lose, and they fuck with your emotions IMMEDIATELY (usually).

So Robinhood —> Citadel.

Next is JP Morgan. The banker. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait up. A *Morgan* started the original Citadel (Wellington), remember? Seems like a killer coincidence! Is Walter somehow related to John Pierpont? Even if indirectly, they bare the same family name... hmmm weird, but I can’t seem to find any relation on good old Google! So we’ll leave this just as a coincidence. 

Back to JP Morgan - they would be the next in line to pay up or default and they are fully aware of the immensity of an infinite squeeze and now are in a position where they would be ones losing huge amounts of money. They have a lot of smart people working for them that quickly caught onto this and starting creating a contingency plan of some kind of to recoup some of the losses they are about to experience.

**This is where $SLV/Silver comes into play and WHY YOU ARE SEEING IT POP UP MORE FREQUENTLY.**

For those who unaware, $SLV is the ishares Silver Trust (which is blackrock’s silver etf). The silver squeeze **IS** something to have happened before and guess who was able to benefit **SIGNIFICANTLY** off of the sell off of the last $SLV rally... JP Morgan. How’d they do this? **They shorted the fuck out of it.** Check out JP Morgan’s history with the precious metals market - https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html. They paid, but still made out like bandits with profits. 

Weird how when JP Morgan is about to lose a metric fuck ton of money, $SLV all of a sudden becomes “viral” and we start seeing it popping up everywhere as the “next squeeze”, but maybe just a coincidence, right? 

Recap Robinhood —> Citadel —> JP Morgan would be the defaulted order. JP Morgan will need to recoup losses somehow, and what better way then A short on Silver whilst writing options during the run up?

Hence why $SLV has became viral.

So in essence. Stay the fuck away from Silver stocks unless you really know what you’re doing. Our mission is to focus on 💎🤲🏻ing GME. **EVERYTHING ELSE THAT IS BEING** ***SHILLED*** **IS A DISTRACTION**. 



Also, Citadel should be another entity we are burning at the stake, not just Robinhood. Citadel is pulling off the greatest heist in history and the rest of the hedgies are just benefiting from this fiasco.

This list is a work in progress but I had to make something because I got tired of trying to remember what shit company to avoid and what person is screwing us over while pretending to be our friend. So below is a list, an uncompleted list but a list none the less. Please help me finish it!

**The obvious foes:**

* Melvin Capital
* Citadel LLC and firm partners - invested $2 billion into Melvin
* Point72 Asset Management's - invested $750 million into Melvin
* RobinHood
* Citron Research and Andrew Left
* Citadel Securities

**The not so obvious foes:**

* Google - taking down bad reviews of Robinhood
* Leon Cooperman - billionaire boomer, hedge fund backer, ""The reason the market is doing what it’s doing is people are sitting at home getting their checks from the government, okay, and this fair share is a bullshit concept.”

The question is, how much more will people pay for GameStop branded merchandise, compared
to a month ago.

GameStop's value is in that it represents rebellion and a striving for fairness- not only from the original short interest, but even more from the media and hedgies blaming retain investors.

Perhaps a stock price of $100 isn't sustainable, but $50 may be.

And this would still obliterate the hedgies, as their positions would still cost them 10-15 x their shorts, and 50-100x the calls they sold.

And if GameStop could demonstrate the legitimacy of this valuation, it would prevent SEC shenanigans that release short interest of their obligations.

ITT we brainstorm what products GameStop could brand, with the cache of their brand.
My vote is a GameStop-branded BlackBerry phone, specializing in simple games, or a unique social chat app.

Here are some others, not my own:

I could foresee a Blackberry/GameStop ecosystem that, shunned by Google, could be a good barrier to normies.
And BlackBerry could sell it as being more secure, instead of the criticism of being exclusionary."

I believe that is partly due to misinformation about the ease of switching so please read if this applies to you.**

Let me start by saying the following: People can sell when they want, buy when they want, and I have no agenda here regarding that.  I also don't work for any other platform and I really don't care which one you move to, if you move at all.  I have read dozens of posts from Robinhood users (I am not a user of their platform) that range from mild displeasure to full-on outrage.  I have read far fewer posts, however, about people actually initiating the process of moving to a better online brokerage option.  There are several but first let's cover some basics so that you are fully informed on how easy it is.  If you had started the process of moving on Thursday when you should have you'd probably be ready by Tuesday/Wednesday of this week so don't delay any further!

**I Read Three Main Concerns, Each I will Briefly Address:**

1. Users think they have to sell their holdings first.  THAT IS FALSE.
2. Users think they can only use one platform.  THAT IS FALSE.
3. Users think the process is difficult or other brokerages cost money.  THAT IS FALSE.

**You Do NOT Have To Sell Anything:** Online brokerages gain and lose clients all the time and anything a transfer occurs it is VERY simple.  I'm finding this aspect of the posts so confusing because it's just as easy to open a new account online at any of the ""Big Boy"" brokerages as it is with Robinhood.  You simply go online, answer questions, and generally your account is open right away!  Next you'll need to fund the new account which you can do in several ways or a combo of a few.  You can link the new account to a checking/savings account you have with a bank, you can transfer assets (UNSOLD) from an old account your new one, and usually one or two other options.  The term for transferring holdings from one brokerage to another is **""In Kind Transfer""**.  Essentially, if you own shares in many stocks or shares in just one stock the old brokerage simply transfers them to the new one.

It would be good to have the routing and account number handy from any account you wish to bring money from too.  If you don't know this simply call your bank first thing Monday morning and ask.  Or go to a branch.  Or go look at the bottom of a check you have and find them there (Google which number is which so you get it right).

**You Can Have Multiple Accounts With Different Brokerages:**  An easier option may simply be to open a new account over the weekend with a different brokerage, get the funds transfer started ASAP, and as soon as the money is there then you can start buying whatever you want from your new account.  You can own *X number* of shares of a company in Robinhood and *Y number* of shares in that same company with a different brokerage.  This is generally what I find my peers to be doing (I'm considered of boomer age by the WSB population) and there are actually a number of reasons to do this.  I think in light of events from this week that point should be self-evident.

**This Process Could Not Be Easier, And Ironically Robinhood (& Others) Applied Pressure Years Ago And Now Most Accounts Have Free Trading:**  That's right, my boomer Vanguard account used to charge a commission for me to buy/sell stock.  Now it is free!  Similarly the commission on options has come down.  Robinhood tricked you into thinking they were doing something different or better.  They actually weren't and certainly now they aren't.

CAVEAT: Vanguard's app sucks.  Some of the other grown-up brokerages apps are better and I've never used Robinhood (but I've seen a million screen shots) and it seems that Robinhood and similar brokerages did design easier platforms, especially mobile-based platforms.  ***HOWEVER, when you've got thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of dollars at stake I'm dumbfounded why a user wouldn't want something LESS basic.***

The transfer may cost you $75 at most (from what I'm reading) but I think the move would be worth it.  But as I wrote above, if you don't want to transfer then just open a new account and keep two open.  One that treats you like shit and tells what you're allowed to do with your money and a new one that appreciates your business and allows you to do whatever you want.  Not sure the choice should be hard here.

**FINALLY, A Note About Margin:** All accounts can have Margin (generally) but that doesn't mean you should use it.  I thought all night about writing this because if you fucks come onto one of my platforms and do a ton of stupid shit and get me banned from being able to buy/sell common stocks I'll be pissed.  But in the effort of giving us, the little guy a chance I felt it better to put this here.  ***Borrowing money to buy stocks is stupid and in the long run you will lose money either from depreciation of account value or interest OR BOTH.***  If you're holding GME on margin right now, for example, you might be best opening a new account and not doing a transfer because you don't want your new brokerage to restrict your trading because you seem high risk.  Obviously some of the bigger, better brokerages may start making their new account process harder anyway if they see an influx of what they deem to be risky investors coming over but I'd suggest you be first in line before that happens if you want to be up and trading THIS WEEK.

I have buried this part at the bottom because I wanted the message to be heard before any of my own thoughts were placed in here.  \*\*I personally am finding it a bit on the nose that so many people are claiming that they're going to ""\*\****hold until Valhalla!""*** **and yet they aren't willing to freeze their trading ability for a 4-5 business day process for a transfer to happen.**  That is suspect AF to me but that's just me.

If people want recommendations of brokerages to consider new accounts with I offer some ideas:

* Vanguard
* TRowe Price
* Merrill Edge (especially if you bank with Bank of America this is going to be your best bet because money should transfer instantly)
* Fidelity
* TDAmeritrade/Charles Schwab (though I may have read they're restricting buying so check that first)

To my knowledge all of these platforms allow you to sign up for a new account instantly online, or very close to it.  If you do nothing over the weekend and nothing first thing Monday morning to correct this Robinhood situation that it seems many of you are in (and believe me, I feel we're brothers in this and therefore I'm trying to help) then I will remain baffled and I'll be sad to see you guys continue to be squeezed.  I have been able to buy dips this past week that you guys weren't and that sucks.  Good luck gents, you no longer have any reason to be dicked around by Robinhood and I suggest you get on this ASAP because this week could get worse.

&#x200B;

*For whatever reason mods keep deleting my shit so I have no idea how long this will be here.  I think it's because a mod accused me of PD-ing on another sub and I called them out but I can't confirm that.*  ***If you are that mod and you read this I'm still holding that position so please consider the disservice of removing this before you do.*** *Disclosure again: I don't work for any of those brokerages mentioned above.*"

Ok, before I retire to my weekend, I have to let you know why I do believe this battle can be won by us only one way and why there is right now more likelihood short sellers can win. 

You know that the Short interest ratio has not changed much and it is still above 100%. And you also know probably borrowing rate for short sellers is >30% per annum, meaning you short 100$, if you keep it for 1 year, you will pay the lender >30$ in interest.

Ok, we have to remember this! Not the same short-sellers might stay in this game forever. Some get in, they get hurt, they get out, someone else takes the rein, meaning not one single hedge fund will pay >30% rate per annum on fees.  They believe this will blow over very soon 1-2 months max, they will pay 5-6% on that shorted stocks but if GME goes down, they will probably make 50-60 maybe 90%. If GME goes up to 600$ they will short at that price, if it rises to 800$ they will short at that, overall, one day they believe (and that day they believe is not 1 year but few months ahead, they will make a ton of money). Therefore, you see SHort interest has not changed much, some have covered, but others have stepped in, believing that the current price is too high, they can make money at this level. 

 They believe this is a beautiful asymmetric risk and reward trade based on historical short squeezes. take the example of VW. Google it. 

TAKEAWAY and ONLY WAY TO SQUEEZE:  ONLY WAY WE CAN REALLY SQUEEZE THEM OUT IS TO HOLD THIS STOCK FOR MONTHS TO COME, NOT 1 or 2 months but maybe 1 YEAR! The only way to bleed them out is to make sure they are shorted for the long term, they pay borrowing rates, they lose money as the stock goes up, they get out, and also, REMEMBER, every quarter they have to send letters to their CLIENTS explaining how their portfolio did. WE HAVE TO KEEP THIS for FEW QUARTERS so that when their investors see their performance, they will either pull the money out or force them to cover! THIS IS LONG TERM GAME guys. YOU have to hold it even if it passes 1000$! THEY BELIEVE this will be over SOON, they will make a ton of money on their shorts and they will be able to show great returns to their clients. WE HAVE TO HOLD IT! LONG TERM! THIS IS THE ONLY WAY! 

If you don't hold it at least for 1- 2 quarters, the game will be won by the last short sellers.

WE REALLY LIKE THIS STOCK!!!

EDIT: This is my hypothesis that as the stock rises, the appetite to short will grow. One of the reasons is because A lot of you keep saying we will sell at 1000$. WHY are you giving them that precious tip?! They know where most of you will exit. As this approaches to 1000$(diamond fingers crossed), they will keep shorting more.  Remember, this is not TESLA. SHORT interest in Tesla declined when TESLA became hundreds of billions in market cap. GME is still 23bln$ there is more way to go. As the market cap grows, shorters' power declines, and they lose interest. Just like in Tesla.

Edit2: then you might ask what is our exit strategy?Remember what u/Deepfuckingvalue said: “what is exit strategy?”  Good night !"

Keep it up!,193,20,2021-01-29 21:37:20,"In the current state of the world, information is abundant. The age of the internet and computers has thrust humans into an indigestible world of data points that has invaded our consciousness. This trend is even more true in the world of the stock market where investors scramble for any information that could give them an edge over their peers. Financial and economic reports and data are countless, these being the things this website hopes to surface and make available to all.

The growth of information has not levelled the playing field. In many ways, the stock market is still “pay to play” with the hedge funds raising the ante every day as they advance their edges against each other and the retail investor. The peek behind the curtain that Michael Lewis’ Flash Boys paints the picture well, hedge funds can have their way with the stock market. Of course, regulators like the SEC and FINRA have “done their part” in protecting the small traders by forcing some sort of transparency. We can after all see selected data on short interest and other long positions. And CNBC is there to keep that information circulating in front of you.

But up until August 2020, Robinhood shared what stocks its investors were holding. That data was available publicly through a portal, and not even slightly as revealing as what it sells to its customers. The platform that first introduced no commission trading, freeing the little guy from the chains of $5-$10 commissions, sells its order data to hedge funds. This means that hedge funds, the same ones that are massively short stocks like GME and AMC, can see what these retail traders on Robinhood are doing. A little like how Google can see your every search and prescribe ads for you before you realize you wanted something. With this data, massive financial firms set up algorithms to beat them before they’ve even started playing.

This game has never been one of symmetric information. Never. Hedge funds and big banks and other financial institutions “winning” this game have known everything that the ordinary person has and then some. Even the Reddit community beating them at their own game, WallStreetBets, is entirely public (for the most part) and has been allegedly spammed by bots from the hedge funds. To say that this community has done anything more than work together to punish the big traders for walking a tightrope on leveraged trades and insane shorting positions is ludicrous. And for Wall Street to think that they could avoid taking the loss by doubling down on their shorts is equally ludicrous.
 
The stock market should be a free market. There should be no distortions created by brokerages restricting anyone’s trading privileges, and the regulators should seek to condemn those who did the restricting. Guess what. Wall Street lost this one. Just like LTCM lost in 1998 after a Russia financial crisis. Just like Lehman Brothers and many other companies lost in 2008 in their dark pools of mortgage-backed securities and derivatives. But this time the little guys didn’t get dragged down with them, and they have the audacity to have disdain for that. $70 billion in losses is not enough of a lesson for them.

But they didn’t lose because the retail trader knew something they didn’t know. The game of asymmetric information continues even in a world flooded with data. Imagine playing chess without knowing where the opponent’s pieces are while he or she knows the positions of yours. MTS Insights will continue to contribute to transparency in the stock market and the economy. We support the pursuit of a level playing field for the retail investor in finance no matter how impossible it may seem to achieve. Onwards and upwards (GME and the like)."

I have returned to inflict more psychic damage upon you about the sick fucks that make up the worldwide disease that is Big Capital. Today, I would like to talk to you about [Kenneth Cordele Griffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_C._Griffin), the founder and CEO of a little company called [Citadel LLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_LLC).

Now unless you have been living under a fucking rock for the past week or have drank yourself to the point of amnesia for one reason or another (forgivable), you are probably by now at least vaguely aware of what Citadel does and how it relates to current events surrounding GameStop and WSB's new favorite hedge fund, Melvin Capital. 

Seeing as how there's a few million more of you here now than there were last month when I was emptying the contents of the bowl of oatmeal that is my brain on these pages about [present day financial crimes perpetrated by Citadel and their ilk](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kbjpqy/an_alternative_hypothesis_for_psth_stripe_for_the/) and the [ouroboros of Western intelligence agencies and Big Capital](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kcm0r9/once_more_unto_the_breach_the_unified_field/), let's do a quick recap. I do hope you take the time to read the full posts, because you may learn something interesting. ^^^PSTH ^^^= ^^^Stripe ^^^🚀🚀🚀

1.  The markets and the flow of capital around the world are rife with financial crime.

1. The vast majority of this crime is perpetrated by large institutions like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Deutsche Bank. Some of this crime takes the form of laundering money for drug cartels, terrorists, pedophiles, and sex traffickers. Some of it involves manipulation of the markets.

1. The regulators in charge of dealing with these fucks are utterly spineless, to the point that any honest person must wonder out loud if they're in on it and getting a take. This phenomenon is known as [regulatory capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture) and is a particularly insidious form of political corruption.

1. The CIA, since its inception in 1947, has acted as a sort of parallel government within the broader United States government, and has been the primary ideological engine of its foreign policy through its ties to Big Capital. That foreign policy has always kept the interests of business as its top priority. One might even call this the Deep State. 

#Who is Ken Griffin?

Ken Griffin is the absolute epitome of the archetypal scumfuck egomaniac asshole that embodies everything that is wrong with the ultra-rich class of Big Capital. Ahem, sorry. Let's try that again.

Ken Griffin started his career out as a 🌈🐻 at the age of 19 while an undergraduate at Harvard, shorting the convertible bonds market and making a bunch of money off of the [October 19th, 1987 crash, more commonly known as Black Monday.](https://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/June-2011/The-File-on-Citadels-Ken-Griffin/) He graduated in 1989, supposedly returned 70% in his first year as a professional fund manager, and went on to found Citadel in 1990. Citadel has swelled to gargantuan size in the last 30 years. It apparently almost [went under in 2008 during the financial crisis](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadels-ken-griffin-leaves-2008-tumble-far-behind-1438655887), but they were fine after the empty suit known as Barack Obama reneged on his campaign promises and fully sealed the transfer of the United States to Wall Street and the rest of the 1%.

He lives in Chicago, but that's not very important. I will note that Chicago has been a historically CIA rat-infested city, as evidenced by the group of [University of Chicago-trained economists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Boys) that helped carry out the regime change ops and aggressive neoliberalization of South America in the 20th century. He's not a complete political partisan, but he does tend to favor Republicans. He has donated to Democratic Party luminaries like [Rod Blagojevich and Rahm Emanuel](https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-met-ken-griffin-political-donations-20190213-story.html), libertarian psychopaths like the [Koch Brothers, and neocon war hawk freaks like Karl ""Turd Blossom"" Rove.](https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-0310-ken-griffin-interview-story.html) His most recent political contributions were to Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, the two imbecilic former Senators from Georgia who were both busted for dumping stocks on insider information shortly before the [Great Beer Virus Crash of 2020.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash) The thread tying these fine folks together is that what most people in the United States think of as politics is more akin to a game show than a real system of governance, and the ultra-rich value their class allegiance much higher than their allegiance to any one political party. As a slight aside, [Loeffler's husband](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sprecher) is the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. How in the fuck is the spouse of a (formerly) sitting Senator allowed to hold that position? Yuck.

(Disclaimer: Griffin may not still own every property in this section and I don't care to find out which, if any, he has divested himself from, because frankly, the levels of opulence make me feel fucking sick. Also, if this is considered d0xxing or something because some of these may be personal residences, I will remove them upon request. This is all publicly available information, though.)

#The Ken Griffin Art Portfolio

Many of the pieces listed here are not held personally by Griffin, but are loaned out to institutions like the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Art Institute of Chicago. For the extreme smoothbrains among you, the reason Griffin blows giant bags on horrible pieces of art and puts them on public display is so that he can use them as tax writeoffs.

Herein lies the part where you may call me a conspiracy theorist if you please, but I think Griffin's art portfolio is indicative of some type of covert relationship with the intelligence agencies. I sincerely do not believe that any person can reach these strata of society without at least brushing elbows with some glowies. The most expensive pieces in his collection come from the school of art known as [abstract expressionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_expressionism), which was [quite literally a CIA-sponsored project](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html) meant to counter the influence of [Soviet realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_realism) during the Cold War. The idea was that the Soviets would see the wacky vomitus that people like Jackson Pollock would spew all over a canvas as an expression of the ideals of freedom and individuality and break free of the bonds of Communism.

* [False Start](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/67552) by Jasper Johns. Housed at the MoMA, purchased by Griffin for $80 million.
* [Curtain, Jug and Fruit Bowl](https://www.theartist.me/artwork/curtain-jug-and-fruit-bowl/) by Paul Cézanne. Housed at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. Purchased by the previous buyer at auction for $60.5 million -- Griffin's purchase price is not known.
* [Self Portrait](https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/self-portrait-1) by Paul Cézanne. I think this is the correct one. He did a whole bunch of these over the course of his life. Price unknown.
* [Water Lilies](https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-monet/water-lilies-8) by Claude Monet. He did like 250 of these, this is the one that comes up when searching it with the year of the one Griffin is known to own, 1905. Price unknown.
* [The Green Dancer](https://www.wikiart.org/en/edgar-degas/the-green-dancer-1879) by Edgar Degas. On display at the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid, Spain
* [Little Dancer Aged Fourteen](https://www.nga.gov/collection/highlights/degas-little-dancer-aged-fourteen.html) by Edgar Degas. An extraordinarily ugly wax sculpture on display at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.
* [Interchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interchange_\(de_Kooning\)) by Willem de Kooning. Abstract expressionist trash purchased for $300 million from noted [Jeffrey Epstein associate and suspected pedophile David Geffen](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/strange-saga-jeffrey-epstein-s-link-brock-pierce-1240462). Recall that Epstein is highly suspected of being some type of intelligence asset tasked with blackmailing rich scumbags by anyone who has studied his story closely.
* [Number 17A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_17A) by Jackson Pollock. More abstract expression trash, also purchased from David Geffen for $200 million.

#How does Citadel spend its money?

Good question! They buy politicians. Remember regulatory capture? Here's Citadel doing just that: current Secretary of the Treasury, former Chair of the Federal Reserve, and sentient potato woman Janet Yellen took more than [$800,000 in speaking fees from Citadel](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2021/01/28/wh_wont_say_if_janet_yellen_should_recuse_herself_after_taking_800k_in_speaking_fees_from_key_figure_in_gamestoprobinhood_scandal_hft_firm_citadel.html#!). In fact, [Yellen ""earned"" over $7 million in speaking fees](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/18/us/politics/janet-yellen-treasury.html) from various other financial institutions including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup between her stints at the Fed and at Treasury. What do we think? Is she just such an enrapturing speaker that she's worth every penny? Or is she getting a kickback for helping to deregulate financial markets and a bribe to look the other way when short sellers and market makers collude to shut retail traders out of the market en masse, like they did yesterday with GME?

They also buy stakes in distressed hedge funds, apparently. Remember the [$2.75 billion bailout](https://nypost.com/2021/01/25/this-short-seller-just-got-a-2-75-billion-bailout/) that Citadel and Point72 gave to Melvin Capital on Monday, which they promptly pissed away doubling down on their GME short? Isn't it weird that Robinhood shut down trading on the very stocks that the hedge funds were bleeding out from and then forced people to liquidate their long positions at the very bottom of a coordinated short seller attack? Doesn't it seem a little strange that the hedge fund branch of Citadel is allowed to own part of another hedge fund that's being bled dry, as [Citadel Securities buys order flow from Robinhood](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1m2p1cv68bx56/Twitter-Freaked-Out-Over-Robinhood-Selling-Its-Trade-Flow-But-the-App-and-Others-Have-Been-Doing-It-for-Years) to [illegally front-run retail orders?](https://imgur.com/0yT6vpJ)

There's also this, on the topic of Melvin Capital and pedophiles and sex traffickers: Melvin Capital's 5th largest long holding is a company called L Brands, which is the parent of Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. Victoria's Secret, as seasoned Jeffrey Epstein gumshoes will know, was founded by one [Leslie Wexner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Wexner), who had a very troubling relationship with Epstein. Epstein was Wexner's personal money manager and Wexner was Epstein's only known client. Wexner and Epstein were so close that [Wexner gave Epstein a mansion on the Upper East Side in Manhattan](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/victorias-secret-epstein/595507/) in 2011, years after it was already known that he was a pedophile creep. Epstein would tell the girls he was sexually assaulting that he was a [modeling scout for Victoria's Secret](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/victorias-secret-epstein/595507/). [Jean-Luc Brunel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Brunel), another Epstein-associated ""modeling scout"" and sex criminal who was [recently arrested in France](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/modeling-agent-jean-luc-brunel-charged-rape-minor-jeffrey-epstein-n1251804), would supply models to Victoria's Secret through his agency MC2 Model Management. Basically, what I'm saying is that Melvin Capital, and now Citadel by extension, are long sex trafficking pedophiles.

#How can I poke this asshole in the eye?

It seems like there's two big things you can do to [do your part.](https://imgur.com/tL98PiA) 

The first is to 💎👐 GME. The institutions are clearly scared shitless at how much blowback is coming their way or they wouldn't be taking such drastic measures to try to tip the scales in the favor of the shorts at the expense of everyone else. Turn off share lending in your brokerage if you can and still haven't.

The second is to transfer your assets out of Robinhood yesterday and graduate to a big boy brokerage. Citadel Securities (remember, this is the market maker, not the hedge fund) [banked a record $6.7 billion in profit last year](https://www.chicagobusiness.com/finance-banking/ken-griffins-citadel-securities-reaps-record-67-billion-volatility). You can bet that this has at least a little to do with the influx of Robinhooders pressing the market order button on their phones and letting Citadel front run their orders while Robinhood gives them a garbage fill.

##TLDR: Ken Griffin final boss. Citadel bad. Robinhood bad. GME go up. Stop FOMOing into other dumb shit and stick to the plan."

Think about it. There’s only two major live streaming platforms targeted towards gaming, Twitch and YouTube. I won’t even mention Facebook streaming because that is something for 🌈🐻plus the YouTube livestream UI is pretty 💩 

Factor in GME’s interest of expanding into eSports, it would be more profitable in the long run for them if they owned their own streaming platform and not have to share profits with Twitch or YouTube. This would also be cheaper than a game Dev studio, which I’ve seen a lot of people mention (those have massive overhead and limited to profits once every 3 years or so, and no one wants to compete with Fortnite)
To pile on, there’s some major streamers out there that currently cannot stream together on air and there’s no alternative platforms on the market to entertain you retards on. For those that don’t know, Twitch won’t let partners stream with other members that were banned, forcing exiled streamers to YouTube with zero alternative. This forces streamers/entertainers into a corner and it sucks to be cornered without any options. These 2 streaming services hold too much power over their talent and it reminds me a lot of our showdown with WallStreet fuckheads like Melvin, Steven Cohen, and Citron. 
And let’s face it, I dunno about you but I really want to see Dr.D and TimmyTheTatman playing with each other on stream again because I miss those two playing together. Also YouTube livestream player is hot garbage and remains a total afterthought because Google knows Streamers have no alternatives, effectively cornering the market. 

I l believe a platform like this would totally justify the current share price as well! 
GME to the moon!! 🚀🚀🚀
Positions: 740 Shares of GME

TL;DR if GME created a gaming livestream platform they could leverage it for their eSports scene and it would let TimmyTheTatman and Dr.Disrespect play together on stream again."

This isn't about you, or your terrible article team. Sit in the back and watch in silence, as you don't have any room to talk.

We are here for 1 thing, a free and fair market. Is it really that much to ask for?

For decades, ""Market Makers"" run the stock market, while the little guy just sits there and plays with his small balances to make ends meet. Sometimes we're lucky, sometimes not.

Ever see the movie Space Jam?

Monstars vs the Loony Toons.

The roided up, guaranteed to win, have all the resources in the world team....vs the average Joes.

But oh no....now we have Michael Jordan (our collective voice) and suddenly it's unfair!

So what, we might lose some money, we might have some issues, but this isn't about GameStop, it's literally about Free and Fair trading, for everyone.

Google a Free Market, tell me that's what we have right now.

Do it, I'll sit here and wait."

I know there's a list going around of who currently (at least throughout the trading day) allows trades, and that's a huge help! Moving forward though, I think it's very important we remember where these companies stood. A few hours ago I [made a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l784j2/it_doesnt_matter_who_ends_their_restrictions_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) arguing that we need to record who restricted trading *at any point during the trading day*. After that post got some good feedback (thanks everyone who commented) I went ahead and made a [preliminary google doc sheet listing these companies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eDXff5R8Njgk8ygNxyjamHS6brUxK7VsRCcmeNzn0lM/edit?usp=sharing). By request, I'm making the post so more people could have the chance to see the link.

If you'd like to have companies added to it, please leave a comment in the cell you believe it should fall under. I'll check this from now through at least the weekend and make updates."

If you open an account on Fidelity and ACH some cash in from your bank account or Coinbase or whatever, you should be able to start buying stocks immediately while your funds settle. It does take more time/steps to get approved for options trading.

**What about the stocks I have in my Robber-Hood account?**

If you have another account that holds stocks like GME on Robber Hood or another brokerage, you can transfer the entire contents of the account, stocks and all, without having to liquidate anything. You just follow Fidelity's asset-transfer process, which comes up easily as a result on Google: 

https://www.fidelity.com/customer-service/transfer-assets

You can choose to transfer an entire account's contents from another broker, including bonds, etc, with just a couple of clicks. It does take a couple of days for the stuff to transfer over.

Edit: Yes Fidelity has a trading app for iPhone, etc. It's pretty good and they have great research tools and news feeds as well. IDK if it's as cool/fun as Robinhood's app, tho."

Dear RobinHood App:

You done f\*\*\*ed up. When you have Rashida Tlaib, AOC, Ben Shapiro, Ted Cruz, and DJT Jr all on the same side, it's pretty clear that you're wrong.

""Let the people trade"" is supposed to be your motto. However, apparently you abandoned it just like Google abandoned their ""Don't be Evil"" motto when $$ showed up.

Sincerely, 

A former customer"

UPVOTE for more chances to win this!,405,32,2021-01-28 22:54:32,"So guys... wow, we have achieved what  nobody thought was possible. We are taking on the big money who has  screwed us average Joes so many time already. This is why the GME is so  important! We are on our way to give more power to the people!!

SO, now what to do? What I will say next is SUPER IMPORTANT for everyone who joined in the last days!!

**We are now playing a mindgame against the big money.**  As we have seen in the past days we are hitting the right spot because  the big hedgefunds are fighting back in every (dirty) way possible. This  shows us we are right. NOW: **They  have ridiculous amounts of money to stretch this play and induce fear  because everybody is waiting for the shortsqueeze to take place.**

THAT'S why HOLDING ON TO YOUR SHARES IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING EVER (or buy more if you can safely afford it)!

The  ride will continue to be bumpy and we have seen ridiculous swings in  the past (+- 30%). Now don't be feared, we are getting there but only if  we don't lose the prisoners dilemma (google this). Now go back and  search this reddit for the incredible due diligence (DD) that has been  done or go watch what Roaring Kitty (aka [/u/deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/deepfuckingvalue/))  has to say on youtube. There are fundamentals that make this play  reasonable but we have to keep a strong mind in the longterm. **Nobody  knows when the hedgefunds will throw the flag, could still be weeks.**  Only then we will win, when the hedgefunds are the first ones to bend  the knee!!!

**HOLD, HOLD, HOLD.**  Whatever happens. Don't check the chart too often. Read this subreddit  or go wanking. Whatever distracts, but don't check your account.

**So, why should you continue to buy and hold GME?**

Big hedge funds bet heaps of money that GME 🚀 would go bankrupt and have been put against a wall. If investors (and retail investors like us retards) hold, this forces the hedge funds to cover AKA buy back stock at whatever price is available AKA a short squeeze.

Time for some learning so take your rockets and listen the fuck up space-cadets: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Now that I have your full attention - pretty much the butt pirates over at Melvin Capital **fucked up big time**. Melvin along with Citron Research (AKA Andrew ""Smoothbrain"" Left) and a few other companies shorted, expecting it to continue to lose ALL revenue. Now, the problem is, they overshorted GME by about \~140 fucking percent.

Essentially as long as investors can 💎 HOLD 💎 past the initial burst of buy-backs (which ***could*** be as soon as Friday with how many ITM options are sitting on Melvin's books). If you don't understand 'Days to Cover' I suggest doing some ACTUAL FUCKING RESEARCH but in short:

*""****Days to cover****, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted.* ***Days to cover*** *is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question.""*

**Short Interest (Shares Short):** 61 - 71.2M

**Short Interest Ratio (Days To Cover):** 2.1 - 6.3

*^(\*there is some disparity here between data sources - approx. as reported 28th Jan 2021)*

As long as everyone holds their GME stocks, this demand by Melvin and Citron will continue to drive up the price, and this can go on technically till GME hits X number because they can only close their positions once people start selling. Remove your fucking sell limits if you like money.

**No selling > no shorts closing > demand for the stock increases > price goes up even higher.** There is no ceiling to this, the power is in your hands to buy and hold.

The point here is, the covering will take **DAYS** to happen. DAYS. No space cadets left behind so get your fucking helmet ready for launch.

Nokia is now a market leader in networking and enterprise level technology, essentially providing infrastructure for all types of networks. They also manufacture telecommunications equipment and engage in licensing. The most exciting opportunity in their current business model is 5G, which could be the main catalyst for this seemingly boring stock to finally break through resistance and become a valuable asset in portfolios. I'll give some key updates and price targets below. 


Partnerships and beneficiary of 5G rollouts


For starters, it's been a common thesis that 5G will be the greatest investing opportunity of the decade, yet Nokia remains in a flat/downward pattern on the chart. They've recently earned several contracts that will give them a stronger moat in the 5G domain as well as steady revenues and growth opportunities. Recent contracts come from a very diverse group of partners, including: 

-A 5 year deal with T-Mobile, in which T-Mobile will power it's 2.5GHz mid-band spectrum using Nokia's AirScale Radio platform. In addition, Nokia will facilitate T-Mobile to upgrade it's mid-band LTE network to a 5G network. 

-Secured a government contract via the National Cybersecurity Center for Excellence. Nokia was selected as the tech provider and collaborator for the 5G Cybersecurity Project. The federal agency plans to utilize Nokia's technology for the transition to 5G from 4G. The project intends to identify 5G use cases to highlight the efficacy of the components of 5G architecture against security threats as part of a government initiative to beef up it's cyber security and anti-spying tools.

-Partnership with Google Cloud in which the 2 firms will work in unison on businesses' digital transformation at the network edge through both 5G connectivity and cloud-native applications and capabilities. The partnership's purpose is to develop solutions for communication service providers to modernize network infrastructure and ensure smooth transitions to cloud-native 5G-core. This will likely build an ecosystem of services that deployable anywhere, from network edge, to public clouds, private clouds, and carrier networks. 

-Nokia has also recently announced partnerships with M1 for 5G solutions in Singarpore, as well as TeleZ to deploy key infrastructure solutions for TeleZ subsribers in Sweden, Lativa, Lithuania, and Estonia. They were also awarded a contract by NASA for $14.1 million to build 4G infrastructure on the moon. 


Nokia has more than 220 large enterprise customers across industries worldwide, of which at least 30 have deployed 5G. They were also in a geopolitical battle in which the U.S. expressed interest in owning a piece of the company, and in response Finland built it's stake in Nokia via Solidium Oy, the state's equity-asset manager, to 1 billion euros($1.2b usd). Nokia also intends to repurchase 500 million shares in the coming months, so demand for the stock is picking up on all levels. 


In addition to infrastructure, licensing is a huge part of Nokia's business model that will benefit from 5G. The ""Nokia Technologies"" Arm handles patent licensing, technology licensing, and brand licensing. This includes an industry-leading patent portfolio including ~20,000 patent families including ~3500 5G standard essential patent families. 


So why is a company with so many valuable assets and recently announced deals/partnerships still trading flat and so seemingly undervalued? The short answer is the former CEO made several bad choices which gave Nokia's competitors an upper hand on the current 5G landscape and put NOK share price in a long term downtrend which has gave it a reputation as a boring stock with an ugly chart. However, with new CEO Pekka Lundmark's expertise in driving returns to shareholders, as well as the scrutiny and subsequent bans of Huawei opening the door for competition, Nokia now has a much needed breath of life and a chance to gain market share to become the biggest beneficiary of the 5G revolution. The new CEO is determined to get Nokia to the top and pull in solid returns to shareholders, as evidenced by the slew of recent contracts/partnerships along with his plans for spending aggressively on R&D, as well as developing a leaner business model by cutting unnecessary expenses and unprofitable endeavors. 


Nokia is primed for growth as they plan into several emerging, high growth markets including 5G, IoT, Edge computing, Network Encryption, Cloud Radio Access, Software Defined Infrastructure(SDI), Cloud Managed LAN, Optical Communications and Networking, as well as established high growth markets such as Smart Wearables, Defense/Security, and LTE. 



Despite the slew of positive news surrounding Nokia and their partnerships/contracts, the stock is still very undervalued, even at today's price surge. 

That may soon change, as the stock's chart is beginning to signal incoming volatility. The implied volatility(IV) and volume for NOK call options are indicating big moves in the coming months. Open interest is on the rise as well. 




NOK is trading at a Price/Book ratio of 1.3x, compared to it's peers average of 4.0x and the sector average 2.2x 

NOK is also undervalued in terms of Price/LTM sales. It has a ratio of 0.9x, it's peers trade at an average of 3.9x, and the sector average of 1.8x

To establish the Fair Value Estimate, we'll use 2 models taking input from previous NOK financials, as well as data from competitors. (Competitors include: CSCO, ERIC, MSI, MSFT, and AAPL.

P/E Multiples: $14.94 target 

Earnings Power Value: $15.64 target 

The average for the 2 models imply a Fair Value Estimate of $15.29 




These estimates are based on historical data, therefore are fair values for the current price and past performance, not taking into account the market share and recurring revenue recently secured. I believe over the 3 months ad beyond the fair value will be much higher as earnings begin to reflect the value and growth from 5G contracts and recurring revenues. 


Even currently, those estimates are a bit low as Nokia's closest competitor, Ericsson, has a market cap that is nearly 70% higher than Nokia, despite the two having very similar financials and even trailing Nokia in several key metrics. 



At NOK's current share price of, it remains undervalued as ERIC is only ahead of NOK in 2 key categories, EBITDA and Profit Margin, and ERIC is only outperforming NOK by a slim margin in these categories. I believe NOK should be valued much higher, than ERIC since they are gaining contracts MUCH faster than ERIC and also Huawei, which would imply a share price of $7.11 before any buybacks place shares into the treasury, which would increase the price even further. 


Nokias Fair value is over $25

This is based on competitor ERIC who is valued 68.4% higher despite having trailing NOK in almost every key metric for valuation, and the valuation of Huawei who is losing tons of revenue and contracts in favor of Nokia"

3.

&#x200B;

Considering the fact that you are in French Revolution mode, would you consider starting shorts in a wrecked journalistic outlet from the Spanish extreme left? It's name is [PRISA](https://www.investing.com/equities/prisa-financial-summary) (""Promotora de Informaciones, S.A.) (Investor Relations [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=PRISA+INVESTOR+RELATIONS&rlz=1C1CHBD_esES860ES860&oq=PRISA+INVESTOR+RELATIONS&aqs=chrome..69i57.3295j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8))

&#x200B;

Points:

\-FINANCIALS: it's an absolute ruin of business, it only survives thanaks to the fact that Spanish banks have become shareholders. Check their financials [here](https://www.investing.com/equities/prisa-financial-summary)

&#x200B;

\-[SHAREHOLDERS](http://www.cnmv.es/Portal/Consultas/DerechosVoto/Notificaciones-Participaciones.aspx?qS={c63f29c7-4140-4e6c-b4ef-e4b4d3547688}): most are former creditors (mostly Spanish banks\*) or corporate investors caught in past investments made at the heat of the financial and real estate bubble that Spain experienced a decade ago. 

So it's not very likely that they will expand their positions to safeguard the share price. The [news](https://www.vozpopuli.com/medios/amber-elpais-cadenaser-prisa_0_1411359754.html) highlighting their intentions to want to get out of PRISA are common. In fact if you google PRISA + X shareholders you will find a handful of news about each of them.

There is also a Qatari sheikh linked to corruption in Spanish football,  International Media Group (Al Jazeera Dubai Media and CNBC) and a couple of British hedge funds. 

&#x200B;

\-VOLUME: guys, it's a microcap from a small country like Spain... There are days when it has a volumen less than €50.000...

&#x200B;

P.S. vol\_I Those same Spanish banks are known (and hated) here for having carried out an aggressive and cruel policy of evictions on unemployed people who could not pay their mortgages when the financial and real estate crisis broke out

P.S. vol\_II Spanish governemnt/bank subsidied media conglomerate hates you american guys. They have spent the last four years making documentaries about how stupid you were because of your political vicissitudes."

As many of you may have noticed, there is a huge amount of brand new, 0 karma accounts shilling several stocks, most notably NOKIA

Obviously this just happens to coincide with all the attention this sub has been getting from mainstream media at the moment

Wall street is **not amused** by the idea of the ""little guy"" making money, so what are their options? Stop losing money by adapting to the new era trading? Not a chance for those **fucking boomers**

What they'd do is do what works best: sabotage their competition. One way to accomplish that would be to """"""prove"""""" that we are market manipulating (which is hard to do when you can tell at a glance that most people here are apes bashing coconuts together)

They could theoretically use these accounts as a last ditch effort to plant false ""evidence"", which they could later point to the SEC/legislature/whatever as ""proof"" of Reddit being the cause of disruptive behaviour to the market

Of course, I may be completely wrong. But of this I am certain:  we had the audacity to stand up to Wall Street and **they will make us bleed**"

&#x200B;

today i want to introduce you to Nokia #NOK. 🚀

The year is 1865 in Finland – NOK was founded. Our beloved God Elon didnt even exist as a sperm back then; nor did your boomer grandpa. NOK took vegetables and made paper out of it. Then they decided to make phones and computers. 

In 2014 NOK sold their phone business to Microsoft for billions. Microsoft sold it to HMD global. NOK still receives royalties for their name. So NOK is not a phone company anymore (do not confuse the 2 when researching). 

Today, NOK is far more advanced than making paper from paprika or selling undestructable phones. By taking over a joint-venture from Siemens in 2013, Alcatel-Lucent in 2015 and continuous work, aquisitions and research, they now pose as a major player in hardware and software for critical communication technology. More about this later.

In August last year (2020), NOK hired one of their key phone infrastructure employees back. He was there from 1990 – 2000. And now he is back as CE fucking O. 🚀

In between 2000-2020 he did some random shenanigan CEO stuff. His name is Pekka (#CoC) Lundmark. NOK have 2 other new executives, very capable.

5G - The economic future outlook is looking very juicy compared to NOK’s share price: 

NOK has a market share of 22%. Sure, Ericsson has 26, Huawei has 28.5%. But Huawei is kicked out of Europe, North America, and now many more.The list of countries banning Huawei is growing fast. Who is happy to take over, even in asia? (look at Singapore, partly Thailand f.e.) NOK, Samsung, Ericsson. NOK will have a pie of it. 🚀

[https://www.channele2e.com/business/enterprise/huawei-banned-in-which-countries/](https://www.channele2e.com/business/enterprise/huawei-banned-in-which-countries/)

EV with autonomous driving will need 5G to be connected perfectly. Also autonomous traffic such as drones will rely on this heavily. Guess who produces infrastructure for this, and offers safe communication infrastructure solutions already tested? NOK. 🚀

The finnish, norwegian and swedish governments already bought into NOK. 5G with secure critical infrastructure is a big deal.

What else? NOK is involved in cyber-security slightly similar to #BB BlackBerry. 

Nokia Smart Grid for securing power stations; Network security in general; IOT security and Railway infrastructure security.

5G will be developed faster than you think. According to Ericssons 2020 mobility report, 40% of all mobile internet subs will be 5G – 3.5 billion users in 2026. You might think thats 6 years still, but remember that its 40% of all mobile subs, and where are 3.5bn of subs? Except EU and NA – think China, India, South america, africa, south east asia. Massive numbers.

I didnt look to far in research and development; NOK has claimed some 3000 patents for 5G, but Huawei is the leader right now. What seems interesting though is that NOK is ahead in confirmed patents. 

https://preview.redd.it/0m0suzawnwd61.png?width=815&format=png&auto=webp&s=635e3eeb409ada0404f6caae272b77066224c523

&#x200B;

The discussion about the patent leaders are diffuse. TwoBirds said that Ericsson was leading, with Huawei questioned as to if their numbers were legit. Qualcomm is also a major player. 

**My point though is that NOK’s stock is still flat,** while Qualcomm and the others significantly gained. (Except Huawei, political risk)

**Conclusion:**

NOK is worth a buy IMO. Traffic of tomorrow will rely heavily on secure 5G infrastructure. NOK’s basic revenue is solid, cash flow positive. They will pay dividends, and are a big competitor in a growing sector. They will need their time though, they wont skyrocket next month. 

This is not a YOLO play. As u/ST_McD pointed out, NOK is not the next GME. I see good upside on this stock though, around 100% until next year. 

For 2 other good DD's on this, check u/ST_McD and u/zepherance. Special thanks to u/zepherance, I used some info from ur DD. 

&#x200B;

Position: long 4000 @ 3.85 Eur. Looking to get calls soon - 8c Jan 22. 

This is not financial advise, I'm not a bot and this is not distortion of GME - im holding.

My DD is just a quick google search so you know I really spent the time making sure you tards were educated.

Last night I visited the MSNBC revolving door brothel and while my dick was rammed down a Boomers throat, I got to thinking about what kind of Charities WSB should be donating to! At half time, my mom brought me orange slices and a juice box. I asked her what she would do and she suggested ... the Affordable Housing cause! 

And, with a quick google search... 

***Why is affordable housing a problem?***

***Increasing access to affordable housing bolsters economic growth. Research shows that the shortage of affordable housing costs the American economy about $2 trillion a year in lower wages and productivity. ... This would have led to a $1.7 trillion increase in income, or $8,775 in additional wages per worker.***

Perhaps the most recognizable affordable housing group is Habitat For Humanity. But, there are plenty of Affordable Housing non-profit organizations all across the world. In fact, there are even cities that sponsor and/or run their own affordable housing initiatives! There are even tertiary non-profits that specifically are there just to raise money for the affordable housing cause. 

So, I challenge you all, after Andrew Left and company are bleeding from the throat, to find an affordable housing cause that will help those in your community that couldn't YOLO their 600$ in life savings on GME.

Lastly, I'm a tard but someone told me you can write off charitable donations on your taxes! 

DISCLAIMER:  This is not investment, legal, or financial advise. My current positions are - 200+ hours of Sweat Equity with Habitat For Humanity, Biked 4500miles for Affordable Housing with BikeAndBuild, 500+ hours of Sweat Equity with other smaller Affordable Housing groups.

P.S. If you have other non-shit charities to suggest. Please leave them in the comments so others can discover a charitable option that makes since for them."

Microvision was founded in 1993 to commercialize Virtual Retinal Display technology, in which images are drawn directly on the viewer’s retina.  Massive amounts of wealth has been pushed into R&D and patents, and has taken their toll in the past 28 years, accumulating a $572.6M deficit as of Dec 31, 2019. This amount has allowed them to accumulate 484 Granted and Pending Patents, and 28 years worth of Intellectual Property in design, testing, and manufacturing laser scanning devices.   Microvision is currently run by CEO Sumit Sharma. Before joining MicroVision Sumit Sharma was also Head of Operations for Google Glass for over 2.5yrs.   On April 2, 2020 they hired Craig-Hallum to help them find a strategic investment (which include M&A).. They signed Mark Spitzer, and Judy Curran to the board to help them facilitate this strategic investment.

 Microvision is the leader in MEMs Laser Beam Scanners (LBS). A key technology which could unlock consumer grade near eye displays, and long range automotive LIDAR.  (Explain like I’m 5) – The lasers work in coordination with the mems mirror. A current is applied through the silicon, which produces a “wobble” as seen in the gif. ASICs (basically a chip) controls the lasers, and the wobble of the mirror to be able to paint a 1440p image at 120hz (in the Hololens 2). The same method is applied with an infrared laser to be able to track objects, and provide 20 million pts/s.

Microvision allowed Microsoft to double their field of view (surface area), by switching from Liquid Crysta on Silicon Panels (built by Himax), to the laser scanning system without increasing the volume of the Light engine, while reducing the weight, and power found in the Hololens 2.   The doubling of field of view, does not mean less pixels per inch either.. As Hololens 2 has been able to maintain their pixel density, allowing user to be able to still read fine print through the near eye displays, unlike other components. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0qgqb8hglwd61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1a255a3e202a3e33dd328094bdb52dbe402d635

The basic concept of why Microsoft switched from a “Panel” type display like Liquid Crystal on Silicon, and decided not to use more expensive, and less mature technologies like MicroLED or MicroOLED is that with the panel type displays, the panel needs to proportionally get larger as the field of view expands. This makes it a challenge for designers and engineers trying to make a light weight consumer near eye display for augmented reality and mixed reality.  The beauty of the laser scanners is by adding a mirror, and a RGB module, they can change the angle, and create a larger FOV without proportionally getting larger. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wvdmh9whlwd61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=405bc391b0b630fadec2f1e702032e3acb6566e8

Sharp / Socle (Foxconn) have already roadmapped a smaller RGB Laser Module to be used for near eye displays. Their mass production of these modules will only make it cheaper to use, as the technology accelerates. This also solves other issues regarding how much power the lasers draw (barely already), being able to create even greater efficiencies in immersion by creating wider field of views and something called “foveated rendering” which reducers graphical processing power by up to 70% in some cases.  High definition, wide field of view, low cost of processing. Holy grail of near eye displays. This is another reason why we believe Dr. Mark Spitzer come out of retirement, to join Sumit Sharma on the Board of Directors of Microvision.

2023 - 17.2 Billion  

2024 - 24.3 Billion  

2025 - 34.3 Billion  

Or an estimated market market opportunity of 96.6 Billion dollars total of potential in the next 5 years. Now if a purchase of MVIS can capture even 30% of that potential, a purchase of the company, even with the associated yearly operating expenditures of many million dollars a year, the potential market share would be nearly 29 Billion dollars of value. How much does a prospective buyer pay for just the AR related MVIS tech when they could control 30% of a nearly 100 Billion dollar market over the next 5 years?

There is no confirmation that Microsoft is utilizing Laser Beam Scanners for their Integrated Visual Augmentation System contract for the US Army.   We only have Microsoft patents that show how they plan on achieving wider FOV’s, and that the Hololens 2 was used as the platform to create the IVAS device. Currently Microvision has not given guidance for finances in 2021, which we assumed is because of ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) regulations and NDAAs.  Most evidence we've compiled is circumstantial, but it's the same kind of information that allowed us to realize Microsoft was utilizing Laser Beam Scanners from Microvision in the first place.

Microvision is leveraging their 28 years of experience to create small (size of a VHS tape), powerful (OVER 200m range), and wide FOV’s (dynamically changing).  Re: How this is Solid State-  The weight/mass is so minimal, it is considered part of the chip... impervious to vibration. If I understand it correctly. From a physics perspective, imagine a brick and a tiny piece of fabric sitting on the passenger seat next to you when you drive. The brick is going to jump around with every bump. The fabric will be unaffected. Too small and light.

Low cost, small size.  Think of how Microvision was able to create an interactive laser projection system in a smart speaker with an MSRP of $199. One word: “Scalability”

Luminar, the market leader for LIDAR with it’s recent SPAC, is currently using a Mechanical MEMS system utilizing a polygon mirror the size of your eye, that spins aong with a planar mirror.  Their “Solid State” Lidar solution called IRIS doesn’t have very much published information, but a dive into their patent holdings shows the use of DMD style MEMS (solid state) which is owned by Texas Instruments.   This is the same technology used in Laser Projectors for theatres, that have excessive heat, excessive price, and excessive sizes (due to the heat sinks and fans required to manage the heat).   Had to look up the Luminar patent to find the vertical FOV, 120degx45degx300pts per squaredegree = 1.6 Million points... and we can't even complete the calc because hey maybe it refreshes a bunch of times a second...

Craig-Hallum and Microvision are currently focused on finding a strategic alternative, which incudes the possible sale of the company. It’s a dragged out process, but we’ve found multiple Tier 1’s that have shown they plan on expanding into the space Microvision currently holds large IP for (near eye displays and Lidar) which would unlock Consumer grade products for these OEMs.   Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook is just a small sample… which would include companies like Amazon, Google and other large whales.

We have more power at this moment than almost any other force in the markets. We are moving the market more then stock picking firms like Motley Fool or any other recommendation firm. This morning people didn't wake up and trade based on their stock screeners. They heard what we where buying and joined. This increases our buying power by a factor of 10 or 100 or 1,000.

We now have the ability to send many more stocks to prices that we see fit because we have our buying power as well as the masses that are following.

While GME and AMC have been great and I think we have enough power to send them where we want them there is the inevitable topic of what happens to them long term. Perhaps they use this momentum and catch their companies up to the price. Perhaps the company and the price remain detached and the price stays high. Simply a place to park money with limited shares causing high prices regardless of the business behind it. A worse option is that the price eventually lowers and this becomes a spike on the chart.

To overcome this I am suggesting we start to find companies that will spike and stay high moving forward possibly forever. Not only will they move higher but they will have more leverage with the increased price to increase growth exponentially.

I think it is time for this group to go through some process to identify 5, 10 or 50 stocks (or a weekly pick) that we think are growth companies that if we send to the moon will be able to carry the momentum from a business stand point. This isn't as fun because it does't screw the institutions as directly. It would certainly block them from shorting many stocks moving forward which is a historic change. We also can't overlook that every time we extract money from the market we beet the institutions.

I see companies that this would be great to do to like LAC (Lithium Americas), OPRA (Opera Ltd), VRYYF (The Very God Food Company)

These are companies that will grow anyways (most likely) but if we set that motion it will grow much more and much quicker. Take LAC for example. Their most likely course forward is to see a partner announced causing a spike followed by news release about their new mine causing increases. As news follows their natural growth and the natural growth of the EV sector natural price increase will follow.

If we purposefully target a company like this we will again rewrite history. Perhaps instead of a company like Tesla buying or partnering with LAC the flood of money to their shares causes them to not need a partner and start being the one buying up other mining companies. Instead of seeing a price double through a partnership with someone like Tesla they become the next Tesla. Not just in terms of share price but in terms of importance to the industry.

The same logic applies to a company like OPRA. Talk about real power, we could shift actual market share of users away from google by sending OPRA to the moon.

I think we need to not let this moment go to waste. We can send stocks to the moon. Through doing so, we can literally shape the world around us. If we pick companies that can keep up as we send their stock to the moon, we may hold this power for years to come. I recommend LAC, OPRA, VRYYF, or companies like them. Perhaps a poll could be implemented at some point and their could be a vote of the week or something along those lines.

All I know is we have become powerful and we should plan accordingly to keep that power. If we want to really screw institutions we get the masses to follow our moves not theirs moving into the future. As we pick companies that can sustain growth we make our recommendations spike and hold. As we do that our power goes to the moon. Let the conversation flow about what our future should look like, but lets not let this go to waste. As we moon growing good business our word becomes gospill and we become more powerful than any institution. Thats an opportunity we should act on. Pick a good company. Grow a good company. Repeat. I see that as our future."

AMC is the largest movie theater chain in the country. The pandemic has hurt small business, movie theaters included. The pandemic has concentrated market share on the biggest players, meaning AMC now dominates more of the pie. 

Theaters aren't going away anytime soon. Nicholas Christakis predicted in Apollo's Arrow that we will see a Roaring 20s after the vaccine. The Roaring 20s will see theaters and movie industry boom just like it has historically. Media companies will release a floodgate of movies and demand will be sky high for a while. 

AMC is poised to capture most of that demand and growth, especially given its recent investments into upgrading theaters. Imagine the hype coming from higher demand, tons of stimulus money, and backed up releases. 

300 shares $AMC @ 5.10

TLDR

The largest theater chain in the country will gobble up the remains of the weaker business that couldn't survive the pandemic. AMC will gain a greater share of the pie for greater long term growth. Roaring 20s will see business boom. AMC to the moon. 

And buy the dip! Going right back to $23.

I have better data supporting this, just on mobile right now. Will update with figures. BTW, check Google trends today, AMC tops the results! Publicity means shares go up"

# GameStop History Lesson:

**tldr**: GME bumbles about like a senile boomer and dabbles in terrible bets. Turns into undervalued stock with cultural significance, gets picked up by Big Dick Burry and Ryan Chewy Cohen.

GME is a childhood dream that turns any grown man into an autist as soon as he walks into the door. Now due to our Lady Rona (covid), a bunch of past Boomer business decisions ([GME fucking bough 507 AT&T stores](https://news.gamestop.com/node/10001) in 2014, not pivoting into omni-channel, [largely misssing the gaming industry explosion](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf), and [a CEO](https://news.gamestop.com/leaders/george-sherman) who prides himself on brick and morter Advance auto parts, Best Buy, Target, Home depot) GME by and large was shitting the bed as investors thought of this company as neglected mallfront with dwindling clientele.

&#x200B;

**In comes Michael big dick Burry**

With the stock trading at $3.78/share in August 2019 investers were sure it was finished. But here's where it gets interesting. With big dick energy seemingly out of no where Michael Burry *(yes that dude in the Big Short who seems like a fellow autist)* buys 2,750,000 shares or 3.05% of GameStock. In his actual [letter to the board](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190819005633/en/) *(yes I dug it up so you can read it as well)* he describes the thought process for the purchase bullets below.

* GameStop was trading at an all-time low ($3.78/share) and he believed that it had not leveraged it's ""elite potision in the gaming universe"" over the last 5 years *(keep in mind, it's fucking GameStop a cultural icon large enough to make a grown man weep with fond memories*
* Shareholders do not have faith in current managament and have not been inspired by new leadership policies
* At time of writing stocks were more than 60% shorted

&#x200B;

*(Taking a break to say, it's not too late the* ***squeeze has not been squoze*** *oblig 💎🙌 = 🚀🚀)*

&#x200B;

**Ryan mega dick Cohen writes a letter**

Then in Nov 16th 2020, Ryan Cohen comes in swinging and tears a new one to the board members of GameStop. For people who don't know who Ryan Cohen is, he stuck the finger to Amazon and [built a digital e-commerce site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewy_(company)) (wiki link) for fucking dogs and cats into a $3.35 billion entity by 2017. Keep in mind that he submitted a Schedule 13D to purchase 121,644 shares at $6.56 per and 163,030 at $8.63 - that's a 10% stake [(yes, I've also dug the original Schedule 13d using google)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000699/rc13da2-091820.htm). Now Ryan's letter reads like a solid talking down that might rival the Queen - looking at you [r/TheCrownNetflix](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrownNetflix/), [r/AskUK](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/).

[I've included Ryan's letter to the board](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf) but will bullet point paraphrase below for you folks still on Yahoo or Ask Jeeves.

* GME has a strong brand across the globe and has 55 million PowerUp members
* GME needs to pivot immediately to a tech structure and it can *(lolz, after this letter they immediately brought Ryan and Chewy co onto board)*
* Size of the global gaming market has grown more than **2.5x** since the last console cycle

&#x200B;

**Ryan mega dick Cohen and team join GameStop board**

In January 2021 [Ryan Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen), [Alan Attal](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/alan-attal), and [Jim Grube](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jim-grube) join GME's board. Now for those of you in the bread line or living at your wife's mothers house playing [r/DnD](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/) with her boyfriend, board changes are big news. These board members have the power to make multiple grown men cry, fire CEOs like it's nothing and change a companies strategy sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.

With Papa Cohen coming onboard and his squad of Chewy troopers, it's likely that we are going to soon see a pimped out GameStop that will make you name your first born ""GME"". Now I'll let you do your own digging and reading but here's just some of the GME DD on it's future potential [(link to DD on some of GME's possible pivots](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/), [One DD to rule them all](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/))

# The squeeze has NOT been squoze:

There is still time for you to convince your wife's girlfriend to lend you money to buy GME. The squeeze has not been squoze and likely wont until we see the type of eruption that accompanied [r/belledelphineXmas](https://www.reddit.com/r/belledelphineXmas/) leaks (yes that sub is NSFW).

Side note on the Squeeze, GME is still massively over shorted at estimates from 130-300% and counting. The important thing to know is that these greedy bastards took multiple short positions on a single stock (naked) and essentially bet that GME was going to go down.

[https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today) (249.67% Shorted)

&#x200B;

**But what happened on Thursday/Friday?**

Gamma squeeze. Short and simple. Now you can read some other DD about what a gamma squeeze so I wont dive into it too much.

It was not the squeeze. Market makers needed to rush to fill calls that were In The Money. This prompted these market makers to buy up stock in the off chance that they needed to actually sell them to degens who were actually betting that GME would blow it's sweet load at 60 and now at 150 lolz. This pared with the low stock volume on the market makes for high volitility on a per stock basis. Here's some [DD links talking about what a Gamma squeeze what we witnessed was that.](https://nope-its-lily.medium.com/gamestop-power-to-the-market-players-part-2-6ef00eff1d26)

**Okay, I've asked my wife's girlfriend nicely and now have $1k...**

Buy fucking shares. No legit, support your random internet brethren *(who don't know each other)* and buy shares of GameStop. Every share you buy bleeds money from Citron and Melvin.

Here's an explanation from [u/robert1032010](https://www.reddit.com/u/robert1032010/) a Hedge Fund Manager on the current short position within GME: [(A hedge fund managers perspective on GME)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/)

>The short positions of this issue appears (although I can't be certain) to exceed 100% with all available shares already lent out from marginal accounts and probably a lot of naked shorting going on as well. Although I don't yet have the current data on todays short position, I can say for certain the stock remains very heavily shorter, perhaps more so now than at any previous time. Today, I called my broker asking about the availability of shares to short and the borrow costs. We have one of the larger accounts at our brokers firm and I was able to speak directly to the ""hard to borrow"" desk. No borrowable shares are available at any broker, anywhere, at this time, even for high borrow costs or even from other brokers. This extreme short against a small common float, made more extreme no-doubt by naked shorting, could end very poorly for those short this issue. As they are forced to close out their positions, the stock will continue to rise and continue to exacerbate the positive effects the rising price has on the above 4 issues.

&#x200B;

Lastly, this is not financial advice; do your own DD. I'm holding $20k at $100/share and yes, I still fucking believe that the tendieman will come and rain tendies.

Why? Because market makers are jacking up margin requirements in an effort to make investors sell GME.

**With margin, you don't even have to lose money to be margin called:**

In this case of GME shares, they simply increased Margin requirements from 100% to 80%. Instead of $20,000 margin for GME, now you can only use $16,000. But you already had $20,000 of margin invested in GME, now they will tell you that you must deposit $4,000 to cover that gap.

**But.**

You can just sell $4,000 of **ANY** positions to fix the Margin Call, you do NOT have to actually deposit $4,000. Robinhood is informative about your options to solve the call but not sure with other brokerages. I commented on Margin on some posts here on WSB, and got a ton of questions about how margin works. **This is for the new guys who don't understand how institutions manipulate and steal from you yet.**

I only really know for Robinhood users. If you use a different brokerage just google how to find out.

Desktop: Account -> Settings -> Margin Investing (Enabled, Disabled)

Mobile: Profile -> Settings -> Robinhood Gold -> Margin Investing (on/off).

&#x200B;

***TL;DR***: Don't use margin to gamble, especially on extremely volatile stocks like GME! Margin should only ever really be considered for collateral (selling cash-secured puts). And don't be fooled into depositing when you don't have to. Buying on Margin also actually helps the big institutions!

**Rest assured, even though RH is trying to force me to sell 40 GME shares, IM NOT FUCKING SELLING! I'm holding through my Margin Call!** **GME**  💎  🤲   **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**

This is why Nokia will boom in 2021. Like $BB, it is no longer a phone company, but is now a major contender in 5G, autonomous driving, AI tech and cyber security. In fact, it almost sounds like a better blackberry with more upside potential. $NOK is trading at $4.75 at the time of writing. It saw a steady decline since it's previous high of $5 in August of 2020, but has since recovered in the last 4 months. 

The reason for the initial selloff was a corporate decision to cut jobs to free up cashflow for large projects going forward. At this time they also halted dividends which pissed off some older retirees, as expected. Now here is the various reason this stock can deliver massive returns in the next 12-36 months.

**Selected for U.S. Federal 5G Security Project**

The project is to ensure a secure transition from 4G to 5G because of the various risks perceived by the general public, to whom security comes above all else. Nokia will provide both software and hardware solutions, and work with both NCCoE and Government to implement.

**Nokia wins Belgian 5G contracts as Huawei ousted**

To put it short, Nokia was chosen to implement 5G technology in Belgium as US continued to put pressure on literally everyone to end business with Huawei over potential security threats.

**5 Year Deal with T-Mobile**

T-Mobile will be using Nokia's Airscale Radio Platform to scale up 5G deployment. As well as this, Nokia will personally facilitate T-Mobiles upgrade from LTE to 5G, which is by all means a large project

**Partnership with Google Cloud**

Googles cloud computing services will be working together with Nokia to help businesses transform their network connectivity through the implementation of 5G and new cloud capabilities.

**Contract Secured with Tele2 in Sweden**

The amount has not been disclosed but it involves deploying 5G infrastructure for Tele2 subscribers in Sweden, to improve network performance and security. They will also use Nokia's NetAct Cloud Management system to improve management and security of sensitive subscriber data.

**Partnership with M1 to build Singapore 5G Ecosystem**

Together with M1, Nokia will implement their 5G standalone core to deliver advanced network capabilities to Singapore. The 5G Standalone core tech allows operators to design and automate network slices to further development of unmanned aerial or road vehicles, remote operations, wireless e-health, etc...

TL:DR

Nokia is not a phone Company. Major contender in the 5G space, cybersecurity AND AI autonomous vehicle operation. Partnerships with other large companies in both the US and abroad have set the stage for NOKIA to dominate 5G, which has the potential to see more growth than any other industry in 2021. Also have more upside potential as Huawei continues to lose contracts due to US pressure and potential security threats.

l4az1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4az1a/gamestop_could_become_the_leading/,GameStop could become the leading subscription-based multi-platform digital game store,224,27,2021-01-25 07:53:09,"These are my thoughts on one potential option GME has to make a significant pivot and leverage its current market place position as the leading multi-platform video gaming retailer into a digital future. This model allows for a lot of optionality and diverse revenue mix.

**Note:** I do not think this is the only option available to GameStop, nor the right one, just throwing it out there as it shows how much potential there is to re-think this business, on a fundamental perspective there is a lot of upside if they can execute on something compelling.

## Summary

A digital platform that offers both a subscription service for all-you-can-eat cross platform titles plus a digital games store where you can purchase cross-platform titles that are able to be traded-in for a credit.

## What revenue would it create?

At the moment, GameStop has over 50 million PowerUp Reward members. This program is largely limited to USA, whereby this digital platform can be global. As a benchmark, Xbox Live Gold is over 90 million subscribers, World of Warcraft has somewhere around 10-20 million subscribers (@ $15/month) - that's just 1 game. GTA 5 has sold over 120 million copies and Take Two makes $350m in micro-transactions in a quarter.

If this service cost $169 per year, cheaper than Microsoft's GamePass Ultimate, this is roughly the recurring revenue it would bring in. Maybe they could charge a lot more than this. $19.99 per month or $239 pa. $24.99 per month or $299 pa.

This service may just sit alongside GamePass, or Microsoft may choose to just integrate into GameStop's service so they are getting their Microsoft owned studio titles on more systems. See this article: [Microsoft wants Xbox Game Pass on PS4.](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-on-ps4/)

|Subscribers|50 Million|100 Million|150 Million|250 Million|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**$169 pa**|$8.5 Billion recurring|$17 Billion recurring|$25 Billion recurring|$42 Billion recurring|
|**$239 pa**|$12 Billion recurring|$24 Billion recurring|$36 Billion recurring|$60 Billion recurring|
|**$299 pa**|$15 Billion recurring|$30 Billion recurring|$45 Billion recurring|$75 Billion recurring|

It's possible too that this model does not simply provide a catalogue of games, like Game Pass does, but could work more like a library system where you can check-out something like a few games at a time. Any games. And turn them back in. Given the potential for license revoking, the opportunity of how the model could work on a subscription basis is only limited by your imagination. This kind of new approach would be different to what we've seen to date out there.

## Digging deeper: More like Spotify for Games

In some ways this model could operate similar to music and movie streaming services (e.g. Spotify & Netflix) where you have the ability to choose from the entire catalogue, and the publishers are paid based on what is being consumed/streamed/used/played. Play hours could be monitored and factored in.

Benchmark: Netflix has around 200 million subscribers, Spotify around 150 million, Disney+ around 85 million.

## Classic Buy/Trade-In model

On top of this, purchased games would be sold in full, generating more classic sales revenue. These digital purchases could work in a number of ways:

1. Games sold generate commission/profit per sale (just like selling a retail disc now) and could be integrated into existing digital stores across Xbox, Playstation and Nintendo eShop.
2. Games purchased through the console stores or other stores could be ""traded-in"" with GameStop for a small credit. It would be some minor work to integrate ability for the existing platforms to disable/transfer the digital license.

Traded-in games would encourage more purchasing than what happens currently where they rot in your catalogue never to be played again, so publishers are incentivized to be involved and contribute to this.

DLC and other digital purchases in-game could generate a similar commission for GameStop, in the same way that the current Microsoft revenue share model has. See below.

## Couldn't _________ do this instead?

Maybe. But, GameStop has advantages over every other player who might want to become the ""Netflix"" of gaming, if you will. They are neutral compared to other companies in the gaming sector, and neutral to the other major tech companies such as Google/Amazon/Facebook when you put them up against Microsoft in particular.

||Microsoft|Sony|Nintendo|Steam|GameStop|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**PC**|X|||X|X|
|**Xbox**|X||||X|
|**PlayStation**||X|||X|
|**Nintendo**|||X||X|

## GameStop is well connected across the gaming world to act as the global carrier for digital gaming

1. Steam might be able to pivot into this area, but GameStop has something Steam doesn't have: the console market. Primarily this means capturing Nintendo & Sony into this future.
2. GameStop has Reggie Fils-Aimé (former President at Nintendo of America). This is a huge card in terms of getting Nintendo of Japan to agree to some kind of involvement.
3. Game streaming is something that can be built in now or down the track. Again, being platform neutral is a big bonus here, as the offer they provide would not be limited to other ecosystems such as what would be through XCloud or Stadia. Microsoft may even want to develop a deeper partnership to provide the technology/infrastructure (e.g. license/transfer XCloud - like an AWS style relationship) and allow GameStop to operate it as a neutral party. At the end of the day, Microsoft may get slightly smaller cut of a much larger pie through a model like this - and not be accused of anti-trust/monopolization.

## Understanding the Microsoft Digital Revenue Share

>Domo President Justin Dopierala told Ars that GameStop Investor Relations representative Eric Cerny sent an email with the statement: “We are allowed to state we will receive a portion of the downstream revenue from any device we will bring into the Xbox ecosystem.”  
>  
>Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba confirmed what Dopierala said, adding that **GameStop will get a percentage of the revenue from every full game and DLC download, every microtransaction and every subscription made through an Xbox Series X or Series S it has sold through its stores.** And since the original line in the PR mentions “lifetime revenue value,” it means the retailer will be receiving money from Microsoft throughout each console’s lifetime.

1. Microsoft want to do these things, but know they would never get Sony onboard. They probably wouldn't even get Nintendo onboard.
2. Sony has been known to bow to pressures in the gaming industry, so would come on board with something like this if Microsoft and Nintendo are hooked in. [Sony caves to the fans: Fortnite cross-platform play coming to the PS4](https://www.nintendoenthusiast.com/cross-platform-play-fortnite-ps4/)

## Plus all the other options available for revenue

1. Physical media will likely still exist for a long time. Case in point: We're still buying up Vinyls. Hell, there's probably still a case for retaining some stores over the next 2 decades in some capacity.
2. There's a waft of physical items that GameStop can continue to sell: Collectibles, hardware, pc parts, consoles (both outright and subscription based hardware), apparel, peripherals, toys, books, etc.
3. eSports: Tournament platforms, leagues, streaming.
4. Private label brands: GameStop can expand into its own house brand of gaming accessories.
5. Game studio development: They can start to make their own games, ala. what Netflix Original Content is all about. There's billions of dollars of potential here.
6. Leverage the data: 50 million members and growing. What else can it do with it?

I’ve seen some Nokia thirst posts over the past couple weeks, and figured I’d look into the company. I used to have a windows phone, and while the OS was absolute shit, the phone itself was solid. NOK also ended trading at 4.20 on Friday so I figured why not look into it.  After briefly looking over the past couple quarterly reports, I’ve found Nokia is as resilient as the phones it manufactures. **Today I’m discussing the long term case for Nokia.**

**DISCLAIMER:** I don’t get paid for this. I’m not a professional. I’m not giving financial advice. I won’t have a lot of pretty charts in this so just eat some fucking crayons like you normally do.

&#x200B;

**The Gossip**

As some of you less smooth-brained retards know, Nokia has been getting shat on from shareholder’s perspective over the past couple years. Seeing a few big dips in share price both in 2019 and 2020 (which I will explain later). It appears that a lot of traders have left the company by the wayside for corporations like Motorola (MSI) and Cisco (CSCO).

**I see you lookin’**

Investment Journalists have already been discussing speculative success for Nokia long-term.

Here are some examples:

[https://investorplace.com/2019/12/nokia-short-term-pain-clouding-long-term-future/](https://investorplace.com/2019/12/nokia-short-term-pain-clouding-long-term-future/)

Another quick little read (I know it’s hard for you sweetie but hang in there) to provide context for my next point.

Cramer said he prefers growth, but with Nokia's long-existing foothold in many facets of the telecom industry AND Pekka Lundmark's EXPLICTLY EXPRESSED focus for Nokia's efforts on dominating a specific niches of mobile access:

>“We have a strong position in technologies that are important for critical networks, such as open and virtualized radio access networks and we are on course for a 100% cloud-native software portfolio,”

We are looking at serious growth within a particular spectrum (spectrum, like frequency spectrum HAHA TELECOM JOKE) and I think it dubious to dismiss Nokia's potential for growth where it *wants* to grow.

**Oh look blue crayons**

Here is a nice, smol-brained visual expression of Nokia’s 2020 weighted 5G conversion rate so that you fuckwits can grasp what’s going on.

&#x200B;

[Source: https:\/\/www.nokia.com\/system\/files\/2020-10\/nokia\_results\_2020\_q3.pdf \(pg. 4\)](https://preview.redd.it/73g1gglcjcd61.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&s=d71f43fd792c1559a7df369c1c4198252f7697d1)

The dotted square represents all of Nokia’s existing 4G footprint at the end of 2018 and the dark blue represents where a 5G footprint has been created to replace it. Notice that some dark blue exists outside the dotted square? That’s all NEW STUFF LOOKIE THERE FELLA UR SO SMART. At the same time, some of the 4G footprint remains because of interest in providing service to..um.. legacy products?

As of the Q3 report, Nokia owns 27% of the 4G + 5G mobile radio market share- excluding the Chinese market for that matter. This hasn't been a company that has lacked resources or experience, but direction and focus; there is a LOT to telecommunications and there are many doors this company can take. It has the connections, money, and focus necessary to achieve these long-term goals that its leaders set. If done right, 2021 won’t be a year of killer cash flow and revenue, but will establish Nokia with one massive cock.

I know it’s not exactly flashy/sexy and won’t see immediate results in the next two or three quarters, but the newly appointed Chief Technical Officer, Nishant “Big Daddy” Batra knows R&D and knows the ins and outs of Cloud Service Programs. Nokia has some BIG brain boys steering the ship. Let’s talk about something you troglodytes can follow: money.

&#x200B;

[ Source: https:\/\/www.nokia.com\/system\/files\/2020-10\/nokia\_slides\_2020\_q3.pdf ](https://preview.redd.it/aif0x17jkcd61.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b4650681395aa96124aa6f64772bf42b5a02395)

Net sales, operating profit, and margin are on track for another consistent year albeit *slightly* lower than 2019. This is good news considering that it lost a large north American customer this previous year due to its lackluster 5G footprint WHICH Lundmark (the aforementioned new president of Nokia) has explicitly stated that this will be the primary focus: R&D in tech that will position it as a long-term leader in the 5G space. They can do it too. I’ll dumb it down for you retards:

Boys, this is FISCALLY-DISCIPLINED leadership.

“BuT sHoUldN’T aLL lEadErShIp bE gOoD wItH mOneY??”

First, shut the fuck up and let me explain. There was a major dip in share price in 2019 after Nokia announced that it would not be paying dividends for two consecutive quarters. The boomers and gay bears in r/investing didn’t like the sound of that and decided to sell to really stick it to Nokia, and bought shit like CRUS because MMs told their sheep to.

**Nokia cut dividends temporarily in order to offset the cost of rolling out 5G tech**. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-24/nokia-cuts-earnings-outlook-and-pauses-dividend-to-invest-in-5g](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-24/nokia-cuts-earnings-outlook-and-pauses-dividend-to-invest-in-5g)

It was supposed to be a short term biting of the bullet for shareholders in order to see long term benefits, but God forbid people didn’t get their 19 cent-a-share dividends. There has been open discussion of bringing back dividends within the next couple years if the company sees continued growth in its cash flow, Nokia mentions the possibility of:

>“an earnings-based growing dividend of approximately 40% to 70% of non-IFRS diluted EPS, taking into account Nokia’s cash position and expected cash flow generation.”

*source:* [*https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/buy-nokia-stock-before-the-company-resumes-dividends-2020-10-21*](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/buy-nokia-stock-before-the-company-resumes-dividends-2020-10-21)

If Nokia officially announces a re-rolling out of dividends, boomers will get  **Rock. Fucking. Hard.** and slurp up shares on the cheap. This is where speculation comes in and is **ultimately why I am posting this shit in WSB.** Nokia has some major competition, minus Huawei in the United States which is a big fucking deal and I’m amazed how that escapes people considering the recent contracts Nokia secured with the US government. Some of that competition currently has the leg up on Nokia and betting on them is risky, but if Nokia can prove within the next year that it has a plan, we have got some SERIOUS upward potential.

Also, check the options activity on Nokia for the next 2 weeks leading up to its Q4 report. It’s getting me \~frisky\~

I could further dissect additional strategies associated with Nokia’s portfolio including what else it has it’s toes in, but big picture: Nokia will begin to hone in on a specific set of specializations (5G and Cloud-native software services).

Oh and you degenerates aren’t paying me.

TL;DR Nokia has potential for long term skyward trajectory with its new leadership."

As a long on Nokia, I have been lurking this sub and I see a lot of the same misconceptions about Nokia and well, I believe its time for me to bring some clarity to the reality that is $NOK

**Myth #1 Nokia is a phone company.**

This is wrong, Nokia is not a phone company. They sold their phone business to Microsoft back in 2013 for over 7 billion dollars, later it was sold by Microsoft to HMD for 350 million dollars in 2016, who currently makes the phones. Nokia just gets royalties for the use of their name.

**Myth #2 Nokia has been under the same failed management for 25 years.**

Correction, Nokia hired on a new CEO Pekka Lundmark in August of 2020 and took full leadership in September. He previously worked for Nokia between 1990 and 2000, when he helped oversee the company’s emergence as the world’s biggest mobile phone manufacturer and a significant player in mobile infrastructure.

**Myth #4 Nokia is losing market share due to competition**

While yes, there is strong competition in the 5G market, Huawei the global leader, is facing bans across the United States and Europe, ZTE who makes up a small fraction of the market share is also seeing geopolitical pressure. Current estimates of market share show the following Huawei 28.5% Ericsson 26.5% Nokia 22% Samsung 8.5% ZTE 5% and others 9.5%.

Here is an updated list on each countries stance on Huawei and ZTE. The list is growing as more and more countries decide to venture away from Chinese telecommunication equipment.

[https://www.channele2e.com/business/enterprise/huawei-banned-in-which-countries/](https://www.channele2e.com/business/enterprise/huawei-banned-in-which-countries/)

With more countries joining on the list, there is an increase demand on the others within the market to pick up the lost market share.

**Myth #5 Nokia isn’t a cyber security company like BlackBerry**

Nokia actually is involved in the cyber security field in many important ways. Nokia Smart Grid for example, is designed specifically for one of our largest threats faced by modern nations, Power Utilities.

**Myth #6 Nokia isn’t doing anything to make itself more profitable**

Nokia Cuts Jobs in France

Staying in Europe, Nokia said it was cutting 1,233 jobs in France, largely impacting research and development positions at its Alcatel-Lucent subsidiary.

Nokia has been slashing jobs amid a global cost savings program originally announced in late 2018. “Nokia is reinforcing its efforts and has earlier launched a global evaluation of its \[research and development\] operation that has led to significant adjustments globally,” a company spokesperson said in a statement.

The Finnish vendor, which is trying to cut $556 million in costs by the end of 2020, announced plans to cut about 180 jobs in its home country at the beginning of the year and hinted at more to come.

Stay with me here - I'm drunk off shitty beer because I'm loaded to the fookin tits on GME and anyway I still drink like I'm in college, but I digress.

The actual points:

1. Ryan Chewy has epitomized ol' Teddy's quote to a tee with single emoji tweets and even deleted some of the more erotic ones. I believe this is the ideal way for WSB to act as well, but as we are far past that with twitter and the talking heads on to us - this brings me to point 2.
2. Gamestop has received an incredible amount of free advertising over the past few months - this will only continue with the squeeze and feels similar to the free advertising for Tesla by resident meme lord Elon. I took a look at google trends but it doesn't work like robinhood with the green and red and so I couldn't read if it's up or down (**If anyone is in marketing or some shit and has any good ideas for getting a rough value for impressions created in the past months please share**)
3. Reversal of the negative GME stigma - I know we all got fucked out of our used games with shitty prices once upon a time and that kind of badwill is something a lot of bears bring up. With the amount of retail investors in gme, I think this has been more than counteracted by the good vibes of riding a rocket to the moon and taking out the big bad hedgies. I've personally converted at least my family from buying gaming shit from big box stores by getting them a pro membership and showing how they will undoubtably save money. **This will 10x with RC's focus on the customer's experience over all else.**

TLDR: Bears going extinct, GME to continue up bigly, we should all calm the fuck down and wait patiently for RC to use that big stick of his and act like we've been here before.

Edit: One last thought, I keep seeing people talk about current price and what if big guys get out etc. and I was definitely worried about this for a while when gme was hovering around 20. I read something though and am now more confident at 60 than I was then - This long/short battle feels like a zero-sum game and investors love The Art of War, Meditations, etc. - Essentially this is war and the big guys feel they have other guys bent over a barrel in addition to what I believe is a good-to-great growth turnaround story and chance by RC and crew"

Feel free to downvote and move on if (1) it's too much text or (2) you actually disagree. There is a **tl;dr** for the smoothest of brains at the bottom.

# 🚀 Wallstreetbets in the mainstream media 🚀

As we all know, WSB is receiving the most mainstream media coverage that it has ever had, thanks to the action over the past couple of weeks. Not only people who have never heard of WSB, but people who have never spared the stock market a thought in their entire life, are hearing about this wonderfully autistic community. ""GameStop"" was the second most trending Google search at the tail end of this week.

But many of us are unhappy with the mainstream media attention that WSB has been getting, and for good reason. Reddit is painted as some collective entity that planned to pump a stock to the moon with all of our individual hundreds of dollars (something that was not at all helped by that horrendous Twitter account). Weeks upon weeks of incredibly meticulous research and due diligence done by u/Uberkikz11 and u/Deepfuckingvalue have been reduced to so much as ""Reddit mob pumps stock"" in the eyes of the public.

In the days and weeks to come, WSB will be getting a large influx of new members thanks to all this public attention. Posts will ascend to levels of retardation **never before seen**. People asking WSB to pump penny stocks. People asking ""how do I sign up for Robinhood"". Remember, the perception of many new members will be ""WSB made themselves rich by pumping GME, they can make me rich too"". I urge all of you to keep the spirit of WSB alive and not let the influx of new degenerates dilute this place into a get rich quick forum for morons with a thirst for unscrupulous market manipulation tactics. The mods will have their work cut out for them, so use your downvotes and help them out as much as possible.

At the same time, however, remember that dumb money is still money. Do not reject people from the community because of their ignorance, because their ignorance is only the result of being misled by the media. **Do not validate people's claims that WSB is an angry mob of Redditors baselessly campaigning for GME.** Rather, educate them and gently caress the wrinkles out of their brains in a manner befitting a true WSB autist. **From Melvin and Citron's perspectives, this has turned from a struggle against a single online forum into a widespread battle against retail traders across the board. The pressure is on, even more so than before.**

# 🚀 Wallstreetbets in the eyes of Wall Street 🚀

What has transpired over the past week—and what will continue to transpire going into the next few—is likely the greatest redistribution of wealth from Wall Street to Main Street that has ever been seen. And Wall Street, as one would imagine, is not happy. In an ironic (but, perhaps, not unexpected) twist of fate, Larry Summers, the man who bailed out one of the largest corporate fraud rings in world history in 2008 while [simultaneously fighting to keep everyday American mortgage holders underwater](https://www.propublica.org/article/dems-obama-broke-pledge-to-force-banks-to-help-homeowners), is calling for [SEC regulation of a subreddit full of retail clowns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2590&v=mo5MGKM0Lds).

In every conceivable scenario, big money has seized every opportunity to milk Main Street, leaving retail traders high and dry while Wall Street fills its pockets with cash. In the words of everyone's favorite movie, ""Wall Street loves to use confusing terms to make you think only they can do what they do. Or even better, for you just to leave them the fuck alone.""

This is an opportunity to punish firms like Melvin for the underhanded tactics that they've employed and given free passes for for too long. When people say ""democratize Wall Street"", *this* is exactly what they mean. This is an opportunity to level the playing field and illustrate that retail traders *can* come up with a good fundamental thesis—and when it comes down to it, we can and will put our money where our mouth is.

# 🚀 For those of you who are new to WSB 🚀

I can speak only for myself, but I welcome the true artists amongst you. But if you're here because you believe Reddit can get you rich by pumping any stock that you choose to champion, you don't belong here and, while I don't speak for anyone else, I would kindly ask you to leave. I'd strongly encourage any new members to filter for ""Loss"" flairs for a dose of reality.

However, if you are here because your interest as been genuinely piqued, take a moment to read some of the content by u/Uberkikz11 and u/Deepfuckingvalue to understand why so many have taken an interest in GME. I can confidently assure you that there is far, far more to this company than ""Reddit mob pumps stock"". Do not be offended by the culture here, but embrace it. **Remember, you are an adopted autist, not a colonist.**

This is an amazing community that has given back to charity far more selflessly than any Wall Street big wigs, and I absolutely hate how the media is representing us. The majority of us are not sending pizzas and merch to someone's personal address to harass them in real life. We rejoice in one another's victories, commiserate (but glorify) in one another' losses, and encourage one another with memes of varying levels of quality. This is the side of the community that I want people to see when the mainstream media directs them here.

&#x200B;

**tl;dr** mainstream media is bad but also turned the larger public on to a chance to profit off of Melvin's tomfoolery; retail traders are slowly gaining traction in a space still largely dominated by Wall Street; keep the WSB spirit alive but behave yourself outside of the Reddit-sphere

l318bm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l318bm/clover_health_clov_will_moon_soon/,Clover Health ($CLOV) will moon soon 🚀🚀,534,121,2021-01-23 08:37:45,"Alright listen up folks. I know this industry isn’t sexy like EV or FinTech, but this space is important. Let me tell you why Clover Health ($CLOV) is going to the fucking moon soon 🚀🚀🚀🚀 

$CLOV merged with $IPOC (Chamath’s SPAC). Chamath’s track record speaks for itself. His investments including SPCE, OPEN, and his other current PIPE investment have all done really well and are quality companies. Since the merger with Clover Health, Chamath upped his stake in the Clover Health and now owns roughly 30%. Not long after, a 13D was filed by Clover’s CEO to up his stake in the company and now owns around 37%. The CEO has a proven track record of building successful healthcare businesses on the services side that he’s sold for billions. Another notable mention is Bill and Hillary Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea. She is on the Board of Directors for Clover and has been a believer in the company for a while now. She recently opted to exercise her shares rather than sell after merging because she’s in it for the long haul. 🚀🚀🚀🚀 if there’s one thing we know, it’s that the Clinton family gets their bag. Numerous other executives at Clover and Social Capital have done the same  including Ian Osborne. There’s 70+ institutions holding the stock but other notable “smart money” includes backing from Google and Sequoia Capital. If you don’t know what Sequoia capital is, I encourage you to look up previous companies they’ve invested in. Follow the smart money 💎💎💎


Let’s talk some numbers. Medicare Advantage spending was $270 billion in 2019, and is expected to expand to $590 billion by 2025. As of now $CLOV is only in 34 counties. That doesn’t sound that impressive at first glance. However, just being in 34 counties generated them 507M in revenue. They already said this year they’ll be in 108 counties which will take their revenue to just shy of a billion. There’s 3,000 counties in the US. Being in 108 counties is just 0.03% penetration of the total addressable market.... They’ve already said they want to be in every corner of the country and the cash generated from this IPO will help them expand to get there. Their market share is growing exponentially (9x faster than its closest competitors) and revenues are growing 50%+. Speaking of total addressable market, 10,000 boomers turn 65 a day. That’s an extremely concrete and measurable customer base that can only expand. We now have president Biden who has sworn to revamp Medicare and possibly lower age of Medicare eligibility from 65 to 60. If that happens, that’s fucking millions of extra potential customers a month. 🚀🚀

Let’s talk a little more about what Clover does. They’ve proven to build Medicare Advantage plans that balance quality and cost. They’re fixated on how they can deliver the lowest cost possible. Any business obsessed with delivering value and cost savings to consumers is always successful. Always. To me this is reinforced through their very impressive partnerships with retail giants in the counties they operate in including: Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Kroger, Costco. But wait, that’s not all they do. Here’s what makes $CLOV special. Clover is a double edged sword. In addition to their Medicare business, the other side of the business (that can be leveraged in conjunction to their Medicare plans) is called Clover Assistant. This is their proprietary AI focused and data driven software. It allows doctors to leverage historical patient data in order to create more effective treatment plans. This results in lowered costs, fewer visits, and better outcomes for everyone involved. Think of this as Einstein for Salesforce CRM or Watson for IBM. Clover Assistant can be the Einstein for the EHRS (electronic health record systems). This industry is prime for disruption. There are very few tech advancements in the healthcare world from an operations perspective. Keep in mind this side of the business is still in its infancy with only 2000 physicians on it. They plan to ramp exponentially with an upcoming direct contracting model in addition to using proceeds from IPO for further market penetration. 

Future catalysts include:

-$20 price target from Bank of America (doesn’t seem to be on web yet but pic from Bloomberg Terminal shared on Twitter) 

-they were invited to speak at the prestigious JPM Health Conference on 1/12. Check out the deep dive presentation. Tons of great growth states there. JP Morgan coverage/price target soon?

-they are presenting at the 4th annual Medicare Advantage Leadership Innovations Conference on 1/27 where they mentioned they will reveal their latest currently announced partnership. Could be great PR. 

-Biden has laid out themes of what he will discuss in the coming week each day. He will discuss his healthcare plans on 1/28 where he will surely discuss his Medicare plans including his plans to lower the Medicare eligibility age 

-future PR from Chamath, Clover, major news outlets, and price targets. There is very little PR on the web about Clover Health currently as a recent IPO. Once that picks up we are going to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀

-technicals: there’s been a lot of speculation that the suits have held this stock down to shake out weak hands and load up before the fireworks begin. The stock has been heavily accumulating in a descending wedge. Looks like the short volume is decreasing and when PR starts to come out, shorts will cover, basically making this a mini squeeze out. Chart looks ready. 

-float: a lot of the public float has been eaten up with the executives involved increasing their share. 67% is owned between $CLOV CEO Vivek and Chamath alone. According to Yahoo Finance data, there’s only 11M float left of 145M shares outstanding. That’s not too much left for retail to buy especially once there’s more eyeballs on this stock via PTs and PR. That’s getting close to low float levels. Low float + short squeeze = 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 

This to me seems like a no brainer especially under this new administration. See you all on the moon 🚀

If you’ve been on this subreddit or know anything about meme stocks, you know about the stocks that have skyrocketed recently. GME, AMD, PLTR, AAPL, TSLA, NVIDIA, CRSR, etc. 

There is a stock that almost all the big tech companies, EV companies, and meme stocks had in common. TSM

If you don’t know what TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing) makes computer chips. You definitely own at least one TSM chip, whether you know it or not. 

Here is a list of a few of the companies that manufacture their chips with TSMC: (from [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20leading%20fabless%20semiconductor%20companies%20such,such%20as%20Allwinner%20Technology%2C%20HiSilicon%2C%20Spectra7%2C%20and%20Spreadtrum.))

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Apple Inc., Nvidia, Intel, Qualcomm, Xilinx,  Altera,Texas Instruments. 

It would take me years to research every single product that TSMC manufactures, but here are a few of the most significant ones that I found:


AMD:All AMD chips are manufactured by TSM any reason to buy AMD is also a reason to buyTSM 
   AMD CPU’s: This also includes AMD Ryzen Processors which are the most bought CPUS on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computers-Accessories-Computer-CPU-Processors/zgbs/pc/229189) As well as the processors that go into many laptops. 
   AMD Graphics Cards: Apple uses AMD Graphics card in their Mac products. They are also in many windows PC’s and laptops, and they are used by miners. 
   Xbox/PlayStation Internals: The PS5 and Xbox Series both use AMD CPU’s and Graphics, which are manufactured by TSM. 

Apple: Apple manufactures All of its processors at TSM. TSM made chips are in every iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, Air Pod, etc. the new M1 Apple in house silicon Macs are also made by TSM. 

Nvidia: Nvidia is the world largest GPU company. They also make self driving processors for Tesla, Nio and other companies. 

Qualcomm: Qualcomm makes Arm processors. Qualcomm processors power everything from Samsung phones to smart TV’s to Amazon Alexa. 

Xilinx: they make most of the 5G processors that go in towers and phones. Samsung Phones use Xilix cellular chips. 

Texas Instruments: they make your fucking calculator. 

There are many many more companies that TSM manufactures chips for. They are also on a more advanced process mode than any other company in the world. Do some of your own research and find out what other products TSM makes. 

See how many products in your life are powered by TSM. 

Chances are, A TSM manufactured chip could be inside your phone, your computer, your TV, your smart speaker and other smart home devices, your wifi router, your cars radio/gps, your cars self driving system (if your car has it). Your wireless headphones, the cell tower in your neighborhood. Even your calculator.

The “cloud” is also powered by TSM. The servers that google, Amazon, one drive, Spotify, Palantir, etc. 

If you can find just one area of technology that does not, at some point, use TSM manufacturing, comment it below. 

If you can’t then buy some fucking shares. 🚀🚀🚀"

In 2013 I bought a gaming PC from my neighbor at a garage sale. The PC had an AMD FX 8350 in it. I spent around $1k on the PC upgrading everything. To this day, the PC still has that same AMD FX processor. Before everyone jumped on the Ryzen hype, I was there, believing. When I got the PC I told my dad to buy $100 worth of AMD stock for me. They were worth a dollar something at the time. They are now worth around $100 a share. Sadly, I didn’t make the Tendies from then investment when I was a kid who saw potential in AMD. 

On July 6th of this 2020, I bought in myself because i knew how great the company was from year of experience. I have been holding ever since and will continue to hold and buy in. AMD, in my mind, is undervalued. Not because of technical analysis or earnings. But because of what I see in the real world. Friends of mine who bought and built PC’s back when I did, had Intel CPU’s in their PC’s. Some of them have never even heard of AMD processors. Between then and now. All of my friends who have upgraded their PC’s have switched to AMD. Everyone who knows a thing or two about PC’s at least considers going AMD instead of Intel. 

You might be thinking it’s too late to buy now, too late to invest in AMD. Your loss. AMD is starting to do the same thing with Graphics Cards, laptops and Server parts that they did with gaming CPU’s. I foresee them having the same takeover they had with gaming CPU’s in the laptop, GPU, and server chip space. The potential is huge. Big cloud  companies like Amazon, Google etc. are starting to switch their servers from Intel Xeon to AMD Epyc. This can make AMD much more money than gaming processors. I don’t know much about Xilinx but i believe if AMD follows the same philosophy they do with their other chips, they can bring Xilinx to the top. AMD had a lot further to go. 🚀🚀

I get interested on Nokia in 2016 when I listen they will change their business to focus on Networks and equipment, at that time I was only interested on Nokia not because of stocks, because I was working as a telecommunication technician and they have the best network devices and antennas together with Siemens.

So I was pretty happy to see Nokia devices focused on networks, since time passed their products have been popping everywhere because they are pretty robust and nice to use.

I get my second look of attention when I see ALL the UE 5G contacts from Huawei turning into Ericsson and Nokia.

PLTR is experiencing a heavy strong trend with a bull and flag. It's broken support this morning and is back up. PLTR has had positive momentum, tons of new contracts and lots of volume. It's been in this pennant and is due for a breakout. PLTR's Demo day is the 26th of Jan and earnings is Feb 11. Demo day is gonna showcase new Palantir products and outline what PLTR has in store for 2021. 

**A case for longs:**

Palantir aims to put together software that compiles data that provides insights into potential problems, solutions to these problems, and help solve complex, real-world problems. This data and analytics is fully interactive, and machine-assisted. So far, Gotham and Foundry are Palantir's products. Gotham is the military/government grade software and Foundry is the commercial equivalent. Apollo is a program that essentially removes the need for support teams when Gotham and Foundry need an update. Apollo gives Foundry and Gotham users the luxury of updating their software like it's an IOS update. These three products are the fundamentals of PLTR

Palantir's goal in the commercial and govt space is to grow in scope and scale. This prepares them for a horizontal integration. They are trying to build a wide moat for themselves in order to secure an opportunity for vertical integration as well. By preparing themselves for both vertical and horizontal integration, they are going down a road not dissimilar to that of Standard Oil. There is not a doubt in my mind that this company is run by people who know what they're doing. 

PLTR is now the biggest company involved in government data. The US cannot afford to have PLTR go under, and thus it will never go away- the only way is up. The real question is, how fast is it going up?

""Looking ahead, Palantir is poised to become the default central operating system for data across the U.S. government and its allies. The company also aspires to be the central operating system for data at large businesses and even entire industries. To appreciate Palantir's ambition with regard to B2B big data, it may be helpful to recall how much economic benefit has been captured by Microsoft (MSFT) after Windows OS took the lead over MacOS of Apple (AAPL) in the PC era, and by Google and Apple in the consumer mobile phone age with their respective Android and iOS operating systems.""

Competitors in this niche tech field are quickly swatted away. BAH and ACN lack the technical power and can't compete with PLTR pricing. Even defense contractors such as RTX, BAH, SAIC, and BAESF cannot compete with the costs and user-responsiveness of PLTR. You might ask why a big shot like google isn't stepping in to work with the government, to which I would chuckle and remind you that google stated they think the pentagon is ""unethical"" and prefer to work with the Chinese government on Project Dragonfly ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly\_(search\_engine)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly_(search_engine))). 

I'll go ahead and rattle off some quick deductions of mine. They have an aggressive merger and acquisition campaign. To grow into adjacent verticals, they absorb companies that are already there, quickening the speed they grow at. They are Capital-light and operationally efficient. Their ROI is very high and they can sell their product with existing hardware for as long as they are the best program to use. Meaning their software needs to be installed once but can be sold as many times as they like, as long as they keep their shit together. They are seriously dominating domestically in their niche. Their wide moat due to the M&A campaign and good management for vertical + horizontal growth gives them a monopolistic outlook. They are in the captains chair. 

**Forward thinking**

PLTR's last Q described sales growth of 46% in international sales. They want to move into Canada, Australia, UK, France and other allies of the U.S. They will very likely establish themselves there as well. They have a Foundry Joint Venture contract in Japan with Sampo Holdings for the wellbeing of the Japanese people. It was $500M. They are likely looking for a contract with Japan's government as well. 

My short-term PT for PLTR is $34, passing ATH. This pennant is a strong trend and it is gonna break out hard. All signs point towards a bullish breakout so I'm loaded up on calls, overexposing myself three times with what I'm usually comfortable with exposing myself to. 

Long term, I can imagine PLTR breaking $100 within 2 years. With a growing need of govt software and national security, *PLTR's value can only go up*

**TLDR: PLTR $34 by early Feb.**🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"

Apple announced in 2020 that they plan to increase the level of privacy of the iOS users, with the release of iOS 14. What does that mean concretely?

\--> As soon as you open a new app, they will ask with a pop up ""Do you allow this app to track you across different apps"". We expect that 10 to 20% of the users will say yes. Bumble officially said while filing their IPOs that could be a major risk for them, to do proper analytics on their users.

Therefore, all the apps relying on paid acquisition, won't be able to track where you are coming from, and if you are a rentable user. Therefore, it makes it even harder to create profitable user acquisition campaigns on mobile. Those who will suffer from it are casino, midcore, casual games, as well as all the apps relying on paid subscriptions. It will provoke a drop of eCPMS (price per 1000 impressions of ads), as there will be less demand on the ad networks.

Certain networks will suffer more than other, but the biggest one is Facebook.

99% of the revenue of Facebook is coming from ads. It means that they will still be able to do targeting on Facebook itself, but not on the networks of apps that run ads (like all the games). Facebook is a key player in this industry, and this will certainly provoke a drop in terms of revenue (9M businesses are relying on their ad network).  They officially said that IDFA change (this iOS privacy update) "" Could Have A Material Business Impact"".

Apple postponed their measure to Q1 2021, but this will come.

Google usually follow suit with these kind of measures.

More info:

 

1. Some quotes:

Facebook [published](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2020/06/18/value-of-personalized-ads-thriving-app-ecosystem/) a blog post outlining a test it had conducted comparing how revenue differed between personalized and non personalized ads on its Audience Network. Facebook said it observed “more than a 50% drop” in publisher revenue when personalized targeting was taken out of the equation —though it didn’t publish a detailed outline of the study.

2. The iOS market is the most profitable mobile market. It represents around 50% of the total revenue for app publishers, while only 27% of mobile owners have an iPhone.

3. In any case, the advertisers won't be able to track properly the performances of their campaigns. Even if they will still be able to target users, they won't be able to know how efficient it is, as we used to today. Moreover, if you increase the amount of ads in Facebook, this will definitely have an impact on the retention rate / session length. This is a lot of fine-tuning, but the solution isn't there.

&#x200B;

TLDR : Significant drop in terms of ad revenue on mobile due to the new iOS privacy change. It will prevent targeting and tracking of the users. Facebook will suffer from it like crazy, as well as other ad players such as Unity, Ironsource (IPO soon) or Applovin (IPO soon), and apps Bumble (IPO soon).

Play : Wait for Q4 Revenue annoucement of Facebook. Then short Facebook until next quarter, when the measure will show its impact

**Additional DD below on Vigtory acquisition:** 

FuboTV Inc. is buying an online sportsbook, a deal that makes the over-the-internet TV provider the latest sports- rich media company to invest in sports gambling in an effort to attract and retain viewers.     

The company said it is in the process of acquiring Vigtory Inc., a sportsbook that it eventually plans to integrate into its TV platform. Vigtory will also be available to those outside of the FuboTV        subscriber base. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.     

In an interview, FuboTV Chief Executive David Gandler said he expects sports wagering to not only generate more revenue for FuboTV but also make it more likely that customers will pay closer attention to sports and tune in more often. The company also recently acquired Balto Sports, a company that develops tools for users to play fantasy sports.     

Sports content tends to be the most expensive on TV, which has led many internet-TV bundles to raise their prices. Over the past year, YouTube TV went from $50 a month to $65 and Hulu +        Live TV from $55 to $65, while FuboTV raised the price of its standard package by $5 to $60        after it added a suite of Disney-owned channels including ESPN.

I tried to make it as retard-proof as I could, but I'm sure I'm underestimating you guys.

I use my template to see the gains/losses i've made on stock that I have sold.

Some quick info: You will need to copy it to your own google drive. Some functions won't work when downloading to Microsoft Excel. Also I have protected the formulas and titles, so you can't change it on accident.

[Click here for to open the template.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ndAyqLq0rD6iE7LMKdpKiyNUFQ2wDDEs9A7C8nn5H4/edit?usp=sharing)

On sheet 'Investment 1', you can individually add your orders. (I recommend this sheet, as this one is way easier)

* Under 'Purchase', you should fill in the price/share, amount of shares, fee, exchange amount (Enter  
1 if the stock is in Dollar) and purchase date (the last 2 are needed for formulas).
* When you sold that stock, enter the sale in the 'Sale' section after the purchase of that stock. The  
spreadsheet will calculate the gains/losses you've made.
* When running out of lines you can add lines by rightclicking the second last visable row and select  
'insert 1 below', then press ctrl+D (when the added row is still selected) to copy the formulas from  
the cell above.
* In row 27 there is a sum of; the total you have currently invested, the total you have purchased and  
sold, and the total you have gained/lost.

&#x200B;

On sheet 'Investment 2', it is the same principle as the previous sheet, but here you can group the stocks.

* This sheet will also calculate how much you currently have invested in each stock.
* It's a little trickier to add rows in this sheet. You will have to be carefull not to add a row after the bottom row of a stock (for example row 11), otherwise the formula that calculates the total of that stock will not calculate those rows. Instead add rows at the first row of a stock, or the second last. You can always hide the last row of a stock to prevent that from happening, as I have done with Tesla and To the moon.
* When you want to add a new stock you can add a few rows at the second last row(Row 12, Row 13 is hidden so the formula doenst get fucked) equal to the amount of rows a stock group has, so you can copy those rows into the new rows. For example Tesla has 3 rows (row 3 to 5,row 4 is hidden), so add 3 new rows behind a stock group, then copy those Tesla rows and paste them into the new rows. Now you have the formulas so you can delete the data in the new rows.

&#x200B;

On sheet 'Strategy', you can keep track of how much you want to invest in stocks, options, etc.

1. Add the total budget you have into cell C1
2. Decide what percentage you want to invest in each section (Cell B2, E2, H2) and give it a name in the cell to the left
3. Decide what percentage you want to invest in each row of a section (Example: Cell B3, B4) and give it a name in the cell to the left.
4. The sheet will calculate what the budget is for each stock or whatever.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Hope I didn't miss anything. Also hope you guys find this usefull, if not, then buy GME stocks right the f\*ck now. F\*ck Melvin, all my homies hate Melvin. 💎✋

**Disclaimer**

This is not investment advice and only serves to provides commentary on of the financial markets and a mosaic theory on what is happening and what will come with respect to GME.

**Pre-amble**

For those that did not read my earlier post a link is below – it provides most of underlying commentary on what has been going on with GME with this post filling in some additional details. It’s unfortunately a long read and for most of you that attended the The Derek Zoolander Center for Kids Who Can't Read Good and Who Wanna Learn to Do Other Stuff Good Too, I wish you the best of luck (assuming you failed out).

[Legacy of WSB: GME Short Squeeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzftk2/legacy_of_wsb_gme_short_squeeze/)

Unfortunately for Jim Cramer (“Jimbo”), I didn’t bring him up in previous post because I admire him or watch his show. It’s because the man himself is going to help describe what happened today with GME. Cue up the video or a read the transcript below. I honestly find Jimbo annoying as fuck and I don’t want to force and of you actually listen or look at him.

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMShFx5rThI)

[Transcript](https://slate.com/culture/2007/03/will-cramer-s-crazy-confession-destroy-his-career.html)

Before I actually get into some of Jimbo’s self admitted tricks of the trade and how they are being applied to GME, I need tell you a quick story about a lovely little real estate holding company called Global Links (traded over the counter) and an investor by the name of Robert Simpson. Simpson’s win was so big, he was interviewed on Bloomberg News on 14Mar2007 along with the CEO of Overstock.com (remember that company from my last post that hit 669 days on the Threshold Security List?). Well Simpson’s big trade was spending $5,000 to acquire 100% of the company (he actually acquired 111% or 1,282,050 shares), the really cool part of this trade was that despite owning over 100% of the company the trading volume over the next 2 days was 50 million shares.

[Transcript: Phantom Shares,' Failed Trades and Naked Shorts](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-145.htm)

The only other quick primer you folks need to digest the below is a quick understanding of market manipulation. As per the ever so useless folks at the SEC (directly from their website), market manipulation is when someone artificially affects the supply or demand for a security (for example, causing stock prices to rise or to fall dramatically).

Market manipulation may involve techniques including:

· Spreading false or misleading information about a company;

· Engaging in a series of transactions to make a security appear more actively traded; and

· Rigging quotes, prices, or trades to make it look like there is more or less demand for a security than is the case.

**Market Manipulation**

Again, a big thanks to the Eight Pound, Six Ounce, Newborn Baby Jimbo, don't even know a word yet (reference to Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby because it pains me to think of that bald 65-year asshole). Let’s review the Institutional short’s toolkit and then figure out what is going on with our beloved Gamestop.

**1. Flooding the offer side of the board**: Any of you folks with level 2 data seen those fun price walls?

**2. Short Down Ladder**: Short A will open a new short position and sell a share at $40 and short B will buy that share to cover an existing position and the open a new short at $39 and so on.

**3. Media Assault**: I am sure we have all seen the fun tweet from Citron today and all desperately tried to get out of our positions. Any of you read business articles are immediately scroll to bottom to see if there a disclaimer noting that the author was paid to write the article? Conveniently the first article that pops up when I search GME on google includes “*The author has received compensation for writing this article” (Link:* [https://www.fxstreet.com/news/gamestop-gme-stock-price-and-forecast-dont-get-gamed-202101191637](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/gamestop-gme-stock-price-and-forecast-dont-get-gamed-202101191637))

**4. Analyst Reports**: Undisclosed compensation and bias research is a professional no-no for many financial designations. Many of the current price targets seems unreasonably low, like below liquidation value kind of low – does any of this make sense ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/price-target/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/price-target/))

**5. Pulling Margin** – holy shit, didn’t this just happen - Short’s are starting to get desperate aren’t they?

**6. Paid Bashers** – Paying people to spam messages boards to create panic and insight selling. This goes way back to 2007 but trust me when I say this will only get worse ([https://www.wired.com/2007/12/confessions-of-2/](https://www.wired.com/2007/12/confessions-of-2/)

**Trading Day in Review**

What everyone needs to consider is that despite the shorts sparing no expense, the share price is still going up and the shorts are getting deeper and deeper under water every day and will only become more and more desperate. Their backs are against the wall and they need to fight to the death to survive. Closing out positions would result in long drawn-out Tesla Style squeeze and would still likely result in the bankruptcy of these funds. Their only chance pushing GME into bankruptcy (very unlikely with Cohen and Co taking over the board).

What some of you are starting to clue into and discuss openly is the visibility of market manipulation. I don’t really care what Citron will say tomorrow but if there is a Q&A someone really should ask how the short’s can postpone the close off requirements on Threshold Securities near indefinitely or when they try and ‘describe’ short interest maybe ask their thoughts about the legality of front running trades.

One of the sparsest sections of my original post was on the short interest. I don’t have access to the Ortex data and I will rely on others posts for this data. Remember Robert Simpson from the pre-amble who acquired 100% of the shares in Global Links and yet had his shares traded 50-times over the next 2-days? SEC enforcement has historically been extremely weak and the actual short interest could be much higher then what is reported.

Normal market price discover is simple economics – the price is established based on where supply and demand meet. More buying pressure the price goes up and more selling pressure the price goes down. All things being equal, how many people increased their positions on the dips today? How many sold? How many were forced to sell some of your position after your margin was pulled?

The market price action is that the currently described by the below (historical volume, daily high, and daily low can be viewed at: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history/))

a) **The current float is small and shrinking**. Retail is going long and we want to keep buying and I want to retire in the coming weeks. Please sir may I have some more?

b) **Volume is unreasonably high** – every share in the company has turned over 5x in the last 4-trading sessions. If you did deeper into timing short attacks, you will learn that doing it upon earnings, press releases, or news announcements helps to mask the associated volume increase. If you refer to my original post, you will know that shorting a stock creates a synthetic share - if they Shorts try a hastily exit, the price will quickly start jumping up.

c) **Volatility is increasing**. If you look at the daily history, what do you notice about the range between the high and low? Citron announced a webinar tomorrow on how to remove the shit stains from their dress pants (Hint: it involves depressing the GME stock price so they can stop defecating in risk management meetings). Volatility will only continue to get worse and its all due to the actual float Shrinking. The Cake is a Lie (Portal reference).

If retail investors maintain demand and don't get disheartened, volume will continue to contract and the shorts are going to dig themselves into a deeper and deep hole until they are no longer solvent. This is exciting, I am “Jacked to the Tits” as we are going to witness the biggest redistribution of wealth in our lifetimes.

Thanks again for the your assistance explaining what is wrong with the markets Jimbo. I am still hoping there is a journalist with some integrity that might push out the real story on the GME play.

Minimum price target of $1,000+ stands because fuck you Jimbo, you friends dug themselves into a hole that they cant mathematically get out of without material market manipulation. Fuck you, Pay Me."

Now I know how Wikipedia as a source can be biased and inaccurate, but there are several pieces of information here worth looking into.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew\_Left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left)

Contrary to everyone here saying that Citron has been wrong on every stock he shorted, WSJ says 

>111 Citron short-sale reports spanning from 2001 to 2014, there was an average share-price decline of 42 percent in the year after Left's report was released. Of those shares, 90 were lower one year later while 21 gained, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. 

Source [link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-short-who-sank-valeant-stock-1445557157)

Now this may be old data from 2001-2014 and his predictions may have become progressively worse ever since. I just want to look at the possible selection bias of PLTR, BB, TSLA, NVDA and every other one of his failed shorts.

However, here's where I think the juicy part is. Consider Andrew Left's checkered past:

> Left's first job was with Universal Commodity Corp, a high-pressure [commodities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_market) brokerage firm that hired salespeople to make [cold calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_calling) and push ""questionable investments.""[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left#cite_note-reut-12) Left quit in March 1994, after 9 months with the company. When the [National Futures Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Futures_Association)  sanctioned the firm in December 1998, Left, along with every other  former employee, was sanctioned for three years along with being  required to take an ethics-training course 

&#x200B;

> Left became active in [short selling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance))  by the age of 24. He has cited his experience with Universal Commodity  Corp as the reason he started short selling stocks promoted by  boiler-room scams. 

He has a lot of experience with securities fraud and uses that knowledge to short stocks with illicit activity. This is where he may have made successful predictions. Yet this is not without controversy. Many firms have sued Citron for defamation and deliberately crashing their stock prices:

> Qihoo 360 has threatened to take legal action against Citron Research, as has former [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) China chief Kai-Fu Lee, now the chairman and CEO of Innovation Works.[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left#cite_note-wantchinatimes1-41)[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left#cite_note-42)  In 2012, posted a detailed, point-by-point rebuttal, via Sinocism, to  Chinese investment platform Xueqiu.com, which also suggests that Citron  had taken advantage of reader unfamiliariarity with Chinese languages  and markets. Lee stated that, ""Since Citron has already made big bets on  these recommendations before their reports are published... Citron’s  recommendation doesn’t have to be right; Citron just needs to mislead  their readers to follow their recommendations!” 

Sounds eerily familiar to what's happened to GME today? I don't think it's a cooincidence. As far as I'm concerned, there is no fraud or illicit activity happened with GME, or the other meme stocks that he tried to short. He simply made the wrong bets, took positions in fields outside his expertise (fraud), and lost a lot of money. Now he is using his experience with fraud against us, deliberately pushing GME down so he doesn't get squeezed.

Point is, maybe sometimes Citron is right to short a stock when the company is engaged in fraud. But every wsb stock he tried to short was based on his conviction that it was overvalued, and he was totally wrong.

Going into tomorrow, I hope everyone exercises some caution. He seems to know what he is doing with market manipulation. Maybe trim positions a little at the top, and buy the dip once his dump ass twitter stream starts at 11:30. I'm bullish as anyone else on this sub, just thought this background info might prove useful as I don't see anyone else bringing it up.

TL;DR Be careful, shitron seems to have a lot of experience with fraud and market manipulation. Obviously don't paper hand, but tomorrow might be a good opportunity to manage position and buy the dip on GME.

oh and for good measure heres some rocket emojis 🚀🚀🚀🚀

EDIT: what I meant by ""exercise caution"" is expect volatility tomorrow, gme is likely to drop around 11:30 when shitron livestreams. At that point, selling will only help the shorts. Hold positions or buy the dip to average down would be the smart move"

# DJ GameStop Stock Is Soaring. It Could End Badly. -- Barrons.com

https://preview.redd.it/t5f3zdu6lec61.jpg?width=1151&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b68789578ac91a585a227c02e5b0fe37c9ad17f

 ·  2021/01/19 12:46 GMT-06:00By Connor Smith

GameStop stock continues to soar amid interest from retail investors one analyst called ""rabid."" Now the stock now has the attention of a notable activist short seller.

Citron Research's Andrew Left wrote in a Tuesday post on Twitter that he plans to host a livestream discussing five reasons those buying GameStop (ticker: GME) stock at recent levels ""are the suckers at this poker game.""

""Stock back to $20 fast,"" he wrote. ""We understand short interest better than you and will explain.""

Left did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Barron's asking him to expand on his thoughts, as well clarify whether he's taken a short position himself. But around the time of Left's post, GameStop stock pared back from a $45.52 intraday high. The stock closed up 11% to $39.36.

On Tuesday, 74.6 million GameStop shares were traded, the stock's fifth-highest volume on record, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Last Wednesday set a record volume for the stock, when 144.5 million shares were traded.

GameStop shares doubled last week following news that three former Chewy executives, including co-founder Ryan Cohen, were joining the company's board. Cohen's RC Ventures has a 13% stake in GameStop, and has urged the company to close more stores and embrace e-commerce.

The day of the announcement, the company pulled out of a planned appearance by executives at last week's ICR investment conference. A GameStop spokesman had pointed Barron's to the conference for commentary on the company's long-term plans. GameStop representatives haven't returned repeated requests seeking comment in the week since.

After the pop last week, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter pointed to the stock's massive short interest, recently at 138% of shares available for trading, according to FactSet data compiled by Dow Jones Market Data. Short-selling analytics firm S3 Partners, which adjusts its short-interest calculations, estimated short interest of about 58% earlier this month.

Such bearish bets have left the stock primed for a short-squeeze, a short-term event where short sellers bid up shares, rushing to cover their positions. Pachter said such short sellers were ""squeezed by rabid retail investors."" He didn't think the pop would last, and has a $16 price target on the stock.

Left's post signaled he'll discuss the technical factors related to short selling at play during his stream, set for 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday. In recent weeks, Barron's has outlined a long-term bearish case. The company is struggling amid broader shifts to free-to-play games and digital downloads, both of which cut out physical game sales.

Despite new consoles from Sony (SNE) and Microsoft (MSFT) that were forecast to drive stronger sales in the broader games industry, GameStop said last week its sales were down 3.1% from last year during the nine-week holiday period. The company pointed to store closures, limited console supply, and the impact of Covid-19. But comparable sales, which strip out the effect of store closures, were only up 4.8% from a rough 2019 holiday period.

Many of the most popular games, like League of Legends and Fortnite, are free to download and play. Instead, publishers offer in-game cosmetic items directly in their online store. For those games, GameStop is often limited to acting as a middleman, selling gift cards for in-game points.

And as more players opt to download games directly on their consoles, it's the gatekeepers of such systems -- Sony, Nintendo (NTDOY), and Microsoft -- that stand to benefit. Meanwhile, PC game distribution is a crowded space. Valve's popular Steam online store is facing some competition from platforms offered by Fortnite maker Epic Games, CD Projekt (CDR.Poland), and Electronic Arts (EA). It's unclear how an old-school retailer like GameStop can make sustainable headway in this already competitive landscape.

Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are also leveraging their cloud infrastructure to offer cloud gaming-streaming services akin to Netflix. Adoption hasn't yet been disruptive to the broader industry. Microsoft, another major cloud player, and Sony have such services that are backed by their libraries of in-house content. GameStop has a profit-sharing deal with Microsoft for its Xbox Game Pass, but Credit Suisse analyst Seth Sigman noted at the time that he was skeptical that such a deal would offset the decline of physical game sales.

Add it all up, and it's clear GameStop will need to execute a radical turnaround plan to stay relevant.

Long time WSB lurker and I've learned a lot here, so I'd like to give back and hopefully add some value to this sub.  I think it’s worth spending a little time laying out my thoughts on why I’m investing in GME as an active early stage VC, and hopefully my insights can help people not paperhand before the real gains are made.  I'll try to provide new insights that I haven't seen on this subreddit yet.

Full disclaimer- this is my personal money I’m investing.  Positions are 678 shares at a $39.81 average as a starter and looking to open a more significant position in the next few months once a few questions have been answered for me on things I’m looking to see (which I’ll discuss below).

Obligatory rockets: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.  If a few things happen, this goes to the moon regardless of a short squeeze.  I'll explain why below.

First, a quick overview at how most VC's do due diligence.

**How VC's Invest**

When we do due diligence on early stage investments (our Fund is a pre-seed and seed Fund with a few Series A deals), there’s a few things we look for, especially when evaluating growth companies in tech are as follows:

1) What’s the market size? There are three types of market sizes investors look at; TAM, SAM and SOM.   Feel free to look up how sizing these markets works if you aren't familiar, this is a long post so I won't waste people's time.  The important thing to remember here is that **the larger the TAM, the more room for growth and competition and the more interest there is to invest in a space.**  This is very important for GME and we will come back to why later.

2) What's the CAGR?  (Compound Annual Growth Rate).  Basically, is the market expanding or shrinking, and how fast.  Again, google this if not familiar.

3) Experience of the management team- have they actually been there before and demonstrated an ability to scale and exit a company in this space?

4) Unit economics- do the numbers make sense as this company grows?  Is it actually going to be profitable?  Every firm looks at these different.  We look at CAC/LTV ratios and doubling time with tech companies.  The TLDR of this is ""how much money does it cost me to get a new customer, how long will they be my customer before they leave, how much money will they spend while they are my customer, and how fast can I double the money I spent on advertising to get that new customer "".

There are a lot more things that obviously go into determining whether something is a good investment or not, but if there are red flags in any of these core areas a tech company is almost always uninvestable.

**Now onto why after recent developments I think GME is shaping up to be one of the most attractive investment opportunities that investors have seen in these markets in years, but why many of you will miss out on the majority of the gains long term.**

1 and 2) Market size and CAGR.  As a gamer myself in spare time and a tech investor this is a market that hasn't even scratched the surface of how large it will get.  Gaming is a market worth hundreds of billions, with an explosive CAGR as more young people grow up with gaming being a socially accepted activity and in many people's lives the center of their social experience.   Most of you are familiar with this already, so nothing more to be said here.  

Now the question in the past was, is Gamestop capable of growing their share of this market?  Until Ryan Cohen, the answer was no (and this is why the share price went down to where it was).  Again, you all know this.  But this leads to the second point of why it is now an attractive option

2) Ryan Cohen.  Not from an ""excited about a memeing CEO"" perspective, but from the most important thing to institutional investors- does he have a proven track record scaling and exiting profitable e-commerce businesses?  Yes he does.  

Again, you all know all this and it is how the stock price got to here today.  Everyone is sitting waiting and watching to see if there is a short squeeze (myself included), and there is a lot of hype and excitement.

**But this is leading everyone to miss the forest for the trees because of the 4th point:**

GME's Unit Economics have the potential to be best in industry, yet shares are priced at an extreme discount to revenues currently.

I'd encourage everyone to check out this article talking about how companies with strong growth are normally priced by tech investors by one of the A16z partner.  [https://a16z.com/2020/08/17/role-of-entry-multiples-in-valuations/](https://a16z.com/2020/08/17/role-of-entry-multiples-in-valuations/)  The article is titled ""why entry multiples don't matter"" and helps entrepreneurs understand how valuations of companies can make sense for tech investors.

The short of it is for all the WSBers who can't read: if you have more growth, you get a higher multiple because you will have the potential to produce far more dividends faster, especially in high margin tech companies.

So what is fascinating about GME?

**If I was presented a new company that had just driven it's e-commerce revenues 300%!!!!! YoY, operating in a several hundred billion TAM, backed by investors and management who had grown a company in the same vertical to hundreds of millions in annual subscription revenue, and with a strong balance sheet and distribution footprint and a widely recognized brand, 20x topline revenue in the early stages would be considered a steal to invest at.** 

Instead, GME is priced at a $2.8B market cap, less than half of annual revenues.

This is an unheard of valuation for a growth company to be trading at a discount.

So why is GME underpriced, and why did so many people (myself included) not see or continue to not see this opportunity until now?  If it's such a good opportunity, why are shares so cheap?

**Most investors are looking at the legacy Gamestop business that has existed for the past decade instead of treating GME like a new startup (CHEWY for Gaming).**

If Ryan Cohen can transform GME into a subscription-based membership model where in exchange for your monthly fee you have a one stop shop to all things gaming discounted, you have a company that could easily be valued at a 10-30x multiple on top-line revenues.  However, because most investors outside of this subreddit still view it as a traditional brick and mortar play vs. a subscription focused tech company with omnichannel growth strategies, they think a bubble is forming and are shorting it instead of buying in.

**So why am I not all in yet but why am I excited?**

The most important thing yet to be understood is what does the customer value proposition look like under the new direction Ryan Cohen takes GME.  Most large investors will be waiting to see how over the next year the balance sheet is strengthened for growth, what new revenue models can be implemented, and to see if there has been a true pivot from brick and mortar.

This is a company that if management can execute on correctly, most large institutional investors will be clamoring to get a significant stake in and grow it because the gaming market is here to stay and grow.  Bear arguments that digital game sales will hurt GME miss the entire point of the pivot.  Ryan understands this and wants to instead bring the whole gaming experience in house- everything you buy you want to buy from GME because you're part of their membership program (again think Costco).  Those programs are insanely profitable and if the unit economics show that to investors as the company pivots the valuation will soar immediately as people realize it's Amazon Prime, not Blockbuster.  However, it is yet to be seen if they can execute on this vision, which is why I am not all in yet.

There is still long term risk which is why this stock is still low.  Not a lot but there is some.

Maybe the company doesn't grow?  Maybe they reject Ryan's vision?

But here's the bottom line.

If a shift to digital first does occur, and GME becomes a subscription first omnichannel gaming company, the market cap will conservatively be 10x topline revenues.

Let's say that stays flat next year at $5B.  

This market cap (matching industry standards) **should for an appropriate valuation for a growth stock be $50B.** 

I know this sounds insane.  But if Ryan can complete the transformation he is hoping for this is a very conservative valuation.

A $50B market cap would be $800 a share right now.  Again, this assumes Zero topline revenue growth.  If revenue begins to grow again 10x will be unrealistic and the multiples will get far higher.

This is why the short squeeze is distracting many.  **In 5 years if you diamond hands this company, the fair value of shares can range from $800-$2400 and not be in any sort of bubble or unjustified by fundamentals speculation.**

TLDR; this company if Ryan does what we believe he will may be one of the most undervalued companies this subreddit has ever discovered.  Even if you take profits in a short squeeze, don't forget to keep shares for a long position because opportunities like this rarely come around.  I imagine the short squeeze will allow them to issue more shares to  strengthen the balance sheet, and the company has a fantastic launch pad to start from with the size of it's existing customer base, brand awareness, and revenue. If it becomes clear that GME will be executing on Ryan's vision even at a $10B market cap this will be a steal and I will open a full position then.  I am waiting to expand my position to see what happens with the pivot, as this all goes out the window if GME rejects his strategy.

As always, do your own DD but I have learned a lot about options from this sub and hopefully this helps a few people understand why selling shares may end up being the biggest regret of their life.  **GME's business model has the potential to look just like Amazon's with a focus on the gaming industry and these shares are only at this price because the market is still looking at the old company and not the new startup that GME could become.

Edit*- I wrote this prior to the squeeze that happened.  You all know the explosion the price saw.  My diligence was written for those investing under $40.  I’ve gotten a lot of DMs.  My thesis has not changed that this was a discount at the time I wrote but I am not opening a significant position until I understand what Ryan Cohen’s vision for a turnaround is.  I am also not holding at the moment and had taken profits last week when I couldn’t justify the market cap for the current company under any circumstances and it began feeling like a pump and dump. I will be looking to reopen my original position between $20-$30 and then look to see what the vision for the turnaround looks like before adding more.  This is in no way financial advice and do your own diligence.  I stand by my long term vision for this company IF and only if I like Ryan Cohen’s turnaround plan and pivot to a business model with attractive margins and potential for strong growth."

Short brand analysis:

Brands like Alfa Romeo, Maserati and Jeep are historical brands that can perform well on asian market especially in China — they are still at the beginning, but this is why is exciting. Fiat, Peugeot and Citroén are beloved brands in Europe, Vauxhall is a loved brand in UK. Lucrative SUVs by Jeep, Ram and Dodge will continue to innovate and push in the US. Chrysler is rebuilding its vehicles with success, see Chrysler Pacifica. Fiat, not just in Italy, but in Brazil and Argentina is among the top-sellers. Former PSA is leader in Europe, while FCA in US has an important market share. The lucrative market of pickups and small vans for the deliveries are the part of the culture of these companies, in fact the EU commission before the green light highlighted the fact that former PSA and FCA are leader of the sector. Former PSA has strong EV technologies, see the platforms and products it built, but even FCA showed with the new 500BEV with Samsung batteries how the former italian-american automaker is able to innovate

CEO Star: Carlos Tavares

    Management: CEO Carlos Tavares is widely considered one of the best CEO on the automaker field; Mike Manley head of Stellantis America, former CEO of FCA and former Jeep, Ram, Dodge manager did a very good job after the death of Sergio Marchionne;

Some interesting technologies:

eVMP is the full-electric car platform developed by the former PSA Groupe;

You can read more about it here: https://www.electrive.com/2020/07/29/psa-group-announces-evmp-electric-platform-for-2023/

infotainment UConnect5 by former FCA is full-custom infotainment system based on Android that now Fiat and Jeep uses on their latest models;

New Products

Stellantis has dozens of products, we’ll talk about these models in the next articles, but for now, according to this graphic, the lineup of Stellantis’ products are just 4.5 older than VW products.

This is just the beginning…

This is just a very very little intro about Stellantis and why we believe it will be a real “Empire” in the industry. We’ll talk more and more about it in the next articles, but we want to give some “titles”: the special relationship with Tesla, the strong partnership(s) with Waymo (Google), Foxconn, BPN Paribas, Total, Crédit Agricole, TIM, Amazon, Enel, Engie, Aurora Innovation, Archer Aviation. The successfully spin-off of Ferrari (listed at around $15B, now market cap of $54B), the re-launch of Maserati, the value of Jeep alone is worth dozens of billion dollars according to Morgan Stanley, the investments in India, the projects in China and much much more"

Nokia's Digital Automation Cloud platform is hotter than the girl that you had a crush on in college who caused more financial damage to you than when you decided to short TSLA at $420. Everyone wants it, and similar to that crush of yours, everyone is paying to get some. So, why don't you, like the good little cuckold you are, pay to be a part of this fucking action?

The other good news is that Nokia is extremely fucking cheap right now, at around a 90% discount from its ATH.

If you want value, this stock is certainly one of the better options out there. The company currently has a Market Cap of around $19bn, which is around half of comparable companies such as Corning and Sony Ericsson. It's P/E ratio is 13.19x, which again, is just more than half of the industry standard of 20.26x.

Bottom line - Nokia is undervalued by about 100% of its current price, not taking into account the enormous contracts it has won this past week. Strong buy. DYOR and read the fucking post.

**You are welcome to leave any valuable information or point out any misinformation in the comments and I'll add them to the post.**

**GameStop (GME)**

**Bear Thesis**

* Game console cycle in 2020
   * Boost in revenue due to new console cycle is temporary
   * Low margin on distributing game consoles
   * Main profit margin comes from software and virtual goods
* Brick & mortar is dying due to digitalization of gaming
   * Largest profit center for Gamestop is pre-owned and value video game
   * High revenue but low profit on new video game hardware and software sales
   * Gaming market is moving towards online game download instead of physical discs (Steam, Riot, Gaming Consoles)
   * It’s a matter of time game console manufacturers do not need them for distribution or service centers for their hardware
* Microsoft deal
   * A share of Microsoft Xbox’s digital revenue goes to Gamestop
   * Revenue share unannounced
   * What’s next after the multi-year deal end?
   * Revenue share does not include pre-owned console sales
* Continued closing of physical stores
   * Signifies accelerated closing of business
   * Directors taking profits after record week
   * Older board members sold part of their shares to profit after the record week
      * /u/Invisible0815 pointed out "" board members most likely sold because they will not stand for re-election in june. AND they didnt sell all their shares. one member had to sell because of his own funds regulations. i bet u, he didnt want to sell (hestia capital, he should be on cohens side cause he hates old management). ""

&#x200B;

* Bull case counterarguments from /u/baystreetdegenerate
   * Nintendo next game console in 2022
      * Okay, what happens in the downtime between console releases
      * **OP's reply**: Current generation of consoles are still being traded at GameStop, which is one of their revenue stream
   * Data is a key asset as the company can use it to analyse new trends in gaming Data can be monetized by selling it to gaming manufacturers or developers
      * Outside of tracking customer behavior on their website and sales and trade-in data what else can they even collect? Developers and manufacturers have multiple, and probably better ways of collecting data already and I don't think whatever sort of data GS can gather will be worth much
      * **OP's reply:** Yes, I agree with you that developers and manufacturers have their own way of collecting data. However, GameStop will be able to provide data on the market overview of the gaming industry if they manage to pull of being a centralized e-commerce giant
   * Turning physical stores into a showcase vendor’s games or new concepts
      * That's what youtube is for...
      * **OP's reply:** I believe there's a market for people who prefer physical roadshows or showcases compared to online videos.
   * Possibility to create a neutral platform for trading digital goods and charge a small fee for facilitating transactions
      * Like Steam's marketplace? Aren't most tradeable items on Steam from Valve games? This idea would require games from unrelated devs to have tradeable digital goods and that they would sign it over to GameStop's trading platform, but why would they do that? What would they gain out of it? Or are you talking about digital goods like digital copies of games? No gaming company would allow trading/reselling of digital copies of games. This idea is a non-starter.
      * **OP's reply:** I do agree this idea seem far-fetched, but there is a possibility that it can be pulled off.
   * E-sports tournaments/leagues to be held at physical stores
      * This idea of turning physical stores into social hangouts like the Warhammer DnD game stores is a little sketchy. Because 1) it requires investment into physical space and 2) it essentially turns the store into a PC bang which only really works in Asia due to costs and culture. Furthermore, why would I go out of my way to play games with a bunch of sweaty nerds at a GS store when I could just do it at home without smelling their BO?
      * **OP's reply:** They may convert several stores into PC shops for the purpose of E-sports leagues/tournaments only but not operate a PC shop business. There's definitely money to be made in the growing e-sports scene. E.g. advertising, streaming, etc.
   * RYAN COHEN: e-commerce
      * How does his expertise in pet food ecommerce translate into brick and mortar gaming stores?
      * **OP's reply:** We are speculating that the management are going to announce their plans between Apr-Jun 2021.
   * Low price to sales ratio at 0.4476 as at 15/1/21
      * Well, yes, because there's no clear path to long term revenue

**Bear case conclusion**: Business turnaround fails and trend towards book value at a price target of $5.

&#x200B;

**Bull Thesis**

* Nintendo next game console in 2022
   * 4th year into Nintendo switch’s 7-year life cycle, estimated new console launch in 2022

* Estimated total addressable market for gaming of USD151Bn and growing
   * Established relationship with 42 million gamers through PowerUp Rewards loyalty program
   * 15.2 million members have purchased or traded at GameStop in 2019
   * Data is a key asset as the company can use it to analyse new trends in gaming
   * Data can be monetized by selling it to gaming manufacturers or developers
* Vendor partnerships
   * Turning physical stores into a showcase vendor’s games or new concepts
   * Opportunity to monetize publisher and console manufacturer relationships
   * Possibility to create a neutral platform for trading digital goods and charge a small fee for facilitating transactions
   * E-sports tournaments/leagues to be held at physical stores
* Brand recognition of GameStop and a lack of centralization for gaming
   * Opportunity for GameStop to be a centralized e-commerce platform for gaming consoles, digital games, merchandise, customization of computers, laptops, gaming chairs, etc.
* Low price to sales ratio at **0.4476** as at 15/1/21
* Board refreshment - Ryan Cohen, Alan Attal and Jim Grube previously from successful Chewy Inc. (CHWY)

   * **Largest e-commerce acquisition.** Sold Chewy to PetSmart in April 2017 for **USD 3.35 billion**
   * Chewy went public in 2019 at a valuation of **USD 8.7 billion.**
   * Saw an opportunity in GameStop and took a stake of **12.9% as of latest SEC filing**
* Potential short squeeze (Speculative)
   * Estimated short interest of 138% not covered
   * Any positive news or materialization of bull case may send share price further up

But don't put money in SPCX thinking you're going to get a part of daddy Elon's baby.

I have looked into investing in SpaceX myself. For small-timers like me (less than $20M investment), the only avenue is a so called special purpose vehicle (SPV), an LLC that in total attracts $20M+ of investment, and is then able to purchase part of SpaceX. Usually, investment minimums are $200-250k, since the max number of investors in an LLC is apparently 100. Unfortunately, the SpaceX SPV's I've found charge outrageous fees. 5% up front, then 2% annually and finally 20% of any profit. That could work for a couple of years, but I think SpaceX is at least a 20 year investment horizon. It may be be the most valuable company in the solar system by then, by some margin, but still.

Other ways to get some SpaceX exposure, which others have mentioned, includes buying GOOG (perhaps 0.5%), and mutual funds BPTIX (3%), or BFGIX (2.6%), which all pretty much sucks."

A while ago I started mixing unusual options activity into my ~~gambling~~investing.  At first I lost a shitload of money chasing dumbass whales with zero plan, but now I actually have a pretty good feel for it.  I still fuck up alot, but more often I do not fuck up.  This is to help those of you who want to start chasing whales, or are at a basic level and want to do it better.

I'm using some plays from this week as examples because they are fresh in my mind and I have a couple screenshots.

**Tools**
I use barchart in tandem with Unusual Whales. For barchart, you can honestly get by using their free version, you just can't sort as well.  They have a free month trial too.  I also pay the 20 bucks for Unusual Whales to confirm what I scan, and they have a good stocks volume standard deviation tool.  I have zero affiliation to either, just saying what I use.

There are way more technical ways to do this, but I like to use my eyes to scan sporadically throughout the day like a boomer.

**Basic Concept**
Long story short, you're ideally chasing the options purchases of what are, presumably, deep-pocketed individuals or institutions.  UOA identifies certain options contract orders that are higher than the average daily contract order.  For example, if the average daily option volume on an GME weekly is 4,000, and an option order enters for 4,000 or higher, it's flagged as unusual activity since it's a multiple of that daily average volume--sometimes it shows as multiple orders if ""they"" push through a few smaller purchases that produce heavy volume.

MM are sneks who like to move in silence, which they can do with with stock positions via dark pools and the like.  However, they can't get away with that with options activity--it all shows.  That fact, young autist, is your slingshot against the institutional goliath.

**Hunting the Whale**
So I've got my unusual options activity page open on barchart or wherever for the current day.  I adjust the expiration date option so that the options I'm looking at don't expire past a couple weeks out (more on why later), then I'm ready to eye scan.

I typically start by looking for **one of two things: 1) large clusters of orders that belong to one ticker  or 2) sporadic orders for a ticker that consistently show up over a couple hours, but belong to non-hot, non-meme stonks that do NOT have earnings imminent.**  To make sure I'm looking at something potentially weird, I choose to exclude options that expire more than a couple weeks out.

**1) Clusters of orders—ABNB example**
The way I scope it is kind of a tiered process.  *First*, I'm looking to see if there are any clusters of orders that catch my eye on a quick scan.  *Second*, I'm looking to see if those clusters of orders contain both calls AND puts, with some OTM activity and spreads preferred.  *Third*, I look to see if the number of seperate call orders outweighs the number of put orders (or vice versa), and additionally I look to see if the volume of the calls drastically outweighs the volume of the puts (or vice versa).  

**Why?  Because it helps you determine if the options order is just a hedge, or if it’s hedging against itself as it’s own positio**n. This is super important so try to follow along-- most UOA is just institutions hedging; Mr. MM has a nice, busy life and fancy yacht and can't just exit his positions back and forth all day like a WSBer.  He also has like a billion shares of his stonks, so if he dumps it when he's got paper hands it will siginficantly tank the value and cause a ripple effect.  So, *instead* of hedging by dumping his shit, he hedges by adding OTM options against his position--next level fucking diamond hands.  That would be the type of whale order from Mr. MM we don't want to follow.  *But*, if Mr. MM buys 4,000 FB call options in a few blocks, and you see like 1,000 in FB puts go through right alongside it, the odds are that someone is betting big on FB and using the puts as a hedge, since the puts represent a smaller volume in the call/put ratio.  Instead of the options being a hedge for a bigger stock position they hold, these types of option clusters indicate that the option order itself is the big, independent play, and it's hedging itself with lower volume order vs the higher volume (4,000 calls to 1,000 puts).

**Then I do an easy confirmation**.  I check the tickers general trend the past week or so in a chart, do a news search on twitter of their ticker for news catalysts and sentiment, and google and YouTube to see if the crayola kids think it's a good nerd play.

**Example**: Here's the screenshot on some ABNB UOA I noticed and played this week.  It went to 200% and change within a couple hours, but I had unfortunate diamond hands and sold for about half that.

[ABNB UOA](https://i.imgur.com/mYDXYmN.jpg)

So, this a softball.  **First**, you can see that ABNB all of a sudden explodes with all these options showing up at 12:52–that's our cluster.  **Second**, the clusters have both calls and puts in that minute timespan, with some put orders showing at the bottom of the cluster.  Some of the calls are deep OTM, as far as 200c.  **Third**, the call orders far outweigh the put orders in both amount and volume.  *Awwwww shit, looks like we got more than a hedge—we’re onto something.*

**Confirmation time**: ABNB had been on a general uptrend, and I typically don't like to chase, but I combed twitter and saw their were rumors of the CEO speaking the following day, and that news had just broken of their DC booking cancellations.  I looked back into the morning, and saw a few more unusual blocks, and a few more rolled in just after the cluster pictured above.

Passed the smell test.  Options bought, tendies gained.

**Sparse Orders: SNAP example**

The same principles can apply to orders on tickers that pop up individual orders, not large clusters,  which **a) haven’t had much attention b) have been on a steep downtrend—this makes the order unusual, and/or c) seem to keep popping up in single orders over a few hours to a day.**The same principles as above apply, but if you see these types of orders with very little time left until expiration, you can assume assume it's probably not a hedge.  SNAP isn't the best example of the week because there wasn't a put order in this block.  But, there was positive TA sentiment when I searched, SNAP had been on an oversold downtrend, and I don't have screenshots left of the better ones I saw and went after.  **Plus, importantly, IT WAS TOWARDS THE END OF THE DAY** (this is huge, EOD is prime time for AH news whales)

[SNAP UOA](https://i.imgur.com/GGr5bra.jpg)

A better example from this week though is SPCE, which had only a few orders sprinkled throughout the day, and one toward the end of the day which was DEEP, DEEP OTM expiring 1/15.  **That’s a flag for us—sporadic listing throughout the day, OTM toward the end of the day. ** BAM! EOD SPCE OTM calls sprinkle in, ARK invests to kick off AH, SPCE moons. 

**Sparse Orders Patterns: Connecting the dots on tech rebound with FB and SNAP**

Seeing the SNAP orders above sharpened my eyes that day to looking for a pattern with tech on the whole, since big tech had been so royally gaped the past week.  I kept seeing FB options like this pop up

[https://i.imgur.com/muVGtq2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/T54peER.jpg)

Sometimes you can put together sporadic listings and create a working theory based on a sector.  Because this and similar FB orders were deep OTM and one day out, I knew there was a risk they could a hedge, but also knew that the tech sector was due for a rebound and saw SNAP posting sporadic OTM as well.  **So, I bought my options for each of those two another week out and closer to ATM (important, more below), to give the whale some breathing room** in case was it was a hedge, even though the technicals agreed with the bounce.  The whales were right, and it was an easy little overnight profit.


**How I’ve Fucked Up 1: Don’t get tricked by trends**

Although we like to believe institutions are ahead of the curve, often they are just trend-riding lemmings who follow what's already way, way up.  They buy the top, just like WSB tardies such as yourself specialize in.  So, when you see shit like this below, take a minute to think before you get excited:

[NIO UOA LIKE THIS WAS NONSTOP](https://i.imgur.com/JCZBx2s.jpg)

It was the same for all the memes: PLUG, FCEL, MARA, and RIOT all week, dominating the orders.  If something is already too popular, just stay away from it.  You can ride something up, but when you see massive orders on shit that's already like 400% IV, just...don't.

**How I’ve Fucked Up 2: DO give the MM’s some breathing room**

*Even if you’re confident in a move you see that is a few days out, extend your play a week or two further out minimum, and strike it closer to ATM.*  If you can't do either of those things because you can't afford the premium just skip that play and check back for something new later; I promise a better opportunity will arise.  You can recover from bagholding, but you cannot recover from blowing your account on an incorrect 0DTE.

Breathing room is also important because often whales will have the news but not the exact timing.  Two months ago I followed a DDOG whale on a Thursday 1DTE that expired worthless the next day.  The following Monday (1 trade day later) DDOG made the announcement that rocketed them like 20%--if I'd given them a week's breathing room, it would've been a 15 bagger.  Fucking F.

**So, to review:** look for order clusters or sporadic ticker orders that a) have a mix of calls and puts with one dominating the other b) unpopular tickers that have deep OTM or close expirations c) always check chatter afterward and fundamentals and d) try to put together a narrative of things that are related that catch your eye (this Monday's EV run or this Friday's tech bounce could be next week's airline dominance or cruiseline craze--connect the dots).  Initially look for options expiring soon, as they indicate the most riskiness--and therefore confidence--if the MM is not hedging.  Shop with a short term eye, buy with a long term choice. 

**10 Things That Will Help You Not GUH:**

**1)** Monday and Friday morning/afternoon are the most accurate whale times, according to data from Unusual Whales

**2)** If you don't have PDT always save some spending power for EOD shopping

**3**) If you don't have PDT never, ever follow a whale with a weekly.  Sometimes the news the whale bets on is a 'sell the news' event, and you won’t recover from a drop especially if there is IV crush involved. 

**4)** Always give the whale breathing room by purchasing an expiration at least a week further out

**4b**) Always give the whale breathing room by going closer to ATM strikes than theirs

**5)** Sign up for barchart monthly trial (then continue it) and unusual whales--they're each like 20 bucks and thats way less than you spend on an FD. 

**6**) You don't need to learn TA, but you need to check technicals on the tickers you want to chase--almost every major ticker has youtubers or fintwits giving their daily or weekly TA.  This way you know if it's a proper breakout happening if the whale hits, and you're not just guessing at when to take profits.  Remember, whales can buy wayyyyyyy OTM and sell for massive profit at any point--they *aren’t* bagholding a call until it's in the money like you are. You may be 10% up waiting for the next 80% GME day while your whale has sold at their target 5% profits on the play and is chillin. 

**7**) Leave at least 10% of your account spending power free each day.  I promise, the one time you go full boat you will see the most obvious whale play at the end of the day.  Then you won't be able to do shit about it and you'll hate yourself when it's a 10 bagger overnight.  Trust me.

**8**) Make sure the ticker you're chasing isn't just ER anticipation/bets.  Always check earnings dates before buying.

**9**) Remember whales are people, so they can be stupid, too.  Don't baghold a position that is clearly fucked for some news that looks unlikely to come.  They are gambling addicts just like you, except they have more money.

**10**) Always take profits if you ask yourself if it's time to.  If it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to close the position.

**Positions**:
Dumped a ton of stuff and loading up Tuesday because long weekends scare me, but saw some ineresting 2/5s I held including

WKHSc
PLTRc
SPYc (1/19, 1/22)
LMNDp

And a couple tickers that I couldn’t post lol.  also have AAPL and JD leaps

***

TLDR
Use a service to follow whales so you can get ahead of announcements.  Look for clusters of options activity that hedge themselves via call/put ratio, and do a legitimate check for TA and catalysts to confirm their moves.  Never follow a whale into a weekly, but use weeklies are your best screener.

***

*I might do a pretty consistent DD post (a couple times a week) on what I’m seeing at the end of each day if there is interest, and if it’s not a day I don’t have a ton of real work.  If something quick catches my eye I usually throw it up on my twitter @yourboymilt (there’s no notification thing on here mods, just trying to be helpful— not selling anything) I’ll also probably throw some more potential Monday positions on here over the weekend once I decide to do some more research.  Later.*"

ky63dw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky63dw/google_trends_analysis_of_amzn_searches_for_those/,Google Trends Analysis of Amzn searches. For those playing upcoming earnings.,23,19,2021-01-16 06:56:08,"&#x200B;

I've compiled google trends comparing Amazon searches over the last 3 years. Then, I correlated that information with Earning Reports. Keep in mind this doesn't take into account people using the app store. 

TL;DR. I've deduced that Q2's huge boost from earnings could have been easily been spotted using Google Trends. Also, I've found the overall interest in searches during Q4 this year is better than 2019 Q4 Google trends, in which the underlying had an 8% pop from Q4 ER. Keep in mind Consensus Estimate is almost double that of 2019 Q4 ER. 

&#x200B;

To help you make sense of the Google Trends graphs I've posted, I'm also including a chart that fellow Amazontard u/slocs1 used in his EPS post. 

&#x200B;

TABLE 1

https://preview.redd.it/9i90ampipkb61.png?width=1472&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fa531224626dabfcf0a80ff6606aedc695099b8

TABLE 2 shows trending results for Q2 Amazon google trends. The last big ride for Amazon was for q2 (april-june 2020). Google trends justified Q2's pop as average google interest was well over 80 and mostly in the 90s.

&#x200B;

TABLE 2 

[2020 Q2 amazon google trends ](https://preview.redd.it/r2s8ec4vekb61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=59380e74bc0f0bca95f145e015aceb575317dc83)

&#x200B;

Q4 2019 ER had an 8% pop day of earnings release. Mostly in 50s and 60s interest, plus holiday pop, then averaged out at 75 interest. Trends showed in TABLE 3:

TABLE 3

[2019 Q4 amazon google trends ](https://preview.redd.it/ywz1etq9fkb61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0805354ecd48509438c5ff78d272c0a20e6760b)

2020 Q4  shows very similar interest patterns to previous years. The dip in interest is from the election, not sure what that mid October pop in interest was. The general interest is higher than 2019.

&#x200B;

TABLE 4

[2020 Q4 amazon google trends](https://preview.redd.it/bv6kuc6hjkb61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=23f61372729937b710a393e282430613d2627ed7)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TABLE 5 shows entire 2019-2020 google trends. Again that Q2 growth in interest (may) directly correlates to stock's growth during Q2 Earnings Release. The holiday season interest was stretched out this year, and shows it was 10 days longer than 2019 Q4, which is promising. 

&#x200B;

TABLE 5

[2019-2020 Amazon google trends](https://preview.redd.it/3b56dq10kkb61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=efc1925f3c7310f3b63dc859814e17b287312235)

And here is 5 year google trends. Clearly, massive growth in Q2 this year, but radically declined to the yearly mean for Q3, which is possibly why Q3 ER dropped the underlying stock price, as interest stagnated, although it was still above the previous years interest. 

&#x200B;

TABLE 6

[5 Year Amazon google trends](https://preview.redd.it/r5hjpvq4nkb61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=623a3375c36d2baec87a5f66b71679134a49d42d)

&#x200B;

Although Google Trends isn't taking into account all of the industries AMZN is dipping it's pen into (i.e. AWS). I do think it's compelling all the same. I will say that I wish I saw more of a drastic change in Q4 google trends to be more confident my calls will print. Please, give me feedback and advice as my calls are bleeding rocket fuel :)

I am also an engineer at an OEM. IoT  has been getting more popular lately but BB isn't doing anything special  here. Companies like TopCon (Tractors/Combines), Rexroth (Mobile  Equipment), IFM (Industrial), ect. are way ahead of the game here with  this tech and have been doing it a lot longer. BB says they have 63% of  the market on EV's? How many companies actually make EV's? Not many. If I  was an automaker I'd be looking to adjacent industries for an already  existing tech to use.

This  is what TESLA did by using the RC controller from Rexroth, which is  mainly a mobile hydraulics supplier (i.e. construction equipment). Every TESLA car has one of these controllers under their hood. 

TopCon  has 15 years in this IoT space and self driving tractors all use this  technology. They are also thinking about breaking into the automotive  field as well.

If you're an  engineer looking into IoT, you've probably heard of IFM as well. These  guys are like the Cadillac of IoT/Touchscreen displays. Incredibly smart  engineers work here and all their products are made with a focus on  data security. I've probably sat down in a dozen or so meetings with  various companies about IoT. Most are generic bland dashboards and use  the same hardware. So from an OEM standpoint, how do I choose which one  to use? Well who has the most value-add in this space, in terms of  cooperation/engineering support for integrating their tech into our  equipment? IFM is leagues above these other companies in this instance.  Most of the companies out there treat IoT like it's a side hustle but  it's going to be huge going forward no doubt.

Tldr;  BB will probably get squeezed out of this space like they did in the  phone industry because major players are ahead of the game compared to  them. Partnered with AWS? Oh boy! Better watch out! News flash, the  companies listed above all use either AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for  IoT data already."

[*Obligatory do your own research and draw your own conclusions statement.*]

**POSITIVES**

- Both Sony and Microsoft are using custom AMD APUs in their latest consoles. (APU = CPU + GPU combined into one.) In case you've been living under a rock for the past 8 weeks, both the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X have been selling like hotcakes, with fresh inventory being depleted within minutes. 

- AMD has been the underdog vs Intel in the consumer desktop CPU space for as long as I can remember. But for the first time in 15 years, [AMD is winning in terms of market share](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-overtakes-intel-in-desktop-cpu-market-share-for-the-first-time-in-15-years). Intel has been able to stay competitive with their latest generation of CPUs by offering significant discounts. Despite this, AMD's CPUs still remain in higher demand and sell out almost instantly (at MSRP). 

- AMD owns Radeon, which is their brand of Graphics Cards. These compete directly with Nvidia's RTX GPUs. Performance wise, they're up there with NVDA, but still lagging a bit in the ray tracing department which most will agree is the future. Key word being future, it's not a big deal *yet*. And thanks to the pandemic these too also sell out super quick. 

- AMD's next generation of mobile CPUs will be launching soon. Just like their desktop lineup, you can expect these to outperform their Intel counterparts as well. AMD's previous mobile generation of 4000 series chips crushed Intel - the biggest problem was availability. People wanted the AMD chips but for whatever reason, they were found mostly in the mid-range and lower end gaming laptops. I expect the availability issue to improve greatly this year. As we can see, certain manufacturer's like Asus are already featuring the AMD SKUs in their [top of the line gaming laptops](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-ROG-Strix-Scar-17-ditches-Comet-Lake-H-for-an-unlocked-Ryzen-9-5900HX-with-liquid-metal-and-RTX-3080-Mobile.514702.0.html). 

**RISK FACTORS**

- While speaking purely from a monetary standpoint, overall I think the pandemic has been a net positive for tech companies like AMD. However, AMD's own fearless leader Lisa Su recently said: [""...the COVID environment has increased shipping and freight costs, which are hard to avoid. As we get into a more normal environment, this should improve. This also matters for our planned graphics updates through the first half of the year, as we have a lot of product coming to market.""](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16409/amd-ceo-dr-lisa-su-interview-on-2021-demand-supply-tariffs-xilinx-and-epyc)

- Unable to keep up with demand: [AMD and NVIDIA confirm that GPU stock levels will remain non-existent for the foreseeable future](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-and-NVIDIA-confirm-that-GPU-stock-levels-will-remain-non-existent-for-the-foreseeable-future.514957.0.html).
[Microsoft has asked AMD for help in combating Xbox Series X stock shortages](https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-has-asked-amd-for-help-in-combating-xbox-series-x-stock-shortages)

- Apple has already started producing their own in house ARM processors for both their laptops and desktops. This doesn't really affect AMD (yet) because [Apple has been using Intel chips in their laptops and desktops for the past 15 years.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/why-apple-is-breaking-a-15-year-partnership-with-intel-on-its-macs-.html#:~:text=Menu-,Apple%20is%20breaking%20a%2015%2Dyear%20partnership%20with,on%20its%20Macs%20%E2%80%94%20here's%20why&text=Apple's%20new%20laptops%20and%20desktop,can%20improve%20laptop%20battery%20life.) And despite being a massive company, Apple only makes up about [13% of the PC market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/576473/united-states-quarterly-pc-shipment-shareapple/#:~:text=In%20the%20fourth%20quarter%20of,the%20fourth%20quarter%20of%202020.). AMD is still Apple's partner for discrete graphics, but that could change soon. This is definitely something you'll want to keep your eye on though because other titans like [Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/article/microsoft-processors-int/microsoft-working-on-in-house-chips-for-its-servers-pcs-idUSKBN28S2Y1), [Google](https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2020/04/google-is-making-its-own-chips.html), and Amazon are all either working on, or producing their own in house chips. In my opinion, this is not nearly as bad as it sounds. Let's break it down by company.

 - [Microsoft currently uses Intel-based processors for the majority of its Azure cloud services, and most of the company’s Surface lineup run on Intel chips, too.](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189450/microsoft-arm-processors-chips-servers-surface-report#:~:text=Microsoft%20has%20worked%20with%20AMD,move%20away%20from%20just%20Intel.&text=Microsoft%20co%2Dengineered%20an%20ARM,a%20couple%20of%20months%20ago.) Only some of Microsoft's laptops run on AMD hardware. 

 - [Google is readying its own in-house processors for use in future Pixel devices, including both phones and eventually Chromebooks, too.](https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/google-said-to-be-preparing-its-own-chips-for-use-in-pixel-phones-and-chromebooks/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADHPvna5MKFbSAnwNIPsW4kMhD7zhe-7IJtk0AzQP1Rrer78Olm_S_019orsNcQA9Ezk_sCz0z8My1nHGdTap_0-SYZtHKs1U9v9ni-AGkuJzp3cOHYUDSEu7b90qMQIDsc-PC8tFFceJElhUcPhJ3ctKtatuQcLkrIF1VotSBz1#:~:text=The%20Axios%20report%20says%20that,machine%20learning%20and%20Google%20Assistant.) Again, because Google currently relies more on Intel CPUs this is not a big blow to AMD's bottom line. A quick check of BestBuy's inventory shows [47](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?_dyncharset=UTF-8&id=pcat17071&iht=y&keys=keys&ks=960&list=n&qp=parent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Celeron%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i3%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i5%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i7%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20m3%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20m7%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Pentium&sc=Global&st=chromebook&type=page&usc=All%20Categories) Chromebooks with Intel SKUs and only [7 with AMD parts](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?_dyncharset=UTF-8&id=pcat17071&iht=y&keys=keys&ks=960&list=n&qp=parent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20A4%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20A6%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20Ryzen%203&sc=Global&st=chromebook&type=page&usc=All%20Categories).
 - The chips that Amazon is producing are for their [cloud computing business](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/amazon-apple-chips-intel-arm.html). These were also replaced by Intel.

AMD has earnings coming up on the 26th which I think they're going to shatter. I probably would not recommend trying to play off of that though as ERs can be quite unpredictable, especially if the news is positive. Personally, I think AMD is going to 🚀🚀 after ER, but I'm not betting on that. Which is why my current position (30% of my portfolio) is LEAPS: (x2) Jan 2022 90c.

My conservative 6 month PT for AMD is 110. Also open to hearing any other potential risks I may have overlooked. To be on the safe side I'm only including 6 rockets.

[$POSH to the moon](https://preview.redd.it/kov88euxh8b61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5960482e7251c81886102864f0b88a40f1868c95)

Alright everyone. Poshmark will soon be joining the ""Becky Index"" with a much anticipated IPO tomorrow morning. While I wouldn’t define myself as a necessarily intelligent (or competent) investor, but I am very familiar with the platform and the re-commerce industry as a seller and buyer.

I’ve been selling people’s used shit since high school, in an attempt to finance a previous weed addiction. Fast forward 4 years and I have still been selling people’s used shit, though now the funds are going toward monthly Model 3 payments I am underwater for. That said, I’ve been selling used clothing and have completed a bit over $300k in gross sales through various “re-commerce” platforms such as eBay, Amazon, FB Marketplace, Mercari, Grailed, and Poshmark. eBay is the most well established platform for used clothing sales and thus wins for market share, but Poshmark wins in nearly every other category- which I have broken down below.

&#x200B;

[Yes, I am one of us](https://preview.redd.it/1nroqslei8b61.jpg?width=2902&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1df27f7feea578af8e41262d689dea6c260f84fe)

Before we get started, it is important to understand what the hell $POSH is and why it is a buy below $50. Poshmark is essentially eBay, though marketed towards Millennials, Gen XYZ etc, and those who value convenience. *Poshmark is a leading social marketplace for new and secondhand style for women, men, kids, home, and more.*

The social media aspect is a bit of a spectacle, as no one really wants to socialize and add “Poshmark Stories” of their shit to get a sale- but this method does succeed in retaining returning customers and rewarding sellers whoa re active on the platform. Because of this, the average time spent on poshmark is 27 minutes a day, which is less than, although comparable to that of social media sites like TikTok and Instagram- rather than the likes of eBay, Depop, or Mercari. The company also turned a profit of $20.9 last year, which is bullish considering the amount of money they burn and COVID.

**Selling fees:**

Poshmark has ridiculous selling fees, although it has proven to be beneficial in respect to revenue. The platform makes money by charging a fee for every sale: 20 per cent for items more than $15, and a flat fee of $2.95 for items under $15 that are less than that. Products worth more than $500 must be sent to Poshmark for evaluation, but the average order value is $33. 20% is ridiculous, especially considering that this does not include shipping costs of the seller/buyer. All the other platforms take a standard deviation around 10%, which begs the question why the fuck do they charge so much. People complain but continue to use the platform because of the next point- shipping.

**Shipping:**

For the past few years, the platform and its social media/YouTube influences have been aggressively marketing towards stay at home mothers and teenage girls. These aren’t your typical streetwear wannabe EnTrePenUeR businessmen, and Poshmark certainly knows that. They supply USPS Priority Mail shipping labels for every. single. fucking. order. Have a 2oz necktie that would ship for $2.62 USPS first class? Fuck that. Poshmark send you a $7.11 Priority Mail label that will arrive to your buyers doorstep faster than Amazons COVID shit prime delayed delivery. While a cost deterrent for lower value items and cheap buyers, this system simplifies the selling process of needing to calculate shipping costs and having to deal with various mail carriers. Packages rarely gets lost and any lost package issues are generally covered by Poshmark or the insure USPS provides through Priority Mail.

&#x200B;

[Less shipping hassle = more time for sellers do shit like this](https://preview.redd.it/iq6b6102i8b61.jpg?width=1484&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=673b69586ea4bdf52c8965da9c89c49d8cd48c26)

$7.11 is cheaper than my Ebay rate for any priority mail, so I also give this one to Poshmark as they seem to have worked something out with USPS. For eBay, if I can shove a pair of Jeans into a Flat Rate Envelope it will cost me $7.59 to ship. Any heavier or larger clothing items cost me, on average, about $9-14. While this last part is speculation, I do believe that Poshmark does get a kickback or receive some commission from every label. The cost has risen about $2 in the past couple years, which is a higher percentile than the USPS shipping rate increase.

**Convenience:**

Buyers love convenience, and poshmark certainly does well in that regard. Poshmark is a large SoCiAl MeDiA MarKetPace, giving them access to a fuckload of your data. When you sign up, you can add the city you live in, university, job etc. You also have the ability to like and share items.

Both of these combined, allow the app to recognize who you are what what type of items you may be interested in buying. My homepage looks the same as my closet at home, shoving new items, markdowns, etc from brands I am much too familiar with.

A lot of purchases tend to be of impulse on the buyer, which is good for sellers since Poshmark doesn’t allow returns (unless fake/ruined/ not as described). I have a handful of buyers asking me to return items every week because they don’t like the color, fit, or price; I tell them to fuck off and Poshmark gets to keep the commission. For reference, my return rate on eBay is about 7% for no reason.

I just sold this Ikea Rug today that I was too lazy to return. I paid $10 for it and the buyer most likely saw the nice stock photos on their homepage and failed to crosscheck the price on IKEA. Convenience of the homepage.

**SEO:**

I study rhetoric so I have no fucking clue how to rank or asses the SEO of a company, but look for any used clothing brand and Poshmark will generally be the first to show up on google. If that doesn’t signify good SEO, idk remember I study rhetoric.

**Market share:**

In terms of Fashion and clothing APPS, I think Poshmark does fairly well. An in depth DD would reference technology, social media, and e-commerce platforms as well- but I’ll just include a graph I found.

[Chart](https://preview.redd.it/h7rm9we7i8b61.jpg?width=1450&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05dcf73e82484e67a62d5df146ef327c05a0f1ae)

In terms of their presence online, I think Poshmark does the best job engaging with their users. They are constantly reposting buyers and sellers images on instagram- making it somewhat of an incentive to use the platform and engage with others in the community. I’ve been posted a few times on their instagram page and story. As a seller, I’ve also been invited out to drinks with some of the staff in SF. Was all food and drinks at the bar covered by Poshmark? Idk ask my Jonny Walker Blue.

&#x200B;

[They follow me on IG lol](https://preview.redd.it/rk0sby59j8b61.png?width=1617&format=png&auto=webp&s=202d187e321d43163c5a0c197284992ad3e1bdda)

I do about 5x the amount in sales on eBay, and have never engaged in any form of communication with anyone not from their Philippines call center. I understand eBay is significantly larger, but this does show that Poshmark’s ethos is something different and much appreciated in the re-commerce industry.

&#x200B;

[They probably spent $10k renting the bar for 2 hours. There was were 10 sellers, including myself](https://preview.redd.it/hj58ify9i8b61.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab39b5983c504e6440b825746dec912ecea8d34f)

**IPO:**

As a long time seller, I was offered direct offering shares which I have committed to. They were planning on $32-39 but I have been notified that the IPO price will be $42 with an offering size of 6,600,000. I’m not much of a share guy, so I will also be buying 100c leaps when they become available.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** I think Poshmark is a great platform, doing very different things than traditional selling platforms. Much higher fees and seamless shipping integration makes the platform a winner. They are valued as a selling platform, but they are much more than simply just that. Can you buy Lululemon pants at $GME? No, but you can on Poshmark. I also have not proofread this post at all.

Re-commerce is covid proof. I'm going 50% $POSH and 50% $EBAY this year. Fourth quarter has been consistently the best for online clothing resellers. When they release 2020 Q4 earnings, just watch :)

Edit: Formatting is fuk. Also Poshmark opened at $102"
kwvu0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwvu0d/zoom_puts_are_free_money_dd_inside/,"Zoom Puts are Free Money, DD Inside",28,51,2021-01-14 10:06:57,"Okay okay, I get it, I’m a 🌈🐻. Let’s get started.

TL;DR ZM $220p Aug 20th 2021, $160p Jan 21st 2022. Buy stocks during run up to 2021 Q1 Earnings Report, sell at the top.

Zoom is, of course, a video conference platform which has seen significant growth over the past 10 months as a result of COVID-19 shutting down offices, schools, universities, etc. Due to Zoom offering a “professional” paid service which allows for Zoom calls between more than 3 people to last for longer than 40 minutes, ZM has raked in massive amounts of money. However, Zoom’s days are numbered and for a vast number of reasons.

Zoom’s Circumstances:

Firstly, COVID-19. The pandemic is THE only reason why Zoom is relevant in the first place. Did much of anyone know what Zoom was this time last year? It’s use has only gotten so vast due to the fact that businesses, churches, theaters, schools, universities, and all other kinds of sectors were forced to conduct business out of the office. This growth can be easily demonstrated by their Year to Year comparison in revenue, up 366% from this time in 2020, according to Google Finances’ information on ZM. 

Second, the vaccine. According to Dr. Anthony Fauci, we should expect for our daily lives to become “normal” again by the end of 2021, and for herd immunity to begin to impact the COVID numbers by the end of the summer. I am actually more bullish in my valuation, as I was with the vaccine where I accurately predicted that we would have vaccines rolled out prior to 2021 despite Fauci himself saying we would have them by Q1 2021. I don’t think that Fauci is wrong; I believe that he is tempering our expectations. He did not want to say that we would have a vaccine before 2021 because if there was a hiccup in the production of them, he loses credibility to the public (even more than he has because of Trump’s rhetoric). Therefore, I predict that we will begin to see the effects of the vaccine by late May or early June, with herd immunity coming into effect by September and no later than October. 

Third, the financials. As previously stated, Zoom has had a great run with through 2020. Y/Y, they increased their revenue by 366%. However, by Q4 of 2020, they already began to slip. In July of 2020 (Q2), they had a total of 748 million dollars cash on hand after they added 273 million from their revenue. This is a SIGNIFICANT amount of money and is a huge bull flag. However, by October of 2020 (Q3) they actually lost 2.75 Million dollars in their cash on hand. Big whoop, right? Who cares? They lost 2.75 million dollars in their COH and still have 730 Million COH. This is actually a significant bear flag, because the difference in COH added to their pockets from Q3 to Q4 was 104%. They went from adding literally hundreds of millions of dollars to their pockets to losing some of it. There are arguments you could make that says that this is not a bear flag and that this is actually a good thing, they’re reinvesting money into their company, but given the rest of my DD, I will prove it is bearish. 

Zoom’s Future:

Let’s be real here, do you expect to be using Zoom in a year from now? Imagine turning on your phone and going in an app folder, seeing Zoom this time next year, and thinking to yourself, “why do I still have this?” before promptly deleting the app. Do you see that as a realistic future? I do. 

There’s no doubt that Zoom will still have SOME relevancy in a years time. Video conferences were still occurring prior to the pandemic and will continue after the pandemic, just not NEARLY to the same extent. Businesses and universities will still hold onto Zoom Pro subscriptions in order to conduct business/classes on days with weather too harsh to come in physically, and some people may end up using Zoom as the de facto video calling service like Skype once was. However, the use of the service will largely halt by Q1 of 2022 and Zoom will be a memory for a majority of people. 

Zoom hemorrhaging $2 million in Q3 of 2020 is just the tip of the iceberg. For Q1 of 2021, I could see Zoom actually increasing in revenue once again, especially since we have been observing a nasty spike in COVID-19 which has driven the few businesses that were operating in person back to work at home. This could lead to a temporary jump in price once they report earnings for Q1 of 2021, however, given the situation of the world, such a spike in price is merely temporary and the only way to capitalize on that is to buy Zoom stock in the run up to their earnings and sell at the top in order to mitigate some of the loss that will be reflected in your puts at the time.

Their financials are slipping already, the end of the pandemic is in sight, and everyone on the planet craves human touch now more than ever before in history. Zoom is not long for this earth.

The play:

I predict that Zoom’s stock will begin to crash back down to pre-pandemic levels around May or June, eventually meeting resistance around $150 by no later than October. The price will occasionally bump up during this crash as news reports of “cases spike in X area” or “California reimposes the mask requirement”, but rest assured that Zoom WILL eventually crash down to slightly above where it was pre-pandemic. I would also argue that it’s possible that Zoom could temporarily crash all the way down to below $100, but if it did it would likely only do so for a few hours before resistance begins to push it back up. 

Conclusion: 

Zoom has a lot of short term upside, I expect we’ll reach a $400/share stock price again within the next few months. This justifies ARK and Cathie adding Zoom to their plays. They either are playing the short term growth that will occur until at least Q1 of 2021 or believe in the long term (and I mean long term, at least 10 years) fundamentals of the company. Granted, Zoom’s fundamentals are strong, but not strong enough to maintain their current stock price. This time next year, they will be valued between $150-200, which is still an over 100% increase when looking at the stock price this time last year (around $76/share). As a result, the dip can be taken advantage of.

My plays:

I’m going to buy into a $220 Put for August 20th, and a $170 Put for January 21st, 2022. 

Buy Zoom stock in the run up to their Q1 2021 earnings report, expecting to see an increase in revenue for that quarter, then sell at the top. 

If this play is too risky for you, refrain from calls or puts. Sell off after Q1 Earnings Report and then wait for the dip, then buy back in on stocks when Zoom is below $200 to take advantage of the stock being more in line with their fundamentals, long term cash flow, etc.

My recommendations:

If you are holding Zoom Stocks or calls, SELL THEM. They may go up temporarily but this is likely the highest Zoom’s stock will average until Pandemic 2 electric boogaloo is released in 2120. 

So, WSB, is this gonna bring us to tendie town or is this a one way trip to my mother’s basement? You be the judge.

Are you curious about how the government is going to steal your tendies or, more likely, if all of the losses from your degenerate yolo trades can actually help you at all? Well lucky for you, Papa is here to provide a basic overview of the tax process in FAQ style. Fair warning, no DD here and there will be a *TL;DR* so you can now scroll and ignore my labor of love. *This is 100% not legal advice and is intended for general educational purposes.*

***Section One: For those with tendies***

**Q: What is tax?**

**A:** Google it.

**Q: What types of tax are associated with stonks?**

**A:** While not an inclusive list, the traditional tax types you will run into will be: 1. Long Term Capital Gains (“LTCG”); 2. Short Term Capital Gains (“STCG”); 3. Long Term Capital Loss (“LTCL”); 4. Short Term Capital Loss (“STCL”) (*applicable to 99% of you*); and 5. Dividend tax treatment.

**Q: What is the difference between long term or short term?**

**A:** Gain/Loss is long term verses short term based on, you guessed it, the duration of time you owned the qualifying investment. Over twelve (12) months is long term and under twelve (12) months is short term.

**Q: Is my option long term or short-term gain/loss?**

**A:** You most likely trade FDs, it’s short term. \* Semi-joke, but unless you owned the option for over 12 months, *e.g.*, leaps, then it is short term.

**Q: Why does long term v short term matter?**

**A:** Simply put, long term gain receives more favorable tax treatment as policy rewards longer term investments. While LTCG is tax at 0-20% effective rate based on your individual income, STCG is treated as ordinary income and is taxed at whatever your effective rate is. Therefore, it is at a great advantage of someone with either large amount of gain (no one here) or high income (also no one here) to hold investments longer to receive LTCG tax treatment.

**Q: How do dividends factor into this?**

**A:** Depends, if your also invested into stonk occasionally certain stonk will pay out dividend payments. These dividends are either “qualified” or “ordinary” dividends. Without going in-depth into the corporate tax law, “qualified” dividends are treated at LTCG rate whereas ordinary dividends are treated as STCG = ordinary income.

***Section Two: For those without tendies***

**Q: I fucked up; can these losses be used for anything?**

**A:** Thankfully the tax code knew people like us would inevitably try our hand at white collar gambling, and, unlike our degenerate sports betting cousins, the tax code has tax benefits for losses the first question is: do I have a net loss and, if yes, is my loss short term or long term? If you do have copious losses, good news they are deductible but there are limits.

**Q: Ok, obviously I have losses… how do I deduct them?**

**A:** Losses on your investments are first used to offset capital gains of the same type. So, short-term losses are first deducted against short-term gains, and long-term losses are deducted against long-term gains. Net losses of either type can then be deducted against the other kind of gain. And finally, if you have more losses than total gain, you can utilize the losses deduct up to $3,000 of ordinary income per year.

**Q: Bro, I yolo’ed and have way more than $3,000 of losses, what now?**

**A:** Luckily, or unluckily, you are allowed to carry forward the losses indefinitely utilizing $3,000 each future tax year until you’ve expended the loss.

**Q: What if I still have questions or need help with some other legal matter?**

**A:** You should consult with a professional \*cough cough\*

*TL;DR* **File your taxes and consult with tax professionals**. I represent taxpayers across the country before the IRS and several northeastern state tax authorities and would like to see as many of you avoid dealing with them.

The above is over a year old. So what is Fitbit, and why am I posting this now, then?


Fitbit is an American electronics and fitness company which focuses on health-related metrics, tracking, and data analysis. For you, what you need to know is that it sells smartwatches. 

Anyone who cares about watches or fashion at all, you might have heard of Fitbit. As someone who used to be big on high fashion about 2-3 years ago, Moncler was a suave yet not over-the-top brand that a lot of rich Asians and Khabib Nurmagomedov wore. https://i.imgur.com/tiONi3I.jpg. Personally for me, Fitbit has a lot of resemblance - popular enough for the cool kids wear and know, and still good for the boomers due to the functionality. 


Fitbit is ranked 5th worldwide in shipments for watches, behind notably Apple, Samsung, and Xiaomi. https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS46122120


Back in 2019, some of you boomers here might recall an announcement by Google, with plans to acquire Fitbit at a 2.1 Billion dollar USD transaction, which was halted by various legislative and activist communities due to the ongoing battle vs. FAANG+M (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, GOOG(Alphabet) + Microsoft). See: Facebook vs. US of A currently. Let me give you the spoilers on this stuff for the upcoming Biden Administration and the near future: it doesn't matter. 

https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22158271/googles-fitbit-deal-eu-regulator-approval


Big techs rule the world, that's why they are boomer stocks at this point, that's why they are blue chips. Stonks only go up? None of this exists to today without the big tech companies starting the trend and movement into this digital era, into this technological boom. Your teachers use Google to find their sources despite telling to you keep your nose in the books. Your very own senators representatives and law-makers, voting about the 25th Amendment, revisit the constitution thru Google, while actively voting against big-techs taking over the world, using... Google. 


The very same Google is bent on acquiring Fitbit, and has received a conditional-yet-final approval from the EU commission, and will be soon to follow in the USA, I presume not long after the transition of power on the 20th. Google will acquire Fitbit due to their previous failure to breach into the smartwatches market, which exploded some ~4-5 years ago. Apple currently dominates the market, and Google wants a piece. Do you think Google will sit by idly and watch one of their prime competitors claim the throne without contest?


Google recently filed a patent for a smartwatch-design which includes a heartrate tracker. It's very unlikely that after their past attempts at breaking into the watches market, that they will go ahead and just, ""TrY aGaIn"" without the proper measures taken. Fitbit is that proper measure, it's the acquisition which will get them the entry footing they need, to grow. https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-fitness-band-design-revealed-uspto/


But the biggest reason why I'm in Fitbit right now, is because it's a tech-involved product maker coming out of the COVID pandemic, consistently beating earnings expectations for the last 2 quarters of the pandemic, about to report yet another earnings in... ~3 weeks, speculated 1st/2nd week of February. Premiums are beyond dirt cheap also, the stock's been sideways for a year since Google's acquisition announcement over a year ago. Get in before the holiday earnings in early February.


**TL;DR**
- $FIT is a watch company being acquired by Google, after long halts from various legislators and committees.

- Earnings are coming up, have consistently been beat during the pandemic, smart watch market grew ~80% YOY in 2019 and Fitbit's revenues grew during pandemic.

- Premiums are dirt cheap, stock has long to run. If $PTON can grow into 2021, $FIT will certainly rise from the ashes.

**EDIT**

POSITIONS:

Down on all, been in for over a month on all of them, some longer. Will be burnt for January calls. Time your calls to the ides of February or after - earnings are definitely not priced in.

#[Today's Top Headlines for Wenesday, January 13th, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-13-2021.html)

# 5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday

*****

> # 1. Stocks set for modest drop
> * U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday, a day after Wall Street resumed its 2021 upswing with modest gains. The fallout from last week’s Capitol riot and the push to impeach President Donald Trump have been keeping a lid on market moves this week. Rising rates in the bond market, with the 10-year Treasury yield over 1.1%, have also been a headwind for stocks. However, ahead of Wednesday’s trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 were less than 1% away from their records. The Nasdaq was just over 1% away from its record high.

> * Target said Wednesday comparable sales rose 17.2% in November and December. While online sales remained robust during the pandemic, shoppers also visited Target’s stores and spent more money per purchase than they did last holiday season. Target’s same-day curbside pickup grew by more than 500%, while sales fulfilled by its Shipt delivery service grew more than 300% during the holidays. Target shares were relatively flat in premarket trading.

*****

> # 2. House to impeach Trump
> * Trump is on the verge of being impeached for a second time. The House set the unprecedented vote for Wednesday, exactly one week after supporters of the outgoing president attacked the U.S. Capitol. While no House Republicans voted for Trump’s first impeachment, this time a small but significant number, including third-ranking GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, will join Democrats.

> * Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has reportedly told associates he thinks Trump committed impeachable acts, though it’s not known if the Kentucky Republican would vote to remove the president. A conviction in the Senate, even after Trump leaves office, would prevent him from becoming president again. It’s unclear if the Senate would try to hold Trump’s impeachment trial before President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration next Wednesday.

*****

> # 3. Pence rules out 25th Amendment
> * The House is moving ahead with its impeachment vote after Vice President Mike Pence ruled out invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump. The House on Tuesday night passed a resolution calling on Pence and the Cabinet to push Trump out of office over his role in fomenting the Capitol attack. In a letter to House Speak Nancy Pelosi, Pence wrote, “I do not believe that such a course of action is in the best interest of our Nation or consistent with our Constitution.”

> * Speaking publicly Tuesday for the first time since last week’s siege, Trump did not take any responsibility for the mob violence and warned a second impeachment could be dangerous for the country. Later in the day at the border wall in Texas, Trump made a vague threat against Biden while insisting Pence and his Cabinet won’t remove him from office.

*****

> # 4. YouTube suspends Trump account
> * YouTube on Tuesday suspended Trump’s account, saying the president uploaded content that violated its policies, though it did not specify any videos. The so-called strike-one on the platform prevents new uploads for a minimum seven days. “Given the ongoing concerns about violence, we will also be indefinitely disabling comments on President Trump’s channel,” said YouTube, owned by Alphabet’s Google unit. YouTube’s decision to freeze Trump’s account follows the indefinite suspension of the president’s Facebook and the permanent suspension of his Twitter.

*****

> # 5. Operation Warp Speed chief resigns
> * Operation Warp Speed Chief Adviser Dr. Moncef Slaoui has submitted his resignation at the request of the incoming Biden Covid team, under a plan that would see him stay in the role for a month to help with the transition, according to two people familiar with the situation. Though the initial vaccine rollout has been criticized, the speed of their development, which Slaoui oversaw, exceeded expectations, with two vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna approved for emergency use in the U.S. by the FDA.

> * The U.S. will soon require all airline passengers to prove they recently tested negative for Covid-19 before flying to the country, the CDC said Tuesday. The measure, which aims to curb the spread of the disease, comes as new infections hit records. The U.S. reported a record 4,327 daily Covid deaths Tuesday. Starting Jan. 26, arriving American citizens and foreign travelers will have to test negative for Covid-19 within three days of their flight to the U.S.

I am here not to talk about the Tesla bubble. But the Netflix bubble that no one is talking about and when popped, autists will be getting fucked to the equivalent of Asa Akira on an episode of Brazzers.  Netflix is a great company, good product but very soon will be outpaced and future earnings reports will begin to show investors how **growth is dying due to competition, life going back to normal from covid, the lack of ability to funnel customers to it's streaming services, and loss of quality content** that is equal to a shitty re-run of the Maury show where a guy finds that is his girlfriend is both his aunt and sister. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hgio2xbcy0b61.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cd79dce1be8173671dcaac08329288d00f0d449

Netflix who has been the background noise hook ups around the world is in a period where they can become the next blockbuster video in 7 years. Market share is being gobbled up by competitors such as Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO Max, Disney plus, Youtube, Apple TV, and direct tv on the go. 

**Growth dying to competition:** The biggest competitive threat to Netflix is probably Amazon. As of the fourth quarter of 2019, Amazon Prime Video had about 150 million subscribers—a number that's been growing at a fast pace over the past two years as the company has increased production of its original content. 

Netflix and Disney had an exclusive relationship, at least until the studio decided to jump into the streaming war. When Disney announced it was going to launch its own service, it ended the deal it had with Netflix. Netflix offered a number of titles from the studio but agreed to cut them all from its lineup in 2019. **Disney owns every Disney movie including every Marvel and Star wars movie that's pretty much every quality movie for fucks sake.** 

Netflix basic package for one person to stream only is $8.99. As of May 2020, package subscriptions to Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ cost $12.99 per month. Subscriptions to just Disney+ cost $6.99 per month or $69.99 per year. Which is way cheaper then a Brazzers subscription. 

The big news for Hulu came in May 2019 with the announcement of a deal between Comcast and Disney which had Disney purchasing Comcast's stake in Hulu for a reported $5.8 billion. This puts Disney in full control of Hulu and consolidates the competition as Disney makes a big push into the streaming services field. 

Netflix investors should be equally worried about AT&T’s new streaming service that launches in 2020. It’ll cost slightly more than Netflix at $16–17 month.

AT&T is best known as a cell phone company. But its purchase of WarnerMedia in 2018 turned it into a media powerhouse. It owns HBO, the most successful premium TV network ever. HBO continues to pump out all-time hits like *The Sopranos, Game of Thrones,* and *Sex in the City.*

**The lack of ability to funnel customers to it's streaming services:** Do you know why the Amazon Echo dot was dirt cheap? Because Amazon wants every household in the United States and the world to have a fucking Alexa in their living room. From that every time you go to order something whether it be a fridge, butt plug, or sweater for your wife's boyfriend you're going to buy it from amazon now. this leads to Amazon prime Throw in the fact that google nest and apple homepod are a thing that are working towards this as well will lead to Netflix becoming a non S&P 500 stock and leave call holders in shambles.

Netflix relies off other companies platforms whether it be Google's search engine to find their website, Ipads with their app, amazon fire stick....its only a matter of time before Netflix is overridden by competitors and left in the dust I believe. 

**Loss of Quality Content:** Netflix's two most watched shows are Friends the The Office which are both now off the streaming service. Family guy isn't on there. Other then Queens Gambit, and a couple other shows its pretty much shit selection and Broke Back mountain that I know you guys like to watch with your boyfriends. Netflix is going to shit and there are rarely blockbuster movies from theaters on there. You cannot tell me the content is getting better....it isn't and the competitors are growing and their content is more entertaining. I know boomer Amazon prime members who canceled Netflix for Amazon prime video. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Look how the stock is flat and has lost momentum while other FANG Stocks are fucking balls to the walls in Retard Strength Momentum](https://preview.redd.it/3de98ecab1b61.png?width=635&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca0cfad8d0924543f2eb6d81bc1164618dcaa57c)

Netflix was revolutionary when it came out. It was the first in streaming and it is getting left in the dust as competitors fight to get their market share in streaming. Even the CEO has admitted the company is trouble. 

Going forward it will succeed or fail on the popularity of the TV shows it produces.  

Over the past year Netflix's debt has shot up 58% to $10.3 billion. For perspective, Netflix earned $1.2 billion in profits last year. 

Netflix’s market cap is about $165 billion—making it the 30th-biggest publicly traded US company. The PE ratio is around 80, meaning every $80 spent is for one dollar of profit.....but **everyday Amazon prime video members, Disney Plus members are cancelling their subscriptions as Netflix tries to raise their prices on their customers and the company is losing quality content every month. Company is overvalued and will struggle to grow.**

Netflix will survive. But it will shrink. Even in the most generous scenario, within three years I can’t see it being worth more than $100 billion. That would put its stock price at about $225/share—or about 40% below its current price. 

Next earnings I am buying a FD Put. 

The Netflix bubble is gonna pop. 

Cannot go tits up.

Here I'm gonna discuss what's going on in the Oil Sector, and what that means for an investor/autist.

&#x200B;

Lets get some perspective.

&#x200B;

[Historical US Airline fuel consumption](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/fuel.asp).

Lets look at the totals for the last five years.

|Year|Consumption (US gallon)|Consumption Change YoY (%)|Cost|Cost Change YoY (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2016|17,044,700,000|1.88%|$24,654,000,000|\-19.95%|
|2017|17,295,300,000|1.47%|$29,251,600,000|18.65%|
|2018|17,868,300,000|3.31%|$38,462,800,000|31.49%|
|2019|18,269,000,000|2.24%|$36,457,100,000|\-5.21%|
|2020|9,359,600,000|\-44.01%|$13,353,300,000|\-59.96%|

&#x200B;

Consumption is down a significant amount, and based on [projections](https://www.statista.com/statistics/655057/fuel-consumption-of-airlines-worldwide/), it's not expected to make a full recovery in 2021. Airlines represent [7.8% of worldwide oil consumption](https://www.planete-energies.com/en/medias/close/fuels-aviation-and-shipping). The world Oil Sector is valued at about [$3.3 trillion](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/030915/what-percentage-global-economy-comprised-oil-gas-drilling-sector.asp).

&#x200B;

Even if airlines were to make a full operational recovery and begin flying at similar rates to peak years, airlines won't be able to generate the same revenue. Why? [Look at where their money comes from](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041315/how-much-revenue-airline-industry-comes-business-travelers-compared-leisure-travelers.asp). Major market-moving companies [have already announced that they plan to significantly reduce coming to work and travelling for business](https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-asking-employees-to-work-from-home-due-to-coronavirus-2020#in-july-google-extended-its-employee-work-from-home-policy-through-june-2021-on-sunday-night-the-company-extended-that-policy-by-three-months-starting-in-september-2021-google-employees-will-go-back-to-the-office-part-time-working-a-minimum-of-three-days-in-the-office-and-the-rest-at-home-1). To add onto that, the general US population isn't expected to start receiving a vaccine [until late summer](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/08/us/coronavirus-vaccine-general-public-states/index.html). The means regular tourism and travel won't be kicking off anytime soon in 2021.

&#x200B;

If you are really interested in taking a deep dive into prices for gas, take a look at consumer [fuel prices, futures, and supply](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/weekly/gasoline.php). To help you better understand and analyze this information, check out this [information on how gas is priced](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/gasoline/factors-affecting-gasoline-prices.php).

&#x200B;

""[The nature of the pandemic and social distancing makes weekly gasoline consumption a valuable proxy measure of economic and social activity](https://aei.ag/2020/09/21/the-most-interesting-chart-in-2020-u-s-gasoline-consumption/)."" In other words, gas consumption will rise once people can regularly get out of the house. As I mentioned before, the general US population isn't expected to start receiving a vaccine [until late summer](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/08/us/coronavirus-vaccine-general-public-states/index.html).

&#x200B;

Most important to note is that the [oil companies are actually working to maintain a good supply/demand ratio](https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-producers-commit-to-supply-curbs-sustaining-price-rally-11610452802) in order to promote stability and growth in the sector.

&#x200B;

**Now lets not panic.** Why? Because oil is arguably the foundation of the global economy. People *go to fucking war* because they don't have enough of it.

&#x200B;

Looking at the  [SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XOP?p=XOP&.tsrc=fin-srch). This ETF represents the trends of the major domestic companies that operate in the Exploration and Production sub-sector of the domestic energy market. Take a look at its [Holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/XOP/#holdings).

Here how things are looking with the prices:

&#x200B;

||Date|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020 Open|03 Jan 2020|$96.12|
|Pre-Crash|19 Feb 2020|$76.52|
|Current|12 Jan 2020|$70.62|

&#x200B;

XOP is currently sitting at 75.9% of its 52-Week high, and many other stocks in this sector are in similar standing. Why? Because oil has a lot of room for recovery as we move forward into a new administration and start coming out of quarantine. If an autist puts his money in now, he might achieve some solid gains over the next 12-18 months.

Are oil stocks going to the moon? Probably not, but you can always buy FDs and dream of hitting those sweet 2014 highs.

&#x200B;

Well if ETSY is mooning, you know what else is going to follow, the site where people *advertise* their ETSY stores, Pinterest. Not convinced?

Pinterest is:

-	A safe social media company without the baggage and politics of Facebook/Twitter/Instagram/Google, people see it as a cute website for crafts, cooking, and home decor. Meaning it won’t be targeted by Dems for a breakup or attacked by conservatives for free speech. Might even benefit from a breakup of Facebook/Instagram. Funds might want to use them for social media exposure instead of the big boys.
-	Technically set up for a run. It just bounced off the 20 SMA and as of today is having a bullish MACD crossover. It’s breaking through it’s resistance at the ATH on big volume (institutional buying).
-	Will certainly have a preanticipatory run up from now to earnings in early February. It unexpectedly blew earnings out of the water last time with everyone staying home looking for things to do, bringing in that sweet sweet ad revenue. After earnings it gapped up big league and went on a run for 2 months. Only in the past few weeks has it been cooling off as the hype died down. Once they announce their earnings date, people/institutions will remember the massive gap up and try front running it.
-	Q4/December ad rates are even higher than Q3 and more people were looking for Christmas gifts and Christmas decorating ideas, and baking holiday cookies. So expect an even bigger earnings beat, but this time it’ll likely be factored in ahead of time.
-	Smart/big money has already started accumulating the past couple of days during the dip.
-	To top it off, our girl Cathie loves them and ARK thinks they’re the future of the internet (included in ARKW). Also means they get pumped whenever ARK gets inflows (so when Tesla is on a run Pinterest benefits).

If looking at the chart and common sense still doesn’t convince you, all you have to do is hit up any single woman you know between the ages of 20 and 40 (if they’ll even talk to you) and ask them how they’re spending they’re time during CoViD, especially if they’re not dating right now. Chances are they’re browsing Pinterest for home redecorating ideas, baking recipes, home exercise routines, and crocheting ideas.

Going to hit/surpass ATH by EoW easy. Price target of $90 by earnings, based on Fib extensions if you believe in TA. Get in now ahead of the trend before the crowd catches on and dumb money starts pouring in, possibly even during Power Hour EoD.

kuq6q7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuq6q7/american_cannabis_the_perfect_storm/,American Cannabis: The Perfect Storm,343,242,2021-01-11 07:44:11,"In 2018, Canopy Growth made more millionaires than any other stock. Legislative change, uplisting to major exchanges (NYSE), and huge institutional investment created the perfect storm and it was a bunch of unsophisticated investors (read: **degenerates**) that got rich off of it.

Today, a similar story is evolving in US Cannabis in real-time, with a total addressable market that absolutely DOMINATES Canada's, and the emergence of unique tailwinds (e.g. COVID, social justice) to drive acceleration of and acceptance of Cannabis far beyond what Canada achieved.

**The core of the investment thesis is dead simple.** Cannabis is federally illegal. This has **prevented large institutions** from investing in American Cannabis companies and provided a once in a generation opportunity for retail to make real money. The democratic sweep of the house, senate, presidency will lead to cannabis reform. Even if the absence of federal legalization, the conditions that led to meteoric rise of Canadian cannabis are being replicated south of the border. Read the Q&A for more.

**Why will cannabis legislation change?**

There is unprecedented momentum for cannabis reform at all levels of government.

* [Senate Majority Leader said Marijuana legalization will be prioritized in a Democratic Senate](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/chuck-schumer-says-marijuana-legalization-will-be-prioritized-if-democrats-retake-senate/)
* [Vice President Kamala Harris co-sponsors the MORE act to Federally and Tax Marijuana](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/kamala-harris-marijuana-bill-legalize-tax-weed-pot-862192/)
* [In historic vote, House passes Marijuana banking bill with bipartisan support](https://mjbizdaily.com/historic-day-us-house-passes-cannabis-banking-bill-with-strong-bipartisan-support/)
* [Language for the critical SAFE banking has previously been included in stimulus bills and will likely make it to execution with senate majority ](https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2020/05/14/568608.htm)(this bill gives US cannabis operators access to banks to GREATLY lower their cost of capital, and is critical to having them uplist onto major exchanges -> institutional investment)
* [Removal of anti-cannabis Attorney General, and additional of Cannabis neutral AG Garland](https://www.cannabisbusinesstimes.com/article/attorney-general-william-barr-resigns/), and [addition of Pro-Cannabis Secretary of Health and Human Services](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/bidens-health-secretary-pick-could-help-reclassify-marijuana/)
* The demographics are undeniable. Young people and people of colour support cannabis reform, and they turned out for the democrats in the general election and Georgia runoff.

**Why will this happen now?**

* [States are losing out on DESPERATELY needed tax revenue](https://normlfl.org/much-tax-revenue-legal-cannabis-generate/)(e.g. [Colorado](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/12/colorado-passes-1-billion-in-marijuana-state-revenue.html). [Illinois](https://chicago.suntimes.com/cannabis/2020/12/15/22174987/marijuana-cannabis-taxes-illinois-dispensaries-alcohol-booze-budget))
* [Cannabis legalization and expungement is a pillar of racial justice](https://www.aclu.org/blog/criminal-law-reform/drug-law-reform/marijuana-legalization-racial-justice-issue), and has never been hotter with nation wide protests this year
* [Public support for Legal Cannabis is higher than it's ever been](https://news.gallup.com/poll/323582/support-legal-marijuana-inches-new-high.aspx) (\~90% for medical, \~70% for adult recreational use)
* [The majority of states already have some form of legal cannabis](https://www.businessinsider.com/legal-marijuana-states-2018-1), medical in 34 states, adult recreational in 11, but large institutions still can't invest, and AMERICAN cannabis companies can list on large exchanges
* [There was a pro-cannabis sweep during the election, with 5 out of 5 states approving Cannabis measures](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2020-elections-marijuana-on-the-ballot-in-these-5-states-173753954.html)
* [New York has already announced a proposal to legalize](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-proposal-legalize-and-create-equitable-adult-use-cannabis-program-part)(New York is the jewel of the East, and many think with legalization in New York and New Jersey, the rest of the nation will follow)
* [Use of cannabis has absolutely surged during the pandemic, accelerating adoption](https://www.forbes.com/sites/irisdorbian/2020/09/18/cannabis-consumption-surges-during-pandemic-as-sleep-issues-and-anxieties-mount-says-new-poll/?sh=3957110843d5) \-- in anxious and uncertain times, alcohol and cannabis flourish; sin stocks do well in recessions
* Cannabis is taking market share from alcohol: [US alcohol consumption decreases as cannabis use increases](https://www.healtheuropa.eu/alcohol-consumption-falling-cannabis-use-increases/94421/)

**Who should I think about?**

* Hint: **it's not Aurora, Tilray or Canopy** (they don't sell ANY cannabis in the US) -- they will have a hard time making effective entry if and when they EVENTUALLY get access as many states have limited license programs that will require very expensive M&A
* Unlikely Canada in its growth phase, the US actually has stellar companies who already have established businesses, with excellent revenue growth
* [Curaleaf is the biggest](https://mjbizdaily.com/curaleaf-rises-to-the-top-of-us-marijuana-industry-with-footprint-covering-about-two-dozen-states/) (CEO is a billionaire, biggest footprint, largest revenues) -- OTC ($CURLF), CSE ($CURA)
* [Trulieve has the best overall financials](https://thedeepdive.ca/trulieve-five-analysts-raise-price-targets-following-stellar-earnings/) (most profitable, juggernaut in Florida, amazing reputation among investors) -- OTC ($TCNNF), CSE ($TRUL)
* [Green Thumb Industries](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/gti-rises-in-the-cannabis-industry-with-focus-on-brand-building-and-prudent-capital-allocation/) is a branding and execution monster (great positioning in newly legalized states, loved among analysts, great track record of execution) -- OTC ($GTBIF), CSE ($GTII)

**But these companies aren't on the NYSE and NASDAQ**

* Yes, and that's exactly the point. Retail has a chance to get in before large institutions get the opportunity in a few weeks, months. Once the uplist happens, your already playing catch up. Sound too good to be true? Google it, take 5 minutes and do the DD. Here's where you can start: [CB1 Capital](https://www.cb1cap.com/blog/2020/8/17/barbarians-at-the-gate)

**This guy sounds like linked shit so he probably knows what he's talking about -- just give me a ticker.**

* Consider $MSOS on the NYSE. It's an ETF with holdings in all the top AMERICAN cannabis companies and have optionality. They've grown to about \~300-400 million in assets under management. They will be a billion within a few months. Ban me if they aren't.

So about a month or so ago I bought 25 132$ call expiring 1/8/21 on $TIF. They were super cheap at the time (125$ total) and I honestly didn't really understand what I was doing. They were planning on releasing their earnings report late December/ early January. I thought that with the holidays and the general uncertainty of the world. People might be buying jewelry, but the real reason I bought it was because it was cheap and i'm dumb.

Well, now January 8th is tomorrow and the current stock is not showing up on Finviz, yahoo finance or Robinhood. I can see on Google Finance that the AH for TIF is 132.40 which would net me a decent profit, but I can't find the stock through my broker (Robinhood, yea RH. boo... w/e).

I've been looking through the news and discovered that TIF was bought out by LVMH recently for 16 billion, but I'm not sure where that leaves me. Will my options even show up tomorrow? or will it expire worthless. Is the recent buyout the reason why I can't see the shares anymore? Also why was $TIF not really moving at all for the past 3 months.

It appears factually wrong unless there was a another 1b$ dilution, which according to SEC filings I think there actually was!  If they issued $1b of stock, then the dilution is insane.

Here are the numbers for stock issuance per the quarterly filings.  I saw more recent filings on the SEC website:

A question I can't figure out is whether a Canadian company can operate in the US.  TLRY luckily is incorporated in Delaware so maybe that takes care of the problem.

The debate about large Canadian companies vs multi-state operators is also interesting.

And it looks like APHA doesn't even mention recreational drugs in its presentations, so I dunno if they're trying to be a grocery store supplier or something.

What's crazy to me is that compared to APHA, all the other executive teams look weak as fuck."

First off, I did correlation analysis between Biden vote share and early turnout in the runoff as a percentage of November 2020 early vote. The correlation is strong, approximately .45. In other words, the early voting has been remarkably favorable towards the Democrats. I got my data from [georgiavotes.com](https://georgiavotes.com). Here is the link to the google sheet I put the data in. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pBDLDZZRPSzhqE1nU6t98mY1wfkOtuOftlQUiY8msOw/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pBDLDZZRPSzhqE1nU6t98mY1wfkOtuOftlQUiY8msOw/edit#gid=0)

Secondly, this is small but anecdotal evidences shows rural polling places have not been busy today. The only way Republicans win the Georgia runoff is with huge election day turnout. That is very unlikely in a runoff election without Trump on the ballot.

Lastly, there is polling that shows a wide swath of Republican voters feel like they should boycott the runoff. [https://twitter.com/cstewartiii/status/1346296064572321792](https://twitter.com/cstewartiii/status/1346296064572321792)

kqv48d,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqv48d/why_wish_has_the_potential_to_go_to_the_moon_and/,Why $WISH has the potential to go to the moon and beyond,76,83,2021-01-05 17:37:23,"This post is in no way financial advice. I’m no expert, I’m just here to explain why I have yolo’d my account into Wish.com shares and calls. I encourage everyone to do their own due diligence. 

Part 1: The Basics

Wish.com went public on December 16th and nosedived from $23 to $17.45 over the course of about 2 weeks. Wish has rallied over the past two trading days despite the market being red overall. I think the stock is way oversold and potentially hit its bottom last Thursday. Let me spit some quick facts about the company:

- Amazon and Alibaba both offered $10 billion to acquire Wish in 2015. This is obviously prior to the boom e-commerce has received from Covid. Wish’s annual revenue was $300 million at this point. 
- Revenue in 2019 was $2.3 billion, about $800 million more than Shopify in 2019 for reference. 
- Founded by former Google and Yahoo programmers and recently appointed a former Square exec to their board of directors
- Wish had over 90 million monthly users in 2019, and I believe that number has gone up considerably by now. 
- Most downloaded shopping app of all time with over 500 million downloads.
- Serves over 100 countries with 3 million transactions a day.
- No debt and over 1-2 billion in cash
- In spite of further lockdown news today, Wish went up. I believe this stock is now being recognized as a stay-at-home stock, yet should perform well post-covid due to the longevity of the e-commerce industry as a whole. 
- Although Wish is an American company, many of its merchants are Chinese. I believe Wish might gain in the short term in response to uncertainty over Alibaba’s monopoly investigation. 
- If none of the above has gotten your cock hard yet, Palantir Co-Founder, John Lonsdale, owns 59 million shares of Wish.   

Part 2: Data

Data is the new oil bitches. Wish has an absolute fuckton of users, and what sticks out to me is that the majority of purchases made on wish are items that weren’t searched for by the buyer.  These are items recommended by Wish’s algorithm. Only about 15%-20% of purchases made on wish are made through the buyer performing a search. Wish is very effectively using the data they collect to recommend the right products to the right people. If you don’t see the value in that, then fuck you.

And may I remind you that John Lonsdale, Data God and Palantir Co-Founder, owns 59 million shares of Wish. 

Part 3: The Cons

The biggest criticisms I’ve seen of Wish is that the product quality can be poor and the shipping time can be poor. These are valid points, however I believe the leadership of this company will make strides in improving upon those two problems, especially when you consider that they just raised a billion dollars in their IPO. Additionally, I’ve seen positive reviews regarding their refund policy. This obviously does not excuse poor product quality and shopping time, but the numbers don’t lie. People are buying shit on Wish. There is a market for cheap, low quality shit and Wish is capitalizing on it hard. If you think Wish is a garbage company, just remember that amazon and alibaba both saw massive value prior to all the growth Wish has had in the last 5 years. 

Once the quiet period is over and Wish releases its first earnings report since they’ve gone public, I’m anticipating a huge run. 

Positions: Loaded to the fucking gills with shares and some July 16 $25 calls. I’m mainly looking at this as a very long term play."

What do you think they will do if the stock triples in less than a month. They can't go and say that we are updating their 1-2-month-old recommendations to reflect that. They are OK doing it for 30-40% but not for 300%. They have no option but to issue a sell rating and bearish sentiment about it. At a given time there are always bearish and bull sentiments and with enough confirmation bias, you can write whatever. We have seen this in the case of Tesla for e.g. JP Moron has a price target of 80-90$ for tesla and on another hand, they have a buy rating for Nikola. While JPM was telling street to sell Tesla, they loaded themselves in Q3-Q4 in tesla. They offer unique leveraged products to customers based on ARK etfs, which has maxed its Tesla capacity. Long story short, these people are in business to prove them right instead of giving opinions to the general public. There is hardly anyone in the analyst community who understands AI, ML, Big data beyond tech buzz words (Ark is an exception). I spent 15 yrs in the industry and spent the whole of my career building ANN/PCA/SOM models for large 4D simulation problem for projects required multi-billion$ investments and then executing these projects. Today I work in Strategy consulting and with few things i learned over the years, my POV is Palantir is misrepresented by mainstream finance and instead we should focus on more what Karp is saying, how the quarterly number looks, which industry they are entering and who is the real competition

One portion of Palantir is little understood is its 2016 acquisition of Silk Kimono, it has to yield results in the coming days

We listen that Palantir has lost money for a long time. it is important to understand that investing back is not money lost and if we see investments and growth in revenue - it's somewhat a proxy for it

Amazon has done it for 2 decades

Once you stop doing that you become a tech value company under the clock of innovation growth company (which you are no longer)

I can't say in the short term what is the right price, In the long term, i see Palantir at a 10x-20x valuation of its value from direct listing

With my own limited understanding of business and things that I learned (certified nerd, with serious degrees from very serious colleges), I ran an exercise that how to identify companies that have 1 Trillion$ potential by 2030 and under 50 billion$ now - Palantir and SpaceX were two filtered out

so I am long Palantir, SpaceX and off course long Tesla also.

The stock has got volatile as initially, it had a bad press, and then there was no IPO or SPAC euphoria. Once it gained, it became a meme stock. The stock is new in public markets and unique growth stock

So people are still trying to figure it out. What it does, it does best. Customer acquisition is not easy but as they prove their worth, it should get better.

See the case of BP, they pay Palantir 120 million $ a year No oil company pays this much to any of the company for digital and software service’s And Bp has stated value of Palantir very openly.

They only have one client in all the industries they work In private space. There is a huge opportunity. They have started with a top-down solution model, But they will@make more and more solutions

Possibly new business models, As well.

This company has just started building a sales and marketing team and One thing a good sales team does is to sell proven solutions, again and again, We need 1-2 yrs to see that impact

I assume customer acquisition for Palantir is a 1-1.5 yr process. Thiel has said several times that his focus is to help navigate companies through key inflection points

No other company symbolizes him more than Palantir today. So I don’t see him bailing out. Alex Karp is super passionate. These guys worry more about the impact they will create and the legacy they will leave than valuation. In their head they see Palantir to be in the same place one day, as we have Google and Facebook."
kpwg05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kpwg05/this_will_be_the_year_millionaires_are_made_from/,This will be the year millionaires are made from Tesla Puts,406,526,2021-01-04 08:04:19,"Tesla stock went up almost 700% this year because Wedbush (who’s made an absolute fortune getting people to buy into his narrative) got retail investors to buy into the narrative that Tesla is not an automotive company, despite over 90% of its revenue coming from selling cars. Once the narrative stuck that it’s a “tech” company, BAM, valuation goes up $550B. And please don’t be an autist and say something retarded like “if Tesla is a car company then Apple is a phone company”. Yes, over 50% of apples revenue is from phones, but they also have huge revenue segments in Mac, IPad, Audio, Services, etc. So, if Apples revenue was 90% phones then yes that statement would be true, buts it’s not so please don’t try and justify it with that stupid brainwashing comment (which I know someone will post in the comments and get 1k upvotes). 

Now, Tesla is a phenomenal company with a visionary leader, don’t get me wrong - but they are being priced like the next Amazon. One slip up and they will tumble - or if they can’t find that one thing that will essentially print money for them (Apple iPhone, Google ads, Microsoft Azure, Amazon web services), then valuation will get cut in half. The first 6x months will be about value stocks, and I predict Tesla hits $500 before it hits $900. I think this year makes millionaires first from Tesla puts, then calls in the second half of the year. 

The only thing I can think of that makes this not happen is the amount of cash they have on hand from selling more shares. That amount of money is dangerous in the hands of Elon. But let’s see what happens - I think puts are the way to go early on, could net some new millionaires."

**A Value-Based A.I. Investment**  

&#x200B;

In the era of growing small businesses and increasing brand presence, the internet appears to be a vast and difficult space to make a lasting impression on from a small business perspective. Small businesses may have insufficient entries in Google, Yahoo, and other search engines, where clients are likely to discover them. This is significant for these businesses, because if their information is inaccurate or missing, it will turn away potential customers. Yext, a growing New York based company under the ticker YEXT, provides a solution for modifying these entries and increasing the internet presence of small businesses.  YEXT shows promise as a growing long term stock due to its unique product line and hopeful financials.

In a sense, Yext is like Google but for enterprises that require more depth than Google can provide for them, and they actually use Google to help companies advertise and gain traction with consumer base using their APIs that are integrated with consumer platforms. The advertising industry is huge, as we’ve seen Google, Facebook, and Snapchat dominate simply off reaching consumers, and collecting their data. Yext bridges the gap between businesses and unstructured data of potential consumers and existing consumers, setting them up in a multi-billion dollar industry expected to continually increase for the future. 

Their main product line includes Answers: a search engine, Listings: an advertising tool to get your company’s products onto multiple platforms, Pages: a tool that helps get your business at the top of every location search, Reviews: which helps you engage with customer feedback, and Knowledge Graph/Analytics which helps business owners see their customer interactions with their webpages and other online presence. Websites used to be everything for a business but now a business requires presence across multiple platforms and integration with every search engine, map, or social media. The more a business’ online presence is spread the more analytics you need too, and Yext is the amalgamation of the entire business’ internet presence. This cloud-based software is easy to use, and it’s used by several reputable companies; including huge fast food chains, travel companies, car manufacturers and even banks. 

Yext solves the problem of particular consumer questions and connects the respective business with precisely what the consumer was looking for. Specific questions such as “wealth advisor near me who specializes in healthcare” (an example they used in their past annual report) will become increasingly easier to answer with the newest developments in Artificial Intelligence. The control of the ever-changing facts of a business are what enable it to spread its sales. Up-to-date and relevant information on every nook and cranny of the web has become a necessity, as convenience has become the most necessary commodity. Poor site experience is a huge detractor for the large majority of shoppers, and if businesses are able to retain this potential loss in customers they’d be willing to pay anything. Managing an online presence using one dashboard is going to be a very desirable service for all businesses, regardless of size. Yext links all the chains together in the cloud, for Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri, and even the Chinese WeChat, all services which are improving more and more in terms of their search capabilities and they’re growing in popularity.

&#x200B;

The product or service a company provides is the most crucial aspect of a company’s success, and YEXT seems to deliver on its product. The solution requires a subscription that can be priced according to a business’ specific needs. YEXT does not seem to have as many recognizable competitors. Its main competitors, Birdeye and Chatmeter, are both private companies with no real news about an IPO anytime soon, while YEXT has been public on the NYSE for three years. From this perspective, YEXT maintains an advantage over its competitors due to it being more recognizable and financially stronger due to its valuation reaching over a billion after going public. However, a reported issue with the product is that listings may go back to normal after a contract with a small business terminates. This is justifiable, because a small business could use the service for a month and reap all benefits. To improve this aspect of the solution that is controversial, maybe a potential solution could be negotiating a minimum period the contract has to be active in order for listings not to revert when it is terminated. Despite this drawback, Yext Inc. has innovated in this niche field and is emerging as a frontrunner in back-end listing modification.

Now that we have established that YEXT will likely be a frontrunner in structuring advertising data, we need to establish WHY this is a growing industry, as YEXT is heavily dependent on the growth of eCommerce and other forms of online and in person business. Without businesses, Yext will have no source of revenue so the expansion of commerce is critical to Yext’s revenue. Fortunately, eCommerce and small businesses are trending upwards, indicating a healthy future for YEXT. One way to examine if this industry is growing is to analyze advertisement spending, as more online businesses directly correlates to more money spent on advertising. The graph below regarding digital advertising spending clearly illustrates that online business is growing, with advertisement spending nearly doubling over the six years.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/plzhvnh7w1961.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7bc511f13b8c4b13206acfc3015bfe9d5303176

Another way to gauge the health of the industry YEXT is heavily dependent on is to take a look at the growing amount of transactions online. Transactions correlate to greater revenue generated via the internet and thus a greater need for YEXT to introduce smaller businesses to this growing market. The chart below from Statista portrays the growth of Mobile POS payments and Digital commerce over seven years, almost tripling in total volume. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jydysim9w1961.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=dddd6ef6ea30f95dbe73d5f664a27193b31d6405

Once again this looks promising for YEXT, as their clients are primarily located in this sect of online business due to accurate data going hand in hand with more online sales. Furthermore, YEXT will be a solid pick for investors in the long term due to its growth along with a growing industry and its solid product. If you are interested in delving deeper into why eCommerce and online payments are growing, be sure to check out the Paypal/Square DD as well.

On their last 10k, Yext reported the following for their most recent compiled income statement:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f8renwobw1961.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=d66290b3c437c25c5798b9130d55f3fdbbd25470

As you can see for the top line, there are plenty of positive signs. Revenue has grown by over $50M yearly from 2016 to 2019, and from 2019 to 2020 revenues grew by about $70M. So the indicator when it comes to sales is overwhelmingly signaling that this company is well-positioned to grow, especially in the near future. Gross profit margins are also great as the cost of the product itself isn’t much. The potential issues in the income statement show up as you go toward the bottom line. Operating expenses far outweigh gross profits so net profits are -30% despite gross profit margins being 75%. Breaking down Opex, you can see that about ⅔ of them go towards sales and marketing, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing as distributing your product can be a huge future investment, but it can be concerning for investors who want a product that “sells itself”. Despite this rather arbitrary requirement, the sales growth justifies the spending as it’s obviously working and eventually revenue should far outpace selling expenses. 

In their 10k, they state that their sales expenses primarily had to do with more wages and a higher headcount of employees. As the company’s operations grow, they’ll need more employees to run it in an aggressive growth stage. Despite the constant revenue growth, the stock price has been diluted due to more underwriting in 2019. It may take a while to recover from all the extra supply that was brought into the market, but even if we see more financing in early stages, I personally wouldn’t be concerned as that’s a normal course of action for younger companies.

A quick look at the financials indicates that YEXT is improving as a company over each year. Due to their relatively high amounts of investment, the EPS for the company has remained negative. The EPS was also a lot worse in previous years. However, don’t let this negative metric fool you, as the EPS has been trending positive since the first quarter of 2020. This indicates significant improvement, especially since the EPS hasn’t been improving much prior to 2020. The increase of the EPS is also supported by the increase of change in working capital from $2M to $4M. As for the rest of the cash flow statement, the negative values are primarily caused by the expansion of operations. This expansion of operations is indicated by the increasing total assets, which means that YEXT grew their assets via larger operations. Although the numbers may be negative temporarily, the expansion of operations allows YEXT to generate more revenue from operations and hopefully turn the direction of cash flows around. Constant reinvestment back into the company is a good sign as it indicates owner and shareholder confidence in the future prospect.

Finally, delving into the 10Q provides reassuring prospects for the future health and growth of YEXT as a company. Looking at the breakdown of individual risks, YEXT looks to be relatively secure in the future. The main risks of the company are internal, and are not influenced by factors such as inflation and foreign currency fluctuations. To some, YEXT may appear risky due to its limited financial history and potential unprofitability due to it being relatively new. However, these risks will ultimately be insignificant, as the expansion of operations will soon be recovered by profits if YEXT maintains its current scale of growth that it has achieved in 2020.

In conclusion, YEXT will be a good pickup for many investors because the enterprise solutions industry overall has done very well, and Yext’s solutions are definitely a foray into the future of artificial intelligence combined with traditional SaaS. If you compare Yext to another company that has a similar premise, Twilio, you can see that Yext’s price/sales ratio is only 1/7th of Twilio’s. Of course, Twilio is far more overvalued and has had better sales growth than Yext this past year, but Yext isn’t a slouch in sales growth either as we’ve seen. Plus, they have far more potential than Twilio does as we’ve seen with their relatively small market cap of $2B. Both companies offer AI-based enterprise solutions, but Yext is just as good if not a better solution for the future as it has more applicability through a variety of businesses. If you want to see similar growth to what we’ve seen in company’s such as Twilio but feel as if you’ve missed the bus, don’t worry: we’ve got the pick for you.

E2open has disruptive AI / Cloud technology for the supply-chain industry. They are widely used by big name customers including Google, Microsoft, Boeing, Walmart, Coca Cola, UPS, AMD, NVIDIA, Abbott, and dozens of others.

What differentiates them from other (more boring) supply chain management companies is the way they use AI to predict changes in supply and demand. Basically, E2open allows companies to see 10 steps ahead into the future to forecast how much inventory they will need based on hundreds of variables (geopolitics, resource availability, etc). This saves companies hundreds of millions in waste. CEO Michael Farlekas  compares it to working at a lemonade stand and being able to know ahead of time exactly how many lemons you will need. Obviously this will save you from wasting money on lemons that would spoil. E2open is the only company that integrates this type of AI technology with a vast data Cloud network.

E2open uses a subscription model to make consistent sustainable revenue from their 1000+ customers. There are multiple services they offfer, but over 50% of their customers only use 1 service. What's nice is that existing customers go on to utilize more and more of their services as they realize the value it adds to their companies. Google for example paid E2open twice as much over the course of 2 years. E2open makes additional revenue from new customers, and also by strategic value-adding acquisitions. The SPAC deal is allowing E2open to clean up their balance sheet so they can add value to their software portfolio (and charge higher premiums to existing customers) and continue making acquisitions.

E2open has been growing at a rapid clip since they were taken private in 2015. In 2015 they made $80M in revenue and in 2020 they made $335M. That's 420% growth in 5 years, or roughly +84% growth per year.

In the last 5 years they increased their revenue +420% by value-adding acquisitions they've made over the last decade --- Icon (2013), Serus Corp (2014), Terra Technology (2016), Orchestro (2016), Steelwedge (2017), Zyme (2017), Entomo and Birch Worldwide (2018), Inttra (2018), and Amber Road (2018) --- and integrating these different services to create a beautiful comprehensive end-to-end platform.

Somewhat surprisingly, their projections for 2021 are much lower at only +10% estimated revenue growth, which is the main reason most would argue P-C-P-L is trading so close to the NAV. However, 10% growth is actually really solid when you look at their margins and consider that 80% of their revenue is recurring with excellent customer retention. Institutional investors especially will appreciate E2open as the reliable revenue generating machine that it has  become. 

I'm also still optimistic about valuing E2open as a growth stock and feel the 10% is a low-ball estimate based on comparisons to the median growth of other supply chain management companies. I'm suspecting E2open will consistently  outperform expectations on a quarterly as the SPAC capital equips them to capitalize on their services, continue making acquisitions, and ultimately tap into millions in white space opportunity.

Even if E2open maintained a 10% growth rate  and if this were factored into its valuation, $11/share is still too damn low. E2open compares itself to Descartes, Kinaxis, Manhattan, and Spscommerce. With a median of 10.7x revenue, E2 was only at 7x, and with a median of 34.7x, E2 was only at 21.3x, meaning E2open has a much higher upside than its peers.

Institutions will bring the stock price up to par with it's peers and I believe the low ball projected growth is a conservative number that they will completely destroy when you consider their growth of +400% over the last 5 years. While 10% is perfectly fine for a company like E2open, I'm expecting the trend of the last 5 years to continue in 2021 and we'll be seeing some exciting numbers. 

My PT pre-merge is 15 and 25 EOY assuming their projected 10% revenue growth. If E2open surpasses 2021 expected revenue as I'm suspecting and they have major quarterly beats, I'm holding until 50.

Disclaimer: This is my largest position. I'm in 2500 shares at 10.87."

Many expressed doubts that Europeans would buy a Chinese car given all the negative stereotypes. From 2021, Germany introduced a CO2 tax (7c per liter) and till 2025 they give 9000 Euros for purchasing a EV. My main problem with German EVs is that they have an abysmal range. VW promises something up to 220km. I drove BMW i3 and whatever they promise there, the truth is that it's around 170 km and the charging takes like 9 hours. Why the hell do I need a car with such a range? 

Nio offers a range up to 900 km. Wow. That's something to consider. But what about the Chinese quality and as a potential German customer who got screwed over by the government's CO2 tax right on the New Year's day I decided to google what German reviews say on Nio:

ADAC praises Nio quality and price, specifying that 70% of materials are from renowned producers like Bosch

https://www.adac.de/rund-ums-fahrzeug/autokatalog/marken-modelle/auto/nio-es6/

Another very positive review stating that it has some problems with being adjusted to the European standards and market but in general it's a good car for German roads and is much cheaper than a comparable Audi

https://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/fahrbericht/nio-es6-guenstiger-elektro-suv/

Another generally positive review. They point out that the battery is not suitable for a speed of over 120km/h which is a big problem for Germany's autobahn as 120 km/h is the annoying grandma speed here. However, other European countries have a speed limit so it might be less of a problem

https://www.autobild.de/artikel/nio-es6-performance-2022-test-preis-deutschland-reichweite-technische-daten-elekrtro-suv-17098037.html

Tl;dr German reviewers praise Nio for its price, quality and driving experience. The main disadvantage is that it is not fulfilling for some Europe-specific demands. However, if Nio adapts to those requirements, it will be a recommendable car.

Tl;dr for retards: Nio at the European market 🚀🚀🚀"

Unfortunately, I left my TA crayons at home, so I'll try to indent and tab over my walls of text as much as possible so that you Zoomers can pay attention to at least 1/4 of it.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*I do want to clarify that some of the timing of iOS 14 changes could get changed and Facebook could push back against certain parts of the change. I did my best to explain the basics of what I think is going on, but it is possible that I miscommunicated or misunderstood some parts of the iOS 14 update, so digital marketers, feel free to let me know in the comments and I'll edit accordingly\*\*\*

\-------------------------------

# TL;DR - Apple's iOS 14 - ""Get Zucked, Zuckerberg,"" Said Tim Cook

For reasons that will be explained below, it is possible that Google and Facebook will begin seeing their duopoly slowly diminish over the next several years (probably >7 years, based on how ""fast"" Turtle Mitch is able to get anything done). I do believe that Google and Facebook will continue to be the top two players in the game for the foreseeable future **(SO I AM NOT RECOMMENDING SHORTING THESE AT ALL YOU 🌈 NOOBS).**

The core problems that these companies will soon face, especially Facebook, is [anti-trust law suits from the FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization), more distrust of their platform due to the most recent election, censorship across both platforms, a complete failure of Facebook to properly address the negative side effects of social media on the youth and actually do something about it, and, most importantly, **Apple upgrading to iOS 14 (explained more later).**

* [The Anti-Trust Law Suit from the FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization) talks about Facebook becoming a monopoly and buying all the competition such as Instagram and WhatsApp, instead of competing against them.
* [iOS 14](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2020/08/30/ios-14-facebooks-apple-nightmare-keeps-getting-worse/?sh=3029be574cfe) update will roll out early 2021. This will hinder the collection of iPhone identifiers for advertisers ([IDFA](https://www.appsflyer.com/mobile-attribution-glossary/idfa/)), one of the primary things used to track users online.

\-------------------------------

Primary Issues For Facebook From The iOS 14 Update

1. **Bidding Issues:** As I stated above, Facebook is going to lose more and more data points as  time goes on, making it so that they aren't able to bid appropriately on someone like Johnny Bravo when he is scrolling through his insta feed. What does this mean? Insta may look at Johnny Bravo as a Joe Schmo and decide that he's not worth bidding up on, so Johnny Bravo will never see those ads of Playboy and Whey Protein that he would have bought if he got an ad for it. (Example for this: with the iOS14 update, Facebook loses its data points to Johnny Bravo's workout apps, so they had no way of knowing he would have been more likely to convert.
2. **Creating Audiences:** Facebook is going to lose thousands of data points on its users, effectively making it harder to match these audiences into their appropriate buckets. Before, if someone had several golf apps on their phone, you could assume they were a golf lover more easily. Without being able to use that app data sharing, it will be much harder to know they like golf unless they follow several golfing pros / shows in Facebook.

\-------------------------------

With the expectation that Facebook will become less efficient as time goes on and that certain lawsuits could negatively affect the company, many advertisers are looking for other viable options to put their ad dollars. There have been several social media competitors working to monetize their app and become the third wheel of digital marketing. Some of these companies include:

* PINS - Pinterest 🚀🚀🚀
* SNAP - Snapchat 🚀
* TWTR - Twitter 🚀
* Twitch - (Owned by Amazon aka AMZN) 🚀🚀
* LNKD - LinkedIn (Owned by Microsoft aka MSFT) 🚀
* Hulu Ads - (Owned by Disney aka DIS) 🚀🚀
* TikTok - Not sure if correct, but you may be able to get shares [here](https://www.ig.com/en/shares/ipos/bytedance-tiktok-ipo) (ticker tbd, but pretty sure it will be ZOOMR 🚀

The name of the game is trying figuring out which of these new channels will be the next to gain 5-10% more market share of ad spend from clients and which will be nothing more than moneyless pits since they do a terrible job at monetizing their app and creating engaging ads that lead to conversions for clients (looking at you SNAP and TikTok).

\-------------------------------

MY RECENT BACKGROUND (aka why should you even bother listening to this autist):

* **Worked in digital marketing and finance for the last 5 years**, also took on several side jobs doing digital marketing for companies
   * **I managed >$10 million in ad spend across various digital marketing channels (Google/Bing/Facebook/Shopping) over the last 30 days** and over >$40 million in ad spend over the last year
   * I work with a team of Managers and Directors at my agency to help talk about new opportunities and keep up with digital marketing trends across all channels
   * Using our >300 clients data, our company is able to look at macro trends at a faster rate, so we can quickly identify which new channels to focus our efforts in (Pinterest/TikTok/Snap/Twitch/etc.)
      * This was highlighted over the last year or year and a half when we noticed a huge spike in companies using Pinterest as a primary channel for digital marketing. Only more and more companies are going to join into the race, this is just the beginning.

\-------------------------------

# Any of these stocks or multiple could improve throughout the following years, but my money is on PINS 🚀🚀🚀

* Even with PINS recent run up in stock price, I think there is still plenty of time to buy this stock now.
   * Our clients are continuing to spend more and more on the Pinterest ad platform and it is returning better performance metrics (ROAS/ROI) than most of the other mentioned channels.
* Pinterest also relies on on targeting people based on boards they visit/follow/create, combined with using a search query method for ads, somewhat similar to Google's. **This means they don't have to rely as much on pixel data, like Facebook does, to create their audience targeting.**

&#x200B;

# I think the safest way to make money on PINS is to buy stocks for the long term, but I know that doesn't get some of your little schlongs hard enough.

* Their next earnings are on 2/4/21(after hours) and ***I fully expect them to smash expectations just like McConnell's dad smashed that turtle to give birth to Mitch.***
   * Look at PINS options that make sense to you for a little after earnings, preferably not 2/5, literally the day after earnings. But you do you boo.

You must be new to WSB. Well here’s your source of tendies for 2021 if you’re not a complete idiot and you can afford modest leaps. 

Some proper DD. I’m not citing sources, y’all can Google shit.

- They have around $200B cash on hand
- They had 34% increase in sales just on Xmas (278M)
- With the M1 processor, they’ve increased interest in their hardware again. Winning back jaded fanboys and killing the hackintosh community almost overnight.
- Their iPhone 12 sales are rumored to be strongest mobile sales to date.
- The stock is up over 80% in 2020 despite a pandemic

Now for bias and my own opinions:

I’ve been following Apple most of my life. I worked on some of the first hackintosh distros (iatkos) as a broke college student. I can tell you definitively that a massive majority of Apple users are in the digital media and production space. With their prioritization on services the last few years, they’ve really slacked in staying competitive in hardware. They’ve also made some weird plays at being different without actually innovating. That’s changed entirely this year. Their next earnings is going to reflect that. The M1 is a game changer. Almost everyone I know (which is hundreds of people in the digital agency space) have already or are planning on grabbing up Mac mini’s or Airs because of the chip and price point. Apple is also pretty much recession proof. 

My predictions:

- 10% price increase leading up to Q1 earnings just off anticipation.
- 20% price increase post Q1 (probably within a week or two) and pre Q2
- An easy 100% increase by year end.

My play:

Get calls on discount now. Near ITM for next earnings call. OTM leaps."

'Palantir\] is the best tool I have ever worked with. It’s intuitive, i.e. idiot-proof, and can do a lot you never even dreamt of doing.

This morning, using TWO FACE rather than XKS to review the activity of the last 3 days. It reduced the initial analysis time by at least 50%.'

and

'While it’s long been known that Palantir got on its feet with the intelligence community’s money, it has not been previously reported that the intelligence community actually helped build the software. The continuous praise seen in these documents shows that the collaboration paid off. Under the new “Palantir Model,” “data can come from anywhere” and can be “asked whatever the analyst wants.”'

Whilst the validity of these sources may be questionable, Dr. Sparkles and I are of the firm opinion that if these analytics tools are sufficient for bulk data collection and analysis for the intelligence community, their impact in private sector will be significant."
