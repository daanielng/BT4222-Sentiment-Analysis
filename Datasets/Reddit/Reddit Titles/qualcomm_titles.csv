Now here‚Äôs the narrative‚Ä¶

DDR5 is the next evolution of dynamic RAM, and all the investment analysts are super smart and have built reliable models of how system builders slowly transition from one memory standard to the next.  In fact you can find many articles from the past 6 months about how the cyclical DRAM market has entered a slower phase and the combination of inventory and production ramp-up time means we can expect slower growth from chip makers that are heavily DRAM makers. Like Micron.  That‚Äôs the sole reason why Micron (PE 14) has not followed Nvidia (PE 114), AMD (PE 47), Broadcom (PE 42), Applied Materials (PE 27), Qualcomm (PE 23) into much higher valuations.

But now there‚Äôs a nasty new version of an exploit called RowHammer that hackers can use to disrupt or steal from DDR4 systems, which is most of the worlds current PC and Unix systems.

DDR5 is naturally more resistant to RowHammer.  Intel and AMD motherboards are already scheduled to ship in 2022 with DDR5 support, so the engineering work is done.  The Rowhammer exploit increases the urgency to upgrade systems and will thus shift the demand curve ahead of what the analysts have in their models.

Now DDR5 makers like Micron, instead of being seen as in a more slow-growth phase of their industry compared to other chip makers, will quickly be recognized to be in high-growth phase, maybe emergency high-growth if a couple Rowhammer exploitations get publicized.

Edit:  I know I misspelled RowHammer in the title.  Turns out you can't edit the title.  Total autist here, you're prolly best off ignoring everything I say."

BlackBerry is set to have a parabolic run over the next few weeks/months with many upcoming catalysts! Below is my analysis of why I think the stock is going higher.

Buying BlackBerry now is similar to buying $AMD at $2.00 in 2014 when SU BAE stepped in as CEO and took the stock to the moon! I believe this is a very similar opportunity right now! ü§´

**My fellow APES** üêµ **just remember that DIAMONDS** üíé **are made under PRESSURE** üñê

Good Luck and let's hope that PAPA CHEN makes it rain TENDIES!  üêî üí¶

\-------------------------

**Background - The turn around story of the SLEEPING GIANT**  üí™

Under the leadership of CEO John Chen, BlackBerry has spent the past 8 years pivoting from hardware smartphones to the future: (1) IoT Internet of Things (2) Automotive/EV and (3) Cyber Security.

All three of these areas are growth opportunities and BlackBerry has strategically partnered with many large tech companies including: Amazon, Microsoft and Qualcomm.

The market value of **BlackBerry is CRIMINALLY UNDERVALUED** **at \~$6 Billion** compared to their competitors such as $CRWD at $53 Billion, $PANW at $54 Billion and $ZS at $48 Billion to name a few.

The transformation of the business can be summarized in the slide below. Mickensy Consulting has estimated that the pool of reoccurring revenue from the IoT and connected car will grow exponentially over the next 10 years, which is VERY GOOD for BlackBerry's new business model!

**Patent Sale/Settlement/Partnership Announcement**  üí∞

There is been lots of speculation and rumors over the past few month from various sources, ranging from Facebook $FB being the sole purchaser for cash up front and/or a partnership deal, to a group of parties. The range of the deal is said to be worth $1 Billion to $2 Billion.

On the last conference call, CEO John Chen said that there is about an ""80% probability that the deal closes by Q4"". This date is November 2021, which is next week. However, they could also be waiting to release it during their next earnings call on December 21st, 2021.

**QNX, IoT (Internet of Things), Amazon IVY and the connected car ecosystem**  üëç

QNX real-time OS is installed in 195M cars today, out of 1.4B cars in total on the road worldwide. QNX enables many different software pieces to run in a car, so acts as a kind of central control unit. QNX is becoming the predominant OS for connected cars, since it¬¥s installed in so many cars. Whilst today $BB licenses QNX to OEMs on a per-unit royalty basis, QNX is effectively set up (through Blackberry Ivy, in partnership with $AMZN) to be the foundation of the data value chain for the auto industry, which McKinsey estimates will be quite big, specially for a company ($BB) with a market cap of $6 Billion today. I think this will extend to other verticals over the next decade.

In addition to the North American and Japanese automakers, BlackBerry QNX also have partnerships with Chinese EV's such as $XPEV and $BIDU (who plans to make EV's in the future).

[Part one link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzkdma/mu_micron_technology_deepdive_adderallfueled_dd/)

So first, we are going to look at the past three days of trading. The stock has had solid momentum over the last 30 days, and especially the past three days. Micron shares have gained 27% this month, the last 30 days have brought the annual gain to 34%.

**Why did MU pop on Friday:**

**Micron opened at 78.93, had a high of 83.86, a low of 78.93, closed at 83.03 (7.80% change), and 47.22M volume.**

[Covered in the first DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzkdma/mu_micron_technology_deepdive_adderallfueled_dd/) *Micron climbed a lot on Friday. This was due to an analyst at Evercore ISI adding the memory chip maker to his list of top stock picks. [He anticipates a return to earnings growth next year.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-stock-price-earnings-chip-shortage-51632864045?mod=article_inline).*

(
*‚Äò‚ÄúIn his note, Muse wrote that while shares of chip makers like Micron have lagged behind the PHLX Semiconductor index, or SOX, since early June, the tide may be shifting.*

*‚ÄúWe believe negative sentiment was due to investor concerns over the sustainability of PC, handsets, and cloud demand, which was also compounded by DRAM spot pricing that began to flatten out in May/June 2021,‚Äù Muse wrote.‚Äô*

[Useful Nasdaq article explaining Friday‚Äôs hype ""Why Is Everyone Talking About Micron Stock?‚Äù](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-is-everyone-talking-about-micron-stock)

This is also due to the Citi upgrade (see Monday section).

**Why did MU pop on Monday:**

**Micron opened at 83.66, had a high of 87.67, a low of 83.66, closed at 83.86 (1.00% change) and 34.35M volume.**

MU popped again on Monday, with shares rising as much as 5.6%. Monday‚Äôs rise was due to a variety of reasons, outlined below.

**An important thing to note is that despite the market slide on Monday, Micron generally held its own and remained green.** The rest of my calls were obliterated, meanwhile the calls I bought pre-market and 5 minutes after open remained in profit. I did not sell these on the peak, I am still holding them. 


*Evercore ISI analyst upgrade from Friday:* 
Again due to the Evercore ISI price upgrade on Friday, MU saw strong momentum on Monday.

*Citi analyst upgrade from Friday:*
*‚ÄúCiti analyst Christopher Danely said the pricing correction in the DRAM market was ""drawing to a close"" as the PC and server markets stabilized and expanded. As such, he expects Micron to benefit from ""more positive catalysts"" in the coming months and maintains a ""buy"" rating with a price target of $120 -- more than 40% above its current price.‚Äù*

*CNBC article released pre-market:*
[An article was released on Monday from CNBC, 7:00AM EST.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/22/micron-stock-has-best-day-in-18-months-traders-see-bigger-breakout.html)  This highlighted the two analyst upgrades, their targets, and the upside. Due to CNBC‚Äôs wide reach, this highlighted the stock to other investors and drove momentum. 

One bearish thing to note (not in the article), from CNBC ‚ÄòTrading Nation: ‚ÄúOn CNBC‚Äôs ""Trading Nation,"" Michael Binger of Gradient Investments said semiconductor stocks that have gained sharply in the recent period are likely to pull back.‚Äù
However my opinion as of Wednesday is that this has happened to much of the semi-sector Monday/Tuesday, but MU has remained largely unaffected thus far.

*Micron‚Äôs LPDDR5X DRAM is going to be used in the MediaTek Dimensity 9000:*

**This is important news, I‚Äôm going to cover this later in my DD.** This was also announced pre-market. 
*[‚ÄúMicron Technology, Inc. (MU) revealed that its low-power double data rate 5X (LPDDR5X) DRAM for MediaTek Inc.‚Äôs new Dimensity 9000 5G flagship chipset for smartphones has been validated.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/micron-lpddr5x-dram-to-feature-in-mediatek-dimensity-9000)*
 
*‚ÄùBuilt on its 1Œ± (1-alpha) node, the new chipset will help smartphones unlock applications powered by artificial intelligence and 5G innovation. Micron claims LPDDR5X to be the fastest and most advanced mobile memory available. It says that it has shipped the first batch of samples.‚Äù*
 
*‚ÄúMeanwhile, Micron disclosed that it was joining hands with leading smartphone manufacturers and chipset vendors to enable ecosystem innovation with LPDDR5X.*

**Why did MU pop again on Tuesday:**

**Micron opened at 85.04, had a high of 87.71, a low of 84.33, closed at 85.41 (1.85% change), and had a volume of 31.64M**

Micron again showed strong performance yesterday. Again, much of the semi sector was sliding/underperforming, yet Micron remained strong. 

The primary reason for this was that [Mizuho](https://www.mizuhogroup.com/) upgraded Micron back to a buy (one month after it was downgraded). 

[Link to Marketwatch article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/micron-upgraded-back-to-a-buy-at-mizuho-just-one-month-after-it-was-downgraded-11637672539?mod=mw_latestnews)

Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh again became bullish on Micron. He upgraded it to buy, after downgrading it to neutral on October 20th. He changed his price target to $95 from $75.

*‚ÄúWhen Rakesh downgraded Micron last month, he cited expectations of a soft demand outlook for the first half of 2022 for PCs and notebooks, server and handset markets.*

*‚ÄúHowever, our recent checks indicate the ‚ÄòACTUAL‚Äô demand is improving across all three markets,‚Äù Rakesh wrote in a research note, with first-quarter PC/NB builds ‚Äúonly‚Äù flat to down 5% from the previous quarter, compared with expectations of a 10% to 15% decline and handsets flat versus expectations of down 10%. He also believes server demand could improve.‚Äù*


[From Barrons:](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-mu-western-digital-wdc-stocks-analyst-buy-51637675537)
‚ÄúNew data indicated actual demand was improving across PCs, servers and handsets that ‚Äúcould support an improved pricing,‚Äù prompting [Rakesh to raise the stock to Buy](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-mu-western-digital-wdc-stocks-analyst-buy-51637675537) and boost his price targets. The new target for Micron is $95, up from $75‚Äù

*‚ÄúRakesh estimates that first-quarter PC and netbook builds will only decrease between 0% and 5% quarter over quarter, up from previous estimates that they would fall between 10% and 15%. PC demand alone could be up as much as 5% year over year, a shift Rakesh said was surprising given Wall Street consensus that demand would be down between 2% and 3%.‚Äù*

*‚ÄùRequests for memory chips in China also could improve compared to previous estimates, as well as orders from server hosts like Amazon ( AMZN ) and Google (GOOGL). An additional boost could come from upcoming investments in the metaverse and virtual reality.‚Äù*

*‚ÄùMicron may be a new darling among analysts. Last week, Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse added Micron to his list of top stock picks, anticipating a return to earnings growth next year.‚Äù*

**Wednesday outlook:**

MU is currently declining pre-market. Opening at 85.59, with a high (so far) of $86, and a (current) low of 84.62, where it is at right now as I write this segment (13:22PM GMT/08:22 EST/07:23 CST). There is no negative news, so I expect this is due to the current slide of the semi-segment and general market slightly affecting MU (whereas the past two days it has almost-always remained green despite the current market). However it is only down 0.90%, we will see what happens at open. I will update this segment then. I will also include any news that comes out today.

Update: MU is still remaining strong. As of 10:25AM EST, it has so far peaked at 86.72, after opening at 84.65, the current low being 84.65 also. Volume so far is 6.81(M). Current price (10:27AM EST) is 86.15 representing a  0.85% change.

It is noteworthy that Samsung was the first to announce LPDDR5X DRAM, however Micron was the first to validate it‚Äôs LDPDDR5X module DRAM in partnership with MediaTek. **Micron has already shipped the first batch of this DRAM module.**  This is not surprising as Micron has been making GDDR5X and GDDR6X VRAM for Nvidia GPU‚Äôs for many years. 

Micron has also revealed that samples of this new memory module for smartphones supports data rates of up to 8.533 Gbps, making it 30% faster than LPDDR5 modules (it is worth noting these are the highest achievable figures for the standard, and not real world figures). 

**How is LPDDR5X RAM on the MediaTek Dimensity 9000 better than LPDDR5?**

[Relevant chart of the Micron LPDDR5X used by MediaTek](https://imgur.com/yKsnPyo)

This RAM is the newest standard in RAM technology for mobile devices. It aims to improve the data transfer on RAM chips used in mobile devices such as the DImensity 9000 (or other counterparts such as Samsung Exynos and Qualcomm Snapdragon). It is claimed that these Micron DRAM modules (produced with 1-alpha technology) consume the lowest power among mobile DRAMs.

[**When sampled**](https://www.digitaltrends.com/features/lpddr5x-ram-vs-lpddr5-dram-dimensity-9000/) Micron‚Äôs LPDDR5X solution achieved data transfer speeds of up to 7500Mbps, however this is behind the transfer rates supported by the new standard (8533Mbps). As Micron emphasized on the 8533 figure, my personal prediction is that it will soon bring out products achieving higher transfer speeds (or that it is maybe saving them for other manufacturers than MediaTek). LPDDR5 (highest rate) achieves 6400Mbps. 

*‚ÄúBased on these results, MediaTek concluded that LPDDR5X modules lead to 17% faster transfer speeds and 15% lower latency compared to the previous generation.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúMediaTek remarked the new RAM technology will allow increasingly higher levels of data processing, which are needed for the complex and heterogeneous processing units that are built into modern-day chipsets. These higher processing capabilities will be vital for the high-data requirements of the 5G era.‚Äù*

**The difference between Micron‚Äôs and Samsung‚Äôs LPDDR5X solutions can only be compared once the Snapdragon 888 benchmarks are released, or newer chips featuring the most recent RAM technology.**

*Availability of Micron‚Äôs new DRAM:*
*‚ÄúMicron‚Äôs Taiwan fabs have begun volume production of 1Œ± node DRAM, starting with DDR4 memory for compute customers and Crucial consumer PC DRAM products. Micron has also begun sampling LPDDR4 to mobile customers for qualification. The company will introduce additional new products based on this technology throughout calendar 2021.‚Äù*

**P/E Ratio:**

MU‚Äôs current P/E ratio (as of Wednesday 24th November pre-market) is 16.3x. The median P/E ratio for the US is 18x. I‚Äôm sourcing from the below linked article for this section. 

*[‚ÄúRecent times have been advantageous for Micron Technology](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-piece-of-the-puzzle-missing-from-micron-technology-inc.s-nasdaq%3Amu-27-share-price-climb) as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to wane, which has kept the P/E from rising.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúMicron Technology's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver moderate growth, and importantly, perform in line with the market.‚Äù*

Last year delivered a 117% gain to the company‚Äôs bottom line. The EPS has fallen 57% in total from three years ago. Therefore the recent earnings growth may have been undesirable for the company.

*‚ÄúTurning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 35% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 11% each year growth forecast for the broader market.‚Äù*

Micron‚Äôs P/E is now in line with other companies. You can use P/E to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations. It‚Äôs superior earnings outlook is not contributing to P/E as much as expected. When strong earnings outlook is seen with faster-than-market growth, potential risks are what may be placing pressure on the P/E ratio. 

The risk of price drop looks to be subdued, but investors likely thing future earnings could see some volatility. 

**NAND Flash revenue growth for Q3 2021:**

[Recent relevant article released today, I will be sourcing from this for this section.](https://evertiq.com/design/51010)

Hyperscaler and enterprise clients are continuing procurement in line with Q2, this is in order to deploy products based on new processor platforms. 

Major smartphone brands are expected to expand their procurement activities during Q3, as they are preparing to release new flagship models. 

*‚ÄúAs such, clients in both server and smartphone industries made significant contributions to the revenue growth of the NAND Flash industry for 3Q21.‚Äù* 

However, suppliers note that orders from PC OEM‚Äôs are showing signs of decline. 

‚Äú‚ÄòOn the whole, the industry‚Äôs quarterly total NAND Flash bit shipment increased by nearly 11% QoQ for 3Q21, and the overall NAND Flash ASP rose by nearly 4% QoQ for the same quarter. Thanks to rising prices and expanding shipments, the quarterly total NAND Flash revenue increased by 15% QoQ to a new record high of USD 18.8 billion in 3Q21.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúDemand from the data center segment remained strong, and clients continued to adopt Micron‚Äôs 176L products. However, Micron‚Äôs shipment share in the smartphone market lagged behind that of other NAND Flash suppliers. Furthermore, its PC OEM clients were starting to be affected by the uneven supply of semiconductor chips. In light of these factors, Micron‚Äôs NAND Flash bit shipment increased by a modest 4% QoQ. On the other hand, the NAND Flash market remained in a severe shortage in 3Q21, thereby driving up Micron‚Äôs ASP by about 5% QoQ. Hence, Micron‚Äôs NAND Flash revenue for 3Q21 reached USD 1.97 billion, an 8.8% QoQ increase.‚Äù*

[*Sales ranking of Branded NAND Flash makers, Q3 2021 (in million USD)*](https://imgur.com/sbJyTmY)

**NAND Flash revenue growth for Q4 2021:**

The impact of the component supply shortage has increased across numerous segments of the NAND flash market, as the capacity issues in the foundry market remains unresolved. 
Currently, NAND Flash components are in higher available supply compared to other kinds of key components. 

*‚ÄúFor OEMs and ODMs, the differences between the NAND Flash inventory level and the inventory levels of other components have been growing over the past several months. Therefore, they have to scale back orders and reduce stock for NAND Flash. As inventory adjustments are happening, NAND Flash contract prices will start to drop and thus bring about an end to the several quarters of strong revenue growth enjoyed by suppliers.‚Äù*

I would note that this is actually possibly negative news for MU, but will only affect Q4 and perhaps after that. NAND is only a segment of Micron‚Äôs business though. 

**Micron‚Äôs CEO, an analysis of his performance**

[‚ÄúMemory chip demand has been exploding since Sanjay Mehrotra was recruited as Micron CEO in 2017.‚Äù](https://investorplace.com/2021/11/mu-stock-is-at-the-middle-of-an-upswing-not-the-end/)

Mehrotra previously founded SanDisk. He became available after Western Digital acquired SanDisk in 2016.

[After Mehrotra joined Micron as CEO, strong performance was seen in 2017 and 2018.](https://investorplace.com/2018/05/micron-technology-inc-booming-despite-low-stock-price/). Micron‚Äôs sales rose from $12 billion in 2016 to $20 billion in 2017 (fueled by data centres and smartphones). In 2017/2018, Mehrota astutely aimed production at solid state drives and graphics. One reason for this was to target the cloud boom, and their upgrade cycle to meet demands for AI applications (making memory important, and thereby putting Micron in a good position). He also aimed to balance between supply and demand that year, rather than the bear market that was indicated by current stock price. In 2017/2018, while expanding investment, Micron built up a cash reserve. It has $8 billion in cash (as of May 2018), and short term investments as of the most recent quarter at that time. Long term debt fell to $7.8 billion nd could be paid out of cash on hand. It‚Äôs price to earnings ratio was 10 (as of May 2018), which would mean a 25% bump in stock price. 

*In March 2020* [Micron surprised ‚Äòanalysts by earning $405 million, 36 cents per share, on revenue of $4.8 billion for the quarter ending in February.‚Äô](https://investorplace.com/2020/03/micron-mu-stock-offers-hope-in-turbulent-market/) Certainly strong performance despite being at the start of the pandemic.

*‚ÄùThe results sent MU stock up over 5% on March 26, although shares are down over 3% in mid-morning trading March 27.‚Äù*

‚ÄúShares rose sharply thanks to a [conservative outlook from CEO Sanjay Mehrotra](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/micron-earnings-conservative-outlook-seen-as-prudent-but-rest-of-year-remains-a-big-question-2020-03-23), who has seen many booms and busts in his 30 years as a memory company executive.‚Äù

*‚ÄúLast week, Micron Chief Executive Sanjay Mehrotra said in a letter that the company took early precautions in January to limit the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in its facilities in China and the rest of Asia and expanded those protections as the virus spread world-wide.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúWe have also carefully managed raw materials and our supply chain to maintain our manufacturing capabilities and production,‚Äù Mehrotra said. ‚ÄúOur global team has shown tremendous strength and solidarity, operating with excellence despite lockdowns and quarantines that challenged staffing, shipments and work schedules.‚Äù*

Because memory chips are commodity products, MU stock is prone to sharp rises and falls. Until recently (as of March 2020) it was said to be riding a ‚Äúsupercycle,‚Äù with chip-based memory replacing spinning disks in devices, PCs and the cloud.‚Äô

*Analysis as of today 24th of November 2021:*
Memory has been going through a ‚Äòsuper-cycle‚Äô for years now, this is due to SSD‚Äôs/flash memory replacing standard HDD‚Äôs in consumer devices and more recently in data centres. SSD‚Äôs/flash memory are faster and more reliable. As the price has been coming down for SSD‚Äôs/flash memory, the switch to these has accelerated. 

Analysts may warn that this ‚Äòsuper-cycle‚Äô is peaking, however it is just [cooling down](https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202107140009). And as outlined in my previous DD, in 2023, 2024 and the future. We can actually expect memory demand to exponentially increase. 

[Chart showing price projections of various DRAM product categories for Q3](https://imgur.com/bPkMum5)

The current supercycle is expected to run [until 2023 (‚ÄúThe super cycle in global memory chips, where price strengthening is coupled with demand overwhelming supply, is expected to last until 2023‚Äù)](https://m.pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2021&no=489942), and could go well beyond that with new demand from [the Machine Internet](https://cplaneai.com/the-machine-internet-age/). As well as cloud-computing. 

Mehrotra sees it continuing. As outlined in my previous DD, he has set a capital budget of [$150 billion for the next decade.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/micron-plans-over-150-billion-in-capital-r-d-spending-in-decade-ahead-11634724001).

**TL;DR of the TL;DR:**
Analyst upgrades, hype and new RAM technology have contributed to the price rise this week. NAND flash shipments are rising Q3. There is a supply shortage across the market. The memory supercycle is expected to continue until 2023 and perhaps beyond. The CEO of Micron is delivering high performance, expects this to continue and has set a capital budget of $150 billion for the next decade."

Most of you apes know Qualcomm as a company that supplies chips for smartphones, but in the latest Earnings call and investors Day, Qualcomm has shown the results of its diversification plans. With roughly **40%** of the QCT **earnings being from non-handset domain.** This has clearly pleased the wall street and the stock jumped more than 40% over the last few weeks!

The main reason why I am supper bullish on Qualcomm is that they mentioned with all their diversification plans coming into fruition their total addressable market has jumped from **100B to 700B!** That is insane for company of this size.

# A brief overview of Qualcomm‚Äôs New & Existing Markets

**The Metaverse:** 

https://preview.redd.it/g0klgm7und181.png?width=2195&format=png&auto=webp&s=9079349fa0732c10fcbd45a33ead96f768932138

Qualcomm has been in the metaverse game before it was hip. More than **10M** Meta Oculus have been shipped containing the SnapDragon XR2 chips. They already have a strong presence in this area, and it‚Äôs likely to be more popular. They have acquired multiple AR related companies over the last decade and have a well-established Snapdragon Spaces Developer platform. The CEO is expecting demand for these devices to be just as big as phone market which means another market space for Qualcomm to dominate in.

**The PC market:**

Let‚Äôs be honest, Qualcomm‚Äôs current presence is the PC space is almost negligible. But Last year Qualcomm did a very interesting acquisition of **Nuvia for 1.4B** dollars. Nuvia was a startup focused on developing ARM based high performing CPUs which was **founded by chief architect of Apple SOC**, responsible for CPUs like iphone A14 Bionic chips and also the M1 & M1 pro Macbook chips! Qualcomm already has the best modem expertise in the world, and teaming up theoretically with the best CPU team is definitely gonna take a good bite out of the PC chip market share soon. Qualcomm is planning to launch its first CPU by late 2022. 

**Automotive tech:**

https://preview.redd.it/86j6smdynd181.png?width=2340&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfe6050350390e98ba595f49af4aceb6ac91ab59

Qualcomm is serious about being the technology provider for most of the auto industry. It recently acquired the ADAS (advanced driver assistance system) unit of Veoneer for **4.5B** dollars. GM and BMW are one of the first companies that has agreed to power their digital cockpit with Qualcomm tech. Revenues from auto sector have already doubled since last year with **13B design wins in the pipeline** over the next few years. 

**5G Dominance:**

https://preview.redd.it/8t3u5khznd181.png?width=1890&format=png&auto=webp&s=70f171e5d260f2b7f00d477f8f11d62f3eb81dc7

Qualcomm has decades of expertise in Communication technology, which is significantly more than any other companies. With the transition from 4G to 5G just starting, Qualcomm is set to continue dominance in the smartphone world. The big concern that investors had with Qualcomm was with Apple planning to make its own modem chips in the next few years. But QCOM is projecting that the revenues from Apple will be less than 5% within a couple of years. **Even though Apple and Samsung are making in-house chips, they cannot escape the royalties that they have to pay to Qualcomm for using their 5G patents.** So virtually every smartphone is using Qualcomm tech directly or indirectly!

**IoT Projection looks Insane and currently on track:**

https://preview.redd.it/1rxoh0l0od181.png?width=2637&format=png&auto=webp&s=80b766d721b0252482385b544cd787a7abfd4ffc

TLDR: Qualcomm is a severely undervalued at the moment, especially if you compare to Nvidia, which has less earnings than Qualcomm and still roughly 4X the market cap of $QCOM. With all the diversification plans showing results every quarter, $QCOM It is ready to launch into stratosphere. I believe Qualcomm has the potential to be one of the best tech stock over the next few years.

My Position: 250 shares and few 185c jan calls for some tendies. 

Not a Financial advice. Do your own research.

/1. INTC is the only real US chip manufacturer that can reasonably compete with Korean Samsung and Taiwanese TSMC (-100 credit score for acknowledging Taiwan). It is getting lots of literal boat load of cash(probs something like $50B equivalent) from the government that is positive for the shareholders, while maintaining the buybacks and dividends.
Yes, TSMC and others are also hedging and gonna start making some chips in USA but realistically the gubment will give most of the cash to INTC.

/2. US gubment is in a cold war with China, this means it's also a technological warfare. This means supercomputers, missile, Starlink chips(private company) etc and Intel is likely going to be one of the prime suppliers of this boom in tech investment.

/3. TSMC and Samsung are pretty much bottlenecked. Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Mediatech, Broadcom, various carmakers, electronics manufacturers etc and not to mention Intel themselves are a big buyer. Specifically, Intel and Apple has bought out all capacity of TSMC 3nm(equivalent to Intel's 5 nm probs, I forgot). This means there is an enormous demand that is not being fulfilled and Intel launching their foundry services and already signing deals with Qualcomm, Amazon is a big deal.

For reference, TSMC's market cap is bigger than 3 Intel (yes, that's a unit I invented). In 2024-2025, you might even see Apple, NVIDIA and the likes fabricating their chips from Intel just to give a big F U to TSMC (who is currently slightly overcharging if the rumours are to be believed).

/4. Intel is launching a GPU. The GPU market is also in a huge bottleneck due to higher demand from gamers and corn miners. Everyone expects that they are likely to sell their GPUs very easily. Think about this for a sec. Intel is just about to become one of the players in this huge GPU market.
Which would also make way for their server GPUs and AIs and the likes.

/5. Think 10-15 years from now. Your fridge, doorbell, light, heating system and every ducking thing will have some chips and Intel is likely to remain a dominant player in this market. I think this will be bigger than the current entire semi market as it is. IOT is just getting started.

/6. Intel is one of the forerunner player in AI techs like autonomous vehicles through their various investments(Mobil eye for one) and will likely remain so. I don't know how big this will be in 10 years, but it's likely that Intel will be one of the bigger players in the market like Google (through Waymo), Tesla and NVIDIA.

/7. Intel also recently launched their big little architecture, where it has already became competitively better than AMD especially in gaming with low power consumption and huge power. Not to mention being very power efficient most of the time for using its efficiency cores most of the time. Not that it matters that much, seeing the gamer Steam reports, very few people actually play on the latest of the latest gen. But, that's also something that's worth noting at least. 

However, the vast majority of pc sales is in just your average boomer laptops and desktops. And they have a good lead there.

*Tips for those wanting to build a high end new pc. Wait for Intel's lineup to be available broadly, high end pc gamers will dump their last gen AMD chips for the Intel one in the second hand market, causing a flooding of cheap AMD CPUs, buy one of them. Source: Did this once.*

/8. One worrying factor is in the server market. Everyone seems to be launching their own server chips and AMD is very competitive and eating away market share. But Intel's management seems to be guiding us towards the right path. If their predictions prove to be right, they are on the right track.

/9. Intel announced that they will launch Angstrom scale CPUs in the future, that's good I guess. They are also working in RISC-V and other CPU architectures.

/10. Pat has an approval rating of 96% in Glassdoor and the employees would recommend others to work in Intel 89% of the time. This is a huge ass jump for both scores from the Bob Swan era. Go to Wayback Machine, you will see. This means a noticeable change has taken place within this huge organisation in such a short time.

/11. Intel stock always seem to have price support at around $50. And it's near that range right now.

/12. Most analysts are bullish on the stock. Comparatively cheap stock in this clown market. Wanna buy a $5.48B gravity powered truck company anyone?

/13. Intel actually has one of the highest talented employee pull who can be expected to deliver. Contrary to popular belief.

**Bear Cases**

/1. This is a boomer stock according to reddit's circejerk. So, it's difficult to convince people that it is actually expected to grow around 11% CAGR just by the current demand circumstances alone by management's conservative estimates for the next few years. This is mega bearish. If the market doesn't care about a stock, no matter what the management do, the stock will not perform.

/2. Intel has repeatedly failed to prove that their foundry division's predictions are reliable. If they went fabless like AMD, it would have probably rocketed already. But a big part of the cheapness of the stock comes from the unreliability of their foundry division. Yes, the management has finally started getting serious about their foundry, but one cannot ignore their past failures.

/3. Government contracts and the likes are not completely free money like some of you believe, delays in delivery and contract fulfillment could make what is essentially a free money glitch to a costly mistake and a billion dollar loss with a brink of an eye. The terms are generally very strict, so Intel has to deliver.

/4. Investments are going to be a lot and semiconductor industry being cyclical means, if Intel fails to deliver, its market share will be eaten away and lose billions in potential profit.

qnwkfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnwkfx/intc_the_sleeping_giant/,INTC the sleeping giant,106,158,2021-11-06 17:10:16,"Hi fellow retards, been a fellow lurker for a few years now but decided to post because I recently shifted my stance on $INTC and figured I should get the full smooth-brain experience by getting roasted by my fellow apes.  

TLDR: Intel is making all the moves to hire good talent to get fabrication and R&D back on track, they have the cash to do it, and DoD has stepped in to make sure they succeed in the wake of the China scares. Moreover, Intel is moving to offer foundry to other companies, which means that it don‚Äôt matter whether your team pro AMD or NVIDIA, they will likely be manufacturing for most US companies in the next 3 years.  

I figured Intel was done for ever since they stopped making significant progress on their chip performance and neglected their foundry, and was on the AMD hype-train ever since Ryzen 2 launched. However, a lot has changed on the global stage and on Intel‚Äôs strategy which signals a new outlook for Intel in the next year. 

First of all, Intel has seen the writing on the wall. They have gotten sloppy and greedy for too long and have seen their bottom line and image hit the shitter. In response, they have started hiring the talent they need to get their foundry and R&D back on track. They recently hired [Vineet Goel](https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/intel-hires-top-amd-gpu-architect-to-lead-xe-ip-roadmap) from AMD to work on GPU architecture, and have hired a slew of [veterans and new talent](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16807/intel-continues-to-rehire-veterans-at-some-point-theyll-run-out) as part of their revamping and have finally started to [move in the right direction](https://www.pcworld.com/article/549611/intel-core-i5-12600k-review.html/amp). Intel definitely sees how they‚Äôve lost their edge to AMD and NVIDIA and are making sure they hire the right talent to turn the tide. They also have deeper pockets than AMD and NVIDIA to make sure this happens (34.6B vs just 3.6B and 7.7B respectively). 

On the other hand, the political stage has completely shifted, and China and the US are more than just on bad footing, as the FBI officially note that . [china is ‚Äúa threat to our economic security‚Äîand by extension, to our national security‚Äù](https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/the-threat-posed-by-the-chinese-government-and-the-chinese-communist-party-to-the-economic-and-national-security-of-the-united-states). As a result, the US government is currently in a race to decouple as quick as possible from china, and no decoupling is more important than that of the chip-manufacturing industry. 

There is only 1, US-based chip manufacturer, and if you‚Äôre also smooth brained, you likely know it‚Äôs INTEL. Everyone else just designs in the US and manufactures in Asia, which is an issue because the next big player, TSMC is increadibly close to getting rammed by China because china want‚Äôs to [take over Taiwan](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2021-11-03/china-clearly-developing-ability-to-invade-taiwan-top-general-says). This leaves the US government as well as the  entire private industry up in the air if and when China invades Taiwan (or even just makes shipping to/from Taiwan harder). 

You know who has deeper pockets than Intel? The DoD and they‚Äôve basically decided that Intel has to be the leader for the sake of the entire private industry and US national security ([see here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-wins-us-project-develop-foundry-ecosystem.html#gs.f1t2zi).

Intel will be a big mover going forward because they want to win, the US government needs them to step up their game, and cash is clearly not and will not be an issue. More importantly, Intel is going to be more than just a cpu vendor, they are likely going to be the main foundry for most american chip designers like AMD, Nvidia, Apple and Qualcomm"

* The S&P 500 was led higher by technology and retail stocks, while the NASDAQ 100 extended its winning streak to a ninth straight day, the longest since December. A positive outlook from semiconductor giant Qualcomm contributed to evidence that the industry's squeeze is lessening. Short-maturity Treasury yields fell as global investors reviewed the future for monetary policy after the Bank of England defied expectations by leaving interest rates unchanged.
* The decision came after weeks of speculation that the BoE would be the first major central bank to boost borrowing costs since the pandemic began. It also occurred a day after Fed's Powell announced the beginning of a pullback in asset purchases while indicating policymakers may be patient with rises. Interest-rate futures contracts, which had priced in two quarter-point increases in 2022, pushed the second one into 2023.
* ""We thought the amount of market pricing for Fed hikes really around the middle of next year was very full, and that should come down,"" said Mark Cabana, head of US rates strategy at Bank of America Global Research.
* Saudi oil output will top 10 million barrels per day for the first time since the pandemic, according to al Arabiya TV.
* OPEC+ decides to ease cuts by 400k in December - sources.

# [Stock futures are little changed as market rally pauses with major averages at records](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/03/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock index futures were flat during early morning trading on Thursday after the major averages closed at records following commentary from the Federal Reserve in the prior session.
*****
> The central bank said it will begin to slow its bond-buying program, signaling that the economy can now handle an unwinding of pandemic stimulus. Investors had long anticipated the move and liked that the Fed did not signal it would be any more aggressive than necessary in raising interest rates once the bond tapering was finished next year.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were around flat on Thursday. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures hovered in positive territory.
*****
> The S&P 500 is up 1.2% for the week, pushing the S&P 500‚Ä≤s year-to-date return up to 24% as the benchmark enters a seasonally strong part of the year for markets.
*****
> Qualcomm led premarket gainers on the S&P 500, rallying nearly 7% following an earnings beat propelled by a 56% surge in smartphone chip sales. The company also provide strong guidance for the fourth quarter.
*****
> MGM shares gained nearly 5% after the casino operator announcing plans to sell the operations of its Mirage casino in Las Vegas to another operator. The company noted that no sales agreement had been reached and it did not mention any possible buyers.
*****
> Yet Moderna shares cratered after the drugmaker slashed its Covid-19 vaccine revenue outlook. The sotck was last down about 11%
*****
> And Roku was under pressure, falling more than 7% after the streaming platform reported disappointing third-quarter revenue.
*****
> During regular trading Wednesday, the Dow gained about 105 points, registering its fifth straight positive session. The 30-stock benchmark hit its 51st record intraday high of the year, and 42nd record close of 2021.
*****
> The S&P 500 also posted its fifth straight day of gains, advancing 0.65%. The index saw its 74th intraday high and 61st record close of the year.
*****
> The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.04%, and is on its longest daily winning streak since June 2020 following eight straight days of gains. The tech-heavy index saw both its 41st record high and close on Wednesday.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe Fed‚Äôs tapering announcement removes a minor, but overhanging worry across markets, as investors had been waiting for this moment for months, and it reinforces the view that the economic recovery has a long runway, albeit with a low rate of growth,‚Äù said George Ball, chairman of Sanders Morris Harris.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe Fed‚Äôs tapering announcement is a signal of economic strength, which is good for corporate earnings and markets,‚Äù he added.
*****
> The central bank said it will begin to curb the pace of its monthly bond-buying program ‚Äúlater this month.‚Äù This marks the Fed beginning to remove the significant stimulus it‚Äôs provided since the pandemic took hold.
*****
> The buying will slow by $15 billion per month, which means the quantitative easing should end by the middle of 2022, although the Fed reiterated flexibility saying the amount could change if warranted.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe Fed did a good job communicating its intentions well in advance of today‚Äôs meeting, which is why we aren‚Äôt seeing a ‚Äòtaper-tantrum 2.0,‚Äô‚Äù said Lawrence Gillum, fixed income strategist at LPL Financial.
*****
> Elsewhere in the market, a number of earnings reports are on deck for Thursday before the opening bell. Toyota Motors, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Kellogg are among the companies set to post quarterly updates. After the bell, Dropbox, Expedia, Airbnb, Shake Shake, Square and Uber will post quarterly updates, among others.
*****
> ‚Ä≥[W]e‚Äôre coming off a very strong quarter of earnings, which has taken priority over downside risk fears that had weighed in the run-up to the reporting season,‚Äù said Oanda‚Äôs Craig Erlam. ‚ÄúThe economy will have to continue showing signs of significant improvement to keep investors on board as they adjust to a world without central banks keeping rates at extremely low levels,‚Äù he added.
*****
> On Thursday weekly jobless numbers will be released, with economists forecasting 275,000 first-time claims, according to estimates from Dow Jones. Last week‚Äôs number came in at a 281,000, the lowest since the pandemic began.
*****
> October‚Äôs hotly anticipated jobs report will be released on Friday. Consensus estimates call for 450,000 jobs added, according to Dow Jones. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 194,000 in September, far short of the 500,000 estimate.

Their phones are becoming commodities with negligible upgrades, the prices are comming down, their eco system is under threat with a recent court ruling regarding monopolistic pricing with apps on their closed eco system. Their long awaited ventue into into cars is too late to the party and still to far away, if they even get it off the ground.

The Pipes vs. the Hardware. By pipes, I mean verizon, at&t, and t-mobile.  They spend billions at auction to buy spectrum from the federal gov to send gsm, Lte, and cdma signals to your phone and now moving into the 5th generation. Appl provides the hardware, the carriers provide the pipes that bring it to the hardware.

The pipe carriers pay full price for Appl phones. Again, the carrier pays full price to appl for the phone.  Those prices you pay are subsidized by the carriers in the form of your 2yr contract. The carrier makes its money off the contract minus the amount it subsidizes to you the buyer. Thats why you get the subsidized price on your phone every 2ys on your contract with trade in. This is very lucrative  to both the carrier and to appl. A revolving 2yr annuity for the carrier, and short new purchase cycle for appl.

What if I told you appl is working on bypassing the carriers. Well, they are. They have already embedded in the 13 a qcom gx chip in addition to the development of the m1 that uses mvno tech to use multiple carriers at the same time. Goggle is already using this with google-fi in their own eco system.  Appl is already beta testing it's own version with the 13 in europe. This is just the first step. Appl is investing heavly in new satellite technologies to beam directly to your appl phone. There are those who say the speed is too slow and this can only be used in rual area's and in emergencies with no coverage.Tell that to Musk and his new venture into satellites.This technology is comming sooner than you think.I believe this is comming. The money that verizon, att, and t-mobile make, prints into the 100's of billions. Imagine if appl takes even a quarter of this away from each of them. Will appl control it's own pipe, and be it's own carrier. I think it will or a least on a quasi level 8n the not too distant future,  and it's printing gobs of money now while I wait. That's why I'm long. Thanks for reading. Good luck with your trades and investments."

* $ASTS, AST SpaceMobile is first mover on direct to cellular phone Low Earth Orbit constellations. It is a very profitable enterprise when they succeed. But first they need regulatory clearance / permission, in the form of licenses. These are important hurdles, and as such will act as major catalysts once cleared. Looking into the state of these applications we find that there will be multiple such catalysts in the next months. You might want to skip to the very last section: Catalyst timeframes.

**DISCLAIMER**

* This is not financial advice. This is regulatory analysis.
* The company covered in this writeup is a first mover in uncharted territory. They aim to do what no one has done before. They are pre-revenue. This is a risky business/investment. The writeup covers only one single aspect in depth. You should gain a broader understanding of the funding, technical concept of a business model etc before investing and not do it from reading of a single aspect.
* *Comprehensive*, as in you will comprehend things and I should also say *exhaustive*, as in you will be exhausted from reading this long writeup. The subject is complex, and as such I might not have understood all things correctly. What is said below is to the best of my knowledge. I added pictures to make the reading less tedious.

**BACKGROUND**

* In a previous wallstreetbets writeup I outline the company and what makes it unique. This post is recommended background reading if you are not familiar with the company. [AST SpaceMobile. The Black Swan of Low Earth Orbit satellite communication constellations. ü¶¢ü¶¢ü¶¢ü¶¢ü¶¢ü¶¢ü¶¢ü¶¢ü¶¢ü¶¢ ü¶Ö Why is it so different?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pvciwf/ast_spacemobile_the_black_swan_of_low_earth_orbit/)

**SATELLITE COMMUNICATION COMPANIES, THE MAIN RISKS.**

[The main risks to satellite services is not technology, it is regulations.](https://preview.redd.it/4wxo8mf8o9u71.png?width=2688&format=png&auto=webp&s=09b652534e9e19458e4833ab125191504ff35d40)

* The above chart outlines the main risks that satellite services companies face. As can be seen **regulatory risks are the main risks.** As such overcoming these hurdles and getting the needed permits and licenses will act as major catalysts.

&#x200B;

[Screenshot from the US market access application showing network architecture.](https://preview.redd.it/n9weep87p9u71.jpg?width=1119&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4f9200f2dd9454d613ce4c6f6a4dd938994b6c3)

* Analyzing the applications in question, which are two the Bluewalker 3 single experimental satellite application and the application for US market access of the SpaceMobile constellation we find three major parts/ hurdles that are subject to the regulators approval. These three main regulatory risks are: **Fronthaul** (satellite to cellular phone spectrum), **Backhaul** (satellite to gateway spectrum) and **Orbital debris.** We shall look into them all below.

**FRONTHAUL CELLULAR SPECTRUM - USA**

* For SpaceMobile constellation US market access application AST legal/regulatory division has been very bright and exploited a regulation that opens up their use of partner cellular spectrum wherever that is not used terrestrially by a very simple and straightforward method, requiring no application nor permission of authorities, just notification.
* The initial application for SpaceMobile constellation contained fronthaul (cellular, satellite to phone) control and backhaul (satellite to groundstation) bands. This has since been amended (see below). And the application now contains just backhaul and satellite control bands. Whereas the applications for the cellular fronthaul bands will see a different regulatory very streamlined and simple process.

&#x200B;

[Screenshot of the public notice when AST SpaceMobile amended its application. https:\/\/docs.fcc.gov\/public\/attachments\/DOC-368002A1.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/vq5c0zkrl9u71.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=aed69ad5b4b4be7df2f547d999b3baf480c5ee80)

&#x200B;

* This other process is available since in September 2004 when the FCC ventured into taking:

>‚Äùadditional steps to facilitate the development of secondary markets expand upon and complement several of the Commission‚Äôs major policy initiatives and public interest objectives. These include our efforts to encourage the development of broadband services for all Americans, promote increased facilities-based competition among service providers, enhance economic opportunities and access for the provision of communications services, and enable development of additional and innovative services in rural areas‚Äù

* Quote above is from FCC 04-167 Its a bit of a complex read, p27 is the key paragraph:

>27. Thus, if the spectrum leasing transaction does not involve a geographic overlap with spectrum held by the spectrum lessee in any of the particular services listed, as described above, we will permit the leasing arrangement to proceed without prior public notice or case-by-case review.‚Äù\*

* Reading a note to the AST amendment of the SpaceMobile application it becomes clear this is indeed the backdoor / approach AST intends to use to gain US market access to use the cellular fronthaul frequencies. It is thereby no longer an intricate application to the FCC, it has been reduced to a simple notification process.

[Screenshot of letter attached to amendment off the original SpaceMobile constellation application. Highlighted text shows the reasoning behind seeking the amendment. This and the regulations cited above suggests a notification is all it takes, not an application to use the leased terrestrial cellular spectrum for AST SpaceMobile Satellite constellation in the USA.](https://preview.redd.it/2c1u31ewm9u71.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=45a1b30005cf2c8725034918adaa3426825206a6)

* A regulation put in place to maximize the use of spectrum in the USA, comes handy indeed. This regulation derisks the US market access application for SpaceMobile constellation, considerably. And as the US to large extent serves as regulatory benchmark for the developed world when it comes to space this will see effects in other markets.

**FRONTHAUL CELLULAR SPECTRUM - REST OF THE WORLD**

* As descibed in a report that can be purchased from Quilty the access to use fronthaul spectrum is a process that is different in different countries. And in some countries this is subject to a unified license regime. On these markets gaining access to fronthaul will be just as straight forward  / streamlined as in the USA. Partner Mobile network operators are already allowed to use them from satellite. I have done extensive searches for partner companies that holds unified licences.The countries I have found are Angola, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, India, HongKong and Rwanda. AST does not provide this list it is assembled from multiple sources by me.
* Further investigations has led to a comprehensive list of the 20 terrestrial mobile network operators that are AST SpaceMobile partners. These collectively hold 1.5 Bn customers and the business model of AST SpaceMobile involves applying for permission / licenses where needed through these terrestrial partners. As Quilty describes it this process will be fast in some countries, and likely see regulators in other countries rush to cut the redtape when they the opportunity to close the digital divide by allowing the use. On some markets, however, such processes will likely stall or be glacial. The partners under MoU or agreements are: MTN, Vodafone, Telecom Argentina, Telstra,  Liberty Latin America, Tigo (Millicom International), America Movil, Telefonica, Safaricom, Indosat, Vodacom, Smart, Uganda Telecom (UTL), AT&T, Rakuten, American Towers, Africell, MUNI, LIBTELCO and perhaps still Bell Canada, but the latter is not confirmed. AST does not provide this complete list when asked it is assembled from multiple sources by me.
* Just as the unified licenses are found in near equatorial countries, so is the partner coverage high near the equator. Companies like America Movil, AT&T, Tigo, Telecom Argentina, Telefonica, LL America means 80%+ of customers in Latin America are covered. And in Africa MTN and vodafone group dominate. Smart and Indosat Ooredoo Hutchinson partnerships covers Philippines and Indonesia. This focus is explained by the fact that AST SpaceMobile will launch the equtorial constellation initially consisting of 18 satellites and 2 in orbit spares for a total of 20, starting launches in 2022. Connecting the unconnected is an AST objective there are lots of these potential customers near the equator. Starting the rollout where regulatory issues are most easily overcome and access most swiftly granted is most likely another AST objective, these objectives are both met near the equator.

**ORBITAL DEBRIS RISKS - Bluewalker 3.**

* A close foreseeable catalyst for AST SpaceMobile would be the Bluewalker 3 experimental satellite application grant, which by all measures progresses smoothly an answer to the last outstanding question from the FCC regarding orbital debris was answered Oct 15th, and the answer filed October 18 2021. The ball lies now with the FCC, and if there are no more questions to ask the next step will be to grant the application. I foresee no regulatory issues there. But in this phase permits/ lisences granted will still move share price.
* As all questions so far has been answered, and FCC letters only contain single questions now, the AST Bluewalker 3 application is mature for approval any day. An imminent catalyst before end of year.

[Orbital debris density varies with altitude, the lowest altitudes are kept clean by drag ](https://preview.redd.it/ijgtz1s6y9u71.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ab2a79348fc17d529a6987dda581cc78b6bfe13f)

**ORBITAL DEBRIS RISKS  - SpaceMobile constellation US Market Access application.**

&#x200B;

* The individual requirement per satellite is to get below 1:10,000 risk. As the AST satellites fly edge on they present small area that debris might impact and the US market access application states 1:19,700. risk per satellite.

&#x200B;

[Screenshot from AST SpaceMobile constellation US Market Access application showing a 1:19,700 total risk calculated using standard NASA software.](https://preview.redd.it/4akbdn980au71.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=106f28a8f91c0540839d65f8c3bd38d23b3b4376)

* 1/19,700= 0.00005076 that would be the individual large object impact risk probability. When the satellite is flying on the altitude of the application as calculated with branch std NASA software. If they are duds.
* Then the regulations say to consider maneuver able sats 0 risk (as space is monitored and they can maneuver away) and they say to use a 10% failure rate. And get below 0.001 total constellation impact risk. That is below .1% one in a thousand times that some satellite would have an object impact.
* So for a 243 sat constellation we have 24.3 theoretical dead in the sky sats we need to calculate the aggregated large object orbital debris risk for.
* The way to do that is to first calculate the chance of a single sat not colliding. That is: 1-0.000005076=0.99994924 Then we calculate the chance of no one out of 24.3 sats collide: 0.99994924\^ 24.3 That is a chance of 0.99881289 that all duds make it. The complimentary event being 0.00119 That is pretty close to the limit of 0.001 total risk.
* Now regulations are clear on the fact 0.001 is not a rule, it is a benchmark that the FCC may choose to do exemptions from. Meaning they can allow a risk larger than 0.001. So there are a number of tweaks to this.
* One would be to amend application to 198 satellites whereby the limit is just met. 198 is more than needed for full global MIMO, then play the starlink trick once global MIMO is achieved and lower altitude.
* A second way is to ask FCC to make an exemption of the 0.001 total debris impact risk limit.
* A third way is to claim that the spacecrafts having multiple magnetorquers (10x redundancy) throughout the array as well as also having Orbion Hall effect thrusters is less likely to fail orbital avoidance having dual redundant maneuverability. And ask exemption from 10% failure rate.

&#x200B;

[Orbion Hall Effect \(Ion\) thrusters](https://preview.redd.it/pvk90d592au71.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=78ac837379b1dcee5e1065aea2ce86b4f113327e)

&#x200B;

[A magnetorquer \(this one made by AST subsidiary NanoAvionics. Multiple Magentorquers are distributed throughout the Bluebird satellite arrays for redundancy. They change pitch, yaw and roll of LEO spacecraft with help of the earth magnetic field and require no propellant.](https://preview.redd.it/qi4p3sij2au71.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=9dd7bbe6d0093f5f6a512c6429fb04db79a7a4a1)

* A fourth is to lower altitude of constellation from start.
* A fifth way is to launch a separate constellation to cover USA using other orbital planes. (This would be unlikely).
* A sixth way is a slight reduction of size. We have seen this played out already, presumably as R and D has developed more efficient microns (it is the name of the antenna array elements), and studies likely narrowed down the number of beams actually needed per sat. Array has shrunk from 30x30 a year ago, to 24x24 (Deutsche Bank coverage) to 20x20 (Barclays coverage report, company statements) and 20x17.8 (measured by me from recent company renderings). If this ongoing reduction leads to amendment of orbital debris impact risk later on remains to see. They might have shrunk a bit since application was filed.

This huge antenna is key to connect directly to cellular phones. Flying edge first is also a design feature that allows a lot more antenna real estate without violating orbital debris regulations.](https://preview.redd.it/cix35xgj6au71.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&s=51932e8db9e3bd91c43f9cf61772fa9a1d108b5c)

* It is an AST objective to have 336 sats up by 2027 according to AST investor presentation. This is the equivalent of 2 x 168 satellite constellations. Mirroring the Starlink double constellation concept. Two such constellations would use two different aggregated orbital debris collision risk calculations. If you add a 30% margin on 168 you end up with 234 satellites. The AST SpaceMobile US market access application is for 243 satellites, whereas just 168 are actually needed for the first MIMO global constellation. It stands to reason there might be a 30% margin to the application that is mostly a negotiation tactic. And if so the 168 needed satellites for global MIMO have an aggregated risk well below the regulatory requirement. If we consider this 2 x 168 satellites the real objective of AST, then orbital debris will not be an issue for the initial 168 US market access application.

**BACKHAUL CELLULAR SPECTRUM Q nd V bands.**

* AST SpaceMobile use extremely high throughput Q and V bands for satellite backhaul.
* The access to these bands are achieved on two parallel routes, one is application to ITU, this has been done through NICTA, a regulatory body of Papua New Guinea who has approved the AST SpaceMobile application to launch.  AST attests to this fact in correspondence with the FCC.
* The second route is by application to each respective country where AST, or its partners Vodafone and American Towers operates a terrestrial Space station / gateway. For most parts this will be American Towers and AST will lease the terrestrial Space Stations to avoid Capital Expenditures, CapEx. Now The Architecture is NewRadio some next level technology that uses leaders at virtualisation Altiostar and Rakuten software to virtualize the entire network and have AI slice it for optimum performance on throughput and latency and distribute the traffic on legacy cellular networks and the internet as appropriate. Using the internet for this is one factor that means AST will not need a terrestrial ground station, nor such permits for backhaul, in each and every country where they operate. just in some.
* In the US [an extra licensing round](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-21-941A1.docx) has been initiated by the FCC to supply AST SpaceMobile with backhaul cellular spectrum. Applications to take part in this round ends on Nov 4 2021. After this date judging by the OneWeb 92 days after deadline and Kuiper 65 days offsets from last round. AST SpaceMobile will receive their Backhaul spectrum grant somewhere between Jan 8 2022 to Feb 4 2022.
* Importantly the Kuiper application in the prior round had¬† \_not\_ yet resolved their orbital debris issues but were still granted v-band rights conditional of later fixing their orbital debris analysis. This means these processes are parallell and will be resolved seperately not delaying the frequenzy grant. They might serve as two seperate catalysts. The orbital debris issue might take another month or two of correspondence to resolve, we see this from the BW3 correspondence. Putting the complete AST US Market access grant, including orbital debris, somewhere in the same timeframe as BW3 launch window March-April 2022 or some month later: June 2022.

**OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS, THE 3GPP 5g standard.**

* Many constellations try to do satellite communications and they compensate for small phased arrays in space and to wide beams by using proprietary user equipment and proprietary communication standards. AST does not use proprietary standards nor proprietary phones. They are adpating to the existing standard. And the existing standard is adapting to AST SpaceMobile.
* 3GPP 5g standard release 16, and later release 17, contain many techniques that are suited for connection to satellite, including better adopted to doppler and latency of LEO satellites, 4x4 beamhandling MIMO, carrier aggregation, improved power management, and positioning. This mutualistic / synergistic relationship between the terrestrial end user equipment and the space based satellites will continue to improve once they connect. The chip Qualcomm x65 which has been with OEM manufacturers in 2021 and will be in phones from 2022 already incorporates release 16. This chip is manufactured by AST partner Samsung.
* AST will connect to legacy cellphones, including smartphones. But as new phones are launched they will keep getting better at it, and add functionality such as very accurate assured 5g positioning. More reliable than GPS, less prone to interference, jamming and spoofing. Good for drones, which by the way also AST latency is, sub 30 ms. Iridium latency in comparison is terrible: above 300 ms. 5g through AST SpaceMobile thereby likely to get regulatory approval to pilot drones and vehicles remotely by low latency sensor feed and assured positioning / fused LEO GNSS.

&#x200B;

[Fused LEO GNSS. GPS type positioning from LEO satellites. Right column. Note the Precision and anti jam anti spoof advantage. +56 dB is 40,000 x stronger signal than GPS. 5g standard release 16 and beyond will include positioning using multiple uplink, downlink  and roundtrip multialteration signals as well as angle of arrival\/ angle of departure multiangulation. These abilities has civilian and military use cases.](https://preview.redd.it/tiyegjszhau71.png?width=352&format=png&auto=webp&s=8805e102e405ad1b70bf1867db02814c8583fd79)

**CATALYST TIMEFRAMES, Summary of the above.       R O U G H     E S T I M A T E S**

* Bluewalker 3 experimental satellite license grant. Nov-dec 2021
* AST SpaceMobile constellation backhaul Q/V band grant. Jan-Feb 2022
* Qualcomm x65 enabled, 3GPP release 16 androids, on the market. H1 2022
* Bluewalker 3 launch run up, satellite arrives at launch provider Space-X. February 2022.
* Bluewalker 3 launch. Mar 2022-April 2022.
* AST SpaceMobile orbital debris issue resolved, US market access granted. Mar 2022-June 2022.
* Partner contracts signed, and partner unified licenses, space station landing rights etc. Multiple.
* Bluewalker 3 testing results March - December 2022
* These catalysts will likely move the share price, IF and when they are executed. How the price will move and a model for that trajectory is in another [writeup](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pvuls1/model_for_share_price_in_pre_revenue_growth_stock/) here on WSB comparing it to another stock. That other stock, Lithium Americas, has tracked the model well running +22% in as many days since that post on a run up to an expected regulatory approval. AST SpaceMobile has yet to start run up and regulatory catalyst spikes but studying the price movement on Lithium Americas on these regulatory milestones should give the investor an idea about the magnitude of regulatory approvals for junior explorers. Be that mining lithium in Nevada or mining connectivity in Space. You still need that permit to start a hugely profitable operation.

This data was all collected from their earning conference call transcripts located [here](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/investors). so far total they have 249 companies signed up to use Blackberry QNX IoT software. This is INSANE!! This ranges from connected cars to drones to medical devices to robots to assembly lines to DoD drones to planes!!! These are design wins in last 2 years so the revenue will show up once they start shipping product, it will be huge revenue!! Starting this quarter in December the revenue will show up!!

**Blackberry QNX now control 78% of EV car market and 24/25 top EV car makers are signed up to use BB QNX software platform.**

Big news drop this week is Google and Qualcomm signing up to use Blackberry QNX Hypervisor. This means the chip will have QNX embedded capability that will allow Android to run on top of it for infotainment. This is bigger than sliced bread!! Every car will have BB QNX hypervisor inside providing safety and security to Android Infotainment. The BB QNX controls rest of the car software and modules like cluster, adas, and bunch of other functions.

Google + Qualcomm partnership is huge.,1230,254,2021-10-14 08:42:43,"As you know, BB moved up 5% (50 cents) today on news that they have partnered with Google and Qualcomm. You're probably surprised it went up because it always goes down on news.

This news is different. This news is huge.

Everyone was quick to jump to the conclusion that Ford had dropped BB entirely from their cars in favour of Google: [https://www.obj.ca/article/techopia/ford-drops-blackberry-qnx-infotainment-platform-inks-deal-google](https://www.obj.ca/article/techopia/ford-drops-blackberry-qnx-infotainment-platform-inks-deal-google)

Well, the Google and Qualcomm news pretty much puts that assumption to bed. Not only will BB still be in Ford cars, any car that is built using both Android's infotainment and Qualcomm's chips, will need BB tech.

We have Google, Amazon, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Baidu, etc. etc. on our side. We have a patent sale that could be worth 1 billion+ coming no longer than 2 months from now. And we have Blackberry IVY slated to release this month.

Please stop throwing current revenue numbers at me when this thing is going to pump revenue out like crazy in the future. Stop focusing so much on their past. Stop focusing on how paperhands rule this stock. I don't see a company out there that has this many positive things going for it with a 5 billion dollar market cap.

If the stock market is forward thinking, why not BB?

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-wednesday-oct-13.html)

*****

> # 1. Wall Street looks to avoid a four-session losing streak

> * U.S. stock futures were essentially flat Wednesday after Dow stock JPMorgan Chase reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue and ahead of key inflation data. Shares of JPMorgan rose modestly in the premarket as third-quarter results from the bank were supported by a $1.5 billion boost from better-than-expected loan losses.

> * The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq all dropped Tuesday for the third straight session. The modest losses indicated that investors were in a wait-and-see mode ahead of earnings season really kicking into high gear.

> * Shares of Delta Air Lines dipped in the premarket after the carrier on Wednesday reported that third-quarter earnings and revenue topped expectations. It was Delta‚Äôs first quarterly profit without taking federal aid into account since the start of the pandemic. However, it was still below 2019 pre-Covid levels.

*****

> # 2. Supply chain woes, rising costs may make for rocky earnings

> * Supply chain issues, labor shortages and higher energy prices are making this a very difficult quarter to model. As of Tuesday, 22 companies that are early reporters beat estimates by 11%, according to Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout. While this is above the traditional beat of 3% to 5%, it‚Äôs far below the average of prior quarters this year, including the roughly 18% beat for the second quarter. Third-quarter estimates, which had been rising steadily for months, have stopped in the last few weeks.

*****

> # 3. September consumer prices expected to remain high

> * The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 1.57% on Wednesday ahead of what‚Äôs expected to be another elevated inflation report. The government at 8:30 a.m. ET releases the September consumer price index. Economists expect headline CPI and core CPI, which excludes the food and energy sectors, to be around the prior month‚Äôs year-over-year increases of 5.3% and 4%, respectively. The Federal Reserve at 2 p.m. ET releases minutes from its policy meeting in September when central bankers indicated they expect to begin reducing monthly asset purchases ‚Äúsoon,‚Äù but did not say when.

*****

> # 4. White House aims to help key West Coast ports stay open 24/7

> * President Joe Biden will unveil a plan Wednesday to try to ease West Coast port backlogs by expanding round-the-clock operations. The Port of Los Angeles is expected to announce a shift to 24/7 operations, following a similar transition by the Port of Long Beach in California last month. Central to this plan to ease supple chain disruptions are commitments by some of the nation‚Äôs leading retailers and shippers, including FedEx, UPS, Walmart and Home Depot, to increase overnight and off-hours operations at the ports to get the goods to market. Together, the ports account for about 40% of the shipping containers entering the United States.

*****

> # 5. U.S. to reopen land borders in November for fully vaccinated

> * The U.S. said Wednesday it will reopen its land borders to nonessential travel next month, ending a 19-month freeze due to Covid as the nation moves to require all international visitors to be vaccinated. Vehicle, rail and ferry travel between the U.S. and Canada and Mexico has been largely restricted to essential travel since the earliest days of the pandemic. The latest move follows last month‚Äôs announcement that the U.S. will end country-based travel bans for air travel and instead require Covid shots for foreign nationals seeking to enter by plane.

# **Stock market on comeback trail heads into what‚Äôs supposed to be another stellar earnings season - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/08/stock-market-on-comeback-trail-heads-into-whats-supposed-to-be-another-stellar-earnings-season-.html)**
*****
> Stocks proved hard to keep down this week, and the start of the earnings season next week could further bolster the comeback if profits roll in as expected or better.
*****
> The major averages notched a winning week after overcoming a debt ceiling debacle in Washington. Lawmakers passed a short-term deal that will extend the debt ceiling until December, kicking that overhang for the market down the road.
*****
> This week‚Äôs price action also overcame surging oil prices and a disappointing jobs report, with investors buying bank and energy shares.
*****
> ‚ÄúIn the face of Washington drama, delta worries, multiyear highs in crude oil, and a much weaker than expected jobs number, you have to be impressed by how stocks were able to bounce back this week,‚Äù LPL Financial chief market strategist Ryan Detrick said.
*****
> https://i.imgur.com/Zh7JRt2.png
*****
> A market pullback that began in September brought the S&P 500 down more than 5% from its record at one point Monday, before stocks mounted a comeback. For the week, the S&P 500 added back 0.8% and sits just 3.4% away from its record.
*****
> Goldman Sachs stuck by its bullish year-end forecast earlier this week, predicting stocks would start to climb the wall of worries. And they did.
*****
> Goldman chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin said in a note to clients that his year-end S&P 500 price target for 2021 is still 4,700, which is nearly 7% above its current level.
*****
> The firm said earnings growth, not valuation expansion, was the primary driver of the S&P 500‚Ä≤s 17% return year to date, adding that should still be the case.
*****
> # Earnings season begins
> The third-quarter earnings season ‚Äî which kicks off next week with big bank earnings ‚Äî is expected to be another strong series of reports, despite some worries about supply chain issues and higher costs. Third-quarter earnings are expected to have risen 27.6% year over year, according to FactSet. That would be the third-highest growth rate since 2010.
*****
> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen some record earnings seasons the past few quarters, so all eyes will be on if earnings can help justify stocks near all-time high levels,‚Äù Detrick said. ‚ÄúWe do expect another solid earnings season, but we‚Äôve seen some high profile warnings already, so corporate America could have a rather high bar to clear this quarter. Buckle up.‚Äù
*****
> Bank earnings are the main focus next week with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs set to report.
*****
> After a range-bound few months for bank stocks, analysts are looking ahead to catalysts that could fuel the next phase in their recovery. Wall Street expects loan growth, interest rates and reserve releases to play into the major banks‚Äô reports.
*****
> ‚ÄúEarnings for the third quarter quarter should again be strong and mostly outpace expectations,‚Äù Leuthold Group chief investment strategist Jim Paulsen said. ‚ÄúHours worked in the third quarter rose by about 5% suggesting real GDP for the quarter may be close to 7%. With most companies reporting strong pricing power, solid real GDP growth should result in another surprisingly strong corporate earnings season.‚Äù
*****
> Paulsen sees earnings season rewarding cyclicals, like banks, and small caps more than technology stocks.
*****
> ‚ÄúI think the stock market is already showing signs of a leadership shift away from slow economic growth favorites including growth, tech, and defensive toward more the economically sensitive areas of small caps and cyclical sectors,‚Äù he added.
*****
> # Supply chain, higher cost warnings?
While the earnings season should be strong, there are likely to be some warning signs about inflation and supply constraints that could scare the market about the year-end set-up.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe risks of higher inflation, Fed tapering and what will likely be a choppy earnings season are still with us,‚Äù Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said.
*****
> There was some foreshadowing of this last week, when Bed Bath and Beyond shares cratered 25% after the company said it saw a steep drop-off in traffic in August. Bed Bath & Beyond saw inflation costs escalating over the summer months, especially toward the end of its second quarter in August, which corroded profits.
*****
> What investors know going into the third quarter ‚Äî from company guidance ‚Äî is that there could be haves and have nots this earnings season.
*****
> FactSet data shows that 47 S&P 500 companies have issued negative earnings guidance for the third quarter, and 56 companies have issued positive outlooks.
*****
> # Fed headwind ahead?
> The headline jobs number Friday was a major disappointment, as the economy added just 194,000 jobs in September, well below the the Dow Jones estimate of 500,000. On the positive side, the unemployment rate fell to a much lower point than economists forecast. At 4.8%, that‚Äôs the same level seen in late 2016.
*****
> It‚Äôs unclear if the number changes the calculus for when and how fast the Federal Reserve will slow its $120 billion-per-month bond-buying program.
*****
> ‚ÄúIn our view these figures are good enough, and when combined with the debt-ceiling can being kicked down the road, likely solidifies November as ‚Äògo time‚Äô for tapering,‚Äù Wells Fargo Securities senior equity analyst Christopher Harvey said.
*****
> ‚ÄúWe continue to expect a choppy equity market rally and a two-to-four-week tech bounce, but the bounce probably peters out next month when the Fed says those magical words: We will begin to taper,‚Äù he added.

> # Best and Worst Performing S&P 500 Stocks in 2021

> The fourth quarter is now off to the races and we thought it worthwhile to check in on the best and worst-performing S&P 500 stocks on a year-to-date basis. As shown below, there are currently six members of the index that have rallied over 100% this year. Apt for the year that its vaccine has rolled out, the biggest gainer of these has been Moderna (MRNA) with a 196.12% rally. It now has a market cap of $124.87 billion versus a market cap of only $41 billion at the start of the year. Of the 20 best performers, MRNA is also the only one with a market cap above $100 billion. The next largest is ConocoPhillips (COP) with a $95.76 billion market cap. COP is one of multiple Energy stocks on this list as well. Of the top 20 performers, Energy sector names dominate the list with 8 members.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-SPX-1.png))**

> Pivoting to the other end of the spectrum, Las Vegas Sands (LVS) is down the most this year having been cut by 36.18%. IPG Photonics (IPGP), Lamb Weston Holdings (LW), Viatris (VTRS), MarketAxess (MKTX), and Global Payments (GPN) also have fallen by at least 25%. Once again, there is only one member of this list with a market cap above $100 billion: Qualcomm (QCOM). One other interesting factor to note of the worst performers is there are several stocks that were at some point plays on pandemic trends, whether those be reopening or stay at home. For example, in addition to LVS, another gaming/reopening name, Wynn Resorts (WYNN), ranks as the eighth-worst performer YTD. Additionally, strong performers during the onset of the pandemic like Clorox (CLX), Activision Blizzard (ATVI), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) are all down double digits this year.

> # Intraday Commodity Spikes

> Since the late spring, both silver and gold have been in steady downtrends spending much of that time below their 50-DMAs. Those downtrends remain in place, but both metals did find a short-term bottom on September 29th. While they have been rallying in the past week and a half, today each one has stalled out. From the early morning leading up to the Nonfarm Payrolls report, precious metals ramped higher with a surge immediately following the weaker than expected report. Only a couple hours after the release, gold and silver had erased a large portion of their earlier gains. In fact, silver is now 2.15% below its intraday high and gold is 1.36% below its high. For gold, in particular, that intraday reversal also marked a rejection of its 50-DMA which it‚Äîas well as silver‚Äîhas struggled to stay above for most of the past several months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-GC-SI.png))**

> Crude oil is yet another commodity that is currently down off of its intraday highs, and like gold, the reversal came at a pretty interesting level. At its high Friday morning, front-month WTI futures rose above $80 for the first time since November 2014.

> # The Job Market Continues To Frustrate In September

> The September payroll report likely created more questions than it answered.

> The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its September employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added a disappointing 194,000 jobs during the month, falling well short of Bloomberg-surveyed economists‚Äô median forecast for a gain of 500,000. This comes on the heels of a lukewarm August report, which did receive an upward revision of 131,000. Somewhat contradictory, the unemployment rate fell more than forecast to 4.8% in September, beating expectations, though that was paired with a reduced labor force participation rate of 61.6% when expectations called for an increase.

> ‚ÄúThe observation window for this report likely came too soon for positive catalysts to really gain traction,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúLeisure and hospitality jobs, a proxy for economic reopening, were only marginally higher. We take this to mean Delta‚Äôs waning impact will likely be more evident in October‚Äôs report where we expect to see reopening momentum reassert itself.‚Äù

> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, in-person segments of the labor market such as leisure and hospitality jobs grew steadily during the first half of the year when COVID-19 remained under relative control. However, the latest flare-up has dampened that trend. We expect to see renewed growth in this sector as the delta variant continues to abate.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.8.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> As mentioned, definitive takeaways from this report are difficult to come by due to the offsetting nature of the report. On the one hand, headline numbers came in very weak, but private payrolls, as well as manufacturing payrolls, fared better. The unemployment rate experienced a significant drop, but interpreting that number becomes muddied when considering the fact that we are already experiencing a significant worker shortage and the participation rate is declining, not increasing, as we would hope to see in a true recovery.

> What is more, because the observation window for the report cuts off mid-month, we cannot yet draw conclusions about the impact of school reopening and the lapsing of enhanced unemployment benefits‚Äîhotly debated crosscurrents‚Äîplus the aforementioned waning delta impact. Regarding the inflation debate‚Äîaverage hourly earnings rose 0.6% month over month and 4.6% year over year. And while wages are undeniably growing and helping to fuel inflation, the data are not mix-adjusted and therefore are inflated due to the suppressed growth in the in-person, lower-wage segment of the labor market.

> The biggest question, though, is what this means for the Federal Reserve‚Äôs (Fed) asset tapering plans. The market had all but expected the Fed to announce a tapering timeline at its next meeting coming into this report, with the caveat that Fed Chair Jerome Powell needed only to see a ‚Äúreasonably good‚Äù job report first. Whether September‚Äôs surprise report has cleared that low bar or not now becomes an open question, one which the market had all but dismissed as a formality previously.

> Indeed, in the aftermath of the report‚Äôs release Treasury markets immediately began pricing in a possible delay to any taper, and equity markets gyrated between positive and negative territory as they struggled to process whether bad news should actually be considered good news in this context. We will have to see in the coming weeks whether this report will be substantial enough to bring on the much-anticipated taper announcement, but one thing is for sure‚Äîthere are no gimmies in this labor market recovery.

> # Columbus Day Performance

> Columbus Day is an interesting trading day for financial markets as it is one of the few trading days of the year when the equity market is open, but the bond market is closed. This may lead investors to think that equity markets should perform positively, as investors do not have credit markets to allocate capital to on that specific day. However, looking at the S&P 500's historical performance on Columbus Day over the last 25 years doesn't necessarily show a real positive bias. Columbus Day tends to act just like any other trading day. Over the last 25 years, median performance on Columbus Day has been a gain of 10 basis points (bps) with positive returns 55.6% of the time. While that's slightly higher than the median one-day gain of 7 bps for all trading days over the last 25 years, the difference isn't significant. That's not to say that Columbus Day hasn't seen some outliers, though. Who can forget in 2008, during the middle of the Financial Crisis, when the S&P 500 rallied more than 11% on Columbus Day!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Day-of.png))**

> For the week of Columbus Day, the S&P 500's median gain has been 0.31% with positive returns 63% of the time which also isn't extraordinary relative to average weekly returns for the S&P 500 over the last 25 years. The worst Columbus Day weeks were in 1999 (-6.63%) and 2018 (-4.10%) while the best were in 1998 (+7.32%), 2002 (5.87%), and 2011 (+5.98%). Interestingly enough, in 2008, even after rallying over 11% on Columbus Day, the S&P 500 finished the week up just 4.60% as it erased more than half of its gains from the holiday session.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Week-of.png))**

> The table below lists the S&P 500's performance leading up to and after Columbus Day for each of the last 25 years. With a decline of over 2.5% since the start of September, this year ranks as the weakest performance for the equity market since 2014.

> # The Most Important Chart In The World

> And just like that, the calendar turned to October and volatility picked up in a big way, with three consecutive 1% moves for the S&P 500 Index to start the month. As we noted in our October preview, this month gets a bad rap for being a bearish month (it isn‚Äôt), but it absolutely owns the title as the most volatile month.

> t took nearly a full year, but the S&P 500 finally had its first 5% pullback of 2021, thus ending hopes of 2021 joining 1954, 1958, 1964, 1993, 1995, and 2017 as the only years to go a full calendar year without a 5% move lower.

> ‚ÄúVolatility is the price of admission,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúSure, we‚Äôd all prefer stocks go straight up forever, but that isn‚Äôt reality. Investors must learn to embrace and accept the eventual scares and bouts of volatility that are common even in the strongest bull markets.‚Äù

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, stocks experience a 14.2% peak-to-trough pullback on average during the year, putting the recent 5% pullback in perspective. In fact, 21 out of the past 41 years saw at least a 10% correction. Incredibly, 12 of those years finished in the green and those 12 years gained an average of 17.0%. Who could forget last year‚Äôs 34% bear market and move back to up 16% by the end of the year? In other words, big pullbacks can happen even in years that see outsized gains, which is why this chart is so important for investors.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> The last new all-time high for the S&P 500 was on September 2, but as of the end of September there were still 54 new all-time highs in 2021, the second most ever with one quarter to go. The good news? Previous years that saw a lot new highs the first three quarters usually had strong performance the final quarter.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Taking things a step further, this year the S&P 500 produced one of its best ever year-to-date gains through September, up 14.7% with a quarter to go. It turns out that good starts to a year tend to resolve higher. In fact, 9 of the past 10 years the S&P 500 was up at least 12.5% with a quarter to go there were further gains in the fourth quarter. As you can see below, the returns are greatly skewed due to 1987, but the median return in the final quarter of the year is an impressive 5.2% (versus the average fourth quarter return of 4.0%).

> # Performance Through Q3 And its Impact on Q4 Performance

> Every year, the makeup and number of sectors that outperform the S&P 500 changes. This year, four sectors (Energy, Financials, Real Estate, and Communication Services) outperformed the S&P 500 through the end of Q3, while last year it was only three sectors that outperformed in the first three quarters of the year (Technology, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services).

> As we all know, past performance does not indicate future performance, and in looking at sectors that have outperformed the S&P 500 in the first three quarters of prior years compared to how they performed in Q4, the same holds true. The table below lists the number of sectors that outperformed and underperformed the S&P 500 in the first three quarters of each year since 2000 and then shows their median performance during Q4 of the same year. Looking at a summary of the annual results, it's almost a coinflip as to whether or not the leading sectors in the first three quarters of a given year will continue to outperform in Q4. On average, the sectors that outperform YTD through 9/30 have averaged a Q4 gain of 3.58% (median: +6.40%) with positive returns 76% of the time. Sectors that lag the S&P 500 in the first three quarters of the year average a rest of year gain of 3.67% (median: 5.95%) with gains 71% of the time. While the term 'strength begets strength' has historically been applicable to the broader market, at the sector level, buying the YTD winners (or losers) ahead of Q4 in expectation of continued momentum to close out the year (or a mean reversion bounce) hasn't offered any material outperformance.

> # Typical October Trading: Volatile Start Sets Up Rally through Month‚Äôs End

> Over the last twenty-one years, the full month of October has been a solid month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have all recorded gains ranging from 0.6% by Russell 2000 to 1.9% by NASDAQ. But these gains have come with volatile trading, most notably during the early days of the month. October has opened softly with mild gains on its first trading day by DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000. On the second day, all five indexes have been weak followed by a rebound on the third trading day before additional weakness pulls the market lower through the seventh trading day. At which point, the market has historically found support and began to rally through mid-month and beyond.

*****

> # 1. Wall Street looks higher after Monday‚Äôs tech decline

> * U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open Tuesday as tech stocks bounced, one day after the Nasdaq sank more than 2.1%. Monday‚Äôs session was marked by rotation out of tech names as bond yields remained elevated. The S&P 500 on Monday fell 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 323 points, or nearly 1%.
> * PepsiCo on Tuesday raised its full-year forecast after its quarterly earnings and revenue topped analysts‚Äô expectations. The company‚Äôs shares were up nearly 1% in the premarket.
> * Johnson & Johnson said Tuesday it has submitted data to the FDA for emergency use authorization of a booster shot of its Covid vaccine for all adults. J&J shares rose modestly.
> * Volatility that accompanied September‚Äôs market decline continued in October, with the first two trading days of the new month up big and then down big. The Nasdaq, as of Monday‚Äôs close, was almost 7.3% away from its latest record close Sept. 7, inching nearer to a correction. The S&P 500 was 5.2% from its Sept. 2 record high.

> # 2. U.S. faces recession if Congress doesn‚Äôt act on debt limit , Yellen says

> * Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC on Tuesday she believes the economy would fall into a recession if Congress fails to address the borrowing limit before an unprecedented default on the U.S. debt. ‚ÄúI do regard Oct. 18 as a deadline. It would be catastrophic to not pay the government‚Äôs bills, for us to be in a position where we lacked the resources to pay the government‚Äôs bills,‚Äù Yellen said on ‚ÄúSquawk Box.‚Äù On Monday, President Joe Biden urged Republican senators to ‚Äúget out of the way‚Äù on the debt ceiling. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said Democrats should use their majorities on Capitol Hill to act without GOP votes.

> # 3. Oil prices rose to around 7-year highs after OPEC, allies moves

> * U.S. oil prices, as measured by West Texas Intermediate crude, rose modestly Tuesday morning to around seven-year highs near $78 per barrel. WTI jumped roughly 2.3% on Monday as international oil producers decided to keep a cap on supplies. Despite pressure from the U.S. to ramp up output, OPEC and its allies were concerned that a fourth global wave of Covid infections could slow a demand recovery, a source told Reuters just before Monday‚Äôs vote. U.S. oil prices have surged more than 60% in 2021, bringing major energy companies along for the ride. Exxon has gained nearly 50% this year.

> # 4. Facebook whistleblower to testify; platform outage fixed

> * Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen is set to testify at Tuesday‚Äôs hearing of the Senate Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection. After recent reports in The Wall Street Journal based on documents she leaked raised a public outcry, Haugen revealed her identity in an interview on the CBS program ‚Äú60 Minutes,‚Äù which aired Sunday night. She insisted that ‚ÄúFacebook, over and over again, has shown it chooses profit over safety.‚Äù Shares of Facebook rose 1% in Tuesday‚Äôs premarket after closing down almost 5% in their worst session in nearly a year.

> * Facebook and its Instagram and WhatsApp services are back online after a massive global outage. Facebook said late Monday that ‚Äúthe root cause of this outage was a faulty configuration change.‚Äù The roughly six-hour incident marked the longest stretch of downtime for the social media company since 2008, when a bug knocked the site offline for about a day, affecting around 80 million users. The company‚Äôs platforms currently have billions users.

> # 5. Tesla must pay ex-worker $137 million over hostile workplace, racism

> * A San Francisco federal court decided that Tesla must pay a former contract worker, Owen Diaz, around $137 million after he endured racist abuse working for the company, his attorneys told CNBC. The jury awarded more than attorneys had asked for their client, including $130 million in punitive damages and $6.9 million for emotional distress. Diaz told the court that colleagues used epithets to denigrate him and other Black workers, telling him to ‚Äúgo back to Africa‚Äù and leaving racist graffiti in the restrooms and a racist drawing in his workspace. Diaz‚Äôs lawyers said the case was only able to move forward because their client had not signed one of Tesla‚Äôs mandatory arbitration agreements.

pzxp4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pzxp4d/wejo_and_autonomo_is_not_blackberry_ivy/,WEJO and Autonomo is NOT Blackberry Ivy Competition,93,18,2021-10-02 23:49:49,"What is [Blackbbery IVY](https://youtu.be/fwDnUNENSoY) (Intelligent Data Platform) works one every vehicle and every platform(in vehicle and cloud)

Many are asking if GM is using WEJO([GPS data platform](https://www.wejo.com/)) for its ULTIFI platform ([software platform](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/general-motors-new-software-platform-ultifi-is-coming-to-vehicles-starting-in-2023/) ) instead of Blackberry Ivy ([intelligent vehicle data platform](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws))

The clear and straight forward answer is NO! WEJO and AUTONOMO ([here](https://otonomo.io/)) only provide GPS type and location data. They both LICENSE data from OEM and sell it to whoever wants to use. This data is NOT processed in cars using machine learning models or in cloud learning models.  the ULTIFI platfrom is bigger than just GPS coordinate data...the GM ULTIFI platform needs data from all 300+ sensors in car. 

[Blackberry Ivy](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-ivy-to-provide-secure-vehicle-based-payments) is a pipeline that sucks in data from over 300 sensors in each car. It then processes it right on the edge (in car chips) and then creates a AI model to use in real time by car APPS and then it also uploads that model in the cloud for other app developers to use. All this data is owned by OEM and they can decide who to give it. Blackberry ivy is NOT just GPS but camera videos to seat sensors to wiper sensors to accelerator sensors to gas sensors to battery sensors to turn signals etc!!! it's mother of all sensors processing platforms. 

The software platform that GM launched (ULTIFI) is coming out in 2023 models the same time Blackberry IVY is coming out. GM is using Blackberry IVY for the data pipeline and providing it to their own app developers and then eventually will open up to other outisders...just like apple store and android play store. 

Blackberry ivy can sit on BB QNX operating system, BB QNX Hypervisor, Linux, anywhere!!! GM is using LINUX for ULTIFI platform to blackberry IVY will sit in there processing thee data. The QNX is embedded in pretty much every car sensor's chips (AMD,Qualcomm, etc) so each sensor has the ability to process all this data in realtime and apply machine learning to it for insight. 

&#x200B;

So yes the final answer is GM ULTIFI software platform is using Blackberry Ivy!!!! This is bigger than anything...this is huge. First big customer of BB Ivy."

* This post is speculative in its entirety, only mentioning things and functionalities that the company has NOT disclosed in public. This post is to be considered speculative and is not financial advice. It is a [follow up on a previous post 7 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ps6ex5/asts_ast_spacemobile_dual_use_spoof_jam_proof_pnt/) ""Spoof and jam proof PNT"", to add some visuals and figures to that discussion. If you did read that one then the images and tables add information and you can skip the text.

**Phased arrays**  


* AST SpaceMobile plans to put the largest total phased array antenna area into Space of any constellation present or planned. I did this [lengthy in depth DD post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pvciwf/ast_spacemobile_the_black_swan_of_low_earth_orbit/) on this earlier. Phased arrays are from the onset a military technology. It is in 4 gen fighter aircraft radars, it is in AEGIS missile destroyers, it is in Starlink satellites and user antennas, it has flown on the Space Shuttle for radar imagery of the earth, it is in spy satellites of all major nations, it is in Israeli missile defense system Iron dome and in US ballistic missile radars, it tracks space debris, it is being used for weather forecast / research, it will also be approximately 331 square meters of it in each AST SpaceMobile satellite which will be used to communicate with cellphones. Making it the largest ever planned phased array in Space per satellite, as well as per constellation.  


&#x200B;

[Beamforming, a technique phased arrays use to maximize signal strength highly directive.](https://preview.redd.it/5abpye9z01q71.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb3ef09ebfade6d046f0dd89f0ba6d45a264c33a)

* By AST SpaceMobile constellation US market access application AST SpaceMobile constellation is capable of 47 dB gain in its beams on the cellular midband close to current GPS bands. This means 50,000 times stronger signal strength at the receiving end compared to using omnidirectional antenna. The AST beams are also narrow making comparably small terrestrial beam-cells increasing throughput per user in the telecommunications use case.

**Assured PNT, a more resilient type of GPS. A potential dual use for SpaceMobile constellation?**  


* The civilian society and military is increasingly dependent on Space based positioning systems. The legacy GPS system is based on satellites very far away. It is beeing upgraded but is still very vulnerable to Jamming and Spoofing. This is why Darpa and others are looking for alternatives. Latency and signal loss is big with higher orbits. Image below shows a GEO satellite. GPS is MEO an intermediate altitude but it illustrates well the case.  


[DARPA slide showing the advantage of LEO over legacy higher altitude MEO \/ GEO systems. And use cases of LEO constellations that is in Darpa focus. OPIR being the only mission a software defined phased array would not be able to execute.](https://preview.redd.it/ony7e9get0q71.png?width=1408&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad15fd86ecb5c48459fc9acd50c1ce0ef193249)

* The 5g standard that AST SpaceMobile constellation will use incorporates from release 16 and onwards 5g positioning as part of its functionality. It incorporates a multitude of positioning techniques, such as angle of arrival (multiangulation) and uplink (UL), downlink (DL) and roundtrip (RTT) time measurements (multialteration). Together with 4x4 beamforming (also incorporated in the latest release 16 5g standard) this makes for an even higher signal strength (jamming proof) at ground level and the multitude of measurement methods, along with the correction message carrying capability of 5g, allows for more precise positioning, than just legacy GPS.

 

[Multialtertion \(where the ping time spheres intersect\) and Multiangulation \(where the beam angles intersect\). Are methods of positioning in 5g standards rolling out now. 3GPP also, from relesase 16 as in chip Qualcomm x65, started adapting regular cellphones to connect to satellites.](https://preview.redd.it/rh3qbjl7v0q71.jpg?width=413&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aec83fee97302674d17fe7fc2ebf3f521ba037e9)

* The civilian use case of 5g positioning, supported by Space constellation is apparent. It will bring with it a revolution for remotely piloted surface and air vehicles. Further supported by low latency of the AST SpaceMobile network enough to close remote pilot - drone loop with high resolution sensor feedback that is resilient enough to withstand jamming, spoofing and other interference. Essential to insure safety if you use positioning for kinetic objects such as vehicles. There is [a research paper on fused LEO GNSS](https://rnl.ae.utexas.edu/images/stories/files/papers/iannucci2020fused.pdf) that illustrates signal strength, author also [has a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGlSTo8cDuA):  


[Table from paper linked above showing Anti-jam advantage of fused LEO GNSS, when using beamforming \(right column\). Note dm level precision and +56 dB vs traditional GPS.  Paper also describes only 1&#37; of a constellations capacity required to solve the dual PNT \(positioning Navigation and Timing\) \/ GNSS \(Global Navigation Satellite System\) mission.](https://preview.redd.it/l66i2ly4x0q71.png?width=344&format=png&auto=webp&s=e88e4dfc56bb263da9f0dfa91cb291f0de8990f1)

* How much more powerful / jam resistant would  this type of positioning be versus legacy GPS? WE see the answer of +56 dB from the table above that equals + 3.98e+5 power increase. dB is log scale, so it is approximately 400,000 times more powerful, or put otherwise 400,000 times harder to jam 400,000 x more secure. The US just spent 10Bn  USD+ to increase the legacy GPS system signal strength by 10 x. That is more than the entire SpaceMobile constellation will cost, for comparison.  


**Other use case than civilian for a 400,000 times more jam resistant positioning.**  


[US military created GPS to get a precision strike edge of its multi trillion dollar weaponry. Fused LEO GNSS \/ assured PNT, using beam forming can give that advantage back punching through any jamming or spoofing in a contested environment. Re-establishing the battlefield dominance of the USA. Likewise an array of this sort would potentially be able to jam and spoof opponent systems.](https://preview.redd.it/ig6h4dv5y0q71.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=4931b4e5f623416c56dc8d194b87bee58406928c)

**There are some hints that AST SpaceMobile will not only incorporate the civilian 5g positioning, but also opt for a dual / alternative use of the constellation. These are:**    
A) The now supposedly dormant subsidiary AST & defense, which by its existence shows intent.  
B) The OmniSpace Lockheed-Martin attempts at doing this showing feasibility.   
C) The fact AST has disclosed their test satellite Bluewalker 3 having an alternative/dual mission that pays for the entire satellite. Paid for by undisclosed other entity.   
D) The fact that DARPA Blackjack program has a dozen contracts with LEO companies, some of which are undisclosed and one of their three objectives is LEO positioning piggy-back civilian LEO constellations or flying with them for a hybrid constellation.  
E) The extra space station application by AST Midland Texas general manager to mount an device that receives GPS signals outdoors and retransmits them indoors at the Midland facility. F) The fact that no other constellation or array deploy technique publicly known kan achieve these type of signal strength in suitable GPS bands (bands that punch through buildings and foliage) at ground levels i.e there are alternative LEO constellations, but they are not as promising. And multiple systems build redundancy and further increase accuracy, no need to just launch a single system here.

F) A LEO positioning patent filed by AST CEO, Abel Avellan.

This post will just cover a single use case  not presented elsewhere. So the post does NOT provide a comprehensive analysis of the company. It has just a brief overview of the concept of the main company, does not mention the subsidiary, and focuses on the *unconfirmed* use case captioned. 

*TL/DR: They‚Äôre building the skynet, to make your GPS rigid.

The AST SpaceMobile Network 

* AST SpaceMobile space segment is planned to consist of 336 satellites by 2028 and the initial application is for 243 satellites operating in sixteen orbital planes in low earth orbit on altitudes between 725 and 740 km.

* Phased deployment 
-First 18 (+2 spares) covering 49 equatorial countries. This part is financed.
-Then expanding north to cover Europe and continental USA, and south to cover all of Africa and South America with the global constellation of 68 satellites. 
-Later (early 2024) Increasing to 110 for MIMO functionality. MIMO means a Phone can talk to several sats. 4x4 MIMO is in chip Qualcomm x65 manufactured by AST partner Samsung. (In androids from early 2022). This is 3GPP release 16 5g standard.
-Finally adding more satellites - 336 total - for more capacity and increased robustness producing 6 satellites per month.

* The satellite. Bluebird type satellites are approx 20x17.8 meters wide and flat. Flying edge first. Capable of 2800 beams in cellular fronthaul bands using sandwiched solar panel/ phased array (electronically steered antenna) elements that is ~ 330 square meters on each satellite. Each of these beams produce a beam-cell on earth effectively replacing a cell tower, varying in diameter depending on bandwidth. The satellite will also be capable of several Q/V backhaul beams. Bluebirds use multiple magnetorquers and hall effect (ion) thrusters for redundant manouverability.

The worlds *largest* constellation.

*Antenna real estate: If launched as planned (they can launch up to 18 satellites on a Space-x Falcon heavy type vehicle) the 336 satellites will have (336x330) a total of 110,880 square meters of phased arrays deployed in space by 2028. AST SpaceMobile total array will be the size of Ellis Island. For ref Starlink sats has 1.7 sqm phased array antenna each. Starlink plans to launch the most *numerous* constellation 12,000 sats by mid 2020s or 20,400 sqm of phased array antenna. AST planned 5x that in size. 

* Ground segment is built and maintained mostly by partner companies American Tower and Vodafone group, it includes terrestrial switches that has multiple gateways with motor steered higly directive ~5 meter long yagi type Q and V band Very high throughput antennas. Which connects the backhaul from satellite to partner networks using internet and legacy cellular networks. They slice capacity using Altiostar/Rakuten AI-software virtualising the entire network incl. handsets to optimize latency and throughput. 

Previously advertised functionality: Coms.

*The company has advertised 2g,3g,4g,5g and IoT functionality. Notably the DSS functionality of 3GPP rel 15-16 makes 4g LTE and 5g possible in the same cells on the same bands. It is bent pipe architecture so forward compatible with 6g. This will eventually be supplied globally and available in most countries from standard cellphones through B2B agreements with terrestrial mobile network operators, MNO on their spectrum. Agreements are signed with MNOs covering 1.5 Bn subscribers/customers.

Not previously advertised functionality: Spoof and jam proof PNT.

* GPS Background: The GPS system was developed to give the US military an edge. It is a MEO system. 31 satellites orbit the earth twice a day. 20,200 km up. 28 times the altitude of AST SpaceMobile constellation. As signal strength decrease with the square of the distance this factor explains a difference of 28^2 = 784 times weaker signal than SpaceMobile constellation. Jamming and spoofing of this weak signal is now in the skill set of US adversaries, while they have launched PNT constellations of their own. The proliferation of GNSS/spoofing and jamming capabilities is blunting the US edge. GPS is not only a deterrant that has deteriorated. Meanwhile the civil society and the military has become increasingly dependent on GPS type PNT, making it very vulnerable to spoofing and jamming. What was a strength is now a weakness.

* Beamforming and encrypted PNT. Beamforming is a technique by which the signal strength is increased in a certain direction. This can be electronically steered without changing nadir of the satellite.
So by the extreme beamforming (0.75 degree beams) capability of AST SpaceMobile satellites the difference in signal strength will be much higher than the 784 times just explained by shorter distance. Making AST-PNT jam resistant. Add to this the 5g high bandwidth information carrying and encryption capability of the AST-signals and AST-PNT becomes spoof-resistant.

* Five signs that hardened PNT is pursued by AST:

1). A LEO PNT patent by the CEO:  https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/21/02/c4/4ae76f6181b025/WO2021163040A1.pdf

2). An application to FCC filed by general manager of AST Midland Texas facility for a terrestrial Space station that includes an specialised restricted device to receive GPS signals outdoors and retransmit them indoors.

3). 3GPP release 16 5g standard, which will be inside phones from early 2022, includes this [*AST will thus provide PNT as it is now part of 5g*]. A range of positioning methods, are used: DL-based positioning is supported by a new reference signal called the positioning reference signal (PRS), UL-based positioning is based on release 15 sounding reference signals (SRSs) with release 16 extensions, time is used in round-trip time (RTT) based positioning schemes. All that needs to function well everywhere is AST SpaceMobile global constellation MIMO to triangulate.

4). The low cost. The cost in terms of used beams and bandwidths has been estimated in an academic paper on fused LEO GNSS. It uses only a small fraction (less than 1%) of the constellation capacity. Video of author explaining it: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cGlSTo8cDuA the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12334

5) Accuracy, this will increase (see paper above) to cm level facilitating new use cases like precision farming and precision drone control expanding customer base v/s legacy GPS.

Valuation 

*Hardened PNT restores the edge of trillion dollar weapon systems while making the civilian society resilient to foreign powers.
That is hard to value. The proper way imo is the alternative cost of launching a dedicated constellation for just this purpose v/s using a fraction of AST capacity to accomplish it. Needless to say the SpaceMobile dual use constellation would provide more satellites and thus greater redundancy and precision compared to a dedicated constellation. But half the cost  of dedicated constellation is a fair price.

*The ground control system of GPS III costs in excess of 4 billion USD. The GPS III satellites cost .5 Bn each initially with .2 Bn projected for the last. 

*The estimated cost of the GPS III space segment through the first eight satellites was $4.4 billion. These use M-code to counter spoofing and somewhat increased signal strength to decrease effect of jamming. There are 31 sats. Using the lower number we get a $6.2 Bn space segment cost. 

*The above sums to a total cost exceeding $10Bn of the GPS III system. The capability of an future AST SpaceMobile constellation of doing this better should be at least half that cost $5Bn ~ $27 per share.

*ASTS market cap today is ~$2.1 Bn or $11.56 per share. 

Conclusion

*The valuation above is indicating an 2x upside on accomplishing dual use PNT functionality, alone. 

*This PNT dual use, which follows more or less automatically from 3GPP release16 5g standard, seems not to be priced in at current levels.

Final note 

*No official or unofficial company source has mentioned plans for this PNT dual use case outlined above. It is all my own logic presented, based on open sources. The confirmed main use case - cellular connectivity - from a technological and regulatory perspective has been the main focus of my DD. To the extent that it will not fit in a single post. But my DD on the PNT potential is shallow enough to do so."

‚Äã‚Äã4 ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:

* Transition from wet to dry etching
* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production
* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process
* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams

**Technical Analysis**

Looking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.

**Conclusion**

The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM‚Äôs Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn‚Äôt pay out high dividends (\~1.56% annually) but does re-invest that money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden‚Äôs $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.

The IAA has been open for the last 4 days, but I hadn‚Äôt been able to properly experience the MicroVision booth until now. I didn‚Äôt want to distract Sumit Sharma, Dr. Luce, and the other 3 MVIS staff who attended from their B2B (business to business) goals. However, today was the first day that the general public were allowed to enter the conference halls, and Dave Allen from IR gave us the green light to go visit the booth.

When I arrived at the booth with /u/MusicMaleficent5870, Sumit and Dr. Luce were nowhere in sight. We nevertheless decided to go in and speak to the MVIS staff. I personally spoke with Jonathan C (who I believe is the Director of Digital Engineering, thx Linkedin stalking). Jonathan walked me through the booth while MM5870 kept the other two MVIS staff members occupied. I introduced myself as a moderator of the mvis reddit and handed him my gag card..

&#x200B;

[ gag business card ](https://preview.redd.it/2zfx6lvzukm71.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8d919fd1ec5803c6f78d7c5c186b60c299b19b9)

# Live Lidar Demo

An important note Jonathan mentioned was that two A-Samples were actively scanning the booth. One directly above the live demo screens (that sits on the *in*famous block of wood which I couldn‚Äôt see even at a relative far distance), and one directly across from that in the back right hand corner.

The point of having two Lidars actively scanning is to showcase MicroVision‚Äôs proprietary active scan lock architecture which allows the A-Sample to actively block out 99% of outside interference (as communicated to shareholders on multiple occasions in past earnings calls). As per past earnings calls the active scan lock architecture is based on proprietary technologies proven in their applications used in the Hololens 2.

In short, the Active Scan lock synchronizes the ‚Äúsend‚Äù and ‚Äúreceiving‚Äù side of the Gen 5 MEMS just as the Hololens 2 displays are sync‚Äôd for the left and right eyes to prevent ocular discomfort (Sumit used a word I didn't recognize to describe that if the left eye and right eye images dont line up you get discomfort. I don‚Äôt have education or background in this so could barely keep up). Each Lidar sensor is encoded its own laser signals and excludes interference even from similar identical units.

For example that if you were stuck in an intersection with 20 cars, each with their own set of short-range lidar (SRL), mid-range lidar (MRL), and long-range lidar (LRL). The IR light pollution and interference will overwhelm other sensors that do not have this feature that MicroVision owns IP for.

&#x200B;

[ The second A-Sample live scanning acting as \\""interference\\"" above the television which is showing the 1.8M Long Range Point Cloud. ](https://preview.redd.it/ien6mkf1vkm71.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8cb12842300f04b56ebe7c9fd7577c29351b7307)

It was explained to me that there is a filter on the live lidar demo. The filter removes the reflection of the floor for aesthetic reasons. They said that if they kept the floor in the final image, you would have been overwhelmed by extra data, but by removing them, the live stream data can be more easily interpreted. Additionally, there are indoor Class 1 EU regs that I believe are in play which made MVIS sandbag their sensor a bit (if anyone was noticing it isn‚Äôt as sharp). Sumit says once all testing and certification is done there shouldn‚Äôt be any issues seen specifically in the demo booth unit.

This is also a phenomenon you will notice in future Lidar demos, because the lidar sensor acts similar to the human eye does when it sees a mirage. There is a critical angle after which, the light seems to bounce to infinity. Therefore, the sensor will not return images of the road surface (due to it being a planar surface). All content which is 3 dimensional continues to be detected until the full range as advertised.

# Elvis has Entered the Booth

During the middle of conversation with Jonathan, I noticed Sumit and Dr Luce exiting from a meeting room behind the booth with an unidentified gentleman. They had obviously finished a meeting, and one of the helpers came out to return the A-Sample and the Gen 5 mems mirror back into the display (they were not there when we arrived).

Sumit walked over, I introduced myself as ‚ÄúJay‚Äù and he replied ‚ÄúJay, nice to finally meet you, I‚Äôve been waiting for you all day!‚Äù We arrived approximately 45 minutes before closing and I had been with Jonathan for approximately 15 minutes. Additionally, I had told Dave Allen I‚Äôd try to swing by later in the afternoon, so I expect Sumit knew we were coming to visit eventually.

Sumit then whisked /u/MusicMaleficent5870 and I away toward the live lidar demo to start our proper tour.

# The MicroVision A-Sample

Sumit asked us what our backgrounds were to get a grasp of our level of technical knowledge. Suffice it to say, we communicated that it was low lol. One of the biggest things Sumit wanted us to walk away with was the story he was trying to convey to investors. The specific story for investors to recognizing the true value of MicroVision‚Äôs IP. The other story he‚Äôs trying to convey is the inevitability for customers (from my interpretation of his explanation).

To give you an example, he spoke briefly about the Hololens 2 and Microsoft. Microsoft spent *years* trying to improve the display of the Hololens 2. It got to the point where they finally realized Microsoft could not achieve it alone (even with a group of ex-MVIS engineers on their engineer team ‚Äì this is my addition for color). Alex Kipman himself mentions this in one of his talks in Zurich/digital streams in 2020. Microsoft eventually had to approach MicroVision to get the job done because of MicroVision‚Äôs proprietary technology that they‚Äôve built in the past couple of decades. He also believes that **they would have never won that $22 Billion Dollar contract without them** (which I agree with. The Hololens 1 was head-to-head with Magic Leap which ate the dust after the Hololens 2 was released).

&#x200B;

[ Microsoft's \\""$22 Billion Dollar Contract\\"" ](https://preview.redd.it/5s1r48a5vkm71.jpg?width=934&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cdaec6c00acd3bc87406771b920045079ea5bb43)

This story of inevitability is what customers are starting to realize. If you want the best technology that solves your problems rather than creating further problems, you need to use MicroVision technology and IP (their family jewels). Their custom ASICs (which is available in a digital form) is one of the biggest advantages over competitors in the L2 and L2++ field like Tesla and Mobileye with their Camera only Neural Networks.

Sumit started to go down the rabbit hole into how Neural Networks work. He wouldn‚Äôt trust the safety of that technology with his family, and that we wouldn‚Äôt either if we read the disclaimers and fine print for cars who use these systems. This also aligns with Mobileye‚Äôs current plan in developing a secondary independent Radar + Lidar system to ensure there are true redundant safety systems for maximum passenger safety.

There is a joke Sumit likes to share from the Silicon Valley Episode ‚ÄúHot Dog, Not Hot Dog‚Äù which helped us understand where he was coming from about Neural Networks.

# The Family Jewels

Sumit believes that the ADAS market is going to go ‚Äúgangbusters‚Äù sooner rather than later. See the bidding war currently happening between Magna and Qualcomm over Veoneer (who IAA placed side by side in the conference with Veoneer squished in the middle).

MicroVision has a lot of key advantages with their proprietary custom ASICs. The way Sumit explained it to us was it comes down to basic math and physics. They can do things with edge computing faster and quicker than anyone else with their Family Jewels. **It comes from their custom OS that is built in their chips.** While Microvision is building their ADAS Lidar Sensors from an established foundation and decade‚Äôs worth of tech and IP, their friends Luminar are spending billions just to be able to do the same thing with no guarantee that they can do it better or quicker than how MVIS is doing it.

Lastly, one of the key praises that potential customers have been commenting on the A-Sample is how **slim in profile the A-Sample is** (Apologies for the photo, I should probably take it lower down).

I plan to publish an album of photos sometime this week which compares the other lidars on display with MVIS‚Äô A-Sample using the ‚Äúcassette of truth‚Äù which I have been photographing to give an idea of the size of all the Lidar sensors. From my observation, MVIS is best in class from a profile aspect, all other lidar sensors are much taller in comparison.

# The Lidar Product Suite

Sumit Sharma wants to generate more revenue. While the Hololens 2 currently does not produce enough volume for the time being,  **he believes that will change soon** with the new Lidar Product family.

Sumit also shared that they were getting a lot of requests for small NREs (non-recurring engineering) about, ‚Äúhey we already have a product for short-range Lidar for the time being, can you make something for mid-range only, or maybe long-range only?‚Äù.  There was enough interest that it made sense for MicroVision perspective to produce the A-Sample which would be identical to their Dynamic View Lidar (DVL) hardware wise, but with limited features the customer require now to help generate that revenue.

Their Dynamic View Lidar is meant to be their premium/flagship lidar offering. Sumit also touched on the use case of the 905nm lasers which have a standard and secure supply chain unlike the 1550nm lasers which are either custom made or non-standard supply chains utilizing exotic materials (which Velodyne does a great job of explaining in this article: [https://velodynelidar.com/blog/guide-to-lidar-wavelengths/](https://velodynelidar.com/blog/guide-to-lidar-wavelengths/)).

Not only do the lasers help MVIS scale, but with the launch of MicroVision‚Äôs fifth-generation MEMS to a 200-millimeter wafer silicon they control the whole process. They own their IP, and nobody else does. This gives them the ability to manufacture it the way they want. More control for MicroVision means more stability for customers.

# True Value

I was honestly surprised how in tune Sumit was to investors. He is also very aware of trader activity, but that is out of his hands. He‚Äôs here to get true value for MVIS long investors and the multiplier/upside is massive in his eyes.

I came away from the 30minute discussion in awe to be honest. There was so much content packed into that meeting, and Sumit was exuding nothing but confidence. If there are any German investors in Munich, make sure you go visit the booth, it‚Äôs an excellent opportunity to share in the excitement and bullishness Sumit is currently feeling.

GLTALs, it's 3:30am and i'm going to bed.

TLDR - I travelled from Vancouver to Munich to meet the CEO of MVIS and to see their new Lidar product to compete against the other companies. I am bullish."

***Q1-"" 5G can only go 1500 feet tops. So, any claims to be anything more than 4G is fake physics sentimentalization..."" by*** *u/*[*WilliamNyeTho*](https://www.reddit.com/user/WilliamNyeTho)

>**TLDR; The 1500 Feet figure was brought up by Google searchs smart answer and was pulled up from a Verizon post. Long story short, this doesn't apply to LEO satellite technology used by AST Spacemobile.**

A:   First, **5G is a standard that incorporates many different bands of spectrum, including cellular (600mhz - 3.5ghz), which has great distance and propagation characteristics,** and much higher millimeter band spectrum which has issues traveling far distances and penetrating objects.  **ASTS is planning to use its partner‚Äôs CELLULAR spectrum,** which can travel much further than millimeter band spectrum that is referred to by bears.

Second, Traditional communication satellites are geostationary and have been in orbit for more than 50 years. GEO satellites weigh more than 1000kg and operate 36,000 kilometers above the earth. These satellites remain in a fixed position relative to any position. Despite Earth‚Äôs orbit, this allows ground-based antennas the ability to point directly at the  satellite, in a fixed position.¬†

In contrast, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites(which ASTS is going to use) orbits between 200 and 2000 kilometers above Earth‚Äôs surface. ASTS is planning to have their satellites at 720Km using cellular spectrum primarily located between 600mhz - 2.2ghz weighing around 2000kg.

Unlike Geostationary Orbits (GEO), LEO satellites move rapidly(at an altitude of 500km, it can move at a speed of 7.6 km/s)  with respect to the Earth‚Äôs surface and have a small ground coverage. In particular, the ground coverage of a LEO satellite deployed **at 600 km** above the Earth‚Äôs surface and with a typical elevation angle of 30 degrees **is around 0.45% of the Earth‚Äôs surface.** Moreover, **due to the low altitude of deployment,** LEO satellites can communicate **with diverse types of ground terminals, such as dedicated ground stations (GSs), 5G gNBs**, ships and other vehicles, or Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This creates the need for a relatively dense constellation **to ensure that any ground terminal is always covered by at least one satellite.** Therefore, global commercial deployments such as ASTS usually consists of more than a hundred satellites to be able to have a full global coverage.

Now AST satellites each will have up to 2800 user beams and two or three gateway beams. Each user beam will be electrically steered through a large phased array antenna and will be capable of being pointed anywhere within the Field of View (‚ÄúFoV‚Äù) of 20 degrees elevation angle. Each satellite in the AST constellation will provide service up to 58 degrees away from boresight.

Each satellite may transmit all of its active user beams on the same frequency or different frequencies. Each active user beam will track a fixed cell on the ground within its FoV without steering the boresight of the planar phased array antenna. All of the active beams can be distributed flexibly  within the FoV.

The same cell on the ground can be illuminated by a single beam, by multiple beams from same satellite, or by multiple beams from different satellites with in the view of the cell to enhance the user experience. The beam-to-beam handover and the gateway handover are based on schedules and  use a ‚Äúbreak -then- make ‚Äù approach.

# How Apples rumor plays into this? (VERY BULLISH)

IPhone 13 is rumored to contain a chip with increased satellite connectivity capabilities, Qualcomm Snapdragon x60. In addition, There is a 3GPP release 16 chip that has been available to OEM(original equipment manufacturer) phone makers since the beginning of this year and it will be in phones starting early 2022. This chip is designed by Qualcomm and it is called x65. Moreover, it is manufactured by AST SpaceMobile's partner Samsung. This chip is the worlds first chip to fully implement 3GPP release 16.

Why is it important?

It will feature enhanced beamhandling capabilities, 4x4 MIMO, and an increased satellite connectivity.

**That is very bullish because it shows that Cell phone makers are already getting ready to connect even better to AST SpaceMobile constellation.**

***Q2- ""No fuckin way they pull that off with a 10m2 sat with any sizeable number of users..."" by***  *u/*[*WilliamNyeTho*](https://www.reddit.com/user/WilliamNyeTho)

>**TLDR; AST SpaceMobile is planning to have enormous satellites with a cross section of 450m2.**

The large LEO concepts are mainly planning to use Ka band for Backhaul. These frequencies **enable higher data rates,** smaller antennas, narrower beams, and greater security. Moreover, improved spectral efficiency and spectrum-reuse rates can also **increase the amount of data a system delivers.**

In addition to better use of spectrum, advances in active antennas and processing have **raised throughput per individual satellite, increasing constellation capacity.** Consider a few changes:

* A satellite can now deploy more spot beams, and greater power can be delivered through each beam.
* Intersatellite links (ISLs) improve connectivity and confer particular benefits to large constellations, including improved throughput and management.
* Improved data-compression methods reduce bandwidth requirements without reducing the quality of communications.

So, a 10 Ka-band steerable antenna can provide up to 1.6 Gbps of symmetrical data connectivity. In addition, two high-performance antennas, can provide up to 5.2 Gbps of symmetrical data connectivity. This is only for the backhaul between the satellites and terrestrial stations. ASTS btw is planning to use V bands for backhaul, which have less traffic on them vs. Ka.

Now for the Fronthaul ASTS will use cellular spectrum (600mhz - 2.2ghz). These frequencies are used today by cellular phones. These frequencies are the best at covering long distances and can propagate through rain, walls, trees, etc .

Now the numbers for ASTS aren't out, but we can talk about Starlinks numbers since it uses LEO satellites too which is essentially the same technology. Starlink will be able to support 485,000 simultaneous users at 100Mbit/s across the entire US, according to new estimates. Additionally, Elon Musk tweeted on 26 of June ""Starlink simultaneously active users just exceeded the strategically important threshold of 69,420 last night!"". The technology works and the numbers are impressive.

***Q3- ""What kind of lag is there to get this data from low earth orbit? Streaming is one thing, gaming is another. I'm curious what the latency would be."" by u/***[*mbr4life1*](https://www.reddit.com/user/mbr4life1/)

>**TLDR; LEO satellites have a low latency 25-35ms.**

This question of latency is key. Some geostationary satellites at 35,786 km already provide broadband services but their transmissions take about 500-700 milliseconds (ms) to travel up and another 500-700 milliseconds to travel down. This time-lag is why users suffer the infuriating time delay during a conversation between the broadcast studio and an outside broadcast unit. If the OB (Outside broadcasting) is more than one satellite ‚Äòhop‚Äô away, then the delay is multiplied.

Now on the other hand, A low Earth-orbiting satellite(What ASTS is using), between 200 and 2000 km, would manage these links in **about 25-35 ms**, a true fraction of existing satellite links and quite comparable to existing cables or fibre networks!

***Q4- ""Starlink will be a direct competitor by 2025"" by u/***[***MaximumRecording1170***](https://www.reddit.com/user/MaximumRecording1170/)

>**TLDR; Short answer is no.**

*Great answer by*  u/[CatSE---ApeX---](https://www.reddit.com/user/CatSE---ApeX---/) :

Yes, AST will be a fierce competitor  to Starlink as AST can do fixed cellular broadband at much lower customer acquisition cost. So they‚Äôll be the prefered choice in  developing world and for low traffic applications in developed world.

But, no, Starlink will not compete with AST in AST core market. Which is  connecting directly to unmodified cellular phones.  This is because Starlink uses high band spectrum that has poor distance and propagation characteristics, which requires users to 1) buy a large dish antenna that is fixed in position and 2) have a clear line of sight to the satellite.

\*\*\*Q5- ""\*\*\****How can phone signals reach the satellite given the strength of a regular handset?, How much is it affected by the weather?"" by u/***[XinjDK](https://www.reddit.com/user/XinjDK/)

*Great answer by*  u/[CatSE---ApeX---](https://www.reddit.com/user/CatSE---ApeX---/) :

* Gainforming. It is a bit like beamforming but it optimizes the gain of the electronically steered antenna.
* the cellular bands used for fronthaul (phone-satellite) are not affected by weather. The v-band used for backhaul (satellite to terrestrial ground  station / switch hooked up with terrestrial cellular network) is susceptible to rain attenuation. This is solved by having powerful antennas in both ends to overcome that attenuation. (If need be, several  alternative terrestrial sites within the FoV of satellite could be  used. To circumvent very heavy rainfalls. No such tweak has been  communicated by company though.)

***Q6- A very frequent question, Why is this ticker allowed on WSB? Doesn't have a small market cap? u/***[Oxianas](https://www.reddit.com/user/Oxianas/) u/[Momoselfie](https://www.reddit.com/user/Momoselfie/)

WSB doesn't tolerate BS aka SPACS, Crypt0, and Market caps <1.5 Billion. At the time of my first post, the market cap of ASTS was 1.7 Billion.

Some brokers, such as TD Ameritrade, brings up only Class A share Data. That's why some people get confused with the market cap.

The A,B, and C class shares were worth 1.7 Billion at the time of my first post.

***Q7- Is there a partnership between SpaceX and AST Spacemobile? by u/***[***carsonthecarsinogen***](https://www.reddit.com/user/carsonthecarsinogen/)

BlueWalker 3(ASTS Satellite) is expected to launch aboard a SpaceX mission from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in March 2022. The spacecraft has an aperture of 693  square feet and is designed to communicate directly with cell phones via 3GPP standard frequencies.

***Q8- How could anyone possibly know that? 6G is still in development. by u/*** [The\_Super\_Capitalist](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Super_Capitalist/)

AST SpaceMobile Leo Satellites don't do onboard processing. They‚Äôre bent pipe architecture so they‚Äôre forward compatible with any protocols being carried on cellular spectrum.  As long as future protocols incorporate cellular spectrum, any future 6G, 7G, etc can be supported.

***Q9- Get ready to get diluted to hell when VC gets called back in after the stock gets pumped. by u/***[The\_Super\_Capitalist](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Super_Capitalist/)

*answer by*  u/[CatSE---ApeX---](https://www.reddit.com/user/CatSE---ApeX---/) with edits :

The owner/partners (Cisneros, American Tower, Vodafone, Samsung, and Rakuten) will provide non-dillutive funding options once equatorial satellites are deployed (and that  one is fully funded).

The risk of  public offerings/dilllution risk should not be exaggerated. If equatorial constellation succeeds it will open up huge positive cashflows. And to aquire non-dillutive bridging financing from owners and/or banks to expand the constellation quicker will most likely be no problem at that point.

Finally, the company can cash settle its warrants once the stock price trades above $18 for 20/30 trading days.  This would bring in $11.50 x 17.6M public/private warrants = $202 million in capital.

***Q10- ""Pump  & dump warning on this company guys. They just hyping a technology  that doesn't exist yet, no heavy institutions supporting them and mostly  owned by private stakeholders. If you really want to YOLO just short it  before it drops."" by***  [Same-Seaworthiness20](https://www.reddit.com/user/Same-Seaworthiness20/)

15 days later, and it didn't dump. For me, this shows that the holders are true believers and not just pumpers.

No institutional support? Now this is straight up BS! Rakuten(Big japanese telecom), ATT, Vodafone, and American Towers all have a position in it. Go to Fintel to see all the institutional investors. According to Fintel, 29% is held by institutional investors. In addition, These investors are well versed in the 5G market and I don‚Äôt think that they would‚Äôve invested if they didn‚Äôt see a proof of concept.

The sentiment has been changed to bullish this week, a GREAT TIME TO BUY.",83,73,2021-08-27 08:59:16," Most great semi stocks are already priced in or overvalued, and we smart experienced apes know that you never buy overvalued stocks because its potential gain is small and its potential loss is too big.

Therefore, we need to buy the stock that is undervalued but eventually goes up to meet its price target later because of its strong fundamentals and future growth (which is MU). And why do we need to pick semi stocks for this? Because Semiconductor business is one of the most potential and profitable business in the whole industry; we simply think that everything is turning to digital and AI systems, and all those devices, platforms, and servers need memory chips. Biden's infrastructure bills and his willingness to support semi industry are also tailwinds of semi stocks.

Ok, so why MU is the most undervalued stock among all semiconductors now?

Because it is ridiculously cheap! 7x forward price to earnings multiple now, and even though it actually have a slowdown in memory chip industry, it is still 10-12x forward earnings which is still ridiculously cheap compared to other semi stocks. (According to Quint Tatro, Joule Financial founder at CNBC).

MU's 52 week high is 96.96, and its current price is 72.77. It showed some high volatility and corrections after its ATH because it went up too fast in short time (52 week low is 43.67). The last large correction made MU's price down from 83 to 68.80 which was 17% down in 4 days. This correction happened because of Morgan Stanley's report that says 'winter is coming' for semis. However, all other institutions and investors, including Goldman Sachs, Bofa, Jim Cramer, think that MU is way undervalued, and its price is at the bottom now. Vanguard Group, Sanders Capital, and State Street, top 5 MU shareholders, added MU positions between August 6 to August 16 . Since many institutions and large investors start to buy MU back, its price went up from 68 to 77, and then it dropped to 73 today due to the red market and some sell offs.

Reasons why this is a great timing to buy MU now

1. The sentiment turned to bullish. It kept going up since it hit its bottom price 68, and yesterday, August 25th, it pumped from 73 to 77 in few minutes, closed at 74, and the current price is 72.77 now. Great buying point before it keeps pumping after this Jackson Hole meeting.
2. Too CHEAP compared to ALL other semis. Here is the picture.

[As you can see, MU is -23.64&#37; from 52 week High on August 25, it has a more discount today since it dropped to 72.77. Ok, then we might doubt about its fundamentals and its future growth. Don't worry, here is why most analysts and institutions think MU is super undervalued and it is time to buy now.](https://preview.redd.it/dlkwd2twtsj71.png?width=1522&format=png&auto=webp&s=320db86cfa01137884d5738472075d85b9f5bc78)

[Its FY1 is 12.13 which is already great, but its FY2 and 3 is 6.36 and 6.34 which is too great compared to others. So, it is a great time to buy it before all those number soar later.](https://preview.redd.it/4o837srxtsj71.png?width=1233&format=png&auto=webp&s=021afd568ab356ba677378e791f117c4bedef258)

Their EPS and Revenue growth are also great too (beating all estimates for over 2 years).

https://preview.redd.it/j65bzmrytsj71.png?width=1099&format=png&auto=webp&s=76f6143cca80476247088955c96ff2d31d03e2b6

3. Morgan Stanley, aka sneaky bitches, revealed a report 'winter is coming' or whatever, saying that DRAM memory chip price was already at the peak and it is going down now which will lead all DRAM company's profit to go down due to its historical data. However, most institutions and investors still believe that DRAM's demand is still too strong enough to cover that DRAM price drop, because all PCs, Servers, Laptops, smartphones, tablets, robots, cars, and anything that has automated computer system needs 'memory chip'. Semi industry has a bright future, and I think Morgan Stanley's report was just a manipulation in order to short the stock and buying it back at discounted price. This asshole bought SK hynix (2nd largest DRAM company) shares back after its correction in Korea. Its price was 120,000 Won before MS's report, and it dropped to 98,000 after its report and they started buying back from 100,000 now. I still strongly believe that this stock will keep going up before tapering. (I hope the Fed does not mention about tapering at Jackson Hole).

4. RSI number is important because we can know if the stock is overbought or not. The current market sentiment is unstable due to upcoming tapering, interest rates, inflation, national debts, infrastructure, etc. and most overbought stock have a high chance to meet its huge corrections later. Ok, so MU's current monthly RSI is 57. It is still in the middle which is a great number for tech growth stock. For example, Nvidia's monthly RSI is 86, AMD's monthly RSI is 85, AMAT is 75, TSM is 76, Qualcomm is 65, and ASML is 93. RSI does not explain everything, but it helps you to know that MU is pretty undervalued.

5. Most great investors always say 'being simple is the best strategy'. I also believe that. Simply, we will make the money if we buy the GOOD stock in cheap way and sell it in expensive way. And simply, MU, a GOOD stock, is cheap now.

6. Here is a better explanation about MU itself (my first MU DD) that shows why MU is a GOOD stock. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/osbr7k/micron\_will\_eventually\_rally\_5080\_upside\_potential/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/osbr7k/micron_will_eventually_rally_5080_upside_potential/)

There is a high chance that the Fed will not mention about tapering at Jackson Hole meeting because of Delta variant problems and slower than expected economy recovery. If they don't, tech stocks have a higher chance to get pumped for a while, and indeed, undervalued stocks have the highest chance to soar. So I personally strongly believe that few more tailwinds can drive MU price up to 20-30% before its next earnings (Sep 27), and 60-100% in 3-6 months depending on market sentiment.

Its current price targets are: Yahoo avg 115.59, Seeking Alpha avg 111.76, Marketwatch avg 115.85,  
Tip Ranks: 112.64, Marketbeat: 112.07, CNN: 112.50. Total Average PT: 113.40.

It is simple, but actually not easy. Buy it now since it is turning to bullish, and sell the news before it actually tanks again. If the tapering is coming? Buy the PUTs or wait until the price became cheap again with healthy correction. And then we get in the ride again when it starts pumping again. I think that is how you can survive in this stupid unpredictable market. I sometimes use option straddle strategy during this unpredictable market because all you need to do is choosing high volatility stocks (I might use this strategy for MU later since it has a high volatility, and the current market is unpredictable).

My positions: 24 Sep 72c x 7 , 24 Sep 68c x 10, owning 100 shares.

Indeed, this is just my DD, no financial advice.

o7wxw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o7wxw5/gsat_ultimate_dd/,GSAT ULTIMATE DD,63,32,2021-06-26 05:25:20,"This is all off the top of my head but it‚Äôs a basic outline of why I think GSAT is a big deal. There are a lot of people who understand the company better than I do, but I really think this is worth looking seriously at, and its up a little bit today so here‚Äôs my first stab at DD.

Be advised: I‚Äôm not a sat com expert, nor is this investment advice and I really have no Idea what I'm doing here.

Also, I should say Price Targets for GSAT range wildly, I've seen targets over $200 per share floated around with some pretty impressive analysis behind it, but more conservatively I'm in line with suggestions it COULD be $30-$50 if and when all goes well in a very optimal scenario, and it seems there's a much broader consensus on a 7$ to 10$ target in the near term.

GSAT owns c band and s band spectrum, which with the push to 5G and Internet of Things has suddenly become incredibly valuable. Recent FCC auctions will attest to this.

For years, GSAT was waiting for FCC authorization on that spectrum, but by the time they got it, they had issues with debt and investors were wary to jump in without a clear Monetization plan for their spectrum. The heavy debt situation has since been resolved, giving them enough of a cash runway to continue in for the next three years. Their business model during most of the past decade involved satellite phones and gps tracking, which, with their aging satellites and limited market for that kind of stuff, was never meant to do much more than keep the lights on while they waited for the value of their spectrum to appreciate. Their share price languished under $1 for a long time until 2021, when a couple things started to shift. They partnered with Nokia to set up a secure redundant 5G node for the port of Seattle, with more similar collaborations likely down the line. Then, most recently, QCOM announced that their x65 next generation snapdragon modem, which is the most popular smartphone modem in the world, will connect to the n53 band specifically. GSAT owns this band of spectrum, nobody else. QCOM obviously did that for a reason, but as of now, there‚Äôs no widespread usage of that spectrum as it‚Äôs not really being used except by GSAT SPOT devices and phones, which is to say, hardly at all.

Exactly what that means for GSAT is unclear, but what it does mean is that within a few years, millions of devices around the world will have the ability to connect to their spectrum.

There‚Äôs a lot of DD out there breaking down price targets, but the truth is nobody knows, and the CEO and other execs have shown an incredible amount of patience and personal investment in terms of allowing their spectrum assets to appreciate while putting their own money on the line to keep things afloat over the years.

Starlink, AT&T, Verizon should all be interested in buying, and have probably all made offers or overtures, but GSAT has not bitten, even when they needed the money. Which also suggests that the company is not interested in a sale. And indeed, leasing the spectrum might be far more lucrative than an outright sale, and better for shareholders.

I won't bother describing the different possible monetization strategies here, as I've linked to a report published by Nokia at the bottom of this post that does a much better job than I could.

GSATs spectrum is sometimes compared to a large swath of undeveloped beachfront property in the middle of South Beach, completely clean and unsullied in the middle of an increasingly crowded and frenzied space.

They look like a penny stock at first glance but they are far from it, and it may be the ultimate 5G play.

You might ask: What about Musk‚Äôs Starlink? Aren‚Äôt they going to eat GSAT‚Äôs lunch?

EDIT: This is better addressed in a comment by u/squishjonesjr:

""Starlink use Ku band for their user terminal links and Ka for the gateway links, they wont need any spectrum in C-band. Also doubt they would purchase spectrum to ensure others cant use it, their main focus is not going bankrupt. Their initial constellation will cost ~$10B and could be much higher if more sats are needed (filed for up to 15k sats). Not to mention their gen 1 sats have a useful life of 5 years so they will have to replace those soon after service start.""

-u/squishjonesjr

Starlink probably doesn‚Äôt need GSAT spectrum, and for our purposes, GSAT is not really in competition with Starlink, as their current business model (which will be affected by Starlink) is not the source of the stocks theoretcal valuation. but if someone DID want to compete with Starlink, they would need to access GSAT assets. Which is another reason why Starlink might need to get there first, not because they need it but because they dont want anyone else to have it.

Starlink is a possible buyer for GSAT, not for their satellites but for their spectrum. The value of GSAT is NOT in its satellites or the ground units, its in the spectrum.

DISH is another possible buyer for GSAT.

Some people point to debt issues with GSAT . It‚Äôs true the company has diluted its shares quite a bit to remain solvent over the years, but they currently have enough cash on hand to give them a three year runway. It would make ZERO sense for another offering to occur BEFORE a major monetization event for the spectrum, and since this is 5G, that monetization event is going to happen WELL before they run out of cash.

Another issue often raised: ‚ÄúThe FCC can just seize spectrum and reallocate it if they want, that‚Äôs what happened to (insert late 90‚Äôs early 2000‚Äôs Sat company here)

These other companies, from what I understand, had major issues with solvency, and so they basically went to the FCC to see what kind of deal they could get if they surrendered it to be reallocated. BTW, I‚Äôve learned that the correct way to talk about spectrum is not as something that GSAT owns or holds but as something they currently control.

Seems Risky?

Betting on the value of Globalstar spectrum WAS a risky play, but now that QCOM has legitimized the value of the n53 band (albeit not explicitly or specifically in terms of eventual use case) by including it in the next gen snapdragon's connectivity ability, the risk associated with the play has diminished a great deal.

The bear case of the QCOM aspect of all this is that including n53 connectivity is more of a marketing trick than something they imagine will actually get used, but given that n53 is extraordinarily underutilized at this point, even that scenario implies that QCOM expects to see expanded usage of that band in the short term.

Also I thought it was interesting that Nokia would publish this on their website: https://www.nokia.com/blog/case-globalstar-6-ways-leverage-spectrum-asset/

From Nokia:

‚ÄúNokia customer Globalstar Inc., a U.S. based provider of mobile satellite voice and data services, is in the enviable position of having 2.4 GHz spectrum that works everywhere, meaning it has been globally allocated. 2.4 GHz spectrum is in the sweet spot from a physics perspective because it‚Äôs good for both coverage and capacity. Although it‚Äôs not yet a 3GPP standardized spectrum band, it has been approved by the Federal Communications Commission and recently in other countries. It‚Äôs remarkably clean meaning it‚Äôs clear, has no co-channel interference and provides network benefits for both indoor and outdoor deployments.

Globalstar turned to Nokia to help determine the band characteristics for its available spectrum and identify potential application options. Nokia‚Äôs Network Planning and Optimization (NPO) team conducted a small cell network study of Globalstar‚Äôs 2.4 GHz spectrum as compared to a similar HetNet network in 2.1 GHz. The study proved the versatility of Globalstar‚Äôs spectrum, showing that operators with a small cell network could benefit from Globalstar‚Äôs clean spectrum, while those without small cell networks could benefit from its huge capacity.

In our study, Globalstar‚Äôs spectrum outperformed outdoor small cell deployments by 20%, while requiring 33% less infrastructure. For indoors in an urban office environment, we were able to deploy approximately half the access points required since the band has no interference from macro towers operating in the same frequency. The full report can be seen here. The team went a step further to also provide six business model options for Globalstar to consider.

‚ÄúWe were excited to work with Nokia‚Äôs NPO experts to help determine how to best monetize and maximize the use cases of our spectrum asset so we can deliver the highest quality experience to the end users,‚Äù said Jay Monroe, chairman and CEO of Globalstar.

6 ways to monetize & maximize the spectrum

1.Lease the spectrum to incumbent operators ‚Äì This provides extra capacity for operators and uses their own RAN equipment and services. Operators can use clean spectrum without incumbrance and it supports standard capabilities like Carrier Aggregation, roaming and redirection. For Globalstar, this is a simple revenue model without any operational burdens.

2.Dedicated in-building small cell spectrum ‚Äì The analysis clearly shows the difficulties presented by macro interference to small cell deployments. Offering a dedicated, clean spectrum band would dramatically improve the performance of these HetNets and significantly reduce the cost to deploy them. Globalstar could lease the spectrum to one carrier nationwide or carriers in geographic regions that wanted to reduce the strain on their expensive macro tower infrastructure.

3.Use the spectrum as a satellite service enhancement ‚Äì By deploying RANs in Globalstar‚Äôs high use areas, such as air terminals, shipping ports, military bases or cargo handling facilities, Globalstar can both provide satellite offload and support high data rates and advanced applications. Enhanced services are provided to customers where they normally congregate, and for these customers there is a layer of satellite redundancy in the event of disruptions in terrestrial networks.

4.Lease spectrum for private LTE systems to non-carriers ‚Äì Cable companies are increasingly interested in pursuing wireless services themselves. Globalstar‚Äôs spectrum provides an opportunity to add a private LTE network on top of their dense cable plant. Alternatively, as the in-building networks are further developed there may be an opportunity to include Globalstar‚Äôs band as a private LTE service on top of neutral host models.

5.Directly provide private services to enterprises ‚Äì By offering private LTE systems directly to enterprises, Globalstar provides spectrum, equipment and services to end user customers, which provides direct control over the user experience and maximizes private LTE system revenue opportunities. These deployments of Globalstar‚Äôs spectrum could be done while several of these other options are pursued simultaneously.

6.Mass market product enablement licensing ‚Äì Globalstar could license spectrum to ODM manufacturers for use in mass market. This would include unrestricted use and products distributed globally. This option could address the Internet of Things or Connected Car markets.

No matter what Globalstar decides to do, Nokia will be there to partner with them ‚Äì in the U.S. and around the world. We are also lending our support to the 3GPP standardization process and equipment manufacturing enablement, which are critical for the spectrum‚Äôs success."

That's still a sweet opportunity.",213,40,2021-06-10 09:31:12,"Hey Ya! Remember the early 2000s? It was all about lace-up jeans, giant cargo shorts, Gilmore Girls, Lord of the Rings, the Atkins Diet ... and the BlackBerry.

Long before the iPhone, the BlackBerry was the most beloved mobile gadget in the universe, known especially for its reliability, its security, and its full keyboard. But Research In Motion, the company that made it, didn't change quickly enough with the times, and the sweet fruit of its labors went sour. The company renamed itself BlackBerry (NYSE: BB) in early 2013 and set on a course of reinvention ‚Äî first around smartphones, and then around software. Many people wrote it off.

And that's where we see a major opportunity.

BlackBerry has been quietly accelerating in its new mission securing all the connected devices that the modern world increasingly relies on. You've heard of the Internet of Things, chips embedded in all the stuff around us transmitting a wealth of data? Call the business angle ""the Enterprise of Things."" BlackBerry's new focus still draws on its expertise in endpoint security, which shows us the fruit hasn't fallen so far from the tree. But this time around, it's securing things like self-driving vehicles, emergency health networks, financial reporting, and much more.

If your image of BlackBerry is stuck in the past, read on. This is a company with a future.

Second Bloom!

It's no surprise that most investors would pass BlackBerry by after a quick glance. Revenue has declined every year since 2011 ‚Äî and even then, the company's share price was far below the peak of nearly $150 that it reached in mid-2008.

But this is, quite simply, an entirely different company than the BlackBerry most people remember, and its turnaround is just starting to take hold. Moreover, the company's progress is masked by the continuing decline of old legacy businesses that aren't part of management's vision or our investment thesis going forward.

BlackBerry continued to sell its own handheld devices until mid-2016, and there are still BlackBerry-branded devices available, so current results continue to suffer from the decline of this business. Service access fees (SAF), related to legacy users of BlackBerry operating systems, are also dwindling. Given that these two businesses still represented roughly 50% of revenue in fiscal 2017, their continued decline has been keenly felt.

But the meat of the current business, Software and Services, has grown at an average annual pace of 15% over the past three years, reaching $782 million in fiscal 2018 (the company's fiscal year ends in February). This is now by far the largest part of BlackBerry, and we expect revenue for the company as a whole to stabilize this year and start rising thereafter.

The company's QNX operating system, in particular, has been driving growth. Traditionally used in vehicle infotainment systems, it has grown into the software backbone that can run all the chips in a vehicle, including safety and communications. BlackBerry has struck key deals with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU), and others around this technology. Baidu, in turn, has made QNX the core of its Apollo platform, and has partnered with automakers like Ford (NYSE: F) and Hyundai to make this the core of future autonomous vehicles.

This certainly isn't the only area where BlackBerry's business is growing, but it's emblematic of the niche the company is carving out: securing endpoints in the Internet of Things, with a particular focus on enterprises. It has been a leader in Gartner's (NYSE: IT) Magic Quadrant for enterprise mobility management for the past two years, making it one of the Top Dogs in a sector that's expected to grow revenue at a 25% annual pace through 2021. 

Still Green!

That hasn't yet put BlackBerry in the black, but it's building the core of a very profitable business.

Since being recapitalized by Fairfax Financial in 2013, BlackBerry has boasted a strong balance sheet, with $2.2 billion in cash and $810 million in convertible debt (which will likely convert to shares rather than being repaid). Gross margin improved from 49% in fiscal 2017 to an amazing 73% in fiscal 2018, indicating not only the company's shift from hardware to software, but also some considerable pricing power. Management also expects the company to deliver positive free cash flow this year (it did last year, too, albeit thanks to a large one-time adjustment).

Add it up and this is a $5.4 billion company currently generating around $800 million in very high-margin software revenue (leaving aside the remaining hardware and SAF businesses), with over 80% of that revenue recurring. With a gross margin that improved to 76% in the most recent quarter, we expect this business to ultimately produce profit margins in the 20% to 25% range, even as the top line continues to grow. That looks like an attractive price point.

Risks and When We'd Sell!

There are a lot of reasons to look more deeply at BlackBerry's financials, but the surface picture remains unflattering. For the time being, this remains a company with shrinking revenue and marginal profitability. Changing that relies not just on continued growth of the software business, but scaling the business so that BlackBerry's relatively high sales, marketing, and R&D costs come down as a percentage of revenue.

The company is a leader in a growing sector, but its competitors ‚Äî companies like IBM (NYSE: IBM), VMware (NYSE: VMW), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO), and others ‚Äî have a lot of resources. That's why it's important that BlackBerry establish an especially strong presence in areas like vehicles, but we would like to see it keep getting wins in other areas, too.

The Foolish Bottom Line!

Not every turnaround works, but BlackBerry has already become a leader in enterprise mobility management by leveraging its security DNA. This company has spent the last five years under CEO John Chen honing its new focus, and at this point he says the company is ""largely done reinventing itself"" and ready to focus on furthering its leadership. Chen should know ‚Äî he's a turnaround expert who was previously brought into database company Sybase, returning it to profitability before it was sold to SAP (NYSE: SAP) in 2010.

Whether or not BlackBerry remains on its own or is ultimately acquired, we expect it to continue expanding its capability and reach in keeping connected ""things"" safe and secure. The best part is that many investors can't see the green shoots growing from the rotten fruit of a decade past. That's a sweet opportunity."

n2ojmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n2ojmq/cohu_the_plug_for_your_favorite_semiconductor/,Cohu; the plug for your favorite semiconductor companies,118,57,2021-05-02 02:44:15,"What if I told you that Qualcomm, Intel, Skyworks, Texas Instruments, Samsung, and Analog devices all had something in common in their supply chain? They all buy their testing capital equipment from Cohu. 

Cohu offers a few different products. All of them are within the market of testing computer chips. Why is this market important? Well on the customer end, imagine if you spent 2500$ on a laptop and the intel chip inside didn't work. You'd return it to BestBuy, who would return it to HP, who would return it to Intel. A long and expensive chain of returns for a nonfunctional product. This issue can also be more than just an inconvenience. What if you bought a self driving tesla and one of the chips in the sensors didn't work? What if a Boeing airbus had some faulty chips in the navigation system? In short, it's very important that the semi manufacturers know that their product is working when they send it out. 

**Bullish trends**

1. Semiconductor volume is increasing in the following industries, **mobile phones** (5g needs 2x the chips), **Computing**, **Automotive** (electric and self driving need exponentially more chips than cars of the past), **Cloud computing** (basically a warehouse of semiconductors) **AI** (not sure how this works, but it's going to need computer chips). Here's my main argument: ***Each of those markets is rapidly growing, and at the same time chip volume is rising in each of those markets***. This creates a sort of exponential effect for the semiconductor chain. Not only is there a strong catalyst from increasing volume in existing markets (phones, pcs), but we also see rapidly growing new markets that also have high density. (cloud, auto). This is very bullish for the entire semi supply chain.  But the key feature that benefits testing in particular, is increasing complexity of chips. A more complex chip requires more complex testing, which demands a higher premium. 
2. Semiconductor shortage. We all know demand for computer chips is very high. And supply has just about run out. This means that prices for semiconductors should increase due to scarcity. This is great news for Cohu, as it leaves more margin to charge for testing. If you were ford would you pay a premium on chips in order to produce your vehicles?
3. Increasing chip complexity, on smaller wafers, demands a higher price for testing. AMAT recently noted on April 6th analyst day that capital intensity (% revenue spent on capital equipment) is returning to the 2000 highs of 16%. This increased capital intensity seems especially true when we consider the global chip shortage. Intel and Tsm are opening new fabs in the last couple months. These factories are going to require a shit-ton of capital equipment. For example TSMC announced they'll be spending $100 billion over the next 3 years on capital equipment, as their fabs have been running at 100% for months and still can't keep up with demand.
4. Trend of strong growth. Cohu has shown strong growth in the last year. In Q1 2020, revenue was $138.9 million, and gross margin was 41.7%. Q1 2021 revenue was just reported at $225.1 million, and gross margin was 45.6%. This is annual revenue growth of 62%, and margin growth of 9%. Business outlook in only getting better as the semiconductor shortage worsens, and demand continues to grow across sectors.
5. Very high accounts receivable. Accounts receivable is up 30% annually to 197 million$. Recurring customers represent 48% of Cohu's revenue, so this is a very strong sign in my opinion. 

**Bearish trends**

1. The company is on a huge downturn in the last few trading days due to announcing 42-45% gross margin for Q2 instead of 45%+, like Q1. This is on increased revenue of 234-250 million forecasted for Q2. A decrease in GM on growing revenue is never a great sign. The reason for this change is that much of the forecasted growth is in the automotive segment, which is lower margin than other segments I mentioned in the last section. Essentially the chips in cars aren't as complicated as the chips in PCs or phones, so they are less expensive, and therefore have a lower margin for testing. I will point out that the firm is likely to generate more gross margin dollars next quarter than this quarter, albeit on lower gm %. (.43x240=$103.2 gm, vs this last quarter 225x.456=$102.6gm). 
2. Recent stock offering. Cohu sold 4,950,000 shares at 41$ at the start of march. This diluted the shares available, but raised $202 million for the firm. They used this to pay off debt, and fund future growth. 
3. strong competition. Cohu's main competitors are advantest, and teradyne. These are two large global firms that have significantly more financial resources than Cohu. Cohu does have some advantages over these strong competitors, it's the global leader in Radio frequency power amplifier. RF amplifiers are a key component in mobile phones, and are increasing in volume with the 5g rollout. (more chips per phone, and more complexity) Essentially Cohu is in the dominant position in this growing market. Cohu is also the leader in automotive handling. (handling is a process where chips are moved into the testing device, then sorted based on results).

**Fundamental analysis**

I use a ratio similar to p/e. I use gross margin/market cap. (If I was buying the whole company, I'd want to know how much profit I'm purchasing).

Cohu annual gm=$316,000,000. Cohu market cap=$1,925,000,000

$316 million/$1925 million=6.09

This is a very attractive price/gm ratio. Lets compare it to some other companies ratios. 

Cohu-6.09

aapl-19.12

amzn-18

ter-11.3

advantest-7.19

swks-17.9

If cohu were trading at the same multiplier as it's large cap competitor, Teradyne, the stock price would nearly double.

Taking a look at the balance sheet, Cohu is in a much better position today than 1 year ago. They have $290 million of cash, almost double from a year ago. They also have significantly lower long term debt. \~$200 million today versus \~$300 million a year ago. 

&#x200B;

**Technical analysis**

[Cohu 1 year chart](https://preview.redd.it/pav84wurgjw61.png?width=1504&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d65ce5a266334b6f1c8a9cd3fb344509441451e)

As we can see from the 1 year chart above, Cohu seems to find support around the $40 mark for the past 6 months. Currently it's chillin out on the support line, so this indicates to me that it's a good time to purchase cohu, as I love buying dips. We can also see it's found resistance at around $50, having tested that line 3-4 times since the start of the year. I cannot say with certainty that it will break this resistance line, but I do expect it to at least check this number again some time in the next 2-3 months. My expected range for this stock in the next 3 months is between $50 and $65, which leaves room for some nice profit if one were to buy at $40. 

In conclusion, cohu is a small cap in an extremely hot market. It's got some big competitors, but it holds certain key advantages over them. The financial position of the company is really good currently, and it's growth should continue for the foreseeable future. It's strongest catalyst is that semiconductor density is increasing in existing markets, and new markets are emerging with high density, which has the potential to create enormous growth. For this reason, I think COHU is a great choice. (Even if you disagree on Cohu, you will want to have some semiconductors in your portfolio for the next few years). 

Disclaimer: I'm holding call options on this company.

**Core Product**

TSMC was founded in 1987 by Morris Chang, who previously had worked in Texas Instruments. TSMC can be considered as possibly the most important company in the world that few people have heard of. This is because it is practically a chokepoint of the $470 Billion semiconductor industry and is instrumental in supplying chips to almost all the major players. Currently, the company supplies to Apple for their A14 chips and ARM-based chips for their Mac products, Qualcomm, MediaTek, AMD, Intel, and Nvidia.

The company is the world‚Äôs largest semiconductor foundry. They are in the pure-play foundry business. This means that they do not produce any processors for their own products but they manufacture and sell chips to companies such as AMD, Intel, and Apple. The main reason for which companies such as Apple and AMD source chips from TSMC is that they do not have to build their own expensive silicon fabrication plants (the CapEx of the plans run into 10s of billions of dollars and it takes an extremely long time to set up) to manufacture their chips. TSMC is currently the world‚Äôs 11th largest company by market capitalization ($554 B).

&#x200B;

[TSMC absolutely dominates the advanced chip market ](https://preview.redd.it/qx1btw29krq61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=61ce94bf883480c99f5e74a43bdea79bbf9d4d9f)

As you can see from the above chart, TSMC absolutely dominates the advanced chip market (<10nm, think phone processors) which also has the highest margins. The company effectively controls more than half (54% to be exact) of the world‚Äôs made-to-order chip market.

**Financials**

TSMC posted its best-ever quarter in Q4‚Äô20 with revenues jumping 22% to a record $12.68 Billion and profits increasing 23% to $5.1 Billion. They are also expected to invest heavily this year with capital expenditure for production and development of advanced chips to be between $25-$28 Billion. (60% higher than the amount TSMC spend in 2020)

They also have a very strong financial position with $23 Billion in cash vs a long-term liability of only $10 billion (YE 2020). The company has also predicted a record first-quarter revenue between $12.7 Billion and $13 Billion, which is almost a 30% growth from the same period last year. We do have to note that their share price has jumped more than 140% over the past 12 months giving it the current valuation of $554 Billion.

**Potential and Hype Factors**

**Technology moat:** Compared to peers, TSMC is easily the leader in chip production technology. The company has delivered over 1 Billion 7nm chips by 2020 whereas Intel is still trying to master its 7nm development process. For those who are unaware of chip manufacturing, in general, the smaller the node size (measured in nanometer (nm)), the better the performance and power management. This is why the companies making the top-end chips want the smallest node size available.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6mw9ehakrq61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=a70944796b31b7b971e743f497854c29d9b797d1

TSMC is currently in the process of producing 5nm chips (20% of their total wafer revenue) and is already ramping up for 3nm production by the end of 2022. It takes a long time to spin up a new silicon fabrication factory (3-4 years is the average time it takes for a factory to go from planning to production).

This leadership in technology would be one of the key drivers for growth in the coming years. The $28 Billion Capex spending also reflects on the management‚Äôs confidence about the long-term demand for the advanced chips.

**Strong long-term demand:** Even though the current shortage faced by automakers is mainly due to a supply chain issue, cars, in general, are getting more and more complicated and EV‚Äôs tend to need better hardware and chips. This will force the automakers to rush to lock in future supply. Even though the margins produced from the auto-chips are not as high as the phones/laptops, the producers of the chips are definitely going to benefit in the long run.

**Risk and Competition**

There are multiple risks associated with TSMC. First and foremost, at the current valuation, the stock is definitely not cheap. The current PE ratio is 33 which puts them in the same bucket as Apple and AMD. While this might be representative of their future growth potential, it is on the higher side for a manufacturing company.

The company might face a short-term crisis in production as Taiwan is currently facing its most severe water shortage in 56 years. Taiwan‚Äôs chipmakers have begun stocking up on truckloads of water to prepare for shortages. During a similar drought in 2015, Taiwan was forced to implement water restrictions for industrial companies. This can cause a significant impact on the top and bottom line as TSMC is currently producing at 100% capacity. A weakening USD can also have a significant impact on TSMC‚Äôs EPS as \~99% of their sales are in US dollars whereas only 15% of its COGS is in US dollars.

A long-term risk for TSMC is that their increasingly dominant position in chip manufacturing is starting to attract political attention. The current shock from the auto chip shortage is forcing governments to bring vital supply chains back into their countries in order to make them less vulnerable to disruption. In the US, lawmakers are citing the chip shortage as proof that the country needs to revive more semiconductor manufacturing at home. This has forced TSMC to build a $12 billion plant in Arizona. This political climate can be beneficial for Intel, given their current foray into fabrication. (I do not think Intel can effectively compete with TSMC in fabrication without significant help in trade restrictions. As we can see from the process roadmap, Intel is currently years behind TSMC in the manufacturing process and they could not make their products work even when they had the best process technology years back)

**Conclusion**

TSMC is currently one of the world‚Äôs largest companies and they are definitely not resting on their laurels. They have been continuously working on building more capacity and advancing their nodes. Even though there are some short-term and long-term risks in terms of their exposure to the US dollar, rising geopolitical tensions, etc., I believe TSMC‚Äôs current technological moat, a monopoly level market share in advanced chips, and the rising use of smartphones and IoT devices put TSMC in a very strong position over the long term!

There was a vicious bidding war between Verizon and AT&T to acquire the next big 5G telecommunications company, StraightPath. I'm here to tell you history is going to repeat itself in GSAT.

""Globalstar, Inc. provides mobile satellite services worldwide. The company offers duplex two-way voice and data products, including mobile voice and data satellite communications services and equipment for remote business continuity, recreational usage, safety, emergency preparedness and response, and other applications; fixed voice and data satellite communications services and equipment at industrial, commercial, and residential sites, as well as rural villages and ships; and satellite data modem services comprising asynchronous and packet data services. It also provides SPOT consumer retail products, such as SPOT satellite GPS messenger for personal tracking, emergency location, and messaging solutions; and SPOT Trace, an anti-theft and asset tracking device. In addition, the company offers commercial Internet of Things one-way transmission products to track cargo containers and rail cars, as well as to monitor utility meters, and oil and gas assets. Further, it sells wholesale minutes to independent gateway operators (IGOs); and provides engineering services, such as hardware and software designs to develop specific applications; and installation of gateways and antennas.""

Marketplace: 5G is clearly the future of many industries. Autonomous cars (EV), Cellular, Energy, Agriculture, etc all willsoonrelyon5Gstructuredcommunications. GSATencompassesallofthese. The 5G market alone is expected to be worth over 667 Billion dollars in 5 years. This is not even including the EV space, which relies heavily on secure communications (aka GSAT) The Market is setup for a dominant, trusted company like GSAT to overtake.

Leadership:

David Kagan Chief Executive Officer David Kagan currently serves as CEO of Globalstar. Prior to re-joining Globalstar as President and COO in December 2017, Kagan was the COO of SpeedCast International Limited. He served as President of ITC Global, a premier global VSAT satellite services provider from August 2014 through September 2015. He was also the President and CEO of Globe Wireless from June 2011 through January 2014 when it was sold to Inmarsat PLC.

L. Barbee Ponder IV General Counsel and Vice President of Regulatory Mr. Ponder has previously served as Senior Regulatory Counsel for BellSouth Corporation in Washington, D.C. where he provided representation before the Federal Communications Commission, Congress and the White House on issues concerning 1996

Telecommunications Act, deregulation of broadband services and tax issues concerning the telecommunications industry. Guys...This man worked for the FCC on the telecommunications act in 1996. He knows the regulations and rules behind telecom industry (5G).

Technology, Current Contracts Band53 technology created by GSAT is being used by companies like Nokia and recently Qualcomm. From a press release: ""Globalstar has worked to develop the Band 53 ecosystem with a group of priority partners like Nokia. Globalstar‚Äôs Band 53 is a prime mid-band spectrum resource that we offer to our partners for deployment with customers that otherwise would not have access to the benefits of licensed spectrum. The combination of Nokia‚Äôs global reach and Globalstar‚Äôs Band 53 terrestrial authorizations in multiple countries around the globe present an exciting opportunity for secure wireless solutions."" This technology is the absolute future of secure 5G connections in not only telecommunications, but also in the EV landscape. Yes you heard it right, GSAT already uses their technology in auto makers such as Fiat Chrysler and Jeep. GSAT has the technology to jump fully into the connected car market, especially the ever poipular EV connected car market. GSAT owns 24 ground stations that serve as points between satellites and over 120 countries. The reach is already there. They are only limited by which contracts they will inevitably pick up. See: Nokia, Jeep, Qualcomm. (So far)

Future Growth With the world becoming ever more connected, these smaller but established companies are just waiting to boom. Every partnership that GSAT sees can increase its cap 2-3 fold. Just a basic true evaluation by some analysts see GSAT worth 9.25 Billion (pre Qualcomm deal) which puts them at $6.60 a share at current valuations! If you don't believe me, go look at what Nokia has said about their partnership with Globalstar: https://investors.globalstar.com/news-releases/news-release-details/globalstar-announces-nokia-deployment-over-licensed-band-53-port"

History repeats itself... The story of Nokia is that of a modern day epic. Here's why:

""Nokia Bell Labs is an American industrial research and scientific development company owned by Finnish company Nokia. With headquarters located in Murray Hill, New Jersey, the company operates several laboratories in the United States and around the world.""

\- 9 Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories, as well as 4 Turing Awards.

\- The C Programming Language, as well as Unix was developed here.

With the 5G/6G arms race heating up, it is time for the 100 year old think-tank to be leveraged once more.

### TLDR: Nokia is going to be one of the 3 kings in the world of 5G/6G... which will be used in EVERYTHING that matters in the next decade and this is the absolute ground floor.

All data that I present is publicly available. By no means do I claim to be an expert, nor is this financial advice. This is simply observation and speculation. I simply like the stock.

 üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

## (Hard) SPECULATION:

\- ""Big tech trades human futures"" - Zuboff, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism

\- IMO, modern institutions are very cunning... Everything they do has purpose.

\- From the cryptocurrency community in the previous bull market, I have learned this, and scaled it into larger markets... The behaviors are the same, but even more predictable due to the dominance of algorithmic trading. Just trade ""whale"" for ""institution"".

\- Nokia is seen in a negative light by retail, and the whole GME/Robinhood farce has further smeared their image to traditional retail investors. Many investors are repulsed from this company.

\- We have seen the clients of Big Tech influencing geopolitics to an astounding degree in the past few years through social media and surveillance capitalism... I believe that financial institutions have now caught on and now are cashing out on social media to move the markets...

\- Forgive me if you have disdain for WSB and the ""Robinhood"" investors, but I believe that there is big money behind them... BlackRock, JPM, etc... They are a vehicle for change, and a perfect fall guy for market manipulation.

\- Some of the DD are likely released by BlackRock themselves... I've seen some of the account's post histories. ""Robinhooders"" are looked down upon, yet under the guise of anonymity, they can release DD that far exceeds any big name analyst report? It smells fishy!

2 Possible threads of speculation:

\- Accumulation

\- Inst. ownership as of Q4 2020 is only 5.30%, shares float is 5 Bn... child's play to manipulate with high float. Other high growth companies that institutes are betting on have 90%+ inst. ownership.

\- Impulse Wave 1 was a test breakout... To gauge the retail demand levels. Institutions love to do this, and only create a melt up when an ideal motive wave can be created with public participation.

## FA:

""Have you ever wondered how you can enter the world of IoT or meet the increased requirements of the emerging 5G use cases? Are you in need of tools to seize the opportunities of 5G? Would you prefer to win new revenue with low risk and minimal investment, instead of spending CAPEX and time building an IoT network and developing new services?

Welcome to Nokia WING, a managed service that offers operators the ability to support their enterprise customers with global IoT connectivity across borders and technologies. It is live today with a truly global footprint but also prepared for the challenges of tomorrow ‚Äì no matter what directions it is taking.

There is nothing else like WING on the market."" - Nokia website

\- Like Blackberry, a comparison can be made to the mining sector. At the start of new bubbles, CapEx for juniors get filled very quickly. If we make a comparison to precious metals miners... this company is a first wave major, not a second wave junior.

\- Nokia, Elisa and Qualcomm together have achieved the fastest 5G speeds recorded in the world.

5G Market:

Market size value in 2020: USD 41.48 Billion Revenue forecast in 2027: USD 664 Billion

""The global 5G Applications and Services Market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 25.8% from 2019 to 2027"" (According to 180+ page research report by Fidelity National Financial)

25.8% CAGR sounds good to me...

Verticals:

\- Manufacturing

\- Energy & Utility

\- Media & Entertainment

\- IT & Telecom- Transportation & Logistics

\- Healthcare

\- Retail

\- Agriculture

\- O&G and Mining

\- BFSI

\- Construction

\- Real Estate

Sounds like a service that has unlimited applications... My favorite type of technology!

\- The global market for Internet of things (IoT) end-user solutions is expected to grow to 212 billion U.S. dollars in size by the end of 2019. The technology reached 100 billion dollars in market revenue for the first time in 2017, and forecasts suggest that this figure will grow to around 1.6 trillion by 2025.

\- 5G/6G is the LIFEBLOOD of IoT.

\- ""5G is much more than just fast downloads; its unique combination of high-speed connectivity, very low latency, and ubiquitous coverage will support smart vehicles and transport infrastructure such as connected cars, trucks, and buses, where a split second delay could mean the difference between a smooth flow of traffic and a 4-way crash at an intersection.""

\- What is the number 1 problem that EV wishes to solve right now? Completely independent self-driving. 5G/6G is part of the solution! Why is Elon Musk focusing on Starlink now? It is the solution for Tesla's biggest roadblock.

\- 5G infrastructures are the neurons for IoT!

\- 5G is huge. It is of UTMOST importance. Why would the US go to such lengths to cripple China's Huawei for YEARS? Huawei seems to be their number 1 target!

Key contracts and partnerships:

\- The FIRST company contracted to set up internet on the moon. Partnering with SpaceX.

‚ÄúWhy would astronauts on Earth have access to 5G at home, but not have the same access to the same technologies when they are on the Moon?‚Äù

Thierry Klein, head of Enterprise and Industrial Automation Research Lab at Nokia Bell Labs, is addressing the gap between communication technology on the Moon and technology astronauts have access to on Earth.

In October, Nokia was named a NASA partner for its Tipping Point technologies for the Moon program, receiving a $14 million contract to deploy the first LTE/4G communications system on the Moon.

\- 5G/6G will be essential for space travel... Sounds like ARKX will need to look into this one!

\- Dec. 1, 2020 - Nokia and AT&T extend Worldwide IoT Network Grid (WING) collaboration to deliver seamless IoT connectivity to enterprises around the world, and support upgrades to 5G. As IoT networks transition to 5G and with Nokia WING also supporting 5G network slicing, AT&T will be able to partition its 5G network into multiple networks that can deliver specific capabilities to its IoT customers and support various use cases.""

\- Jan.14, 2021 - Nokia selected for U.S. Federal 5G Cybersecurity Project

\- Main collaborator for the Hexa-X 6G European Union Project... ""Being a 2.5-year project within EU‚Äôs Horizon 2020 ICT-52 program, Hexa-X is a consortium of 25 key players from adjacent industries and academia. Nokia has the overall lead and Ericsson the technical manager role in the project. Hexa-X is a broad collaborative initiative to frame the 6G research agenda and lay the groundwork for a long-term European investment in future wireless network technology."" - Ericsson's website.

\- ""Google Cloud and Finland‚Äôs Nokia are teaming up to develop cloud-native 5G solutions for communications service providers and enterprise customers, the companies announced in a Thursday (Jan. 14) press release.

The companies plan to develop solutions that combine Nokia‚Äôs 5G operations and networking capabilities with Google Cloud‚Äôs AI, ML and analytics technologies. The solutions will run on Google‚Äôs Anthos platform.""

Yes.. a Google partnership.

Take the below figures with a grain of salt... Sources are varying and biased, and there needs to be more rigorous audits in this sector. However, you will get the idea:

5G Hardware Market Share 2020:

\#1. Huawei - 28%

\#2. Nokia - 16%

\#3. Ericsson - 14%

(These figures vary depending on the source, but it is clear that these 3 are the leaders by far)

Investors accumulate shares, Research companies accumulate patents. Those who own the patents are the power brokers in the industry.

Total 5G patents owned 2019:

\#1. Huawei - 13,474

\#2. Qualcomm - 12,719

\#3. Samsung - 9,299

\#4. Ericsson- 8,116

\#5. LG - 7,694

\#6. Nokia- 5,554

There is an argument for Standard-Essential Patents (SEP) ownership... supposedly, which patents actually matter, and Nokia owns about 3,000. I am no expert on IP law or 5G technology, but these figures gives me a rough estimate, and are an indicator to the larger picture. Robert L. Stoll from Faegre Drinker's report has some good secondary sources if you want to dig into this.

A quick calculation of Value metrics:

\- Current Mcap of 23.35 Bn.

\- 16% market share of projected 664 Bn... Market size refers to the maximum total number of sales or customers your business can see, often measured over the course of a year.

\- 664 Bn x 0.16 = 106 Bn Revenue, assuming Revenue = Sales for now, 106 Bn/5 Bn shares = 21 SPS. Assuming P/S Ratio of 1, Market Value per Share = $21.00 USD by 2027.

\- Current price = $4, 21/4 = 5, so a 400% gain in 6 years based on a P/S Ratio of 1.

\- Tesla's current P/S ratio is 23.78, and Zoom had a high of 108.95 with the lowest being 25.83.

Does it sound right to you?

 üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

## TA:

\- MACD has crossed over on lower time frames to bullish, and is converging on the 1D.

\- Current Price action shows fake consolidation... Motive Sequence has already begun.

\- The first run up to 10 must be wave 1 of the motive sequence, as this corrective wave has gone below the previous high.

\- Fib levels for wave 3 and 5 are around 14 and 21.

## QA:

First, the problem with options...

\- 142,040 Open Interest for options expiring 2/26/2021

\- 158,201 Open Interest for options expiring 3/05/2021

\- 434,917 Open Interest for options expiring 3/19/2021

It is possible that these need to expire before we move up again. However, all is not lost:

\- Heavy speculative call interest, with large short interest (in this case short volume) that are pushing up against major resistance levels can quickly pop higher. This indicates that they have consolidated and are getting ready for the next large move.

\- NOK had 370.0 ATM IV on Jan. 27, 2021, where the MM was forced to gamma hedge and we got the big but short-lived pop. Currently 50.2. This can be interpreted two ways. Low IV is good if organic growth and MM pinning pressure to ease, but abnormally low IV compared to the historic IV, where there is large negative gamma exposure means a big directional move is imminent.

\- Once again, call skew is turning bullish. Option interest always leads the price!

Institutional Behavior:

\- 442 institutional investors, and rising... More than Palantir Technologies...

\- Average 13F ranking rising (calculated from Total # of 13F shares and # of Funds holding)

\- institutional interest is GREATLY decoupled from stock price! Extremely bullish indicator. Price is what you pay, Value is what you get.

I always look for the big players, and what they are doing with their money. Words are cheap. Follow the money.

\- \*\*Blackrock increased their position 333,000,000 shares during 2020, an increase of 21 million shares held from the year before (7% increase) and representing a 5.90% ownership of the company.\*\*

\- State Street increased their position by 2,039,035 in Q4 2020, bringing their total to 2,372,220.

\- Susquehanna increased their position by 5,030,133 shares as the 6th largest holder in Q4 2020, with 10,849,501 total and significantly decreased their options positions, both puts and calls.

\- Renaissance Technologies increased their position by 4,149,027, with 7,688,612 total as the 10th largest holder in Q4 2020.

\- \*\*Citigroup increased their CALL position by 85,900, decreased their Put position by 52,600, and sold 1,347,617 shares.\*\*

\- \*\*Citadel increased their call position by 1,266,800 to a total of 1,680,100 and decreased their Put position by 283,700... They still have 2,567,900 Puts as of Q4 2020.\*\*

\- Nokia has a Short Volume Ratio generally ranging between 10-15... GME currently has 15-25 to give you an idea, and this puts it in the range of the top 10 companies with the highest short volume on the market.

\- NOK has a 5.3 Bn shares float, making the stock unbelievably easy to manipulate via short selling. The short interest is useless here, short volume is what to look at.

## Speculation:

\- I have noticed that BlackRock and JPM have been massively accumulating shares in companies that I believe have the deepest of value, and are future tech monopolies (PLTR).

\- Such movement has been preceded by RenTech, Citigroup, and Citadel, RenTech and Citadel being top Quantitative Hedge Funds.

\- Speculative interest appears in the Robinhood community.

\- Extreme media FUD campaigns and short-selling follows to depress the price, while BlackRock and JPM accumulate enormous amounts of shares.

\- The Quants are playing MM for BlackRock and JPM. They are RUTHLESS! I have suffered for 2 months at their hands at Palantir!

\- The news will be out soon... This won't stay down here much longer. Information moves quick nowadays. Maybe Cathie will buy in.

To be an investor in such conditions, one must have the strongest of conviction. One must do their own DD... Conviction cannot be outsourced.

tl;dr at the bottom

Why it'll ¬†üöÄthis year and next year:

1) Biden wants to make the entire US fleet EV by the end of his term. You really think he's going to buy $70,000 cybertrucks for the fleet? Can you imagine the outrage if federal cars are using fancy Teslas while the average American has to buy regular cars? I think Biden will be more likely to buy GM's newer electric cars once they come out because they'll be much cheaper. Biden also drives GMs cars adding to possible bias or favoritism there. I don't think it's a coincidence that GM announced going fully electric while Biden pushed for a fully electric federal fleet. Either Biden knew GM was going electric or GM knew Biden would make this big purchase order.

2) Cap and trade? Have you heard of it? No? You should learn about it or else you'll lose out on tendies.  Cap and trade is complicated so I'm not gonna explain it here. Go google it. Point is, companies who produce electric cars can receive a rebate because the car emits less CO2 compared to a gas car. In fact, Tesla would've **lost money** in 2020 if it wasn't for California's cap and trade program ([https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/investing/tesla-profitability/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/investing/tesla-profitability/index.html)). Now that GM has access to this cap and trade market, they'll be able to sell these to the remaining gas car companies. This will also hurt Tesla because the more companies sell credits the cheaper they become. 

Also, you know who's likely to pass cap and trade? The federal government. Obama tried to pass cap and trade in 2009 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American\_Clean\_Energy\_and\_Security\_Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Clean_Energy_and_Security_Act)), but it was never brought to the senate. With climate change being a more pressing issue, and Biden's talk about solving climate change and green energy jobs, he's for sure going to try to expand and pass cap and trade on the national level. He's also publicly supported cap and trade ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/climate-change/carbon-tax/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/climate-change/carbon-tax/)). From his campaign website ""And, he will demand that Congress enacts legislation in the first year of his presidency that 1) establishes an enforcement mechanism to achieve the 2050 goal, including a target no later than the end of his first term in 2025 to ensure we get to the finish line."" This seems to refer to cap and trade as it's the only real enforcement mechanism to achieve a targeted climate change goal. With democrats controlling everything, cap and trade is likely to pass this time. 

Then again, politicians lie all the time and  Biden isn't much different. However, even if the feds don't step in, multiple states have already passed cap and trade with many more to come. 

3) GMs cars are comparable to Tesla's cars.  The Model 3 isn't actually that good. The Chevy Bolt has a range of 259 miles, about 22 miles longer than Tesla. Both cars cost about the same amount. The newer Chevy Bolts also have fast charging, so Tesla's starting to lose its moat here. Guess Elon's plan to not patent anything really screwed him over.

4) The PE on this is stupidly low. Come on? 12.13? It's practically **begging** to be bought at this price. Compare this to Tesla's 1,230. If GM and Tesla, both EV companies, had the same valuation, GM would be worth $5000. This is my price target lmao.

5) The UK, Norway, and other countries are planning to ban vehicles. Norway is the most aggressive at 2025. China is also considering it, which would make EV companies like GM go absolutely parabolic. GM has the Chevy Bolt, meaning they already have a head start in terms of experience when it comes to producing EVs. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Why is the stock down?

There are a lot of things that make people scared of GM. Here's why I think they're dumb:

1) The chip shortage:

This is a concern for GM in the short run, but they were still able to beat earnings compared to 2019. Currently they're projecting the earnings will be $1-$2 billion lower next year due to the shortage. I think that's a worst case scenario and the market is **overreacting** to the chip shortage. The chip shortage is now getting the concern of Congress and Biden ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/23/biden-semiconductor-shortage-meeting/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/23/biden-semiconductor-shortage-meeting/)). Given that Biden always talks about manufacturing, funding the semiconductor shortage via loans or grants and boosting domestic production of semiconductors could serve an easy win. He can claim this is coronavirus stimulus money to build manufacturing jobs or whatever. GM gets its chips from Qualcomm, which has a ton of facilities in the US and is based in San Diego. This can serve as an easy political win for Biden. 

2) Charging stations. This isn't going to be a concern for much longer. Most people don't drive for long haul journeys, so driving stations aren't really needed. Think about it. If you could fill up your car with gas at home, would you ever go to a gas station? Very rarely. This is the point of EVs, and it's why I think they'll be the future. Also I hate to mention Biden again, but he's planning to put 500,000 public charging stations in the US by 2030. This won't be a problem much longer. ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-02/joe-biden-plan-to-fight-climate-change-could-sell-25-million-electric-cars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-02/joe-biden-plan-to-fight-climate-change-could-sell-25-million-electric-cars))

3) bEaR mArKEt. Chill. This shit happens every couple of months. People panic and say the market is crashing. It's not. Even if it was, GM would hardly be hit because its PE is so stupidly low. IMO the only company that should tank a ton is Tesla. People always bring up the **bUfFeT inDicAtoR** because they think Buffet is some kind of god. He's not. Sometimes Buffet is an idiot. He doesn't understand the tech industry, and I think the rise in stocks recently is tech related. We're entering a new era of American capitalism where tech companies dominate. 7% stock market growth is the norm. With GDP rising 2% per year, you should expect to see a high divergence in the long run. The buffet indicator only measures GDP too, which isn't remotely the same as stock prices. Stocks get their values from earnings and also the assets the company owns. GDP doesn't factor wealth into consideration at all. 

One last point: people think it's a buy and hold for 10 years, but it's not. I think GM will go to the moon ($5000) quicker than you think. Stocks move faster than reality and price in future expectations. There are a lot of catalysts incoming (charging stations, no new gas cars, chip production, and cap and trade). If any one of these things are announced, that's GM to $100. 

&#x200B;

tl;dr Buy GM. Cap and trade, EV ban, and its undervalued price make it super attractive. GM will hit $5000. Buy or cry.

lrdg2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrdg2q/gsat_dd_its_the_spectrum_stupid/,"GSAT DD (It's the spectrum, stupid)",384,141,2021-02-24 21:55:56,"
This is all off the top of my head but it‚Äôs a basic outline of why I think GSAT is a big deal. There are a lot of people who understand the company better than I do, but I really think this is worth looking seriously at, and its up a little bit today so here‚Äôs my first stab at DD.

Be advised: I‚Äôm not a sat com expert, nor is this investment advice and I really have no Idea what I'm doing here.

Also, I should say Price Targets for GSAT range wildly, I've seen targets over $200 per share floated around with some pretty impressive analysis behind it, but more conservatively I'm in line with suggestions it COULD be $30-$50 if and when all goes well in a very optimal scenario, and it seems there's a much broader consensus on a 7$ to 10$ target in the near term. 

GSAT owns c band and s band spectrum, which with the push to 5G and Internet of Things has suddenly become incredibly valuable. Recent FCC auctions will attest to this.

For years, GSAT was waiting for FCC authorization on that spectrum, but by the time they got it, they had issues with debt and investors were wary to jump in without a clear Monetization plan for their spectrum. The heavy debt situation has since been resolved, giving them enough of a cash runway to continue in for the next three years. Their business model during most of the past decade involved satellite phones and gps tracking, which, with their aging satellites and limited market for that kind of stuff, was never meant to do much more than keep the lights on while they waited for the value of their spectrum to appreciate. Their share price languished under $1 for a long time until 2021, when a couple things started to shift. They partnered with Nokia to set up a secure redundant 5G node for the port of Seattle, with more similar collaborations likely down the line. Then, most recently, QCOM announced that their x65 next generation snapdragon modem, which is the most popular smartphone modem in the world, will connect to the n53 band specifically. GSAT owns this band of spectrum, nobody else. QCOM obviously did that for a reason, but as of now, there‚Äôs no widespread usage of that spectrum as it‚Äôs not really being used except by GSAT SPOT devices and phones, which is to say, hardly at all.

Exactly what that means for GSAT is unclear, but what it does mean is that within a few years, millions of devices around the world will have the ability to connect to their spectrum.

There‚Äôs a lot of DD out there breaking down price targets, but the truth is nobody knows, and the CEO and other execs have shown an incredible amount of patience and personal investment in terms of allowing their spectrum assets to appreciate while putting their own money on the line to keep things afloat over the years. 

Starlink, AT&T, Verizon should all be interested in buying, and have probably all made offers or overtures, but GSAT has not bitten, even when they needed the money. Which also suggests that the company is not interested in a sale. And indeed, leasing the spectrum might be far more lucrative than an outright sale, and better for shareholders. 

I won't bother describing the different possible monetization strategies here, as I've linked to a report published by Nokia at the bottom of this post that does a much better job than I could. 

GSATs spectrum is sometimes compared to a large swath of undeveloped beachfront property in the middle of South Beach, completely clean and unsullied in the middle of an increasingly crowded and frenzied space.

They look like a penny stock at first glance but they are far from it, and it may be the ultimate 5G play.

You might ask: What about Musk‚Äôs Starlink? Aren‚Äôt they going to eat GSAT‚Äôs lunch?

EDIT: This is better addressed in a comment by u/squishjonesjr:

""Starlink use Ku band for their user terminal links and Ka for the gateway links, they wont need any spectrum in C-band. Also doubt they would purchase spectrum to ensure others cant use it, their main focus is not going bankrupt. Their initial constellation will cost ~$10B and could be much higher if more sats are needed (filed for up to 15k sats). Not to mention their gen 1 sats have a useful life of 5 years so they will have to replace those soon after service start."" 

-u/squishjonesjr


Starlink probably doesn‚Äôt need GSAT spectrum, and for our purposes, GSAT is not really in competition with Starlink, as their current business model (which will be affected by Starlink) is not the source of the stocks theoretcal valuation. but if someone DID want to compete with Starlink, they would need to access GSAT assets. Which is another reason why Starlink might need to get there first, not because they need it but because they dont want anyone else to have it.

Starlink is a possible buyer for GSAT, not for their satellites but for their spectrum. The value of GSAT is NOT in its satellites or the ground units, its in the spectrum.

DISH is another possible buyer for GSAT.

Some people point to debt issues with GSAT . It‚Äôs true the company has diluted its shares quite a bit to remain solvent over the years, but they currently have enough cash on hand to give them a three year runway. It would make ZERO sense for another offering to occur BEFORE a major monetization event for the spectrum, and since this is 5G, that monetization event is going to happen WELL before they run out of cash.

Another issue often raised: ‚ÄúThe FCC can just seize spectrum and reallocate it if they want, that‚Äôs what happened to (insert late 90‚Äôs early 2000‚Äôs Sat company here)

These other companies, from what I understand, had major issues with solvency, and so they basically went to the FCC to see what kind of deal they could get if they surrendered it to be reallocated. BTW, I‚Äôve learned that the correct way to talk about spectrum is not as something that GSAT owns or holds but as something they currently control.

Seems Risky?

Betting on the value of Globalstar spectrum WAS a risky play, but now that QCOM has legitimized the value of the n53 band (albeit not explicitly or specifically in terms of eventual use case) by including it in the next gen snapdragon's connectivity ability, the risk associated with the play has diminished a great deal.

The bear case of the QCOM aspect of all this is that including n53 connectivity is more of a marketing trick than something they imagine will actually get used, but given that n53 is extraordinarily underutilized at this point, even that scenario implies that QCOM expects to see expanded usage of that band in the short term.

Also I thought it was interesting that Nokia would publish this on their website: [https://www.nokia.com/blog/case-globalstar-6-ways-leverage-spectrum-asset/](https://www.nokia.com/blog/case-globalstar-6-ways-leverage-spectrum-asset/)

From Nokia:

‚ÄúNokia customer Globalstar Inc., a U.S. based provider of mobile satellite voice and data services, is in the enviable position of having 2.4 GHz spectrum that works everywhere, meaning it has been globally allocated. 2.4 GHz spectrum is in the sweet spot from a physics perspective because it‚Äôs good for both coverage and capacity. Although it‚Äôs not yet a 3GPP standardized spectrum band, it has been approved by the Federal Communications Commission and recently in other countries. It‚Äôs remarkably clean meaning it‚Äôs clear, has no co-channel interference and provides network benefits for both indoor and outdoor deployments.

Globalstar turned to Nokia to help determine the band characteristics for its available spectrum and identify potential application options. Nokia‚Äôs Network Planning and Optimization (NPO) team conducted a small cell network study of Globalstar‚Äôs 2.4 GHz spectrum as compared to a similar HetNet network in 2.1 GHz. The study proved the versatility of Globalstar‚Äôs spectrum, showing that operators with a small cell network could benefit from Globalstar‚Äôs clean spectrum, while those without small cell networks could benefit from its huge capacity.

In our study, Globalstar‚Äôs spectrum outperformed outdoor small cell deployments by 20%, while requiring 33% less infrastructure. For indoors in an urban office environment, we were able to deploy approximately half the access points required since the band has no interference from macro towers operating in the same frequency. The full report can be seen here. The team went a step further to also provide six business model options for Globalstar to consider.

‚ÄúWe were excited to work with Nokia‚Äôs NPO experts to help determine how to best monetize and maximize the use cases of our spectrum asset so we can deliver the highest quality experience to the end users,‚Äù said Jay Monroe, chairman and CEO of Globalstar.

6 ways to monetize & maximize the spectrum

1.Lease the spectrum to incumbent operators ‚Äì This provides extra capacity for operators and uses their own RAN equipment and services. Operators can use clean spectrum without incumbrance and it supports standard capabilities like Carrier Aggregation, roaming and redirection. For Globalstar, this is a simple revenue model without any operational burdens.

2.Dedicated in-building small cell spectrum ‚Äì The analysis clearly shows the difficulties presented by macro interference to small cell deployments. Offering a dedicated, clean spectrum band would dramatically improve the performance of these HetNets and significantly reduce the cost to deploy them. Globalstar could lease the spectrum to one carrier nationwide or carriers in geographic regions that wanted to reduce the strain on their expensive macro tower infrastructure.

3.Use the spectrum as a satellite service enhancement ‚Äì By deploying RANs in Globalstar‚Äôs high use areas, such as air terminals, shipping ports, military bases or cargo handling facilities, Globalstar can both provide satellite offload and support high data rates and advanced applications. Enhanced services are provided to customers where they normally congregate, and for these customers there is a layer of satellite redundancy in the event of disruptions in terrestrial networks.

4.Lease spectrum for private LTE systems to non-carriers ‚Äì Cable companies are increasingly interested in pursuing wireless services themselves. Globalstar‚Äôs spectrum provides an opportunity to add a private LTE network on top of their dense cable plant. Alternatively, as the in-building networks are further developed there may be an opportunity to include Globalstar‚Äôs band as a private LTE service on top of neutral host models.

5.Directly provide private services to enterprises ‚Äì By offering private LTE systems directly to enterprises, Globalstar provides spectrum, equipment and services to end user customers, which provides direct control over the user experience and maximizes private LTE system revenue opportunities. These deployments of Globalstar‚Äôs spectrum could be done while several of these other options are pursued simultaneously.

6.Mass market product enablement licensing ‚Äì Globalstar could license spectrum to ODM manufacturers for use in mass market. This would include unrestricted use and products distributed globally. This option could address the Internet of Things or Connected Car markets.

No matter what Globalstar decides to do, Nokia will be there to partner with them ‚Äì in the U.S. and around the world. We are also lending our support to the 3GPP standardization process and equipment manufacturing enablement, which are critical for the spectrum‚Äôs success.‚Äù"

FY-20 Revenue and Net Income up 21.7% and 62.7% vs. FY-19. Proposed Dividend of ‚Ç¨ 1.70 per Share, up 68.3%.  This is a rocket ship ready to blast off in the semiconductor shortage.

‚Ç¨BESI // $BESI.Y

**BESI what do?**

Leading assembly equipment supplier with #1 and #2 positions in key markets. 32% addressable market share.  Customers are primarily leading semiconductor manufacturers, assembly subcontractors and electronics and industrial companies.  That is Samsung, TSMC, & Qualcomm.

*Ape speak: they make the shovels in the gold rush.*

Why BESI? -  *Richard Blickman* BESI CEO knows how to upscale his business during surging demands and has demonstrated time and time again in the cyclical semi industry.  He will direct the company to grow their market share a forecasted 20% this year!  ***Their order book for Q1-21 has already exceeded Q4-20.***  Their market share is as a result of long partnerships with IDMs, supply chains and others.  He's a master of capital allocation and knows the market, look at how he has flipped the business to match consumer demands, and positioned BESI in the Asian market.

**Semi shortage:**

So nobody can even get a semi these days?? We need to get rock hard.  Revenue in the Foundry industry was up 23% last year to $82 billion. Counterpoint shook its Magic 8 ball and is now calling for growth of 12% this year bringing revenue to $92 billion. TSMC should grow 13% to 16%  this year staying pretty much in line with the industry's overall growth rate. We have already seen good commitments to CAPEX for building foundries, which is good news for BESI and their product lines. As the companies look to expand they need assembly equipment to grow!!

**A cyclical business and detachment from trends:**

For those unfamiliar with semi's sometimes they go down, sometimes they go up - it depends on how many semis are going around.  This time with a semiconductor shortage we go parabolic. It is the nature of the semi.. but as the good lord says use it or lose it and never waste a semi.

Typically we observe these cyclical trends in the business.

&#x200B;

[Increased Cash Flow Efficiency](https://preview.redd.it/z17ralkm0vi61.png?width=1582&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f039a7d4b30c2e85ad4a589bdb2969759364ddc)

BESI is well positioned for upscaling, you need only observe their cashflow efficiency in previous semiconductor cycles. After a low period an observed strong rocket follows.  This time with the detachment of the cyclical business as a result of the war on semiconductors we will see continuous rocket ship.

Increase in margin over the previous years is a testament to their business model and the cash cow they have created.

In a letter sent to sleepy joe 18th Feb, SEMI, the industry association serving the global electronics design and manufacturing supply chain, and 16 organizations representing industries including automotive, medical and technology urged the Biden administration to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing and research. The letter calls for funding the initiatives authorized in the CHIPS for America Act and the enactment of a federal investment tax credit (ITC) for semiconductor manufacturing facilities and equipment that would quickly provide a significant, direct and transparent incentive to all companies investing in new and expanded semiconductor facilities in the United States. Without further support, the letter warned, the country‚Äôs:

>‚Äútechnology leadership is at risk‚Äù.

Pretty much nobody can hold a semi in their hand and it don't matter if you're Hank in his ranch, or Hawa in Timbuktu.  Everyone is gearing up, and this rocket ship is about to blast off.

**Share Repurchases**: \~ ‚Ç¨35million committed to share buybacks to programme extended until October 30, 2021. Increased to \~‚Ç¨10MM/quarter from \~‚Ç¨3MM/quarter.  == Strong confidence in their stonk.

**Dividend** \- 2.6% dividend, relatively moderate and hopefully appease some boomers. Typical capital allocation has a strong preference for share repurchases which is better for BESI share price.

**Lookahead**

* 20% market growth now estimated for 2021
* 36% growth forecast between 2020 to 2023E
* Strong secular market fundamentals:
   * 5G, Datacenter and AI are primary drivers
* New process technologies:
   * Hybrid bonding, CSP adoption as device geometries shrink further
* Revenue +30-40% for Q1-21
* Gross Margin 58-60% for Q1-21

**TLDR:** My argument is that the semiconductor industry has detached from it's previous cyclical traintracks due to the arising semiconductor war brewing between USA and Asia. I think this rocket ship is just fueling up and ready to blast off. As both sides scale up, money will flow towards the bottleneck in this industry: the assembly and manufacturing equipment - my answer to profit: BESI.

This is not financial advice I just like the stonk!

Before Covid supply chain was running smooth as a glove, think of it as a highway full of cars flowing at exact same speed and spaced equally. This supply chain was being perfected for over a decade. And then this shitstorm happened. The highway is clogged, ships are standing loaded with crap they cannot effectively unload quick enough, there aren\`t enough ships to move products that are needed. Including basic materials for industries and intermediate components to make a final product.

For those who don\`t know, there is an absolute chip shortage in the market right now. Spanning from AMD/NVDA CPUs and GPUs, to auto chips, to new consoles, and any kind of electronics. Even AAPL will have sales issues this quarter caused by the chip shortage.

The main chip producer TSMC is ramping up CAPEX to $28 billion, including $12 bn for their US plant.

The perfect storm is brewing for NVDA and AMD to gain enormously from this market, but in my opinion AMD will end up with upper hand, let me explain.

&#x200B;

1. Back in 2017/2018 year old GPUs were selling over on Amazon and elsewhere for double their MSRP. These were old graphic cards! their price should have depreciated over time, but didn\`t. Why? Cause of B T C. Miners were buying that shit by bulks. Guess what? We\`re at the exact same situation right now, except that price of that thingy is now $50k! and with new cards being more cost effective you wouldn\`t be able to buy ANY right now even if you wanted it to simply upgrade your PC and play something. As a matter of fact try to buy GTX 10xx or RTX 20xx gen on Amazon, there are NONE! So its not only the latest gen that\`s unavailable, its ALL of them. And CPUs have the exact same problem, which wasn\`t so bad in 2018. And soon you might find it impossible to buy even any laptop having latest chip: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156)
2. Not long ago NVDA announced $40 bn acquisition of ARM which would ensure they have access to state of the art IP which would make them future chip behemoth, and not surprisingly the largest companies in the world are now lobbying against that [https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns) . With this in mind, its becoming increasingly likely the acquisition wont go through. On the other hand, AMD replied with the acquisition of XLNX which seems wouldn\`t be such an issue considering AMD is way smaller than NVDA or INTC.
3. AMD and QCOM are actively lobbying US gov to address the issue, which they will. What to expect? Quite likely to remove previous trade policies regarding chips - resulting in easier access and higher/cheaper volume of chips being produced overseas. Which would mean AMD can ramp up production and meet the huge current demand of data centers and whoever needs their GPU. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage) . 
4. Price action - stocks follow certain pattern. They kinda wobble within some range for long period of time, 6-18 months, this is where a lot of accumulation by big players happen, and fundamentals kind of crystalize. Once the conditions are right, the stock can shoot 50% in a span of a month and then hover on new level for considerable time. Look at the chart of TSLA 2015-2019, NVDA numerous times, AMZN, GOOG, etc. Right now, NVDA is up already 20% in the last month. I believe the market will look from NVDA to AMD very soon, given points 2-3 and major holders wont be willing to sell for current price.

To recap what is the perfect storm. In 2017/18 chip shortage was caused mainly by A. the thing we dont mention here, right now its also B. new consoles cant be produced fast enough, C. supply chain issues which might be resolved soon, C. simply way bigger improvement in new CPUs/GPUs hence new upgrade cycle coupled with corporate upgrade cycle due to COVID

On Thursday, the CEOs of the major Chip producers (Intel, AMD, QCOM) have sent a letter to Biden that he should sent out an executive order to adress this shortage. ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage))

I see three different scenarios:

1. Biden gives an executive order to build improve and increase the domestic chip foundries. This would be most bullish for Intel, since they are the only company with foundries in the USA. This would also help AMD and QCOM, since they would most likely that access to cheaper chips.
2. Biden lifts the trade restrictions set on semiconductors. This would mean that AMD and QCOM would get access to cheaper chips, but it would not solve the shortage of silicon so it is unlikely to happen. This would be bullish for AMD and Qualcomm, but it would not change the situation for Intel.
3. Biden does not do anything and the shortage will continue. If Biden does this nothing will be changed, it will be neither good or bad from Intel and AMD. AMD will still keep growing at a massive rate and Intel will still be a cash cow.

So regardless of what happens, I am very bullish on the semiconductor industry. I expect Biden to start ramping up semiconductor manufacturing the USA, because of his tough stance on China. At the moment almost all of the semiconductor industry is relying on Taiwan, and with the Chinese involvement in that country, it is very likely that their is bipartisan support for increasing semiconductor manufacturing domestically.

Advice: if you want to play this, buy calls that are at least 2 to 3 months out, or buy shares.

Every huge company in the world is missing semiconductors: ""companies like Apple, Qualcomm, Sony, and AMD have all cited shortages in recent weeks, with effects ranging from part shortages for iPhones to the incredibly hard-to-find nature of the PlayStation 5 or AMD‚Äôs newest CPUs and GPUs. But in today‚Äôs increasingly connected world, a shortage of semiconductor chips impacts not only traditional technology industries, but also a wide-ranging list of other industries. Numerous automotive companies ‚Äî including Volkswagen, Fiat Chrysler, and Toyota ‚Äî have been forced to temporarily suspend vehicle production over the past several months. And Ford just announced that it would be pausing manufacturing on its most lucrative F-150 trucks earlier this month in the wake of chip shortages.""

All these companies are just begging for more semi-conductors, and $ON and others are almost completely out. When production starts ramping up again the huge demand will increase their earnings even more: THIS IS A LONG AND SHORT PLAY.

Alright listen up retards. NVDA is going to print at earnings. 

#Retard Analysis
Over the last three quarters, Nvidia EPS growth averaged 81%. They have earnings on the 24th, probably going to do well. CHRISTMAS could have some helpful effect as more people get into PC gaming. Especially with the shortage of PS5 and Xbox X that could have pushed some over the edge to switch. Regardless it would be a minor, but still positive impact. 

#Expanding Business 
Looking at Q3 2020 reports we can see some great news in expanding their business. Saw revenue and sales up 57%, a new record for them. 

* ""Launched the NVIDIA¬Æ EGX Intelligent Edge Computing Platform to bring accelerated AI to retail, manufacturing, telecommunications, logistics and other industries, with Walmart, BMW, NTT East, Procter & Gamble and Samsung Electronics among early adopters"". 
 
* USPS is going to use their AI tech to improve packaging process. 

* Loads of updates to software and companies adding RTX support showing they are becoming a standard in the industry. 

* The push forward on AI with self driving that is surely to increase going forward long term. 

* Their data center division revenue passed their gaming division and we all know data is the gold mine *PLTR autist PTSD*. Data center sales increased 162%.

#Red Hat
But the item im most interested in is the Red Hat collab they are starting. They are trying to get more involved with 5G telecom market by making virtualized 5G RAN networks using their GPUs. Retardedly put, they want to simplify how current telecom traffic works and make it more harmonized: to bring down maintenance and management costs; increase flexibility; allow multiple vendors to work on the same hardware and share resources. Further, Red Hat is going to become a major player in the cloud services industry. Azure and AWS just don't have the same capabilities as Red Hat's open source infrastructure and having a good relationship with NVDA looks great for future projects.   

#Semiconductor shortage easing
The world is coming off the end of a semiconductor shortage that was showing some recovery before COVID. Likely there will be no shortage going further into this year, maybe even early as Q2. Many of the car manufactures have been feeling the effects of the semi conductor shortage, even having to shut down factories temporarily before the situation improves. Bodes well for NVDA, supply is constricted and the pent up demand will blow its metaphorical load heavily at NVDA and other semis. 

#Bear case
The only hiccup: ARM merger deal is running into problems from anti-trust complaints by competitors. Likely to not happen when China reviews it and says no. The merger would make ARM US based and have the same US restrictions on exporting tech to Huawei or other blacklisted companies. Same thing happened with Qualcomm and N_X_P (automod removing small cap tickers) semiconductors. But on the off chance it does go through from both 1) The US taking a different stance towards China and 2) NVDA convincing regulators that ARM would still have impartiality for how it does business, the upside is massive. Not too concerned with it not happening since NVDA will adapt and move on. Its more of a bonus to NVDA and would only add to their underlying business that is already doing very good.

I believe Qualcomm has been brutally oversold. I expect a large rebound in the following months. 

Following their [most recent earnings report Q1 2021](https://investor.qualcomm.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001728949-21-000022/0001728949-21-000022.pdf) on the 4th of February their stock dropped 10% in 2 days. However, their earning report was strong and they maintain confidence that they will have a strong Q2 earnings too with an EPS of $1.65 (analysts were expecting an EPS of $1.57). The Q1 ER had an EPS of $2.17 per diluted share which is more than double their Q1 2020 $0.99 EPS. Although their ER beating high estimates of $8 billion in sales by an extra $200 million, [their licensing division brought in $1.35 billion of an estimated $1.43 billion.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/qualcomm-stock-earnings-chips-apple-51612390489) Their equipment and services division brought in $6.440 billion. They had an operating income of 2.5 billion.


Qcom has a healthy balance sheet with $7 billion in cash and very little short term debt. They do have $15 billion of long term doubt, which would be entirely covered by their cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. They can chip away at this debt slowly in this low interest period whilst focusing on R&D.


All sounds good, so why did the stock tumble so bad? I‚Äôve looked at different sources and have read that business analysts are worried about the limited manufacturing capacity across the semiconductor industry. However, I believe this is bullish. With demand higher than supply, it allows for the flexibility in price and larger profits whilst reinvesting back into manufacturing. Furthermore, I do not believe the dip is for this reason as other US chip producers such as Broadcom, Nvidia and the likes also are experiencing the same chip shortage and their stocks have not dipped in the same way. AMD has dipped in a similar way after beating earnings in true fashion and is showing signs of recovery which makes me bullish of a rebound. 

 It is possible the sell off may be due to [citi downgrading their PT to $165 from $194.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/qualcomm-stock-gets-a-downgrade-at-citi-after-earnings-2021-02-04) This is still higher than the current price by a bit but is slightly more bearish. Qualcomm has 77% of shares held by institutions, so you‚Äôd expect less volatility considering recently they have been loading up on shares, however, this data is prior to earnings. Updated figures on institutional holding reports are filed within 45 days after calendar quarter end - the 21st of March. [The most credible reason for the dip may be due to analysts having higher forecasts for the licensing division, however, I do believe the reaction has been very disproportionate especially when following EPS for the next quarter remains strong.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/04/why-qualcomm-stock-is-falling-today/)

Please [check out my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6fuy1/part_ii_option_analysis_and_the_situation_on_nok/) discussing the $NOK situation in detail with a focus on options. If you're interested in seeing more up these, follow my profile - I'll be making these posts daily leading up to the 04 February 2021 earnings report.

TL;DR at the bottom.

As I'm sure everyone is aware, several brokerages have blocked stocks like $NOK, $GME, $BB, $AMC, etc from being purchased. Most notably is Robinhood. Prices are going to take pretty significant hits due to what is some of the most blatant market manipulation in recent history.

I just wanted to briefly discuss Nokia's financials and how they compare to the overall 5G market as we move into the future. Why? Because it's important that we understand that $NOK isn't *just* a meme, it is a real company with legitimate prospective growth.

**I don't care how financially illiterate you may be, please read below. I will make it as short and simple as possible.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# The 5G Market

First, let's take a glance at the 5G market which Nokia is heavily involved in.

[Sources from World Economic Forum](https://preview.redd.it/07gw9c7r54e61.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=743acf5a433b00cce7fc32a489c2c5dbcfe96e8b)

Please check out [this document](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_Impact_of_5G_Report.pdf) if you're interested in the full read. **In short, growth in the 5G sector is going to occur rapidly over the next 15 years. The first part of that growth is infrastructure, which is exactly what Nokia does. Here is the official** [press release page](https://www.nokia.com/networks/5g/5g-press-releases/) **for Nokia 5G, where they have announced major infrastructure agreements.**

The compound annual growth rate of 5G is expected to be \~43% from 2021 to 2027.

# Financials

Okay, now let's go over the financials for Nokia and we'll compare it to Qualcomm, one if their biggest competitors with similar books. This data is from Yahoo Finance.

||[$QCOM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QCOM/financials?p=QCOM) (USD)|[$NOK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NOK/financials?p=NOK) (Converted to USD)|[$ERIC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ERIC/financials?p=ERIC) (Converted to USD)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Book Value|$35.594 Billion|$47.43 Billion|$33.146 Billion|
|Total Debt|$15.726 Billion|$6.43 Billion|$5.706 Billion|
|Repayment of Debt|$5.964 Billion|$542 Million|$836 Million|
|Free Cash Flow|$3.924 Billion|$2.35 Billion|$1.161 Billion|
|Net Revenue TTM|$2.744 Billion|$890 Million|$1.726 Billion|
|Operating Income|$3.503 Billion|$2.09 Billion|$2.72 Billion|
|**Market Value**|**$176 Billion**|**$22 Billion**|**$37 Billion**|

**What do these numbers actually mean?**

* Book Value - How much the company is worth based on the their assets.
* Total Debt - How much money they owe
* Repayment of Debt - How much they paid off in the last 12 months
* Free Cash Flow - How much extra money they company has to spend on growth/development
* Net Revenue - How much money they made in the last 12 months
* Operating Income - How much money is generated from business operations
* Market Value - What the companies value is according to the market

**What can we take from this data?**

Nokia is *very* similar to Qualcomm in the not to distant past. Nokia has a higher book value, less debt, and relatively better FCF. Why is the market value so much lower? Because Nokia has yet to generate earnings that would encourage growth - until now.

Well, sort of. Nokia has a big day coming up next week. **They will release their Q4 2020 earnings, which will be a huge indicator about the direction they are heading.** Expectations are generally quite high, and based on recent developments with Nokia, so are mine. More exciting is that, even if the Q4 2020 earnings aren't amazing, the prospects for 2021 are pretty awesome based on new business that Nokia has acquired. Again, I encourage you to [check out their press releases](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/newsroom/press-and-stock-exchange-releases/).

Ericsson is also very similar financially to Nokia and Qualcomm. Why should Nokia perform any better? Based on financial data alone, **Nokia's book value is more than twice its current market value**. Ericsson actually out-performs Nokia in many ways financially at the moment, but Nokia's current business developments and undervaluation lead me to believe that Nokia has significantly more potential for growth in the near future. I absolutely recommend looking at [Ericsson's press releases](https://www.ericsson.com/en/newsroom) to see what they're up to!

*Another user pointed out that I had failed to convert everything to USD. I have now corrected and converted everything, and included $ERIC in the comparison for a more fair evaluation. I also included operating income.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# TL;DR -

**Nokia's earnings report on 04 February 2021 could mean big shifts in the companies valuation in the short term. The long term prospects for Nokia are pretty fuckin' solid, no matter what happens.**

**Also, fuck Robinhood and TD.**

**Please consider filing a complain with the SEC** [here](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/Complaint.html).

**Or file a complaint with FINRA** [here](https://www.finra.org/investors/have-problem/file-complaint/complaint-center)**.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Disclaimer and my Holdings -

I currently own 10 of [these bad boys](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NOK210716C00005000?p=NOK210716C00005000). Those are $5 Call options that expire 16 July 2021. I'll be holding these for a while üöÄ.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-court-markman-ruling-favorable-113000670.html

Big move in PRKR today as the company reported a very favorable markman ruling in the $500 million patent infringement case against INTC in Texas.  Trial is set for the end of the year.  More importantly - the first QCOM trial is now just 3 months away ‚Äì finally in May there will be a reckoning!  Despite being fully aware of their infringement of PRKR‚Äôs designs, QCOM has been using PRKR‚Äôs patented tech for more than 10 years!  QCOM has refused to remove PRKR‚Äôs tech from their chips (they can‚Äôt figure out a way to do what PRKR invented any other way) and these chips are used in nearly 100% of all cell phones sold today.  This is called willful infringement.  Minimum damages in the QCOM case are estimated at $1.35 billion just in the US, willful damages would result in 3 X that amount.

QCOM‚Äôs legal strategy has been to delay the patent enforcement process as long as possible and hope that PRKR doesn‚Äôt survive to collect ‚Äì that strategy didn‚Äôt work!

&#x200B;

today i want to introduce you to Nokia #NOK. üöÄ

The year is 1865 in Finland ‚Äì NOK was founded. Our beloved God Elon didnt even exist as a sperm back then; nor did your boomer grandpa. NOK took vegetables and made paper out of it. Then they decided to make phones and computers. 

In 2014 NOK sold their phone business to Microsoft for billions. Microsoft sold it to HMD global. NOK still receives royalties for their name. So NOK is not a phone company anymore (do not confuse the 2 when researching). 

Today, NOK is far more advanced than making paper from paprika or selling undestructable phones. By taking over a joint-venture from Siemens in 2013, Alcatel-Lucent in 2015 and continuous work, aquisitions and research, they now pose as a major player in hardware and software for critical communication technology. More about this later.

5G - The economic future outlook is looking very juicy compared to NOK‚Äôs share price: 

NOK has a market share of 22%. Sure, Ericsson has 26, Huawei has 28.5%. But Huawei is kicked out of Europe, North America, and now many more.The list of countries banning Huawei is growing fast. Who is happy to take over, even in asia? (look at Singapore, partly Thailand f.e.) NOK, Samsung, Ericsson. NOK will have a pie of it. üöÄ

[https://www.channele2e.com/business/enterprise/huawei-banned-in-which-countries/](https://www.channele2e.com/business/enterprise/huawei-banned-in-which-countries/)

EV with autonomous driving will need 5G to be connected perfectly. Also autonomous traffic such as drones will rely on this heavily. Guess who produces infrastructure for this, and offers safe communication infrastructure solutions already tested? NOK. üöÄ

The finnish, norwegian and swedish governments already bought into NOK. 5G with secure critical infrastructure is a big deal.  

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-08/finland-is-building-its-nokia-stake-in-response-to-u-s-interest-ketqcpo7](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-08/finland-is-building-its-nokia-stake-in-response-to-u-s-interest-ketqcpo7)

What else? NOK is involved in cyber-security slightly similar to #BB BlackBerry. 

Nokia Smart Grid for securing power stations; Network security in general; IOT security and Railway infrastructure security.

5G will be developed faster than you think. According to Ericssons 2020 mobility report, 40% of all mobile internet subs will be 5G ‚Äì 3.5 billion users in 2026. You might think thats 6 years still, but remember that its 40% of all mobile subs, and where are 3.5bn of subs? Except EU and NA ‚Äì think China, India, South america, africa, south east asia. Massive numbers.

Research & Development: 

NOK is the flagship for 6G research in the EU.

I didnt look to far in research and development; NOK has claimed some 3000 patents for 5G, but Huawei is the leader right now. What seems interesting though is that NOK is ahead in confirmed patents. 

https://preview.redd.it/0m0suzawnwd61.png?width=815&format=png&auto=webp&s=635e3eeb409ada0404f6caae272b77066224c523

&#x200B;

The discussion about the patent leaders are diffuse. TwoBirds said that Ericsson was leading, with Huawei questioned as to if their numbers were legit. Qualcomm is also a major player. 

**My point though is that NOK‚Äôs stock is still flat,** while Qualcomm and the others significantly gained. (Except Huawei, political risk)

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

NOK is worth a buy IMO. Traffic of tomorrow will rely heavily on secure 5G infrastructure. NOK‚Äôs basic revenue is solid, cash flow positive. They will pay dividends, and are a big competitor in a growing sector. They will need their time though, they wont skyrocket next month. 

This is not a YOLO play. As u/ST_McD pointed out, NOK is not the next GME. I see good upside on this stock though, around 100% until next year. 

For 2 other good DD's on this, check u/ST_McD and u/zepherance. Special thanks to u/zepherance, I used some info from ur DD. 

&#x200B;

Position: long 4000 @ 3.85 Eur. Looking to get calls soon - 8c Jan 22. 

This is not financial advise, I'm not a bot and this is not distortion of GME - im holding.

BlackBerry Limited (NYSE:BB) JPMorgan‚Äôs 19th Annual Tech/Auto Forum Conference Call January 12, 2021 5:45 PM ET

Company Participants

Steve Rai - CFO

John Wall - Co-Head, BlackBerry Technology Solutions

Conference Call Participants

Samik Chatterjee - JPMorgan

Samik Chatterjee

Hi, good afternoon. I'm Samik Chatterjee, the analyst at JPMorgan here. For the next company at the tech forum, we have the pleasure of hosting BlackBerry. BlackBerry has transformed from a smartphone manufacturer to a leading security-focused enterprise software and services provider. The BlackBerry‚Äôs portfolio competes in a number of interesting markets, including cyber security, automotive software and critical event management.

Today, we will be focusing more on BlackBerry's automotive software, which is QNX. It is my pleasure to introduce Steve Rai, BlackBerry's Chief Financial Officer; and John Wall, BlackBerry's Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions. And thank you both, Steve and John for attending and participating in this conference. Look forward to an interesting discussion.

I will probably just start you off here, Steve, in a sense,* we- before we dive into Q&A for the benefit of investors, reengaging with the BlackBerry story, who probably know BlackBerry from a smartphone days more, can we just start with a high-level overview of the business today?

Steve Rai

Sure.* Thank you, and pleased to be here today. So, while we don't build phones anymore, we absolutely continue to leverage the strong software and security heritage of the company. Our trusted software platform, which we call Spark, can connect, secure and manage every endpoint in the IoT landscape.

So, it leverages next-gen threat protection, intelligent security, and provides a single pane of glass to manage the environment. Further, through AI and machine learning, it continues to get smarter and provides excellent return on investment. So, this area represents a $38 billion and growing addressable market.

Beyond securing enterprises, our solutions also enable critical infrastructure such as securing utilities, automotive safety through QNX, which as John will speak to, and securing people through our AtHoc critical event management solution.

We've got deep credentials which have been hardened in the regulated space. At nearly all of the G20 governments and top 10 global banks as well as the top 9 automotive OEMs, we've got them as customers. Our solutions are equally applicable and provide significant value to enterprises of all sizes.

So, I believe all this and the strong financial position of the company, of course, sets us up very well to serve the markets that we‚Äôre in*. And it plays right into the macro trends that we're seeing, including an ever-increasing mobile and work-from-anywhere workforce, rapid IoT proliferation, and an ever-increasing threat landscape, which, of course, the unprecedented cyberattacks of 2020 underscore, and the evolution of vehicles and smart city infrastructure that John Wall will speak to.

Question-and-Answer Session

Q - Samik Chatterjee

So, before I kind of move on to some of the other markets, let's kind of hit on QNX and the inbuilt software offering here. For those who are less familiar with QNX, John, maybe if you can kind of explain what it does, that would be helpful?

John Wall

Absolutely, I'd love to. So, QNX has two, what I would call, foundational products. One is the real-time operating system called Neutrino, and the other is our hypervisor that provides virtualization of CPUs. Both are microkernel-based. These are deeply embedded products that are particularly suited to safety critical applications.

We've been able to reach the highest level of certifications for both those foundational products in the automotive field, medical and industrial. We've achieved ISO 26262 ASIL D and we've achieved 61508 ASIL C and -- ASIL 3, sorry, which is the highest level of safety. And that means that our products are designed for mission-critical. In automotive, in particular, that means our products are designed for things that control steering, braking, anything that controls the vehicle.

So, examples of this within automotive is obviously ADAS, which is active safety, digital cockpit, which is a new trend where we are seeing the consolidation of infotainment systems and other in-cabin functions such as digital cockpits, get consolidated to one hardware module and using our virtualization to separate safety and non-safety systems, the infotainment being non-safety. But also in other markets such as MRI scanners for medical, medical robotics, nuclear power plants, oil and gas. So, if you've ever seen a wind turbine on your travels across various parts of the world, more than likely QNX is running in those systems to control the pitch of the blade, which is very important for keeping the system stable. So, those are just a few examples.

Samik Chatterjee

Got it. John, you did mention kind of the safety aspect becoming one of the key enablers here. Maybe if you can broadly hit on what are the overall trends in autos and kind of where and how are those impacting QNX's addressable market?

John Wall

Absolutely. So, I mean, I think everybody is aware of the macro trends. We have connectivity. Cars are getting more connected. We have electrification and we have automation, so autonomous drive or levels towards autonomous drive. So, what we're seeing within a vehicle is software is starting to play a bigger and bigger role. There are some studies that say that by 2030, 50% of the vehicle's BOM will be electronics, and of that, 30% would be software.

So, what we're seeing as a trend is the car today is made up of a lot of what we call ECUs, and these are electronic control units. And these today are typically single function. So, you can think about it in terms of door locks is an ECU, my transmission controller is an ECU, my digital instrument cluster is an ECU, and so on and so on.

So, what we're starting to see within a car is a consolidation of these ECUs into what we call domain controllers. And domain controllers will handle multiple functions on one module. And these domain controllers are typically high-performance compute platforms. So, when you think of these, you think of Qualcomm, Samsung, NVIDIA, things that would run in your computer or things that would run in your smartphone. And this is a sweet spot for QNX, since the QNX products run on high-performance compute platforms, not on the lower end 8-bit and 16-bit single function ECUs.

Now, as more of these systems migrate to these domain controllers, there's an element of safety that's required because these things are either controlling chassis, they're controlling functions within the vehicle. Outside of the infotainment, most of these modules have a safety function. So, this again is a sweet spot for QNX.

We saw this trend developing four or five years ago, maybe five* or six years ago. We saw that infotainment was moving more and more to Android, but we also saw that the car was moving towards this grouping of domain controllers. And we knew there would be an opportunity to get more in the vehicle, more software sockets within the vehicle. So, we really started focusing our efforts on safety and security knowing that as the car evolves, we have more opportunities within the vehicle to hit many more modules as opposed to just infotainment, for instance.

Samik Chatterjee

Got it. You recently announced BlackBerry IVY, a co-development and co-marketing agreement with AWS. So, how is this different to what QNX is currently doing?

John Wall

Actually, this is quite different from what QNX has been doing traditionally. So, we announced IVY, which is the intelligent vehicle everywhere. So, IVY is a cloud-connected and cross platform that is multi-OS, multi-cloud, in-car software that allows automakers to access a vehicle sensor data in compliance with safety and security requirements to process that data with updatable code to create new vehicle insights and then share those insights with developers through a consistent and simple in-car API mechanism.

So, essentially, what we've done here is we've looked at how do we make vehicles look common from an API perspective? How do we access vehicle data in a way that is consistent from car brand to car brand? This is a very tall order, because vehicles are still pretty bespoke as far as their electrical architectures. No two cars from different OEMs look exactly the same. They use different sensors. They have different architectural layouts.

So, the idea with IVY is to create a middleware, I would say, translator that goes into the vehicle. At the bottom end of IVY, we are talking directly to sensors within the vehicle. But then, we use either machine learning or other processing to normalize that data into what we call synthetic sensors.

And as an example that I'd like to you look at is if you think of a smart city and you think of a smart city that wants to know the conditions of their roads during the winter, a synthetic sensor within a vehicle could be a combination of wheel, speed sensor, antilock brake sensor, temperature sensor and potential camera input. And with those four sensors, you could normalize the data into a synthetic sensor that would allow the smart city to know, do I have an icing condition? Do I have cars slipping in a certain part of my route?

Now, imagine the power of this, if the way to access that data was consistent from carmaker to carmaker. So, the real power behind IVY is to make sure that we grow an ecosystem that allows scale and allows app developers to create common applications, smart cities to access common data across different car brands. And so, the idea here is to ensure that the carmakers have the best ability to monetize their data or to save money by being able to do things like analytics of how their cars are behaving on the road. The idea is to grow an ecosystem that will become a de facto standard in the industry.

Samik Chatterjee

What is the level of commitment that it slightly* brings to this, particularly -- I mean, obviously, I'm guessing investors will be looking at what‚Äôs the level of commitment of AWS to this?

John Wall

Right. So, it's a 50-50 joint development. And something I didn't stress enough in the last question, just to be clear, this is OS and cloud agnostic. No dependency on AWS cloud and no dependency on QNX. This is truly a generic piece of middleware to create this ecosystem. So, obviously, we're doing development on QNX. We expect QNX to be the high runner within the vehicle because of our dominant position in the car. I mean, this is part of the reason that AWS is very interested in working with us.

We have a very good pedigree. We're in over 175 million cars. We've been doing this. This is our bread and butter as working within the vehicle. We have exceptional record of delivery. We've never held up a start-up production, and we have very, very strong relationships with the top automakers.

Now, obviously, AWS is a leading cloud provider. They're an unrivaled provider of ML tools. So, they have a lot of the data expertise to do analysis of the data to create these synthetic sensors. And first and foremost, they're a massive company that has the ability to drive an app ecosystem.

From a commitment perspective, it's -- as I mentioned earlier, it's a 50-50 development. This type of a relationship with Amazon is very rare. They do this with customers. They don't typically do this with partners. I think, we have a very, very strong alignment on the direction of IVY with the exact same goals, and that's to drive this ecosystem and to provide an app ecosystem within the vehicle and off the vehicle that is common across OEMs and brands. And I think that is really the thread that binds us.

Samik Chatterjee

If I kind of think back almost like three, four years ago, I do kind of remember some start-up companies, private companies that were trying to harmonize the data across coming from different vehicles. So, are companies already doing this? Why would IVY be different on this front?

John Wall

Yes. That's a great question, and there are lots of companies doing this. This is -- we haven't invented anything new here. Carmakers are very interested in monetizing their data. They know there's a lot of value in their data, especially as the car continues to evolve towards autonomous drive and active safety, lots of sensors within the vehicle, one of the most complex IoT endpoints. So, they know there's a lot of value in their data.

I think, the challenge has been, each carmaker is creating a bespoke solution, and there's really no scale to it. And since there is no scale or very little scale, it creates I think a challenge to really get application developers out there ideating on what the next big thing could be. I think, you'd like to be able to see the ability to leverage the ecosystem from the phone. Lots of people have great ideas out there. And I think the more people that have the ability to access this ecosystem, the more great ideas the carmakers will get.

I think, the other challenge with some of the bigger players in this area has been ownership of the data. So, from -- right from the beginning, BlackBerry and Amazon have made it very clear. We have no desire to own the data and we have no desire to control the data. That's solely in the hands of the OEM. And that's really not an area that we're looking to get involved. The real purpose of this collaboration is to create that de facto ecosystem that will really get the ecosystem out there, developing ideas and applications that are going to be cool for the car.

Samik Chatterjee

So, I have like almost 15 questions here, and since I have 15 minutes remaining, let me start tackling some of them. So, let me start with the ones that relate to IVY. A couple of similar ones. What do you think the TAM is that IVY will open up for carmakers? And on similar lines, there is a question which is -- give me one -- yes, when do you intend to provide tangible color around the commercial opportunity that IVY represents? So, I'll let you guys tackle those two together.

John Wall

Steve, do you want to take that?

Steve Rai

Yes, I'll start. So, the first vehicles to have IVY are expected to come out in 2023. So naturally, leading up to that time, we expect to be engaged with the OEMs and potentially with Tier 1, Tier 2 suppliers working on this and generating professional services revenues along the way. We're targeting a subscription or usage-based model, in other words, building a recurring revenue stream. And so, that's sort of the time frame I think to address that part of the theme.

Samik Chatterjee

Two follow-up questions on IVY and more related to automakers. So, again, I'll just combine them for everyone's benefit here. Is BlackBerry QNX or IVY going to be in the new vehicles that NVIDIA and NIO will be working on together? The second question on similar lines is IVY something Tesla will consider?

John Wall

Yes. Those are great questions. Obviously, I think, everybody -- I think, most people know we have a very strong relationship with NVIDIA as we announced a few years ago that QNX is the foundational OS of their DRIVE OS offering. I don't know that we can make any comments at the moment about specific OEMs as we made the announcement on December 1st. What I can say is the reaction by OEMs to the announcement has been overwhelming. We've already had a workshop with one OEM prior to Christmas.

So, there is a lot of excitement about the ability to create this ecosystem. When people think about the ecosystem in the past, they've thought about, well, the carmakers are going to have to get together, they're going to have to create a kind of a unified architecture for the vehicles to be able to create this ecosystem. Try to think of it kind of in terms of iOS or Android -- not iOS or Android, but something like that, but that's appropriate to the automobile. This is kind of really taking -- this is really looking to take a shortcut and really create that app ecosystem before the car makers have had the ability to necessarily unify their architectures.

To the point of Tesla, Tesla could definitely be a customer of this.

Samik Chatterjee

Okay. Is it possible to implement back into the captive market of 175 million QNX current users? So, I'm guessing they are -- it's asking about IVY. So, is it -- yes, so is it possible to implement IVY back into the captive market of QNX users?

John Wall

Absolutely. I mean that‚Äôs -- in a lot of cases, that's the intent. There are very few carmakers that we are not working with, especially today when we look at our move towards more of safety software within more modules within the vehicle, especially when it comes to ADAS, autonomous drive, chassis control, digital cockpit. We're very dominant in the digital cockpit market. So, I believe that, that's obviously going to be the case, but I also think it's going to open up new customers. And I mean, that's a very strong reason why we made this OS independent and cloud agnostic is we wanted to address our current customers, but we also wanted to address carmakers that are not our customers that are running different operating systems or have different architectures or have different cloud solutions. We wanted this to go to our existing customers and to open up new customers.

Samik Chatterjee

Got it. A ton of new questions on QNX, but before I get to that, one question that came in is the patents for sale, which kind of coincides with a news release, I think I saw saying that BlackBerry‚Äôs selling to 90 patents to Huawei. And I'll just give you an opportunity to answer that question as well as comment in terms of anything that's been announced recently.

Steve Rai

So, if that question is referring to what has been in the press in terms of some of the broader rumors about the portfolio, I'm not going to comment on those rumors. Regarding Huawei, there was a very small number of patents that are no longer relevant to the business. So, small sale, not part of our recurring transaction. And certainly, it was permitted under the applicable rules. So that's it.

Samik Chatterjee

So, moving to QNX, let me take this one. Could you outline the content per vehicle opportunity for QNX on an EV and separately on AV? And if you don't want to give dollar per car, could you suggest the number of QNX RTOS, I apologize, I don't know the acronym and hypervisor installs for EV and AV versus internal combustion engine vehicles. So, essentially, I think, in a nutshell content for vehicle for QNX on EV and AV separately?

John Wall

Yes. I don't know that I really look at them all that separately. One has a battery manager, one has an engine controller. I think -- so I'll try to answer it more generally speaking, and then I will make a comment to EVs. So, generally speaking, the ability for QNX to be used in more places within the vehicle is what drove our decision to focus on safety.

Traditionally, if you look back at where QNX was playing in automotive 10 years ago, the opportunity was typically a telematics box, an OnStar or an infotainment unit. And at the time, we were very dominant in infotainment and in telematics. If you -- so you kind of add two potential sockets there that we were fighting for, and for the most reason, those were the most -- those were the two high-performance compute platforms with telematics box and the infotainment box. I think as we see this consolidation of ECU to domain controllers, the opportunity has gone up dramatically. You have domain controllers that are handling gateway. So, you have a gateway functionality within the vehicle, you can do that almost like a router, that's going to manage safety systems and non-safety systems within the vehicle, the different buses. You have chassis controllers, you have ADAS controllers, you autonomous drive controllers. You have the digital cockpit, which is probably the first consolidation that's been happening within the vehicle, where we're taking cabin functions such as digital instrument cluster and infotainment and merging that onto one high-performance compute platform, using our hypervisor.

So, I think, without actually throwing out numbers, as far as the dollar amount, from an opportunity within the vehicle, there is definitely going from 2 or 3 opportunities to 5 or 6 or 7 opportunities within the vehicle. To us with IVY is just one more, a different function.

Now, having said that, from an EV perspective, I think we put a status during earnings before Christmas that I believe we're in 19 of 25 of the top EV producers and that we have a 61% market share of working with EV customers. And one of the reasons that EV is interesting is in a lot of cases, it's clean sheet. They're starting with new architectures, and they're able to move to these new domain controller type architectures more quickly.

Samik Chatterjee

Is Automotive Grade Linux a strong competitive threat? Who is the most significant competitive threat in terms of the auto ecosystem? And how is QNX superior to these over time?

John Wall

Right. So, I would say that we have two groupings of competitors. We have the traditional under-the-hood safety-based operating systems. And those are Green Hills and Wind River. Green Hills is very well-known in aerospace and defense, and so is Wind River. I think, we've been quite successful against those two.

And then, on the other side of the spectrum coming more from consumer side and coming more from high-performance compute platform, you have Linux in all forms, whether it's AGL or Ubuntu or something else. It doesn't really matter.

Now, the advantage that QNX has over Linux is that those Linux distributions are not safety certified. Safety certification is a lot of work. It's very hard to achieve. It's especially hard to achieve when you look at a product like Linux that -- part of the beauty of Linux as it moves very fast, and it's contributed to by the community. But that's also -- it's Achilles‚Äô heel when it comes to safety because safety requires due diligence around safety cases, design, knowing the providence of where the software came from, a lot of testing, a lot of impact analysis.

So I mean, our view is we take all the competition seriously. And we're just trying to continue to push our product forward to be better performance and a higher level of safety against all our competitors. And we believe that will help keep us in the lead.

Samik Chatterjee

In the couple of minutes we have remaining, let's take a couple of questions on IVY here. First question, and I‚Äôll again kind of club them together. How will the IVY app store ecosystem be monetized? And then, a second question, can you talk about the dollar investment and the time investment, how are you splitting that as it relates to development of IVY?

John Wall

I'll answer the second piece first. As I mentioned earlier, it's a 50-50 investment by both, Amazon and BlackBerry. It's a significant investment. But, we're not providing any numbers. But, there is a significant investment in doing this.

As far as monetizing from the OEMs and the app store and how that's going to look, we're just starting to have those conversations with the OEMs. I don't know that we have a clear picture on this. Based on the discussions we've had with the OEMS, we know there's a lot of value there. And the idea of providing a more comprehensive and more standardized SDK and API across car brands is only going to make that more valuable. But, we haven't gotten into all the nuts and bolts of what this is going to look like, except that we know that the OEM is going to control the data, and it's going to control the access to the data.

**Samik Chatterjee
**
Okay. Last one, let me squeeze this one in. Where do you see the biggest catalyst for your loyal shareholders?

**Steve Rai
**
Well, I think, the trends that I spoke to in my opening comments are really what position -- all of the Company's technology, the way that it's come together and the drivers that we have play in very directly to these trends, and the trends being proliferation of IoT, security, all of the concepts that John described in the auto sector as well as the general embedded space. And those are things that the Company is just ideally suited for in terms of the expertise and the solutions that we have.

Samik Chatterjee

Great. That's all we have time for. Steve and John, thank you both for taking the time to attend the conference. And it was a pleasure hosting you and great discussion. Thank you.

I worked for this company way long ago. Mostly interns work there but that‚Äôs how they reduce cost.

Blackberry is not the Blackberry you used to know before. They have a new highly profitable unit called QNX which is into developing embedded softwares for Autonomous Vehicles and EV stuff.

Apart from that, they are into creating security softwares for government. For example, Korean government is high paying permanent client.

If that‚Äôs not enough, they are going after all the companies who copied their patents. They are leaving not a single fucking company even if they copied a mere of an emoticon style. Seems like (sorta) this is now a side-income revenue model for them as they don't sue for shit. They sue for near billion amount.

For example this one, [https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/12/blackberry-awarded-815-million-in-arbitration-case-against-qualcomm.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/12/blackberry-awarded-815-million-in-arbitration-case-against-qualcomm.html)

While I was there they won a lawsuit against Qualcomm (another billion dollar company) and won over 815 million dollars in compensation.

Now, they won against Facebook. I am not sure but they sued Snapchat as well for fully copying their messaging features.

I attended all the town-halls given by John Chen, and he is fucking awesome guy.

In my opinion, they are gonna crush their March Earning's calls. And, there would be a surge right after that. From all three quarterly townhalls, the April ones are generally more exciting and good news types.

It's not just some Canadian company. They have offices all over the world.

There‚Äôs lot of growth potential. I am giving this boy a PT of 100$+ EOY.

If you‚Äôve been on this subreddit or know anything about meme stocks, you know about the stocks that have skyrocketed recently. GME, AMD, PLTR, AAPL, TSLA, NVIDIA, CRSR, etc. 

There is a stock that almost all the big tech companies, EV companies, and meme stocks had in common. TSM

If you don‚Äôt know what TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing) makes computer chips. You definitely own at least one TSM chip, whether you know it or not. 

Here is a list of a few of the companies that manufacture their chips with TSMC: (from [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20leading%20fabless%20semiconductor%20companies%20such,such%20as%20Allwinner%20Technology%2C%20HiSilicon%2C%20Spectra7%2C%20and%20Spreadtrum.))

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Apple Inc., Nvidia, Intel, Qualcomm, Xilinx,  Altera,Texas Instruments. 

It would take me years to research every single product that TSMC manufactures, but here are a few of the most significant ones that I found:


AMD:All AMD chips are manufactured by TSM any reason to buy AMD is also a reason to buyTSM 
   AMD CPU‚Äôs: This also includes AMD Ryzen Processors which are the most bought CPUS on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computers-Accessories-Computer-CPU-Processors/zgbs/pc/229189) As well as the processors that go into many laptops. 
   AMD Graphics Cards: Apple uses AMD Graphics card in their Mac products. They are also in many windows PC‚Äôs and laptops, and they are used by miners. 
   Xbox/PlayStation Internals: The PS5 and Xbox Series both use AMD CPU‚Äôs and Graphics, which are manufactured by TSM. 

Apple: Apple manufactures All of its processors at TSM. TSM made chips are in every iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, Air Pod, etc. the new M1 Apple in house silicon Macs are also made by TSM. 

Nvidia: Nvidia is the world largest GPU company. They also make self driving processors for Tesla, Nio and other companies. 

Qualcomm: Qualcomm makes Arm processors. Qualcomm processors power everything from Samsung phones to smart TV‚Äôs to Amazon Alexa. 

Xilinx: they make most of the 5G processors that go in towers and phones. Samsung Phones use Xilix cellular chips. 

Texas Instruments: they make your fucking calculator. 

There are many many more companies that TSM manufactures chips for. They are also on a more advanced process mode than any other company in the world. Do some of your own research and find out what other products TSM makes. 

See how many products in your life are powered by TSM. 

Chances are, A TSM manufactured chip could be inside your phone, your computer, your TV, your smart speaker and other smart home devices, your wifi router, your cars radio/gps, your cars self driving system (if your car has it). Your wireless headphones, the cell tower in your neighborhood. Even your calculator.

The ‚Äúcloud‚Äù is also powered by TSM. The servers that google, Amazon, one drive, Spotify, Palantir, etc. 

If you can find just one area of technology that does not, at some point, use TSM manufacturing, comment it below.

**Intro:**

Most people look at Blackberry (formerly known as RIM) as a dead cellphone company. A company that‚Äôs basically a prehistoric dinosaur at this point with a small cybersecurity portfolio left of their business. Their inability to adapt against cell phone companies such as Apple & Android vendors has caused their main revenue driver to plummet into non-existence. However, their business has been able to keep afloat in the past few years due to their competitive advantages around cybersecurity. Many government officials & corporations till this day still use QNX from BB as their mobile/security platform due to these advantages.

**Word on the street:**

Around last year summer, word on the street was that BB is looking to partner with Amazon on a EV platform around data sensors, automation, and cybersecurity. Stock prices at the time was around $4-6 CAD. Just looking at financials alone and the amount of $ revenue they bring in compared to the industry standards, $BB stock price seemed quite undervalued in comparison. However, this made sense since $BB has failed to deliver and disappointed shareholders over the past years.

Whether we‚Äôd like to believe it or not -- EV (electric vehicle) is the future in the next 5 years. Whether that is one day where we run out of fossil fuel‚Ä¶ or people moving towards environmentally friendly options, there is much to be explored and the market is relatively immature.

In today‚Äôs world, every automotive company is chasing EV currently and wants to avoid becoming the next ‚ÄúBlockbuster‚Äù prehistoric company. The question we need to ask next is, ‚ÄúDo they have the necessary tools & solutions to help them transition in that journey?‚Äù To answer this, I will give a quick example. Most farmers do not build a tractor to farm their crops. They instead go out and buy one than to waste precious time seeing their crops die. I believe this holds true for automotives as they lack the necessary skill sets to develop a platform that can run cybersecurity, data sensors, and automation for their cars. If you didn‚Äôt know already, popular car services such as Apple‚Äôs CarPlay and Google‚Äôs Android Auto all already operate on top of QNX today in our cars today. Amazon‚Äôs partnership will only help accelerate that movement as QNX will be linked to their public cloud to do over-the-air monitoring, upgrade, security, collision crashing assistance, autonomous driving, AI machine learning, and many many more.

**What‚Äôs happened recently**:

Well‚Ä¶ their partnership with Amazon came true around December. In addition to this, they‚Äôve sold off their üí© cell phone patents to Huawei so they can finally focus purely on Cybersecurity and EV.

Icing to the cake, they‚Äôve recently won a settlement against Facebook so they gotta pay up that $$$ to $BB which hasn‚Äôt been reflected in their quarterly report yet.

SpaceX, Zoom, Qualcomm, governments, and many more are working with $BB as we speak today. Sony recently just announced their partnership with $BB for their next upcoming car last week. Overall, lots of exciting news back to back.

This explains the excitement around $BB and why it‚Äôs been taking off recently. I believe they will continue to do so as the EV and Cybersecurity market continues to evolve from its infancy. (With other digital ""currencies"" growing, would there be a bigger cybersecurity play for $BB? Who knows)

**So.. what are the Risks:**

3 things I can think of currently:

1. No Revenue Growth despite all of the above
2. EV doesn‚Äôt take off as much as it should. COVID is impacting sales of cars or sales of anything in general. Self-explanatory there
3. Someone creates a better platform over $BB

This all depends if $BB is capable of hiring great salespeople to execute on their job. Only time will tell.

**TLDR; In Conclusion**

Most boomers will avoid $BB because they think it‚Äôs a cellphone company. Anyone that‚Äôs googled it recently will know that this isn‚Äôt true. I personally think $BB is very undervalued and with the reasons I‚Äôve explained above, I feel there‚Äôs much potential for the company to grow. Lots of people are going to be selling it when there‚Äôs a bit of a profit but I think the company‚Äôs barely scratched it‚Äôs potential.

Finally, the ret‚Ä¶.s WSB from reddit are using lingos such as ‚Äúto the moon‚Äù and ‚ÄúRockets üöÄüöÄ‚Äù for $BB so we all know people are dumping hard on this to make it the next big thing.

Here's why:

TSMC was founded in 1987 with the intent of bringing Taiwan into the global tech market. Morris Chang, who previously worked at Texas Instruments for over 30 years, is the founder and former CEO of TSMC and widely regarded as the ""godfather of computer chips"". TSMC is currently the world's largest semiconductor producer, with over half of semiconductor revenue from TSMC. Other notable competitors include GlobalFoundries (AMD used them for Zen and Zen+, switching to TSMC for Zen 2 and Zen 3), Intel, and Samsung. TSMC is a pioneer in the pure-play foundry business, meaning that they do not produce any chips for their own products. Instead, they manufacture and sell chips to companies, meaning that those who choose to source chips from TSMC do not have to build expensive silicon fabrication plants to manufacture their own chips. TSMC currently operates 10 different silicon fabs, manufacturing over 10,000 different products using over 250 distinct technologies to cater to 499 different customers in 2019.

Not only is TSMC the largest semiconductor foundry, it is also a pioneer in advancing semiconductor production and performance. Currently, TSMC has 7 customers for its new 5nm chips, including Apple, for A14/X chips and ARM-based chips for Mac products, Qualcomm and MediaTek for 5G smartphone chips, AMD, for next-generation Zen 4 CPUs, Bitmain, Intel, and NVIDIA. TSMC is also currently engineering its N4 chips, built on a 4nm process node, its 3nm chips, and its 2nm chips, which will use new GAAFET (Gate All Around Field Effect Transistor) technology instead of the traditional FinFET technology.

**So who are some of TSMC's biggest and most notable customers?**

# Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Apple is the world's largest company in terms of market capitalization (2.17 Trillion), and has become widely popular due to its heavy and cohesive integration between its products and widespread use by many prominent figures. Currently, it offers many products such as laptops, phones, smart watches, smart TV products, fitness products, and more. It also offers many services and software products, which all integrate with each other via iCloud, continuity software such as Handoff, and more. Recently, Apple has confirmed that they are cutting support for Intel CPUs on their Mac products in a few years, meaning they will shift to using entirely Apple Silicon chips for all of their Mac products. This is in addition to Apple using their own chips for all other products that they currently produce - iPhones, iPads, smart watches, etc.

Apple is one of TSMC's largest customers, and that is only expected to grow as they ramp up production for their M1 and next generation ARM chips for Macs. Apple's M1 chips are a strong competitor to AMD and Intel CPUs, especially if they can scale well up to 32 and 64 cores. They are extremely efficient and consume drastically less power than x86-based CPUs (Intel and AMD CPUs), meaning that thermal requirements are much lower. Macs have typically been targeted by PC enthusiasts as an overpriced, underperforming lineup, but we may see that change as Apple's new chips perform extremely well.

Apple reported a yearly revenue of 274.5 billion US Dollars in 2020, roughly a 5% increase from 2019. Since Apple relies on TSMC for their chips, and Apple's Mac lineup is likely to become more popular, I would expect that TSMC's revenue from Apple will increase more than we've seen in previous years.

# Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)

AMD has certainly made a huge return since Lisa Su became CEO in 2014 and the production of Ryzen, which was widely popular due to its high core counts and high price to performance compared to Intel. Now, Ryzen has developed into a strong all-around player, sporting high core counts and great single thread performance. Currently, AMD Ryzen 5000 desktop CPUs outperform Intel's current generation Comet Lake CPUs in games, which is the first time that AMD has surpassed Intel in gaming performance.

AMD has slowly been regaining market share, both in the PC enthusiast side and the server side. In the past two years, AMD has doubled their server market share from 4.5% to 8%. This may not seem like much, but considering that server upgrades are not frequent and those who buy Intel server CPUs are more likely to stick with Intel, that is a massive increase. On the PC enthusiast side, AMD CPUs have accounted for 84% of CPUs sold on mindfactory.de, a German PC Retailer. This is a massive increase considering that in 2016, before the release of Ryzen, Intel accounted for roughly 75% of CPU sales on mindfactory.de.

AMD launched their Zen 3 chips in 2020, which was followed by huge demand and a shortage of these CPUs. This was in part due to demand at TSMC not being able to keep up with AMD's orders. Zen 3 CPUs perform extremely well, and next-generation Zen 4 CPUs, which will be on TSMC's 5nm process, point to a shortage of fab space at TSMC.

# Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)

Qualcomm is a semiconductor company that creates wireless technology chips, CPUs, software, and services related to wireless technology. Their most prominent products include their Snapdragon CPUs, used in phones from some of the largest smartphone companies such as Samsung, LG, OnePlus, Xiaomi, Motorola, and more. They also produce application specific processors for things like cameras, IoT devices, kiosks, robots, and a lot more. Additionally, Qualcomm offers desktop CPUs, such as their Snapdragon 8cx. Qualcomm also produces various connectivity chips for things such as WiFi (onboard chips in laptops, desktop Wifi cards, routers, modems, etc), Bluetooth, and internet connectivity chips on smartphones.

Currently, Qualcomm relies on TSMC for the production of its Snapdragon chips. Although Samsung beat out TSMC for the production of Qualcomm's upcoming 5G chips, mobile chips accounted for 44.8% of Qualcomm's total revenue in 2020, while RF Front End chips (smartphone internet connectivity chips) accounted for just 9.8% of Qualcomm's total revenue.

# NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)

NVIDIA has been a long time customer of TSMC, dating all the way back to 1998 when NVIDIA switched over to TSMC's 350nm process for the Riva TNT. Since then, TSMC has manufactured nearly every NVIDIA chip up until RTX 3000 series, also known as Ampere. NVIDIA decided to switch to Samsung's 8N 8nm process node, likely due to financial reasons or fab capacity reasons.

However, NVIDIA is allegedly moving back to TSMC to manufacture more Ampere GPUs using their 7nm process. There could be a few reasons for this - TSMC might have offered NVIDIA a deal, or capacity for 7nm fabs may have opened up due to large customers such as Apple and AMD shifting more focus towards TSMC's 5nm process.

NVIDIA's RTX 3000 series GPUs, also known as Ampere, are a massive improvement in the GPU space compared to previous generations and just for performance in general. The RTX 3070 performs similarly to an RTX 2080ti, where the former has an MSRP of 499 USD and the latter has an MSRP of 999 USD. In addition to much greater price/performance, Ampere GPUs also heavily increase ray tracing performance so games that can take advantage of ray tracing hardware are actually playable. They are extremely popular, and currently Ampere GPUs are selling anywhere from 200 to upwards of 1500 dollars of their MSRP. NVIDIA is also huge in the AI/Computing space, teaming up with NIO for AI-based self-driving computation, Photoshop, for neural filters, and also  powers some of the fastest supercomputers in the world. In regards to AMD, NVIDIA blows the new RX 6000 series GPUs out of the water for things like streaming performance and workstation performance.

# Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)

While Intel has traditionally manufactured most of their products (Internet connectivity products, processors, chipsets, etc), Intel is reportedly shifting a fair amount of their chips to TSMC. Recently, Intel announced they would use TSMC for 7nm Xe graphics chips on their CPUs. In October of 2020, Intel CEO Bob Swan said Intel would decide by January whether it was going to expand its 7nm production, outsource it to a foundry, or both. Intel has severely underperformed in the CPU space compared to AMD, but if they decide to shift some production to TSMC, this could mean that Intel will make a strong return into the CPU space and strong entry into the GPU space.

# Cool, but what does this mean?

Again, TSMC is the largest foundry, outclassing the likes of Samsung, GlobalFoundries, and other similar companies. There is an insane amount of demand for TSMC's chips, and they are extremely competitive compared to other manufacturers. TSMC has customers such as Apple, AMD, and Qualcomm, which all have great products and are only expected to grow with the release of new technology such as CPUs or 5G networking. Many of its customers are expected to have massive growth over the coming years, meaning that TSMC will reap some of those profits.

# Ok, but why should I buy now?

I mean, TSMC is already up over 100% over the past year, isn't it too late to buy in?

When you consider its most important clients, all of them are going to use TSMC for future products that are important to their respective segments. Apple has just begun their venture into producing their own CPUs for Mac products, the release of DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 is right around the corner with AMD's Zen 4 processors, set to release late 2021 or 2022, Qualcomm producing next generation Snapdragon CPUs (and we may see 5G production shifted to TSMC), Intel actually producing competitive CPUs once again (which might be with TSMC), and NVIDIA continuing to dominate in the computing space and the GPU space. Considering that all of these things are happening in the next few years, TSMC is getting ready to take off.  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ

TL;DR: TSMC has a lot of very large customers (Apple, AMD, QualComm to name a few) which are all producing technology that looks very promising. All of these things are coming up in the future, which mean that TSMC is going to the moon. BUY CALLS AND LEAPS LET'S GOOOOOO
