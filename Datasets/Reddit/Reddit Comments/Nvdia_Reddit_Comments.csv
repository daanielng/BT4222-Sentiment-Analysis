I'm not into deep conspiracies. I'll make it very simple. 

If, IF there really is some henous underground deep conspiracy behind GME, AMC, and CLOV, etc. What on earth makes you think these people will ever play by the rules and allow a full squeeze like people are hoping for? If they're already doing illegal things, why do you suddenly think they'll be forced to play by the rules?

Anyway, it's best to put the conspiracies aside. I made a good chunk of money off clov, amc, and gme. I will reenter those positions for day trades if the chart looks good, but I am not going to dream of some 8000% squeeze that may never happen based on some internet conspiracies.

1246,h687zw6,t3_optda9,"1. Delta will not be a repeat of the OG Covid Crash. Completely different circumstances. Covid in 2020 blindsided the market and the world; we had no defense against this strange and unknown virus, except to shut down the world basically. Delta? First, we have vaccines that work against it. Perhaps slightly less effective at preventing transmission, but still enormously effective at preventing death and severe disease. Second, everybody knows everything there is to know about it. We know it will cause infections to tick up, like in the UK. Yet, the UK case surge appears to have slowed, without the need for extremely draconian measures like with OG Covid. It would take a black swan to blindside the market again; a new variant that completely evades the vaccine and sets us back to square one. Delta isn't that.
2. This one I can agree on. Valuations are extreme, and will eventually come down. We just don't know when though. Could be next week, next month, or next year. You can sit on the sidelines in cash and miss out on the blow off top, or define your risk and invest what you are comfortable with losing a portion of.
3. I don't believe the inflation narrative for a second. The 5.4% YoY increase is due to temporary issues. Supply chain havoc? Not a long term problem. Stimulus money? Saved, used to pay debt, or invested. Either way, banks end up with that money and they don't spend it in an inflationary manner, i.e. by buying groceries and cars. Another round of stimulus will not happen unless we get another black swan event. Most of that inflation is probably just prices recovering from when they tanked in 2020. Remember oil? Prices collapsed in March 2020, I hadn't seen gas so cheap in decades. Now it's back to its normal price and everyone's losing their minds over inflation. It's easy to set a growth figure so high when your base level is zero. We're still in the same economic paradigm as we have been for the past few decades; namely, defined by a stagnating and aging population and labor force. Interest rates have been on the decline for decades, any increase would be temporary. In order to create economic growth in this economy without structural growth, we just print more and more debt, and kick the can down the road. We're not about to stop doing that now. I am very confident that YoY inflation in 2022 will be much lower than what we've seen this year.
4. New industries will spring up to support continued economic growth, but indeed, not in time for this bull market. AI, biotech, spaceflight--these will revolutionize our world and create billions of dollars of growth, but probably not this decade.",45,2021-07-23 16:44:58

I can generalize that I have for bull investments which are mostly financials such as C, BAC, CFG, JPM, PRU.  These would make up say 40% right now.  Since as you see above that I believe inflation is happening and in addition I am a believer that gold is a good thing to own in and inflationary environment, I have say 30% in NUGT, GLD, SLV, UGL.  UGL is positive and NUGT is underwater.

I sold most all of my profitable stock assets on the bull side a month or so ago, so most all stocks I own are the remainder in the red, except for GE, PFE, and TSN, which I won't sell.

On bearish bets I bought QID and REW which are around 10 to 30% depending on the account.  My entry is around 5% to 6.5% higher than where we are now for QID and REW.  I bought them both a couple weeks ago and then again on 7/19 so that purchase is underwater for the last few days.   I have a small play in UVXY, less than 1%.  I am short TSLA which is around the flatline, and NVDA which is slightly underwater.

So in all to screen shoot everything just simply isn't practical, unless you have something specific you want to key on.  Tomorrow is Sunday so that will be the only day I would have time to do this.  Once the work week starts I am working 12 hours a day at engineering, so hopefully you can get back to me soon unless it can wait until next weekend.

EDIT: Those of you downvoting that bland, apolitical comment must be genius traders.  Cases are spiking massively. A certain percentage of those become hospitalizations within days of diagnosis, and a certain percentage of hospitalizations turn into deaths within 2-3 weeks of initial diagnosis. You don't just get COVID and instantly drop dead.

Cases are a leading indicator. You know, like *forward* earnings, that thing you're supposed to understand as a trader?

Yes, I understand that over half the population is now vaccinated. However, vaccinated and previously infected people can still catch and *spread* COVID, even if the risk of a severe case is low. The Delta variant (83% of sequenced cases in the USA as I type this) is much more transmissible, and more deadly than, the original strain, and we're no longer implementing the mitigation measures we were last and earlier this year.

Everyone being a potential carrier, a much higher transmissibility, stronger infections, and limited mitigation means Delta is going to absolutely rip through the unvaccinated population through August and September. Look at where [the curve](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html) is headed. This is the beginning of Delta's exponential growth.

Edit.  Looks like you’re just downvoting me on multiple account like a bitch instead of replying, but in case you look at the comment again it also looks like Florida has been undercounting deaths.

They have been locked down for a month and will continue to aug 31 but i forsee it going longer. It may find a way to spread thru east coast too if ppl escape lockdowns.

1625,h6tr1y8,t3_ot8wlv,"I thought this was a good write up, however,

I really think it's tough for older millennials like us to fully acknowledge that for zoomers companies like this are fully fledged brands rather than just component makers.

Your views are exactly what my natural ones would be and are exactly what the landscape of this industry was 10 years ago when we were the target audience, I honestly think this sentence sums it up:

""Gamers care about performance first and looks and brand second""

This is/was true for us, it really isn't for e.g. my nephew and his friends, they want what they see streamers on twitch have and are way less technically minded about it, for them brand and looks are a priority.

I also think you minimised somewhat elgatos dominance, and the advantage having something for everything slot that Corsair has, particularly if you like RGB as it all syncs up with icue, for evidence of this you only need to glance at r/Corsair to see all of the all Corsair builds posted everyday.

For me crsr is a bet that strong branding in Corsair, Elgato and Scuf will give them those #1 slots in peripherals and the ability to stay there whilst the TAM of gaming components and accessories inevitably grows.",83,2021-07-28 21:08:26
1626,h6tv7x5,t3_ot8wlv,"Very good DD Sir thank you, but I must say your estimates seem very conservative at some points. The ""the pandemic is a one-off"" take has already been refuted by their Q1 earnings, it showed that the gaming/streaming trend was here to stay and logitechs earnings yesterday showed the same thing, still growing trend in anything gaming/streaming related while for logitech the office space product started going down again, which corsair doesnt even make. Also the similar product thing might appear like that on first glance but Corsair does provide, especially with the elgato brand unmatched quality of products(specifically the software), an unmatch product experience. The wave link and also the new camera hub software make the experience so good for these products. There are some webcames that can match the quality of elgatos but not one of those can be fully software controlled down to ISO and shutter speed. Same goes for Corsair, there are other options to buy rgb fans/ram/... it is the iCUE software that makes the experience perfect. It is well made, easy to use and just syncs up everything without a problem and is extremly customizable. Corsair is very clearly playing the apple tactic here. There are many others making phones with similar quality and that for a way cheaper price but people still come back every time to buy an iphone because they know the software is good, the quality is good, it is easy to use and the whole ecosystem works together perfectly, they dont even try to go for cheaper option because paying the premium will payoff with all the listed advantages. Sure Corsair might not be fully there yet but they are in the best position to become the apple of streaming/gaming. And its just so obvious that streaming and gaming is a strongly growing trend and will be for the next decades to come",17,2021-07-28 21:43:27

GSKILL being *basically* just memory manufactuers are willing to pay more to outbid everyone else for the best chips on the market at the start of a new cycle, we saw it with DDR4 and Samsungs B-die at the launch of Ryzen.  They had almost double the RAM kits on the mobo manus QVLs then anyone else.

Corsairs customer service is hands down the best in the industry, they back their products 100% and as long as it doesn't look like you hit it with a hammer, if something breaks they will try and fix it *usually* even out of warranty.

I agree, the pandemic created more gamers and once you become one you never really stop.  There's a lot of money to be made in the casual gaming market (see: mobile games) and I think Corsair's in a good position to take advantage of it with their strong branding.

1649,h6v4zcc,t3_ot8wlv,"Fair points and I agree with most of what you write about here but I think you missed few important things. So couple of additions:

&#x200B;

* PC market share has been shrinking for a very long time. Obviously because of CV19 PC sales rose this and the last year but ex virus years PC market share has been shrinking every year since 2016. While PC market share is shrinking its being replaced by laptops, consoles and most importantly mobile phones. This is important because laptops and consoles have less components that Corsair can sell to those gamers. PC gamers are likely to purchase Corsair's case, PSU, RAM, internal RGB systems and more. Laptop and console gamers will only buy controllers and headphones (if even that much).
* Nobody (on Reddit that is) has mentioned cloud gaming when writing about Corsair. Cloud gaming is the single biggest bear case for Corsair. Yes, I know that most people in 3rd world countries like USA don't have sufficiently fast internet yet, but it will happen, people will have fast internet speeds eventually. On the other side of the coin, game streaming infrastructure is already in very very good position and is only limited by user's internet speed. In this scenario you only need good monitor to play latest games on max settings. This would devastate Corsair and frankly it will happen the only question in when.
* You mentioned that they don't have a moat but their brand is well regarded. Well their brand is their moat and its not a narrow moat either. Yes, they sell generic hardware with Corsair sticker on it. However, because of that sticker they are able to sell generic hardware with huge markup while OEM vendors have to compete on lower price selling exactly the same stuff. That's moat and its moat that takes decades to build. Otherwise, you could say that Coke has no moat. After all, it taste almost the same as store brand beverage.
* Speaking of previous point, for hardware manufacturer they have very good profit margins. 6% net margin for hardware vendor is really not bad.
* Selling PC hardware is cyclical business but they are taking initiatives to diversify. For examples, they have services branch where they sell esports coaching services. They are also working on building some SAAS product but it is not clear yet what it is. If it wakes off it could really help to reduce business criticality and improve profits forecastability.
* They are also positioning themselves as the go-to streaming hardware vendor. Streaming is exploding in popularity so this is large TAM that they could be dominant players in.

So just few extra points above but overall I agree with what you wrote. For disclose, I dont have Corsair positions because I'm not retarded.",2,2021-07-29 03:05:07

1654,h6vzpxt,t3_ot8wlv,"Great DD, especially the no-moat explanation in PC HW.

I will add, in terms of the streaming market, they are building a moat in streaming HW.

Elgato products still has little to no competitors. (I think EVGA is now selling capture cards to compete).

They also have done M&A in companies that benefit the streamers and esports gamers. (don't remember the names, but here is  what I remember about them).

In one M&A, ""somewhat"" of a of mentoring service to develop future streamer and esports gamers. 

And in the second, the acquisition of graphics art company that pretty much has a moat in selling emotes and UIs to the vast world of Twitch streamers.

&#x200B;

Regarding your first comment about the Q1 earnings - I do say this in the DD in the Conclusion section. But I do agree with you fully.

Agree on the iCUE sync with all their RGB, although i'd point out that this is not exclusive to Corsair. NZXT for example have a pretty similar software/sync setup with their products called NZXTCAM. The software is just as good, syncs all RGB components and provides overclocking abilities and system statistics too.

I currently use iCUE with my current rig that has Corsair components, but actually prefer the NZXT equivelent, the software is cleaner and easier to use imo. But in terms of functionality they basically do the same thing.

Also Razr have similar software called Razer Synapse, i've not used it on a desktop case or anything but have used it on their laptops, it's quite powerful in terms of the RGB effects you can do and stuff.",2,2021-07-28 21:51:05

Agree with your points, G.Skill in particular seem to be very popular at the moment, and I regularly see them cheaper than Corsair for identically spec'd RAM sticks.

Yep iCUE does kinda suck, it's pretty cluncky and unreliable. Lots of people seem to hate it. I prefer NZXT's software but have to use iCUE as I have Corsair components in my rig.",4,2021-07-28 22:46:05
1679,h6u0h9f,t1_h6tx8k0,"It's tricky, Corsair could easily continue to trade sideways for months, even years. Imo it needs a significant catalyst (such as a merger or aquisition) to let it break away from its competitors in terms of moat. Or we could see a slow and steady rise over months or years.

Personally i'd be happy buying now at the current share price, and would do so if I had the cash, becuase I invest long term a lot of the time and dips in the share price now won't be noticable in a few years time when the share price is (hopefully) significantly higher.",7,2021-07-28 22:23:38

Yes, this is exactly correct in my opinion, VW is a good comparison.

And regarding the rebrands - yes agree too. As I mentioned in the DD I don't know what the magins are in terms of OEM rebrands, but I guess Corsair made the choice to not bother making their own products in some cases in order to ride the wave of already well made exisiting ones.

The things to look out for with ET is that after the next sell they will likely lose majority control (they have 54mm shares atm with 92.5mm outstanding / 100mm fully diluted)

This will make crsr more attractive for things like pension funds etc who I'm not sure if they even can legally buy into majority controlled companies.

As this other guy notes, our spec-based mindset is born of *having* to pay attention to specs or the thing wouldn't post. And we were trying to get max performance or the game would be barely playable. Nowadays basic performance has moved far enough ahead of the base-line playability that it has fallen back as a primary concern. See e.g., forenite, apex, etc. Most widely played games will play fine on a 'potato' as the kids say.

Casual games, strategy and whatnot - sure, no problem. But those don't require much of a gaming rig anyway and that's not where the big customers base is. You can play those on your tablet or phone.

NZXT also sells PSUs (although a limited different models) that I think sync with NZXT CAM.

NVDA is trading at 26x price/sales... that's SaaS type valuation.  AMD is trading at 10x price/sales, meaning it still has a ways to go to be valued like Nvidia.  Both have stellar revenue/earnings growth.

It's entirely likely Nvidia will run again after earnings, but keep in mind it's valuation is still very high compared to AMD and not even comparable to Intel.",1,2021-08-05 22:17:47

Nah, it doesn't work that way. There is a big difference between a negligent driver causing a fatal accident, and the actual car itself causing a fatal accident. You can't just directly compare stats that way. No one will ever see it that way.",9,2021-08-17 17:49:13

2476,h9aa5c0,t1_h99xm48,"And those autonomous lanes would have to be far more standardized and better maintained than our current roads. Half the time I'm driving on a street with completely faded lines or some quirk that's confusing even to human drivers (weird asymmetrical intersections). Then there's things like traffic cones and detours that humans can make sense out of but I'm not sure how you would get an AI to correctly interpret what it's supposed to do if the traffic change goes beyond a simple lane change, based solely on a written sign and a bunch of cones, or a human directing traffic.",2,2021-08-17 21:06:03

2722,ha2dn2i,t1_ha2d8es,Thanks.  I doubled down on the company as soon as the 3000 series were revealed.  Hoping for the ARM deal now.  If ARM goes through... I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be filthy rich within the next 5-10 years.,11,2021-08-24 02:55:23
2723,ha2v6m7,t1_ha2d8es,Yes you most certainly will!! I really hope you do my brother.,4,2021-08-24 04:54:28
2724,ha36mm2,t1_ha336af,"It's perceived as just patience, but it's actually about establishing an overall portfolio that allows you to take calculated risks.  I've created multiple safety nets for myself (401k, IRA and a pension with free health care).  I'm set at age 60+ because those accounts compound out to plenty of money by then.  My other safety net is my pension.  It brings me a reliable income stream even if I'm not working. These safety nets allow me to take more risks and hold long positions in my brokerage and not sell even through market corrections.  Patience is definitely a big role, but I'd say establishing these safety nets enables me to have patience.",3,2021-08-24 06:14:42
2725,ha2mwzn,t1_ha2kjkn,Living a good life already.  Compounding interest is the key.  You don't get to take advantage of it if you keep realizing gains on your best stocks.,4,2021-08-24 03:58:53

2732,ha4vyak,t1_ha2k9q3,That price isn't even 2 years old. This solidifies how out of touch wsb is... A stock price of less than 2 years ago is *unfathomable* to people here.,1,2021-08-24 15:23:35
2733,ha3fw96,t1_ha2dn2i,If arm goes through you’re going to be relaxing in bora bora telling your wife’s boyfriend what to do,1,2021-08-24 07:23:59
2734,ha3zy1l,t1_ha36mm2,Bro no hate but you’re on the wrong sub lol,5,2021-08-24 09:56:09
2735,ha2p5s4,t1_ha2mwzn,"Yeah I know long term compound will benefit you greatly, just knocking the “Never Selling” statement specifically. Literally never selling results in $0 realized. Maybe your kids will sell lol.",3,2021-08-24 04:13:56
2736,ha2wews,t1_ha2mwzn,"This is beautiful. I have my regrets,  but I'm glad some had foresight.",2,2021-08-24 05:02:41
2737,ha2zzt9,t1_ha2mwzn,"This isn't compound interest, though. I get what you're saying, but I find the ""stock compounding interest"" issue to be problematic.

When the price of a stock goes up, it's just that the price of that share went up. Compounding is when you have a sum of money in something and it increases multiple times over and each time is multiplied by the new sum.

If I have $100, and I get 5% on that in a month, then the awarded interest plus original value at the end of the month is $105. The next month, my interest increases to $5.25, and so my new value is $110.25... and that's a guaranteed outcome because of the rate of interest.

Stocks are valued based on trading value, they don't actually compound unless you're thinking about dividends or something else that you get actual interest on. That same stock price that ""compounded"" up to double or more? It can drop down to half just because the stock price changed.

If you want stock value to compound, you have to sell them at the high and buy them at the low. ETFs and funds do this, which is why they're said to be compounding gains, but if you're just buying shares thinking that the inflationary increase in value of the share is compounding, it might lead people to make bad assumptions about the value of a stock into the future.",2,2021-08-24 05:27:28
2738,ha2o0o9,t1_ha2mwzn,"Ok, but if you literally never sell then wtf is the point of any of it?",1,2021-08-24 04:06:12

2740,ha4vzp9,t1_ha2o1cq,I know... That price isn't even 2 years old. This solidifies how out of touch wsb is... A stock price of less than 2 years ago is *unfathomable* to people here.,2,2021-08-24 15:24:09
2741,ha2dxtc,t1_ha2davg,"That's not my motive.  I want to tell everyone about my success in the market, but I can't tell anyone... so this anonymous post kind of scratches that itch.",10,2021-08-24 02:57:26
2742,ha4wvyb,t1_ha4vyak,"I come here from time to time, but all I see are people gambling and speculating.  Makes for good entertainment... there are safer ways to grow money tho.",1,2021-08-24 15:36:52
2743,ha4w2ae,t1_ha3zy1l,"Yeah, dudes actually responsible... He needs to GTFO asap",2,2021-08-24 15:25:09
2744,ha32ro4,t1_ha2zzt9,"I hear ya.  I just call it compounding interest because I use the S&P 500s 10% per year performance as my benchmark for my portfolio.  So 'compounding interest'  In terms of setting performance standards and financial planning for myself so I can have reasonable expectations for my future.  I'm actually averaging 150% per year for 6 years now.  I've considered adjusting my benchmark up based off my own performance, but I figure I should plan for the worst so I keep it at the S&P 500s performance.",2,2021-08-24 05:46:58
2745,ha3agls,t1_ha32z9f,"...righhhhht. Can I bookmark this thread and ""I told you so"" later on? Idk how Reddit works",1,2021-08-24 06:43:07

This is coming from my personal experience.",2,2021-08-24 04:04:31
2747,ha33iew,t1_ha32ro4,"Oh totally, that's a great plan... I guess I just have a pet peeve about this because every 401k presentation I've ever sat through they refer to stocks as compounding interest and I have to then explain to my coworkers that there's more risk than they're letting on. LOL",2,2021-08-24 05:52:15
2748,ha3cv1q,t1_ha3agls,Go for it,1,2021-08-24 07:01:01
2749,ha2pcpn,t1_ha2nrml,"I'm retired in my 30s, but I grew up poor.  I get a sense of guilt when I talk about my financial success.  I'm well off enough to sustain my wife and I without having to work, but not well off enough to help my family yet.  I made 40k this week and it's really exciting, but at the same time it kind of feels like cheating (irrational I know).",0,2021-08-24 04:15:14
2750,ha356dh,t1_ha33iew,"Ya, it needs to be explained better... I agree.  If I wanted to calculate NVDAs performance I'd go back 10 years and average their 12 month gains and use that percentage to establish a compounding rate.  It won't be exact and past performance is no indicator for future returns but that's the only way to actually call it compounding interest for an individual stock... otherwise you have to think of it exactly as you described.  Best to establish it off your own overall portfolio performance and adjust it every year.",2,2021-08-24 06:04:12
2751,ha3sqhn,t1_ha3cv1q,You know West Taiwan threatened to nuke Japan if they intervened in a war with Taiwan 🇹🇼,1,2021-08-24 09:02:05
2752,ha3y1k4,t1_ha2pcpn,"i mean it kind of is cheating. in a sane world this type of thing wouldn’t be possible, and the economy wouldnt be made up of debt and imagination. not saying you’re doing anything wrong, though.",2,2021-08-24 09:41:54
2753,ha39ggy,t1_ha356dh,"Yep, you're either trading to hold hoping people buy it, or inflation naturally pushes the price up... it would be awesome if we had a way to do actual compounding interest on stocks. I think funds and ETFs are probably the closest you get without managing trades all the time.",1,2021-08-24 06:35:38

2810,ha4onsx,t1_ha4iqw5,Couple of reasons. Mainly because I wanted to take profits when I can. Because you have to at some point otherwise you can just lose all that you earned. Two I haven't seen NVDA go up 5.5% in a single day without a significant pullback soon after. The question is not if but when. NVDA usually rallies like 3% in a day is considered great. 5.5% is considered a bit crazy for NVDA at least. If we were talking BNTX it's not considered crazy unless it's at least 15% in a day. Three I want to diversify my profits. And wait for a pullback before reinvesting NVDA.,1,2021-08-24 13:47:00

INTC has the potential to prove the haters wrong over the next 3 years, and I like their new CEO and his strategy.  That said, there's a lot of real execution that they need to do here...

I do think US and Europe are incentivized to support domestic chip production and won't let INTC fail.  Lot of upside if they can execute.",49,2021-08-24 23:30:39

I did a write up of AMD vs Intel many years ago.  I went all in on AMD in Jan/Feb 2016 at about $1.80.  

This is from someone who used to work in a datacenter and would sometimes talk to contractors that worked at Intel about their product.

Jan 2016 - present
 
Intel $36 to 53 - 1.5x
AMD $1.80 to $108 - 60x
NVDA $6 to $218 - 36x
TSM $20 - $112 - 5.6x

Intel has a very real brain drain and has not made a good product since probably Nehalem microarchitecture in 2008.  This made leaps in virtualization then but now they are dead in the water in the datacenter cloud computing world.  

This is also an opportunity cost question because if you had put $40,000 in AMD in 2016 you'd have about 2.4 million, in NVDA you'd have 1.5 million, in TSM 224,000.

If you had put 40,000 in Intel in 2016 in one of the best tech runs in 5 years you'd have amassed 60,000.  Sure you made a little money but any other semi stock and you'd be near retirement.

Intel has not designed a good modem, a good gpu, a good cpu in over a dozen years.  13-14 years in the semiconductor field and Intel hasn't advanced much.  

As I wrote many years ago in that post, this is an efficiency problem, no one sensible is going with Intel. You'd be wasting billions in computing power, electricity, real estate etc.  It's a bad bet vs whatever else semi stock you can park your money in.  

I don't keep up with cpus any more but last I heard the gap is widening between AMD and Intel in datacenter performance/efficiency",64,2021-08-25 03:44:51

2954,ha94qsw,t1_ha7sv64,"There is so much material to read on this. AMD is taking market share on the server side which is the higher margin sale, not really on desktop/laptop. Intel still owns that space, although Apple has started to make their own chips and ARM and other manufacturers are winning mobile chipsets.

AMD/TSMC was able to compete with Intel by using chiplets and TSMC’s EUV production capabilities (as they own 50% of the EUV capacity worldwide based on system’s developed by ASML). This allowed their joint venture to be more efficient with the production efficiency off of the silicon, driving down prices that typically would be higher than Intel can offer with its ownership of the foundry, while offering similar to more powerful chips across the product line. Intel is following with a ‘tile’ approach (basically their name for chiplet) and moving through a roadmap that will see them align with AMD in terms of chip capabilities in 2023, if they can execute. Given Intel’s struggles to execute, the question is if AMD/TSMC can ramp up production to keep taking away market share in the next 18 to 24 months, or more realistically push Intel on margins, where Intel is forced to drop prices to maintain customers.

To be clear, I see Intel still being a significant market share holder in 2025 with significant government contracts and some growth outside of the server chip space. They will lose Apple business and have tightened margins for the next two years, but they have the cash and capabilities to execute out of their predicament. AMD and Nvidia have great execution in recent years, but they are valued to continue to grow when competitors are also aligned to further take business from them or start to squeeze margins as the chip shortage eases in 2023. I’m long Intel (likely hold at these price levels) and wouldn’t be placing call or put bets on Intel in the short term or on Nvidia or AMD at their current valuations. AMD will likely continue to take market share but only up to the point where they can meet the demand which will limit their upside during a time period during which they have an obvious technical and production advantage. 

So the bet is whether Intel can execute well enough to maintain margin and market share for a likely 2024 rebound or whether AMD can show growth above already high expectations. I’m not a taker of those bets in either direction.",1,2021-08-25 12:12:27

It's PE, cough, fundamentals, cough, is 1/3 of AMDs. So it's currently making 3x more profit per dollar invested. $100 of INTC stock right now is worth $300 of AMD, in terms of net profit.

More autonomous cars will help, but I think the big kicker will be robots. They will take over pretty much all the manual labor and dangerous work.

-Medical
-Autonomous vehicles
Etc
ARM deal is massive if it goes through. 

All these technologies and innovations allows Nvidia to have vertical integration.

To me one of the best options s is the silver market right now. Also real estate trusts ha e been a good long term investment ABR. May be high right now.$1.40/div.

The fact is: the market is way overbought and ready to go down.

Silver is undervalued here. You are not late to the party, but right on time.

Watch the lunch scene in wolf of wall st with Matt McConaughey and Leonardo DeCapria.

No, they won’t net you 400% return, but 15 to 20% isn’t shabby. Then play with some money you are willing to lose as you learn. That way you aren’t losing all your money. There are plenty of free you tube videos that can give you insight on TA tools and options trading. No one of them is foolproof. They just serve as insight. I’ve heard it said options trading should only come after experience in stock trading. Probably good advice. I’ve tried options three times and not happy with the result. Which is why I’m now studying all those tools used like RSI and MACD. They aren’t fool proof either. I’m smart enough to realize gambling (and options playing is pure gambling)  is a some skill/experience and a whole lot of luck. Big money gamblers make money, usually, because they are able to survive substantial losses before that big win. Big losses wipe out little players. Good luck and be smart.",3,2021-09-05 22:47:34

Newbie: what? Why are you questioning wish to moon? Are you a hedge fund shill?

Clov has been my number 1 profitable stock with day trading, while GME/amc/BTC were my biggest 2-month period gains.

We at the CLOV fam have no idea where this is coming from.  We would’ve loved this attention last week, or even better on the 20th when the options chain was loaded.

The fact that so many people here on WSB are accusing us at r/clov of brigading and using bots with 0 and I mean ZERO evidence is really unfortunate.

There's a difference between content generation and advertisement/spamming... the CLOV community needs to learn the difference, and the TA needs to be more than ""we're consolidating after finding out bottom"" and weird conspiracy theories about short squeezes at 1% borrow fees and low FTD rates, dark pool handwaves, and weird conspiracy connections between shorts and future rollover dates that aren't based in any actual dynamics (and obviously didn't come true).

I have CLOV shares, which I'm selling calls on because the premium's pretty good and I get to rotate puts/calls on it as it shifts between $7.50 and $9.50... do I believe it can go above $10 with a lot of buys over a long period of time to consolidate the float past the sell wall? Maybe... but that's a pump, and a lot of the people engaging in it are documented long time bagholders who want it to go up again so they can sell. That's against the sub rules, and when people just repost the same things and lean on conspiracy theories and voodoo magic it makes it look even more like a pump and dump scenario.

I used to be a CLOV follower. Even when it was at $13 I thought there could be a good way to play it as a cyclical stock, and now that is happening at the current range...

But the problem with CLOV is the community. The CLOV community is TOXIC AF. I have been outright harassed by people, brigaded, mass downvoted for pointing out simple things like that an eldercare medicare company doesn't have the sentimental drive of gaming and movie companies, or for citing the change in the short percent of the float or the short fees, or for pointing out that significant sales occurred on lockup expiry date... and people don't dare mention the index admission reversal LOL. I caught someone on one of the communities trying to rally people to harass me because I pointed out the lockup expiry thing a while back. LOL

Right now, you can go to almost any thread and find some frequent offenders saying on almost any post ""Yeah, that stock's fine, but if you really want to make money, sell that and buy CLOV! It'll be a 50 bagger!"" This is the stuff, and the us -vs- them mentality of CLOV devotees that's making people really hate all the CLOV posts and turning this into drama... if you guys want people to buy into CLOV, this isn't how you do that.",31,2021-09-07 03:10:16

3853,hbzkyg9,t3_pjqb7r,"Deep and long on HIMX since the last time it was this low (around May). I added quite a bit more on this dip.

That said, the bear case is not as drastic as China invading Taiwan. The large majority if not all of HIMXs foundry capacity is in mainland China. If China's protectionist policies continue to evolve to perhaps shutter that capacity to outsiders, HIMX would suffer greatly.

Additionally, their current ridiculous operating margin (guided higher for Q3) will eventually settle down if/when the supply/demand imbalances resolves. That said, sick margins until it does and they should have some good long lasting margin boost.

That said, they seem to have a solid grasp of the climate in which they are operating and I'm hopeful that scenario won't come to pass. I believe if that's the bear case risk the market is pricing in here, they are giving the fud way too much credit.

Positions:  
+2510 shares @ $12.36 avg (up slightly ytd though on HIMX with CSP/CC)  
-1 9/17 $13p  
-2 10/15 $12p  
-5 10/15 $11p  
+4 1/2023 $7c  
+10 1/2023 $10c  
+4 1/2023 $30c  
+1 1/2023 $20c  
+1 1/2023 $25c

Largest position in my portfolio (now larger than CLF as I feel it has more upside in the near term). That said, for the long term, I honestly believe there are better semiconductor plays. In the short to mid-term, it's the best look on the market IMO.

OTM LEAPS will be sold well before expiration.

3890,hbzljmp,t1_hby7yzj,"Take a listen to last quarters' earnings call. Almost all of the Q&A was related to foundry capacity.

Downside, all of their foundry capacity is in China.

CEO Jordan Wu opening remarks on Q2 earnings call (August 5, 2021):

> Thank you, Eric. The semiconductor industry continues to go through a severe foundry shortage, especially in the mature process nodes where we are mainly anchored. With foundries running at more than full capacity while demand shows no indication of abating, the longlasting unaddressed supply-demand imbalance remains. In view of the foundry shortage and anticipated growing demand for the foreseeable future, we have entered into strategic agreements with foundry partners to cover both our short-term and long-term needs.

> We are in the process of entering into further such agreements as we speak, with some of them involving new foundry partners, leaving nothing untried to expand our capacity pool. Likewise, across various product lines, we are entering into strategic agreements with customers who wish to secure their IC supplies. Some of them are indirect customers who don’t necessarily source ICs directly from us but still wish to enter into supply deals with us to ensure that their direct vendors, mostly panel makers in our case, will get their desired supply quantities from us.

> All such contractual arrangements will help boost our future growth prospects and improve earnings visibility. 

> Notwithstanding all these efforts, demand continues to outpace supply and we believe the imbalance could last well into 2022. However, we are on track for more accessible capacity to grow our business quarter by quarter this year.
Looking further ahead, we expect to also secure more capacity for 2022 as compared to this year. We will provide more details as they come available.",3,2021-09-08 06:34:54

Why so conservative?",2,2021-09-11 00:43:33
3911,hbz7lvq,t1_hbz6yc1,I appreciate you taking the time to reply and argue the reasoning behind your DD. I'll give it a look tomorrow then and see what will happen. Good luck my man!,4,2021-09-08 04:52:14
3912,hbyc6o5,t1_hbyaqob,"Fair enough, though don't overlook the fact that TI is massively expanding their domestic production capacity across the board (look up phase II of RFAB and the Micron fab purchase). So they stand to grow even more if the upward cycle of the semiconductor industry continues. 

And nah that's just a formatting thing, using the sidewards chevron to do the  "">implying"" thing.",2,2021-09-08 01:16:44
3913,hc2tsc4,t1_hc2scl4,Will be around these areas. I would not be surprised it hit single digits. Frustrating stock to trade or own unless you’re shorting it. No signs of $15s anytime with this delta variant.,1,2021-09-09 00:51:27

3915,hbzx0tf,t1_hbzwfsi,Agreed 100%.,1,2021-09-08 08:03:26
3916,hbycipa,t1_hbya8kd,"Fair argument, but a lack of supply in this case won't reduce demand.  While foundries may provide preferential treatment to big names, the smaller fabless producers managed to acquire their niche for good reason.  HIMX mostly focuses on the automotive sector, in which demand is highest right now.  You make a good point about supply, I just don't see demand cooling off.  And if the whole industry is having bottle neck supply issues, it's not like automotive makers can shop around for a cheaper working foundry.  The supply constraints on HIMX seem to be the same industry wide.",5,2021-09-08 01:19:01

3918,hcbz5ym,t1_hcbxlg9,"The PT was determined by analysts, and I can’t tell you how they determine that number.  The pump to 17 was due to the dividend, bears piled on to the after dividend dump right when the China FUD started because of the education/tech crack down.  I see it at least hitting 17 again before Q4 and the support in this price range seems strong.  

But I can’t tell you why so conservative.  Geopolitical tensions?",3,2021-09-11 00:53:56

3920,hbyld5i,t1_hbyc6o5,"Lol, no worries.  And yah, TI looks good, especially with the addition of that new foundry in Utah.  HIMX is fabless producer tho, so it's not addressing the shortage, it's just super undervalued from a P/E perspective compared to other fabless producers, especially in regards to it's earnings.",2,2021-09-08 02:20:01
3921,hc2w9eo,t1_hc2tsc4,I’m not sure where your pulling single digits from.  It just bounced off an SD at 10.95 on the 6mo chart.  Same level we saw the bounce off of in May.,2,2021-09-09 01:08:29

3924,hc2y7je,t1_hc2w9eo,I said I wouldn’t be surprised due to delta variant and the pandemic. This stock is definition of volatility.,2,2021-09-09 01:21:49
3925,hbyfi9z,t1_hbyd3pe,"I'm hearing you, basically the bottleneck is at the production level and HIMX won't be able to solve this problem since they are involved in the design aspect of chip creation.  I'm arguing that HIMX is undervalued for what it does, not that it's going to solve the worlds semiconductor shortage.

I'm looking at HIMX from a P/E perspective mostly.  TSM maybe was a poor comparison, but if you look at some other fabless producers like LSCC (P/E 128.71) or NVDA (P/E 81.73) they have price to earnings ratios 10-12x HIMX.

 Compared to other stocks in the same industry, this one is cheap.  That's all I'm getting at.",6,2021-09-08 01:39:30
3926,hcc1lv2,t1_hcc0vme,"Yes sir, yes sir.  She already moved back up and crossed back over the 200SMA today.  I think that 10.80-11 level was the bottom.  We’ll see what happens from here, but trend is looking rosier.",3,2021-09-11 01:10:28

3929,hdlyqnc,t1_hdlwzhr,"Yah, it bounced at 10.11 back in May.  Same region, EPS is 0.8 right now, I added 1000 shares and a few more calls.  So much FUD with JPow speaking on Wednesday and Evergrande.  Could be spill over, depends on how China handles Evergrande defaulting on payments on Thursday too.",1,2021-09-21 00:46:49

3931,hdm1hab,t1_hdlzbav,"The difference was there wasn't a shortage of semiconductors world wide, and HIMX EPS was around -0.05.  China FUD won't help, but the trade environment has been hostile for years, the difference is the shortage creates uncomfortable necessities.",1,2021-09-21 01:05:13

What companies did you compare Corsair to to determine it’s so strong relative to others? Or did you just look at Corsair in isolation?

They’ve got solid products, I’m 100% with you there, but I think most folks buy the stuff Corsair makes at the same time they upgrade their CPUs and GPUs… which are stupidly expensive right now and in short supply for the near future.

4270,hg3qnpq,t3_q56m7l,I was glancing at stock transactions by pelosi’s husband. He apparently purchased $400 strike calls for 6/22.  He must have faith it’s only going up,17,2021-10-10 21:54:40
4271,hg3j1wd,t3_q56m7l,"The random point you selected and drawn the line of actually has one touch point. So it seems rather invalid ‘that this broke a big trendline’. People draw what they want to see, be factual and when you draw these lines looks for multiple touch points and always take a second look to be sure it has multiple touchpoints. A trendline would be the latest three downside touchpoints, but that would be a small one. You could say braking this, that it would go to the bottom pf the ascending channel, yes. But i dont really find that a guarantee play. I want to see multiple indicators pointing bearish. Trend shift in bearish volume, harmonic patterns, chart patterns like a bearflag/head and shoulders etc, bearish and hidden bearish divergence. Bearish volume support once it breaks out. Cause if their is no volume support than its easy to identify a fake out. And never trade a breakout unless its retested the line as resistance. Cause else it could go straight back and make it support again",14,2021-10-10 20:45:34

If you mentioned the market as a whole and said that if a market wide catalyst occurred it would drop 23% I’d almost agree with you there.

4314,hgiy1o2,t3_q7j3yn,"Hey! So I want to preface this response with WSB is NOT a good place to ask this kind of question. You will either get made fun of or get shitty answers that might be true...or not. I'd reccomend r/investing for this kind of question.


You need to research the company and look at how they are doing. In the last year the stock price has skyrocketed a few times. It's got a lot of excess cash flow to cover any debt they have and their dividend is about 2$ from what I remember. Solid company choice.


 However; this totally depends on what you want to do with this stock. Are you hoping to buy and sell every 3 months? Are you looking to do an options play? Do you want to buy it and just keep it sitting until you're 80? All these are factors in telling you what you should do. If you are looking to diversify then there are many other medical companies that offer a much better dividend, but might not have the same credentials.


NEVER buy a stock based on emotion it doesn't matter what your experience was, only what you think will happen. If you think a merger might happen or a new drug is available or something news worthy that is what should base your choice on. Good news stock goes up bad news stock goes down.",3,2021-10-14 04:09:55

His hundreds of businesses have mostly failed, no idea where you’re pulling a positive win ratio from, he literally bankrupted a casino. The only ones that didn’t fail are a subset of his real estate investments and licensing of his brand, but even a lot of those have failed.

Trumps only value to a business is his brand, he has no operational expertise, and his involvement in the day to day is more likely to be a detriment. However his brand is currently toxic to more than half the country and opium to the other half. Call me crazy but I don’t think that having half the country alienated is a great way to start a social media platform. Especially considering the alienated half is on average wealthier than the addicted half.

I think if you look at this platform objectively, it’s high end monthly active users is probably around 25 million after a few years, if it can las that long. It has little to no international appeal. No one left of center in the US will touch it. No one under 16 or over 65 will touch it. The moderate / center right conservatives (the “I don’t like his personality but I like his policy” types) won’t touch it.

And the thing you're not taking into account is that the current national average for gas is only 30 cents above the cost prior to the pandemic.

Logically where is this social media platform going to get ad revenue from? It’s focused on a very narrow population of people and not international. How is a platform that only panders to less than 25% of Americans possibly going to compete with international platforms that serve almost half the planet, companies like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube? Oh yeah there’s also Reddit, where there are already plenty of subs for his supporters to play on. Just like Getttr and Parler (also failures), Truth Social is a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist. It’s an answer to a demand that doesn’t exist.

I will wait for options before sitting at the table at the casino on this one.",3,2021-10-29 00:46:47
5027,hiekh60,t3_qhqc3u,"I worked at one of the facilities several times as it was being built, and they just can't quite seem to figure it out.
They had tons of issues keeping the facility clean enough to meet their goals on product yields, they're working with and plan to continue working with yesteryear technology, and their other FAB acquisitions from IBM were of even older technology than the other manufacturing they were dealing with.  They've announced that they'll be building another FAB late next year, but once again, it's not to get on the cutting edge - it's to lag behind the innovators.

They repurposed their building originally constructed for R&D into a FAB once they realized that they weren't keeping up with what was needed to compete at that level.

The company has bled money ever since they began and I can't imagine they're going to stop now.  Abu Dhabi has basically given $20B in bandaids over the last decade.",3,2021-10-29 01:18:38
5028,hiiwmxn,t3_qhqc3u,"I may have missed it, but you skipped or glossed over the part where IBM paid GF to take over the East Fishkill fabs (323/10)-  If a company has to pay you to take their junk and the local / state government makes you agree to certain employment levels for 5 years then you know you are stepping in something that smells.",2,2021-10-29 23:41:33

5030,hjanvmr,t3_qhqc3u,Bought 100 @46.57 - last week. Feeling like a genius this week. We’ll see if I get dumber as the weeks roll on.,2,2021-11-04 23:56:10

5033,hieinsa,t1_hiefkau,"This week will be very telling. I'm interested to see if SOXL or QQQ will allocate any of its funds to GFS. Also as I mentioned in the post, the majority stakeholder has had a public interest in getting rid of its stake. I will want to see how, when and how much they decide to dump.",2,2021-10-29 01:06:46
5034,hii3eo1,t1_hiekh60,"I agree they are the ""me too"" at best in the space, but short term, I almost see that as a strength.  A major addressable market space for ""old"" tech semiconductors still exists in automotive, where spec-ing in the leading edge technology every 6 months still misaligns with their business model.  While other semiconductor companies push forward, Ford, Toyota, GM. Ect. will still lag the technology.  

All they need to do is drive manufacturing costs down to poverty levels and sell a cheap ""good enough"" offering to nail down a very profitable niche in a very busy space.  Easy to say, hard to do, but the path exists and us pretty clear.  Being located in the US helps, government money once China starts acting up again is also realistic (thank you Pooh Bear for having a bug in your ass about Tiawan).

Positions 100 shares at $45, expected to see the selloff from $47, which seemed high.  In my retarded opinion. There is money to be made here, but this isn't a WSB play.  This is going to be a boring sideways trader at a glacial pace for a while.",1,2021-10-29 20:04:14

5036,hikk12m,t1_hiketrz,"It’s day 2, beginning IPO prices mean nothing. Insider options and RSUs are being liquidated, funds buying in etc all make the first few weeks of IPO volatile. Once more information starts coming out about their financials, what ATIC is unloading, what funds are buying, open interest on the options chain etc it will be more telling.

5113,hinr0ob,t1_hindjt0,"1) yes. If you wait to expiration you lose only what you paid.  Although you would almost always sell them for a cash compensation at some point until expiration. You can sell it whenever and cash in the profit as long as you break even but would you be happy with it? That's subjective. The downside of holding on to them until they are closer to expiration is pretty small since theta is minuscule. Why? because the value of the option is almost entirely made up of intrinsic value. Theta tends to increase in the last month of duration so you will need to move more ITM to offset the decay. 

2) With far ITM calls you need to look at volume because you risk not being able to liquidate your position. In this type of market these kind of calls are as close to free money as you can get as long as you mind IV. Because extrinsic value is positively correlated to IV if you buy a call with high IV, intrinsic value will have to revert to the mean at some point, making extrinsic value smaller and reducing your option premium. In the short run, it can lead to IV crush, in the long run, it can eat up a good portion of profit if IV reverts to the mean close or at expiration and you did not sell until then.

A common thing to do is to buy LEAPS and hold them until close to expiration. This way, you try to squeeze the last bit of profit the call can give you while risking your premium. Since the option is almost entirely intrinsic value if deep ITM, you can mostly ignore decay since it will be tiny. 
 As long as your LEAPS position is a small % of your capital, this is an ok thing to do. If the underlying tanks at expiration you let it expire worthless and move on like a chad.",5,2021-10-31 00:32:11

You either have them in your account ( covered calls = sell 1x100 company x contract with the collateral being the 100 shares of company x that you own) or you need to have a cash equivalent to cover those shares. 

If you dont have the collateral you get margined and then you get a call from your broker to tell you how dumb you are.

5155,hj6o9ex,t3_ql3vzm,"Also be aware that op is holding amd.

Everything in this post is true as of like a year or two ago but you see this same thing repeated all the time as if it still holds true. Fact is, as of alder lake intel is finally on an equivalent node to amd. Intel makes more money in one quarter than amd does in a full year despite their market caps getting closer every day. 

We see a lot of intel posts because its a great value purchase at these levels. Its not a get rich quick meme play but theres a ton of upside and almost no downside. It's currently trading near the same prices it hit during peak covid when the only launches on the horizon were rocket lake and zen 3.",10,2021-11-04 03:03:05
5156,hj13ddf,t3_ql3vzm,INTC is a value play. If they make the right moves they could be back in the game. They’re still a giant in the room.,24,2021-11-03 00:42:56
5157,hj0l7z0,t3_ql3vzm,"I understand the bear case but still think it's a good play. INTC's been shitting the bed but it's not like the company doesn't print money. Revenue and bottom line's been steadily increasing, albeit much slower compared to its competitors. Trading at pe of 9.5 there's really a lot of value. And great changes seem to be on the horizon. New 12900 coming out in 2 days show benchmarks that beat AMD and Arc GPU coming in q1 2022. They even admitted their incompetence and are working with TSMC to make their 7nm chips now(for Arc). New fab investments will cost tons of money but I think that side of the business will receive a lot of government aid because semis are now considered national security. INTC's big gamble could fail but at the current valuation it's a pretty good bet to go long imo",23,2021-11-02 22:38:17

5164,hj0svl1,t3_ql3vzm,"Again this is your money do as you wish but I find it highly dubious that a mod on /investing sub deleted my comment, especially when no one in 2016 would consider AMD in the datacenter, I specifically said why that would change in performance, energy, space and how AWS Azure would save billions etc.  We already know the subs are being infiltrated but that's not even trying to hide it so this is more just a heads up  warning.

As for INTC it doesn't matter how well you build the house if the foundation is flawed you can keep improving the house but your main design and structural problem still exists.  That's their main problem.  

Their track record for innovating cpu, modems/socs, gpus in the last dozen years has been subpar.  

Last I spoke with contractor at Intel the ethos and culture hasn't changed so until I see results you can't say it'll turn around.  

It probably takes half a decade to design and implement a good cpu and people act like a CEO change magically does that next quarter, year, years.  

I've not seen any 3rd party benchmarks that aren't influenced that would suggest Intel GPU is competitive.  Intel saying it'll compete with the 3070 is just nonsense  until we see the numbers and when it's out in full force the on par with 3070 performance will be way behind anyways.",2,2021-11-02 23:31:49

I think intel already has plans to open a Fab in [Arizona](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tiriasresearch/2021/03/23/intel-invests-20-billion-in-2-new-arizona-fabs/). 

Another reason that I am bullish on Intel (even though I don't own any), there new CEO is a an engineer (which goes a long way in the semi conductor industry). Although he has only been in the role for a relatively short period of time, thus far, he has already made some big improvements in my opinion. Have a look at the launch of there new 12th gen chips, much more streamlined product information relative to 11th gen launch. I think over the long term, intel will still to make a bit of a come back, that being said I wouldn't expect it to print serious bags, due to its current mcap already being pretty huge.",5,2021-11-03 13:21:08
5170,hj6tgeq,t1_hj6o9ex,"every Intel benchmark has been proven wrong by independent testers every year.  Even if it's on par and from what I've read it's not on par , when you are using 2x the power even if you got close to performance you technically aren't on par with the competition.  

I know it's hard for people to grasp but energy efficiency is the future and why I'm super bullish on TSLA, battery tech, solar, ev etc.  At scale saving energy is saving billions in power consumption, cooling, space etc that's what my post many years alluded to.  That's why people like you don't get ""it"", you think if INTC catches up in performance it's a win but that's only a small part of the equation.  And they aren't even on par, maybe if you select a few cherry picked benchmarks but non of the real world stuff that matters in datacenters, Intel is failing every metric.  

Everyday, month, quarter, year AMD NVDA breaks new highs and INTC goes sideways around the $50 mark for 5 years.

5171,hj58kvh,t1_hj13ddf,"OP says

> Intel is gone up maybe 30% in the biggest stock run and semiconductor/cloud computing run in 5-6 years. Abysmal compared to every semi stock

And that's a bad thing? We want to buy stocks for less money. Or does OP want to spend more money? If INTC tanked 99% that would be a good thing for new investors. How does this not make sense to people? Prior price action does not predict future price action. At all. 

Yes. Intel is a value play. It's cheap as fuck. So people are recommending it. Will it go up? Who the fuck knows. Will AMD outperform? Dunno. No one does.",18,2021-11-03 21:27:25

Keep in mind Intel doesn't need to design to be profitable. All TSMC does is manufacture. Their manufacturing business is worth multiple orders of magnitude more than their design business, and is likely to only grow in value.

You can back date it said years ago AMD is better design, energy efficiency, multi core performance.  Intel design consumes too much energy even in their new chips.  

Even when I told you guys last week.  NVDA and AMD are probably both up 30% and INTC just lags around $50-60 and it will won't grow as fast as NVDA or AMD or TSM in the next 6 years.  Opportunity cost is really high.  Either the INTC crowd is tech challenged or delusional",2,2021-11-09 02:47:00

Since this post of 2 or 3 days ago NVDA is up 20%+ , AMD is up almost 14% while INTC is flat

INTC is major opportunity cost, and it's crazy people don't see it.  Think of INTC as the IBM of tech world, it might go up a little if any while the alternative tech plays are up 1000% +.  You'll see in 4 years again how it'll be left behind.",0,2021-11-05 02:40:51

I was one of the first people to advise people to move to AMD in the datacenter and everyone that switched is saving millions in power costs alone.  What exactly do you know of tech?  

This thread really is full of mentally handicapped suggesting Intel.  Speak to 1000 competent tech people who deal with this and maybe 5 people would choose Intel, maybe for their specific use case.  In every earnings, every major move in datacenter, AI, GPUs, energy efficiency is going away from Intel.

When you run benchmarks you have to understand how they work. If Intel had the same amount of cores as the 5950x it would again, be close, on par or slightly above.  AMD is roughly 1/4 of TSMC revenue. That's not good. All chip manufacturers including apple, TSMC, Nvidia and many others are at maximum capacity. How do you expect AMD to grow without TSMC expanding? Intel is already in mid construction on 2 fabs in Arizona and a bunch of others in the works around the globe.

A stock price going up in a day or a week isn't proof that you made a good decision. A stock price going down in a day or a week isn't proof that you made a bad decision. 

What you're actually buying when you buy a stock is earnings. If you bought the whole company you'd want to pay the least amount possible and you want the earnings to be consistent or growing. 

Amd has had amazing earnings growth. If it continues the current stock price may be justified in 5 years. If earnings growth slows down then the current price is not justified.

5212,hl002co,t1_hkz9d7c,"I did buy RBLX at $80 and U right after the Facebook Meta change.  They'll be big metaverse players.  Like I said MSFT AMZN GOOG NVDA will be big players here but they are all at all time high right now, that's your choice if you want this entry point, you can probably find a better price when things sectors rotate around.  I think you have to like the EV, battery tech, ev charging companies, solar sector too 

I don't see one that is a sure shot like AMD when I saw it at $1.80

If you are into alternative tech.

Definitely look up Harmony Protocol / Harmony One.  Go to their youtube page, telegram, twit look at their meetings, road map and tech.  This is the most transparent project with a CEO Stephen Tse that used to work for MSFT, GOOG, APPL and sold a start up to Apple.  An entire team dedicated to the future of tech.  I told everyone 8 months when it was .03-04 it's now up 700% but on a bit of a downtrend as the entire space is right now but at .24 I strongly believe it can still go up 1000%-3000% it might take a few years but Harmony One will be a game changer.",2,2021-11-17 23:52:07

You can always buy back on a pull back",2,2021-11-05 00:42:15

You'll need the help of trading option platforms such as TD Ameritrade, Robinhood, Interactive Brokers, Portfolio Insider  and many others.  
I've had a fair experience in all of them and they have their pros and cons.  I'll say [Portfolio Insider](https://portfolioinsider.com/) has a better portion of them.   
 One thing I liked about Portfolio Insider is their impressive technology architecture, It leverages over 500+ REST cloud API’s to gain unique insights into nearly 20,000 mutual funds, with research reports from over 200 brokerages produced by more than 3,300 analysts amounting to over 500,000 pages of research every day.

* Nvdia joins the trillion-dollar valuation club in the next 6 months.  
* That is a 25% move from here. 

Longer-term: Nvidia is sitting at the market leader of paradigm-shifting technology.  Excellent gains over the next decade appear probable.  

Things I am thinking about right now ...

Short-term supply chain excellence yeilds an advantage in tough times...

* Chip production will continue to be tight. As such, companies with sophisticated supply chains and pricing power will emerge as the clear winners. 
* Other easy winner picks will be TSLA, APPL

Graphic Cards  (growing @+30% per year)

* Nvidia dominates this market.  The card business was 59% of rev last FY. 
* Emerging tech like virtual cloud-based GPUs (vGPUs) seems interesting for specific large visual workloads.
* Professional Workstations: Again another area where Nvidia dominates.

Compute (growing at 230% per year) - holy shit!

* Auto: A new area that provides a platform for a wide variety of in-car services. Hypergrowth ""could be found here"" but competition is high.
* Hight performance computing 
* Streaming services
* Consoleless gaming
* AI as a service 
* Robotics automation 
* ...and soo much more

Nvida will be the company most people don't know but is everywhere and in everything.  

The future looks bright.  I won't be selling anytime soon.

This is what I shared with another poster in this thread that represents about 80% of my efforts to stabilize my portfolio and limit losses:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qmtptf/comment/hjfkw1t/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qmtptf/comment/hjfkw1t/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

For the other 20%, I base most of my trades on TA and rely on a few different things to line up.  I then adjust my risk tolerance accordingly.  I also rely on TA to pick out support areas and have been pretty good about closing with a loss if support is lost.  I have come to terms with accepting that losses are a fundamental part of my approach and I try not to feel badly about taking them.  In fact, this past year, only 40% of my trades were green but when they go, they really go and that's exactly what I want.  I could definitely improve my win/loss ratio by waiting for more TA confluence but then I'd only have made a small fraction of trades this year and would have missed out on the recent TSLA and NVDA runs and many others.",2,2021-11-06 04:26:19

To oversimplify quite a bit, I usually look for charts with an overall uptrend which has had a pull back and for which the daily, 15m, and 5m MACD is crossing positive.  I then flip as the MACD crosses negative but there are other factors as well.  I tend to prefer stocks testing ATH with increasing volume.  For me, timing can range from hours to weeks.  That said, I tend to get impatient and sometimes force a buy where I shouldn't.

I've only been trading options for about 15 months but I've been trading stocks for around 15 years and GME was probably one of my best-timed plays of all time.   I began picking up calls less than two hours before what would become its infamous run which I mostly selected based on its gigantic bull flag, growing volume, and MACD behavior.  Some calls I sold that day (e.g., https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2y3gb/gme\_80\_to\_6k\_on\_122\_60\_c/), some almost a week later.

5994,hjfkw1t,t1_hjfcdvm,"I think strategy will depend a lot on trading style.  For options, I really like breakout plays and have tried to structure my strategy around finding them.  Unfortunately, a losing streak is not uncommon and can be really painful.  I've been using leaps and timing broad market swings to offset those losses and I quit riding losing plays hoping for a bounce.   I also counter greed by making sure I have multiple contracts per play that I can unload to lock in profits as breakouts rocket.  Additionally, I reduced going all in at once and try to buy in gradually with confirmation of breakout.  Overall I have lost more often than I have won this year (around 60/40) but by building absorption of losses into my strategy, my losses are very small with respect to my breakout wins.

Weed stocks are a mixed bag, but TLRY owns the market share of Canada, and has made moves over the last 12 months to position itself has a global leader in the future. Not to mention their consistent growth in revenue each quarter, which is saying a lot given the challenges in the industry, will allow them to eventually acquire US based cannabis companies once legalization in the states finally becomes a reality (just a matter of time).

6105,hjcabuu,t3_qmw801,"Hi all,

Instead of getting proper health insurance, I elected to have a high deductible health insurance policy which allowed me to contribute 3k annually into a Health Savings Account. What's fascinating about having an HSA is you are allowed to trade stocks in a tax-advantaged brokerage account. Starting in 2017, I contributed 2k of my own money post-tax, and my company contributed 1k on my behalf, and with a little as $54/weekly contribution into my HSA TD Ameritrade account, turned it to 58k! Early notable trades were $GBTC in early 2017, but I sold too soon back then. My biggest loser was $CPNG unfortunately. Luckily I jumped on the NVDA, AMD, and SQ train. +544.55% in NVDA in my HSA. Thank you based boss Jensen and niece Lisa Su!

TL;DR I am a degenerate and gambled stocks in an HSA instead of getting proper health insurance!

EDIT: I was just informed the contribution is tax free in a HSA!",32,2021-11-05 06:18:49

6109,hjccj2p,t3_qmw801,"Not a degenerate at all! It’s actually a brilliant strategy to have another tax advantaged investment account. I’m guessing you’re fairly young and healthy so a high deductible health plan isn’t a silly thing. 

I had an HSA years ago and gave it up after two years cause the savings wasnt meaningful to me making what I was, my preferred plan didn’t participate and it was yet one more complication in health care utilization. However, I didn’t know at the time that the funds could be invested. Simply put, our broker did not explain that aspect of it at all. Major fail. Kudos to you!",9,2021-11-05 06:34:02

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRoR43bZqsg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRoR43bZqsg)

One thing he didn't mention is, if you pay out of pocket for an eligible medical expense, (Co-pay, prescription, glasses, etc..) you can save those receipts and reimburse yourself tax free, 10, 20 or even 50 years from now. So if i can pay a couple hundred dollars today out of pocket, i will and leave that money that I would have used to continue growing.

&#x200B;

here's a cute girl explaining too: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sii1kX7awFQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sii1kX7awFQ)

Now me being the irresponsible person that I am, i buy options and stocks with my account instead of investing responsibly. Don't be me.",1,2021-11-06 01:35:17
6155,hjksmvc,t1_hjencbi,Yeah no shit. I didn’t say it’s a free pass. There are always rules. Read the fine print. I said you can use it for other in family including relatives too and not just yourselves.,0,2021-11-07 02:04:08
6156,hjcpljx,t1_hjclbz8,...which says it's to be used for medical expenses. Doesn't seem easy to get around. No way to get around 20% penalty and 65 (and who knows how they'll modify the rules in 10-40 years).,3,2021-11-05 08:06:55
6157,hjfx24j,t1_hjfvwn1,"Well you see, I’m a young, healthy degenerate  that’s still on my parents insurance. So this seems like the best move for me.

Will need to see if I have access to self directed trading. I’m leaving to a less heavily regulated part of the finance world.",1,2021-11-06 01:42:39
6158,hjdmhgh,t1_hjcpljx,Just keep all your medical receipts pay them out of pocket now. Then in 20 years collect on all those receipts while your money is growing/compounding. There is no time limit on when you can claim the medical  expenses from HSA account,3,2021-11-05 12:31:04
6159,hje6c1d,t1_hjcpljx,"Yes, The HSA is intended for medical reasons but you know people always find loop holes. Also if you have high medical needs you're probably better off with a low deductible plan. The 20% penalty is for early withdrawal for non eligible purposes but if I cut myself and end up in the ER tomorrow I can use my HSA debit card or withdraw the money  to pay for whatever isn't covered by my insurance, tax free. But If I can afford to pay it out of pocket today, I can leave the money in my HSA to grow and 20, 30 or even 80 years from now I can reimburse myself tax free. So if you're able to cover minor medical/dental expenses, (Co-pays, deductibles, drugs, things not covered by your insurance, new glasses, etc..) out of pocket then you just have to save all your receipts. That's the part that may seem like it's not worth the hassle for most people. I could go on but I'll leave you to your own research.",1,2021-11-05 16:56:39

It's also the same reason I left Tesla to make more elsewhere and gave up a stock package that'd be worth $6M today.

The difference between $750k and $1M is a hell of a lot less than the difference between $0 and $750k. I have a pretty high income but not locking in those GME profits hurt. In my case that's like 2-3 years of saving (post-tax). That's a lot of life to lose in an afternoon. Just sayin.

6638,hje9c5v,t3_qn308x,"Also, an easier explanation:
Options are basically like sports betting. 
The ones who put out the options are typically “bookmakers”, who find a small margin offering these to the customer. Let’s say a certain price is 50 percent likely to be hit, then they “set the bet” to profit for a small percent of that. Ie. Puts the price slightly higher than it would be. 

In short, if you know the same as everyone else you are just betting on a stock. Even if you think something will go up x amount, it is essentially the same as betting on Bayern Munich winning their next match.

You are gambling, you are not cheating the system. And some walltards manage to do the correct gamble a lot of times. Guess they are just a notch more on the spectrum than the rest of us.",9,2021-11-05 17:41:51

4) What 0DTE mean?


5) Options are weekly or monthly or vary depends?


6) And what has always stopped me: How can u calculate how much money you are going to make? I mean if i but a stock for 1000 and rises to 2000, I made 100% or 1000.

How to do that with options? Its impossible!!? I can't understand how to calculate how much I will earn.

Lets say stock is worth 100. I but 10 calls expiring next month with a strike price of 120.
I pay 10 dollars.

How much I make if the stock goes to 110? to 120? to 150?

I never understood how to calculate that.

You, a person owns 100 shares of a particular stock. You do some real DD and nothing is in the horizon, but and you say

“I bet this stock will not go above this price before this day” -> You are selling a call option.

Another person comes in and says

“I’ll take that bet” -> buying a call option

Now, the person taking the bet can choose to exercise that option or not. They may buy sellers 100 shares at the strike price, or they may not.

If the stock goes above the strike price then the buyer of the option is “in the money” and may well choose to buy the sellers shares. The seller has still gained money, but after the stock goes above the strike price, their 100 shares stop producing value (because they have an agreement with an option buyer to sell 100 shares at a specific price, which is below the current market price).

A put is the opposite.

6730,hjdqcf8,t1_hjdo71x,The reason is because Tesla moving that much isn’t that absurd so people value it higher because it’s implied Tesla can easily move that fast. Vs if you said any other company moving 80% in 3 months it’ll be cheap because it never happens. Tesla does thst in its sleep,21,2021-11-05 13:12:32
6731,hjdv8wu,t1_hjdv00w,"Either or both. For example you could buy an option for Nvidia for 360 by jan22 and if tomorrow it jumps 300% as it did today because Nvidia jumped 10%. I paid $1000 for the option but now are $3000. I can sell and take the profits unless I’m confident it’ll surpass 360. Now the issue is, if I wait till the last day the only money I make is how ever many dollars above the mark is. So if it ends at 370, that’s $10 above so $10 X 100 shares. $1000. Which breaks me even. So it’s better to make money off the contract because the time in the contract also has value.",36,2021-11-05 14:13:27
6732,hjdmq6y,t1_hjdm92k,"Think of it this way. $10,000 deposit. 6 months. Divide it and each day it decays and becomes less valuable because of the time. So your theta is the amount of money you’ll lose a day. Each day has a value. Like a 3 month contract is cheaper than a 6 month contract. Now as long as it rises faster than the decaying price then you are good. But any day could pop off for options. Often 1% for a stock is 10% gain for an option. Roughly.",24,2021-11-05 12:33:35
6733,hjduuk7,t1_hjdtypr,Somewhat yes. You are able to leverage the profits of 100 shares at the price of 10-20 shares. For example if I buy an option for a stock that goes up 25% I could potentially make 1000% on my money vs owning the shares. Difference is it’s time sensitive and I could lose it all for good.,9,2021-11-05 14:08:04
6734,hjexsoo,t1_hje5208,"1) Mostly because of greeks and if IV falls. IV rises mostly before earnings so if price doesnt move enough you lose money.

2) Delta - shows how much option price goes up for $1 that stock goes up
 
Theta - how much option loses in value closer it gets to strike price

Vega - shows price change with 1% rise in IV

3) Dont know what iron condor is but straddle is buying put and call option on same stock and hoping that it moves a lot in one way so you profit on a put or call option

4) 0 days till expiry

5) You can buy daily, weekly, monthly, 1 year out, 2,3 years out

6) If stock goes to 150. 150-120(strike price) every call is worth $30*100=$3000. And you paid $10 for one call 10*100=$1000. 3000-1000=$2000 for every call. And if you have 10 you are in profit 20k. You can add premium to your strike price and then you know your brake even price and can calculate what kind of move you need. And if price of stock at the day of expiry is lover than your strike price your contract is worth nothing.",7,2021-11-05 21:50:42

6738,hjdu5t0,t1_hjdqzme,The value of an option has built into the price implied volatility. So if most people are confident Tesla will hit $1500 within 6 months then the option is expensive even if it’s not close because it’s assumed it will and thus the options go for a high premium. But if news comes that causes that confident to decline for example they announce they lost a huge deal. The stock doesn’t even need to drop for the option to crash because the confidence of Tesla hitting $1500 could decline and thus crash the option value. Sorry it’s late but that’s a rough example,16,2021-11-05 13:59:02

But I could easily sell it for $65 x 100 because if there is 3 months left or 3 weeks that time is valuable since it could continue to rise.

Sometimes you can get a buck or 5 at expiration day, since other people that took the other side of the contract might just want to buy to close out their side of the contract slightly early so they can free up that money to use elsewhere before the market closes. For example of I sell to open a contract for $100, I'm fine with buying to close it for $50 (if it's within the early days of the contract) to free up the money to use elsewhere. If it's closer to expiration I might just let it ride or buy to close for $5 or $1 depending on what they are going for",1,2021-11-05 18:50:11

6749,hjgi24p,t1_hjef64h,"Think of it like this. 

Horse race. You bet $20 to win 8X. Your horse is in last in a long race. Someone says hey seems like you might lose how about I give you $5 for your $20 bet. So if it wins I get all the profit. But let’s say your horse is in second and gaining. You are now able to say anyone wanna buy my gambling ticket for $40 because my horse seems like it might win. Even though it hasn’t yet. Since the bet is more likely it’s value increases. 


Theoretical example. So say you bet Tesla to $2500 in 3 months and since its unlikely to happen it’s cheap to buy an option. But say tomorrow it jumps to $1800 then your bet becomes more likely. So your option for let’s say $1500 for 100 shares to hit $2500 is now worth $5,000 because it seems far more likely to happen. 

They are basically buying a bet from you in some ways.",1,2021-11-06 03:55:25
6750,hjgift5,t1_hjejkuw,"I agree, but I can make just as much profit on $2,000 that someone can make on $100,000. For example Nvidia went up 30% so that would be $30,000 profit for the common stock holder. My $2,000 is now worth $25,000. So I made 1200% and risked only $2,000. Of Nvidia dips 2% you lose the same amount. 

The key difference of course is as long as you hold you would most likely eventually get that money back over time. While options will disappear in thin air if you bet wrong.",1,2021-11-06 03:57:46
6751,hjgizgq,t1_hjemuos,"You will only ever lose what the initial purchase price is for the option correct. So if you go buy a Nvidia option today for $15 which means $15 x 100 shares which = 1 contract worth $1,500. You will only ever lose $1,500. If the date comes and goes and the stock doesn’t go up, you just forfeit the $1,500 nothing else. 

You never need to actually exercise the option ever. You would also sell the contract to someone else. Never a benefit to actually buy the 100 shares out. 

It’s basically like if you wait Robinhood finds a buyer for $1.8M for the house. You bought a option for the house at $1.2M so someone buys it at $1.8, the owners get their $1.2 and you get yours $600,000 profit.",1,2021-11-06 04:01:12

6757,hjgqoi2,t1_hjgov56,"Note: each contract is a bundle of 100 shares. So if the option is worth $1.50 it means per share so $150 per contract. 

Example: you buy an option for Nvidia to hit $350 within 6 months. Today Nvidia is $300. 

The option cost is $5 per share so $500 for the option. 

Total investment: $500 for 1 option. 

Scenario: Nvidia goes to $400 within 3 months. You are now $50 above the price. So theoretically your option is worth at least $50 x 100 so $5,000. If you exercise then the shares are sold, you get $5,000 and the $350 is given to the original person. 

But you are not waiting for this to happen. If you buy that option and within 3 months Nvidia is at $340. Although you didn’t hit the mark yet, since you have 3 months left and have made major gains with tons of time left. Your option is worth a lot because Nvidia jumping $50 in 6 months is hard, but Nvidia jumping $10 in 3 months isn’t so your deposit is now more valuable. So you can sell the contract as you should go someone else let’s say for $30 per share down payment because it’s so much more likely to happen. So you make $30 x 100 so $3,000 for a $500 investment.

3. Strategies involving buying/ selling calls and puts at varying strike prices; usually with the same expiration. If you graph the curve showing potential profits the shape of that curve is usually where the name comes from.

6. This is the big one, the thing I had a hard time figuring out and I bet most people do. Because the formula behind calculating options price is so complex this is not a simple task. I recommend using a website called optionsprofitcalculator. There is no easy way - they are priced using the Black-Scholes Formula. It is seen as one of the crowning achievements of economics similar to the standard model of cosmology in physics. It's amazingly deep and complicated, you could spend a lifetime studying it alone.

To answer your final point about crazy possible gains - Options are leveraged, that is why you can gain or lose so much so fast. You can calculate the leverage of any options using this :

**(Delta Value of Option x Price of Underlying Security) / Price of Option**

6808,hjgdxvp,t1_hjg8d76,"You need to remember that there’s always two people involved. A buyer and a seller. That’s also true for options.

A person selling a new call option “requires” 100 shares to back that option up. A person buying a call option needs no shares.


If you’re buying a call option, you **do not** need 100 shares. You are just saying that, if you feel so inclined, you will purchase 100 shares from the person who is selling the call option at the agreed upon price.

If the stock price goes above the agreed upon price, then you’re in the money and should exercise your option to buy those shares, then resell them at the much higher current stock price (or hold if you are buying TSLA). 

Or you can resell your purchased call option to someone else (for example, if you don’t have capital to buy the underlying 100 shares).



—————

If you are selling a new call option (ie, one you did not buy from someone else), then you “need” 100 shares. 

If you sell a new call option without the underlying 100 shares, then you are in a naked call.",1,2021-11-06 03:29:47
6809,hjkxm4h,t1_hjhhkyf,Well you can sell contracts in which case you collect a premium and can lose your 100 shares per contract if the strike price is reached and the buyer exercises the contract. Otherwise you have puts that are similar to short selling. You may be thinking of short selling as it has risk of large losses.

6839,hje2g90,t1_hjdz24o,"Just one thing to note - depending on the size of your account - paper trading is ALOT easier when you can use imaginary money for high priced volatile stocks \*(GS or SPY etc) 

But if you are working on a limited budget - you are stuck either doing FD's with a short expiration OR doing long calls on low priced stocks which likely have lower volatility. \*(IF they have higher implied volatilty - the price of the options will be more expensive as it is always factored in)

Even though the paper trading account gives you $100,000 (or whatever your site is) - only use the actual dollar figure that you plan to risk in real life for your practice runs. 

People always wonder why they do so well trading with $100K of imaginary money and then lose their ass risking their actual $2000. It's not even close to the same.",25,2021-11-05 15:57:09

With options the contract gives you the right **but not obligation** to purchase the underlying at maturation or any time before.

6841,hjejg03,t1_hjeikqz,"Try the wheel on a stock you like. Start off by selling to open a csp(cash secured put) on a stock you like on a down day. Since puts would be worth more on that day. You get premium for selling.
if the stock goes up you can buy to close that position and keep your premium and your cash that was secured for the put. And sell another csp on a different down day. You don't have to do it on a down day it's just puts are worth more on those days obviously. 

Now if the stock goes down past your strike price( hopefully not too far) and you let it expire,  you'll get assigned those 100 shares at the strike price (with the cash you secured the put with). Then you can start selling covered calls on those 100 shares (usually on an up day since calls are worth more on those days) above your purchase price. You'll get premium for that. If they get called away if the price rise above that strike price, then you get the profits up to your strike (plus the premium you sold it for). Then do it all over again.

I actually do it on stocks I don't care about either that have high volume and IV just to sell the cash secured put and then hope that stock goes up so I can buy to close the position before expiration day. I've been assigned a few times but then I just sell cover calls at a price where I hopefully cancel out my losses into a small gain & get rid of them",3,2021-11-05 19:47:01

7005,hjhnwv2,t3_qnjlmt,A number of my larger customers are dumping their managed service providers in favor of supporting their own vm's in AWS or Azure.  Especially those with sensitive data.  Doesn't really speak to your question but worth mentioning.,3,2021-11-06 08:34:19
7006,hjgni1s,t3_qnjlmt,No customer have asked for ARM yet. But they haven’t asked for AMD either. Several thousand servers and no AMD in sight.,5,2021-11-06 04:29:19
7007,hjgo4b9,t3_qnjlmt,"not even AMD, every server we owned is intel and are still buying intel only.
why? it takes alot of time to profile,debug and tune OS x processor.

If we shift to AMD, everything we got is irrelevant. we might have to reprofile all our performance tests. We might encounter new bugs that takes alot of time to debug.

so its pretty unlikely data centers will use ARM or M1 given that we have never seen any servers of those in the first place and nobody wants to be a first mover/guinea pig.",5,2021-11-06 04:33:15
7008,hjgnsv5,t3_qnjlmt,"I run a hosting company, AMD has compatibility issues with some server software. We only and exclusively use intel. We only buy Dell. Most of our partners do the same.",3,2021-11-06 04:31:14
7009,hjgsceb,t1_hjgo4b9,"Yes I know some smaller hosting places with a lot of costs sunk into large blade servers.  Amzn msft have a number of instances running AMD

I know plenty in the colocation hosting service and it's too much man power for them to switch over but the big players have.  

The point isn't to see the NOW there's no money in that the point is to see far ahead.  That's where the real money is.  

Few are going to ask for arm especially smaller hosting providers but AWS does use Arm and it beat out every cpu. 

https://thenewstack.io/cpu-benchmarks-for-cloud-providers-intel-vs-amd-vs-amazons-arm-based-graviton2/

I understand why a shop won't switch over it's too much man power and configuration but the big players do and they just ship the pod preconfigured, it's modular, it plugs in and it's up instantly.",1,2021-11-06 04:59:36
7010,hjgv4sc,t1_hjgsceb,well then you have your answer.,2,2021-11-06 05:17:40
7011,hjno26v,t1_hjgsceb,The big players you speak of have not switched... They just might need a new data center somewhere and make a deal with AMD. Microsoft and Google actively buy both AMD and Intel.,1,2021-11-07 17:56:46
7012,hjo2my3,t1_hjno26v,"yeah no one is throwing away their billions of sunk cost, and many more billions in man hours.  You have to keep buying some Intel because I don't know of a reliable hypervisor that can live migration/ vmotion that works between Intel/AMD.   But I've been in the datacenter the days of garbage AMD Opteron when every datacenter, colocation, SMB was 99.9999% Intel.  

INTC is definitely losing market share faster than most think.

Again no one I know of has even thought of using Arm in this use case.  That's why I want to investigate it before analysts understand it's potential

The big money isn't made being the last on the train that has already made 10 round trips.   I want to be in the first on the first train before it leaves and I was one of the first to say AMD at $1.80 was one of the best bets in tech many year ago

I don't work with Arm and was hoping I'd find a needle in the haystack, someone who does and has some forward thinking into the implications or something so efficient.",1,2021-11-07 21:00:05
7013,hjo42ez,t1_hjo2my3,Keep in mind AMD is focusing their resources on data center. Intel did the same last quarter. I think Intel is just falling to just another player in the game. More and more servers are being built. AMD cannot grow without TSMC expanding fast! TSMC is at maximum capacity. AMD has purchased supply for years but this does not mean anything as they had no choice. TSMC requires payment upfront.,1,2021-11-07 21:13:10

It is clear that Google does not eat all of their own dog food.

In contrast, Amazon offers excellent documentation and they still support older APIs and products for a reasonable time.

7134,hjjyd6j,t3_qnwkfx,"Looks like someone is salty they missed the AMD, Nvidia, Apple and Qualcomm, TSMC train...

There's no question Intel is a successful company, but they're still riding on the coattails of their previous success over the last 30+ years. The computing market has been shifting away from x86(their core business) to ARM and other risc based architectures for a while now - ie apple's m1 for personal computers and Amazon's graviton2 for servers.

Also, they have almost no market share in mobile, memory, discrete GPUs, etc. The fact that they dropped the ball so hard here means they have no idea what they're doing and it's a little too late for them to play catch up.

The only thing Intel has right now are slightly faster x86 cpus which just barely beat AMD's from last year. They're actually worse in many ways because they decided to go with stupid ""e-cores"" which waste silicon that could have been used for more ""p-cores"" and massively complicate process scheduling. Whatever tiny lead they have right now will be gone in no time. Like many enthusiasts, I'm waiting for AMD to release zen 4 which won't have any garbage efficiency cores - that alone should scare you as most market sentiment is likely leaning that way which is not a good long term outlook for intc...

Lastly, placing a bet against tsmc because they're in the country Taiwan is ridiculously stupid. They make chips for literally every trillion dollar company so there's massive money behind them to ensure their success - and it's not like intel is going to pick up the slack in case of anything(they actually outsource some production to tsmc). If China is a real threat I'm sure they have plans in place to deal with every conceivable scenario.",1,2021-11-06 22:27:40

The US is protecting Taiwan, and they will likely continue to. However, right now most chip designers in the world are US companies and they are completly reliant on Taiwan. China doesn’t need to invade Taiwan to cause issues, they just need to disrupt Taiwan’s production/shipping of goods (like chips) in any way, and then we have an even bigger chip shortage. What good is it if Apple can make amazing chips on TSMCs 5nm node if they can only get 50% of the chips they were expecting from TSMC? Taiwan is only a few miles away from China and the thing with geo-politics is that when they go south, they do so in unexpected ways. I mean, so far this year, we have a chip shortage, magnesium and aluminum shortagw and shipping shortages, all mostly thanks to China. They’ve basically disrupted our whole economy without even shooting a single round, all under the pretext of global warming and Covid complications.

Now INTC isn't going to see AMD style movement because there's no indication that AMD is going to stop being competitive like Intel did. But AMD are obviously taking Intel's moves seriously because the 5800x has already been dropped to $300 on some storefronts.

The whole world’s trade infrastructure is supported and made possible by the US army, if we fail, the rest of the world economy goes down with it, because no one else can offer security and stability at the global level to assure global trade (and no one trusts China to do so anymore).

7. Intel is no longer the more power efficient of the two with the recently released latest generation.  They had to dump all the power they could into the CPU to be able to compete with current-gen AMD.  AMD is about to release next gen in 3 months with general expectation to crush Intel's latest gen for the desktop market.  

leading to point 8...

8. AMD's Epyc server has ran away from Intel as competition -- it's no longer even close.  AMD just announced yesterday their next gen Epyc is expected to have \~50% uplift (in *common* workloads, so VM heavy crap); and the following gen to double their core count to 128 cores. Intel's best is a 38 core CPU which cost more and substantially less powerful then current/last gen AMD Epycs.  FB is utilizing AMD chips, Msoft is rolling out VM infra using AMD chips, I've been rolling my own shops servers over to Epycs. 

&#x200B;

The scariest part to your thesis is if AMD continues to make inroads into the AI segment; if they pull off the ai inference chips right that they been working on, big bucks.  Meanwhile Intel has a nasty reputation as of late of bringing interesting products into the foray but then lacking followup and further development-- based on the numbers behind their latest GPU it appears to be going down that path again.",8,2021-11-09 14:56:26

AAPL is a poor example. They have a high market cap because they’re one of a handful of major stock holdings in mutual funds sold in retirement accounts. A typical retirement account will have at least 5% in AAPL. Retail accounts for most of their moves that aren’t virtually in lockstep with MSFT, which accounts for a similar percentage in a typical retirement account. AMZN is lower but mostly following the trend because it’s usually no more than 2.5% of mutual funds in these accounts.

Currently, the climate is such that there's both price momentum and popular sentiment going for AMD and NVDA. Unless you've got the capital to influence the price it's easier to just follow the trend of the time. The trend seems to be to ride the Mama Su rocket ship to the moon.

I still believe Intel can turn this around and Gelsinger could do it. He might do it too, as he has already kind of “divested” the fab business ready to be available for other customers too in the future. But it’s going to take a while.",3,2021-11-10 13:02:58

They're fighting a losing battle against TSMC, especially when Pat announced the $26B investment on their fabs and said that they will produce 5 nodes in 4 years and regain the node leadership by 2025. I don't know what flavor of cool-aid he is taking but 5 nodes on 4 years is insane! especially when they're stuck with 14nm for god knows how many years and their 7nm (or now called as Intel 4) has been delayed until next year.

7652,hk2cy2b,t3_qql2m0," intel are getting back into gear . But I think this is too early. 2023 is when shit really gets interesting for intel. Sierra. And the path to that is very much up in the air given amd being this competitive

Amd are on a roll and their counters plays have been simplistic in relation to what intel needs 

Amd: stack another die on top of zen3

Intel: hybrid compute is a must to compete. A total new uarch E core etc 

Point is as much of a feat CoW is, it's most definitely less resource intensive compared to designing a new uarch. Validating two unique cores, even more so

What I suspect that means is zen4 or zen5 is a mean competitor that has had a lot more engineering time put into it than usual. They basically get a extra year for uarch development due to CoW playing off

Intel do not have a full run yet, I think there's defo more risk atm give zen3d is like a month away and could really sway who's leading here

Personally think it's still currently overpriced. The fab section of the company is overvalued just like globalfoundaries was. They might have idm2 but name really even 3 other customers other than intel.  Without customers the fab is worthless and no customer is going to move to another fab unless they have equivalent features and are price competive

And to add they need to invest an ungodly amount of money for these next nodes to keep up. It's not cheap by any means

Data center is the money maker. Sierra in 2023 is all that interested me on their roadmap if that flops wheres the money coming from for these nodes",1,2021-11-10 21:28:35
7653,hk0zt6s,t3_qql2m0,"Im with you on INTC. However I take issue with your statement about INTC starting to compete with Ryzen. Intel chips have always beaten Ryzen. AMD hasnt had a top performing chip in like... well ever. 

Ryzen was just AMD going from incredibly inferior to a little bit inferior. And Intel hardly had to do any tweaking to stay on top. Like you said, theyre still outperforming ryzen with 10nm and less cores.",-8,2021-11-10 11:54:42

They have proven that their big.Little designs aren't as efficient as you'd think. It seems especially unsuited for server, where AMD is eating their lunch. Plus the gaming crown will be gone in months when Zen3D comes out. Also, AMD has been working on Zen4 forever and that will likely blow intel out of the water, with Zen5 sinking the ship the next year. I just don't see how AMD doesn't give you 8 more quarters of ever increasing revenue while intel goes down over the next 2 years, at least. I'm long AMD for at least 2 years, intel has nothing on the horizon that seems worrisome.

However, Meta accelerators are going to be designed in house if they are actually useful.  Apple did it, Microsoft did it and Google did it. Fab design is pure logical skill set. Sure, AMD can milk it for now but not sure for how long.

Additionally, AMD has a major major key supplier risk. If TSMC messes up their nodes due to any reason, they’re royally in shittown. Could be due to geopolitical(Taiwan-(?)), technological, labour or any reason.",-1,2021-11-10 13:06:26

Intel’s new business model is to fab chips for others, particularly in the US.

They pay 40-50% lower than an equivalent job in apple or nvdia or AMD. This is mainly because a large chunk of comp is usually sticks and Intel stock has been garbage compared to the others. Intel is also losing talent to the likes of google, amazon as they are throwing money at chip folks for their server chips.

When there is that much pay disparity, anyone with an ounce of talent, that wants to leave will leave. Intel is no longer even the top 25 preferred employer Silicon Valley.",2,2021-11-10 20:38:31

It doesn't really matter how good an amd gpu is their driver support is terrible and if a 700 dollar gpu that performs like a 1500 dollar gpu sounds good, which it should but in reality it doesn't matter because the drivers are crap and real world performance always lags benchmarks. 

On the cpu front. I'd only use amd cpus on a workstation. The higher core count per dollar is nice but my 5950 system with a 2080ti never ran as well on 2k as my 9900k system with the same gpu. Both have ram tailored for the system and adequate cooling using msi mobos. This is in cod warzone which is heavily cpu dependant. The 9900k is at 5ghz both use noctua 2 tower coolers. And 32gb of b die ram. The amd system has memory tailored to the infinity fabric frequency as well so don't give me that frequency crap. The issue with the 5950 is I get frequent stuttering and lag fps drops. Not network related. If I spin 360  between the downtown and airport runway while on the hill ill lose 50fps. Dropping from 150 to 100 around the time I'm looking at array. 1440p same settings as my 9900k but fir whatever reason my 9900k system doesn't have these stutters when replicating.

Their Ice lake servers is a massive flop that cloudflare skip the entire thing. Netflix and the newest AMD customer, Facebook are using AMD server part because of how AMD can customize their tech according to the clients need.

As their main business. 
Intel make CPUs. NVIDIA makes GPUs. AMD makes both. 

AMD wasn’t able to get in server segment, was mostly a candidate for PCs and laptops for many years. Now they are growing strong in that arena. Meta deal is a big proof for that. If they grow in server segment they are bound to eat the market share  of intel. So if you are comparing PEs of AMD to intel then market perceives AMD to be a better growth stock than intel and is willing to pay more for the stock. Look at your profit on the capital you invest and the stock you buy not the just the PE ratio. Intel is a giant in microprocessors AMD has a lot of room to grow and eat away intel’s monopoly. Being a high growth stock I would be bothered even if their PE worsens, till the time they can continue with the growth. 5-10 year or who knows even earlier Intel might be ready to eat AMD’s monopoly.

And AMD is not ready in any shape or form to switch suppliers. Samsungs 7nm/5nm EUV node is not the same design as that of TSMC.

7820,hk7hbu6,t3_qrluqx,"OK, the last TA wasn't so good technically or otherwise, but this TA is pretty solid. I did a similar analysis of SPY last night and came to pretty much the same conclusions and breakpoints.

It's not just NVDA and TSLA driving this, but also inflation news and OpEx. We're a little early, but I expect we'll decline into OpEx week and rebound... the biggest threat that might push us down into 450 or below territory would be political shenanigans relating to BBB act or the debt ceiling, or possibly a COVID resurgence for the winter.

If we dodge all of that, we're probably looking at the standard monthly dip give or take.

To supplement this: If you do a channel analysis, as of yesterday SPY broke the channel it was trading in since rebounding in October to the downside for the first full daily candlestick. We're now in that downward trend into OpEx week and expect to hit at least the SMA20 at just below 460.",3,2021-11-11 22:48:57

7830,hk7u5z8,t1_hk7oat0,"The TA I was referring to was the TA on FOMC meeting day where you basically said there was nothing to look forward to and that low volume intra-day divergence meant the market was going to decline rapidly. 

Obviously, that didn't happen. My critique was that you can't take intraday volume on its own without considering the context. FOMC day was a ""wait and see"" moment and once the pressure was relieved, the market rallied. 

I 100% get the point you're making about technicals and I think it's mostly true, but in the end the trade happens technically the way it does because the rules we all ""agree"" to trade by conform to things like moving averages, fib sequences, etc... in the end, what we're really measuring is mass human movement, which is why TSLA/NVDA have some influence, but I think that when you dig into the timing correlation and the numbers, TSLA/NVDA have a little less of an influence than people think. NVDA's pretty strong, overall, and holding around $300... so looking at the NVDA chart my bias is actually a little more around the idea that NVDA is more a victim of the downward pressure on NASDAQ ETFs rather than the other way around (although I think yesterday and the day before probably had a little more of an NVDA bear thesis). 

TSLA does kind of match, and I agree that overweighting can have an amplifying impact, but at the same time it doesn't because on Monday the market didn't really exactly reflect TSLA's arc... this tells me there's something else in the mix, and inflation concerns and reshuffling for bond yields makes sense.

There's a long-standing pattern that has emerged since around 2010 that I've been tracking... it's not uncommon to see a tech rally a day or so after a bond yield boost, which is counterintuitive to the traditional wisdom, but I think it really comes down to the fact that bonds are risk offsets. People buy bonds on up days to lock in yields, but then they have a risk offset and capital, so they then buy riskier assets to gain growth since now they have a hedge.

QE amplified this by feeding the cash side after the 2008 market crash, so it's been a bit more pronounced, I think.

But I think that dynamic and OpEx largely explain the current trend change. 

In the end, I think if we're not enriching our trading with the macro human influence on the technicals, we stand a greater chance of getting the call wrong. I get the point of trying to remove bias and that's your discipline and I \*totally\* get trying to keep to a working discipline, and for daytrading I can see that working more often than not... but there be dragons when it comes to making macro calls without a consideration of the macro human factors.",3,2021-11-12 00:21:24

I have a bit of a degenerate gambler thing going on LOL. I'm doing OK, but still developing the discipline and method that u/jmj_daytrader is referencing.

I'll answer your question, though: It depends on your goals. Overall, I'm still bullish on the indexes over the next year. From a high multiple picker aspect, I think the market's a little rough right now to guarantee high return on any given stock or sector, though I'm leaning into a broad distribution because I think once we get past some bumps here, the whole market will continue to rally at a variable and possibly slower pace.

So one thing I'm betting on is a broad diversified cross-sector ETF selection I pulled out from historicals that generates around 5% income and 25% growth, give or take, based on last year's numbers that should outperform the market if there's a decline... but that's a position trader option for slow growth.

7929,hk9w0vr,t3_qrxrnl,"NVDA has a huge moat. Most retail talk about nvda as a GPU company but don't realize how massive their software suite is. 

Want to do deep learning? U need nvda cuda libraries to work with SOTA libraries like tensorflow and pytorch.. their inference is a lot faster than their competitors.

They are also investing in proprietary software, that works only with their GPUs. Why hire an engineer to implement X when Nvidia has an optimized version if u have their GPU.

Also, they have been heavily investing in computing for robotics, look at their Jetson series.

8103,hkh81a0,t1_hkh0ml4,"Yeah, I've made most money after or before earnings (not holding over the earnings). I don't even know why I still feel like it's worth to buy and hold anything into earnings as most of the time I get hurt or only get a modest profit compared to the risk.

And I also take profits relatively quickly, either a intraday play or couple days to couple weeks at maximum (not including LEAPS I own). Of course holding a day or two longer shows in the profits compared to what you're aiming at (average seems to be +67.02% on winning trades), but of course there's the risk that things star moving only sideways or down when holding for too long and then you're down more than you wanted overnight (my average on losses is -29.42%).

I do trade SPY, but I usually buy more ""conservative"" options so I can exit them quickly with small loss or get a decent gain on relatively small moves when there is market events. I don't know why I sometimes get into the weeklies that are very likely to just go bust (without any of the few retard weekly or 0DTE options my losses would've been only -17.04% on average and it still has some -90%+ losses from holding into earnings, so I clearly could do better if I stopped doing stupid stuff now that I checked it). Even though I don't risk too much into retard trades, but losing it all is just more than likely anyway, so I don't know what I even keep doing it.

I should just stick to what works and not keep getting into these trades that have been unprofitable pretty much every time, and are just eating my profits. I guess it has something to do about ""testings things out"" once I've made couple good trades so I feel like I can take extra risk and being bit too greedy, wishing for quick 200-500% gain if a big move happens.",2,2021-11-14 01:29:59

Why Intel fucked up, I do not know, they promote some lady without college degree to VP, they hired Qualcomm dumped guy for tech lead, and Qualcomm does not have a foundry, they hired an accountant as a CEO, they think they are Exxon mobile, what are they thinking? I do not know I do not understand, I do not care, 
But Intel will survive, it is a national asset.",20,2021-11-15 11:47:37
8174,hkoubpr,t3_qtw2ht,"Intel thesis isn't going to play out this year but maybe in the next 5 years, so no options only shares. Also their PE is super low cause they are predicted to shrink and lose marketshare to AMD. Best time to play is when any of Intel's investments start paying off not while they are attempting a turn around. Invest hard when it starts stealing marketshare from nvidia or amd. Might accumalate shares on the low.",13,2021-11-15 14:06:53
8175,hkqcig5,t3_qtw2ht,"I agree and bought in at 48$ a share, hoping for it to fall more. I think this is a play where you don't stand to lose much at all if anything, and stand to gain decent. The risk to reward is really chill, I like it a lot.",4,2021-11-15 23:53:57
8176,hkqr3jv,t3_qtw2ht,"I've been buying loads of this for a while now. Its a long term play (5 years minimum) and a good place to park cash with a P/E of 9. Their new CEO is setting them off on a better track. Their 12th Gen chip is already beating AMD (single core performance) and will continue to do so as AMD is about a year away from anything new, and I'm betting Intel is pushing for a 13th gen around that time. Once Intel steps up the core counts AMD will have a real battle on its hands. I'm a huge AMD fan, always have been, but this competition benefits consumers the most.

I'm out of momentum investing and AMD / NVIDIA seem a tab overpriced for me. I took profits on both recently and I'm out of both positions now. Switching to a more long term value outlook, as I think 2022 is going to be a bang up year for inflation.

Basically buying Gold Miners, Energy, Intel, berkshire hathaway, some cell tower REITS. And a tiny slice of HUT as a gamble essentially.

Interesting times ahead for Intel",3,2021-11-16 01:31:51
8177,hkp0hch,t3_qtw2ht,"I disagree with your datacenter argument, their cloud segment dropped 20% and AMD is taking marketshare in the server space.

AMD’s Epyc cpus are better in powerefficiency and multitasking, they just announced 128 core chip for early 2023. They have technological advantage here. 

Furthermore with their new MI200 datacenter GPU they are challenging nvidia in this area as well.

So overall AMD is better choice, they have a good roadmap, rising margins, rising revenues, they are expanding to new markets (Xilinx) and so far they’ve delivered their promises. 
Disclaimer: my biggest position is AMD shares",6,2021-11-15 15:18:52
8178,hkoqc5u,t3_qtw2ht,"The four competitors you named all make better products with higher margins. As you mentioned, INTC's GPUs are shit compared to NVDA, but you didn't mention that INTC barely bothers making memory because Samsung's and MU's are vastly better/faster/stronger/harder/longer/deeper/cheaper, etc. And, yeah, Lisa's big steaming hot brain. But, sure, INTC's cool, too -- probably a better value play than three of those companies...which would matter of fundamentals mattered any more.

8870,hl657bn,t3_qwpky1,"Bro! I had a similar situation. I had puts on it because the company is VASTLY over valued, but I realized, if it got this high without correcting, and if I’m expecting good earnings results, why the hell would it dip on earnings?

So I swapped my puts for calls, made some profit, sold those calls, and got some Dec 31 puts for when it inevitably corrects as people take profits on it jumping ~40% in the last month.

Don’t fomo. Don’t be emotional. And don’t make big trades on things you are particularly unsure about.",1,2021-11-19 05:11:58

9311,hl7bjcb,t1_hl7apmj,Yeah. Name of the game. Let’s get that money.,6,2021-11-19 10:21:21
9312,hl8cu0h,t1_hl7khb0,Thanks friend. If we can finally push through 471 and find support I’m looking at 480-490 range and that’s when I’ll be looking for a pullback. Historically Nov has been pretty good for bulls. If we can’t find support army 471 ish I have to think that bulls will have to be getting tired especially with the inflation talk and raising rates,3,2021-11-19 16:14:15

9314,hl7vlql,t1_hl7tztr,Cant give you a number. There's strong support at 467 and 465 tho.  With Opex we generally see a 1% day tho in either direction. Over 471 I'm bullish tho.,2,2021-11-19 13:03:03
9315,hl91etn,t1_hl8cu0h,So if we don’t find support at 471 you think we will see more downside in the short term? I’ve been holding back for the past month getting in for the same market fears you mentioned but despite everything it just keeps chugging along.. and historically it’s been a safe bet. Maybe I’ll stay cash today and see what your outlook is on Monday,1,2021-11-19 21:13:25
9316,hl7vzj4,t1_hl7vlql,Hopefully this futures rally is setting up for a bull trap at open and it rug pulls at noon I’m just praying for my $464 Puts with an avg of .59 lol,1,2021-11-19 13:06:34
9317,hl958u4,t1_hl91etn, Yah. Hell of a bull market. OPEX is today so we may see choppiness today.,2,2021-11-19 21:46:20

9472,hld01yy,t3_qy05dr,So now we call anything beyond weeklies a leap?,214,2021-11-20 15:07:44
9473,hldicia,t3_qy05dr,"The problem TSM has is it's not in nasdaq or s&p 500 so it doesn't get the massive passive flows from there or the gamma squeezes. It's just a huge portion of SMH which is great and it gets pumped with the rest of the sector but there's definitely sellers out there keeping it in this tight 110-126$ range.



[Anyhow after pumping to relative highs vs SMH last year it's now come back to relative lows vs SMH. So it should be a good buy vs the sector, or at least it should start to outperform the sector once again for a few weeks/months](https://i.imgur.com/whQ1QP4.png) 

My thinking is the big leaders will consolidate and this laggard that has been consolidating all 2021 after the early pump will go back to it's highs. Maybe it can even grab it's leader seat back for a while and push new highs.

For some reason the market isn't valuing it with huge multiples unlike the AMDs and NVDAs out there, probably because it doesn't have the same growth prospect.

Looking back a few years ago it's a very stable stock compared to the other semis, it has a beta of just 1 compared to AMD's 2 and NVDA ~1.5 so it's not as volatile as them hence the lesser returns.

China doesn't want any war or proxy war. Notice how they try to rein in North Korea more and more. Less about communism now. More about they want a better economy and influence.",2,2021-11-21 01:12:11

The winning condition would be to take Taiwan with minimal damage to the infrastructure so that ruled out indescriminate bombing/missile strikes. Not that they actually have enough long range missles to do that, especially factoring in missile defense systems.

They would need to occupy Taiwan to pacify it, but getting troops on the ground is a nightmare in of itself, because if urbanization and mountainous terrain there isn't much landing zones for paratroopers, and those zones are well defended. And, to land paratroopers they must first get air superiority and naval blockade,  which they simply cannot in a short order ( at least 3 months with most projections) .

Yes, looking from raw numbers PLA is massive, but in a invasion there only so much planes/ warships/ troops can fit in a finite space. 

In the context of conventional invasion in the Taiwan strait, the numbers of planes at the airspace at one time is severely limited, some projections say no more than 6 fighters at one time, so the fight for air supremacy will drag on months. Similar things for warships, neither side wants their fleet to cluster up and get absolutely Fucked by missiles. 

You can watch some of the simulation/projection scenarios on YouTube. Those are not 100% accurate and often leaves political discussion out, but they gives you insight on why there is a huge bottleneck in a invasion.",2,2021-11-21 08:21:46

AMD chip architecture is fundamentally far superior and Intel have had to do some desperate manoeuvres to stay in touch with AMDs products. Untimately Intel has had to pump huge amounts of power and heat through their chips to reach high enough clocks to compete and have also been using some dubious comparisons in their benchmarks which heavily gimp their competitors. AMD doesn't need to do this and CPUs are far more cool and efficient as a result. On a compatible power consumption AMDs products are around 30% more efficient, this is why AMD are taking large parts of the data center and Intel are struggling to find an answer. Unfortunately for intel AMDs momentum isn't letting up any time soon and we're still yet to see anything truly comparable from Intel. NVIDIA should also be concerned by AMDs hugely impressive server GPU the MI200 which trounces NVIDIAs comparable offering. We will see how things pan out in the consumer space but the gains AMD is showing across CPU and GPU are mightily impressive. Disclosure, I'm fairly heavily invested in AMD.",2,2021-11-22 23:52:57

[Reason for yesterdays pop with MU (Mizuho price target upgrade)](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/micron-upgraded-back-to-a-buy-at-mizuho-just-one-month-after-it-was-downgraded-11637672539)

[Interesting Nasdaq article released 1 hour ago](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-piece-of-the-puzzle-missing-from-micron-technology-inc.s-nasdaq%3Amu-27-share-price-climb)

*""Micron Technology appears to be back in favour with a solid price jump getting its P/E back in line with most other companies. We'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.*

*Our examination of Micron Technology's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook isn't contributing to its P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see a strong earnings outlook with faster-than-market growth, we assume potential risks are what might be placing pressure on the P/E ratio. At least the risk of a price drop looks to be subdued, but investors seem to think future earnings could see some volatility.""*

[Noteworthy options activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/noteworthy-tuesday-option-activity%3A-tsla-aapl-mu)

*""And Micron Technology Inc. (Symbol: MU) saw options trading volume of 276,425 contracts, representing approximately 27.6 million underlying shares or approximately 160.3% of MU's average daily trading volume over the past month, of 17.2 million shares. Particularly high volume was seen for the $87 strike call option expiring November 26, 2021, with 37,219 contracts trading so far today, representing approximately 3.7 million underlying shares of MU.""*

[MU Rallies against the grain](https://www.investing.com/analysis/micron-rallies-against-the-grain-200609364)

*""Despite a run of bad news in recent weeks, shares of semiconductor company Micron (NASDAQ:MU) found themselves among the better performing equities on Friday of last week as well during yesterday’s session. Though they retreated from their highs into last night’s close, they were at one point up 15% in just two days’ worth of trading.*

*Even with the weak close last night, they’re still up close to 30% since the middle of October. Not bad for a company that’s struggled to generate a positive headline since the summer and whose shares had been trending down since April.*

*The Boise, Idaho headquartered company was among those most affected by this past summer’s supply chain constraints, which manifested itself in lowered guidance in the company’s fiscal Q4 earnings last September.*

Though they managed to beat analyst expectations on the top-line revenue and bottom-line EPS, the drop in their forecasted fiscal Q1 revenue from $8.49 billion to $7.65 billion meant shares would continue to fall to 2021 lows. In the weeks afterward, the situation appeared only to get worse.""*

[Why MU popped Tuesday](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/11/23/why-micron-stock-popped-today/)

*""Shares of computer memory-maker Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) jumped out of the gate Tuesday, rising as much as 4.6% before turning tail and retreating to a 2.2% gain as of 11:25 a.m. ET. (Which is still respectable, given that the rest of the Nasdaq Stock Market is down about 1%!).*

*You can thank investment bank Mizuho for the reprieve.""*



[](https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/stock-update/will-micron-technology-inc-mu-stay-at-the-top-of-the-technology-sector-2)

*""Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) is near the top in its sector according to InvestorsObserver. MU gets an overall rating of 62. That means it scores higher than 62% of stocks. Micron Technology, Inc. gets a 77 rank in the Technology sector. Technology is number 5 out of 11 sectors.""*",1,2021-11-24 19:48:32

The currently enabled features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous. The activation and use of these features are dependent on achieving reliability far in excess of human drivers as demonstrated by billions of miles of experience, as well as regulatory approval, which may take longer in some jurisdictions. As these self-driving features evolve, your car will be continuously upgraded through over-the-air software updates.

9848,hlro21e,t3_r0ba4c,"You are not comparing apples to apples here. Tesla FSD and nvidia chips are not the same product. There are exactly 0 cars with Nvidia FSD.

Rather than FSD, nvidia chips are used for standard upgrades to vehicles. For example, my Honda fit has lane keeping and adaptive cruise control. Those features cost me between $1000-2000. On a tesla, those features come standard. So you could say that 100% of tesla users buy that tech, and less than 100% buy it for honda (If I remember correctly, the base model didnt even have the option when I bought my car).


Comparing FSD (which is doesnt have a great definition for comparison) to all forms of sensors is not a great comparison. It is really easy to detect the large metal car directly in front of you moving at appoximately the same speed, but it is a huge step to detecting a crosswalk 2 miles ahead or a one way sign for full self-driving.",92,2021-11-23 22:03:53

Also, the reason FSD is not purchased by most of Tesla owners is because it's still beta.  
I own a Model 3 and a Chevy Bolt and I can tell you that Tesla is decades ahead of other car companies.   
Btw, FSD is almost complete and Dojo supercomputer is not even live. When Tesla starts using Dojo, it will be a game changer, history.",7,2021-11-23 23:01:20

There are no FSD cars on the market using nvidia tech. It looks like there is a plan for a 2024 Mercedes, and nvidia more recently announced that it was releasing it's next gen AI drive system for 2024 cars. So I would expect that is when we will get the first look, in about 2-3 years.   


Nvidia is not a car manufacturer, and seems to be selling a DIY-type kit. Basically saying, hey, we have a system that uses X sensors, but car manufacturers can pick and choose which features/hardware they want. This means at the very least, car makers are going to have to figure out how to integrate and change the base systems for specific cars. I have no idea what this means, but it doesn't look like there is going to be a single ""nvidia FSD"", but rather a bunch of various versions of it.

&#x200B;

What this means to me is that it is going to go into the cost function of car makers. FSD is not going to be a standard option for years, if not decades. Car manufacturers are going to charge for it (just like they charge for leather, heated seats, or remote ignition). If the price of lane assist/adaptive cruise control is any indicator...I would guess that it is going to cost several thousand dollars at a minimum.   


Looking at what data I could find on Honda Sensing, the honda version of adaptive cruise control, it currently costs about $1,000 for some cars, and on the non-base models it is included in the price. It looks like in 2016 the purchase rate for sensing was maybe under 30% for new cars, and is now just under 70%.   


So if you tell me nvidia FSD is going to be 1,000.....I would say tesla is going to have a bad time, but my guess is that it will be quite a bit more expensive, and once you start getting into a few thousand dollars for a feature that a lot of people don't actually trust or want....11% doesn't actually seem like a low adoption rate for a relatively untested and (kind of) useless technology.",2,2021-11-24 08:13:49

Most people are also buying these ""cheap"" options to play big names like Tesla because they can't afford ATM or ITM.  There usually is a formula for success that can work for anyone.  I believe the average retail trader believes buying 50 $1 OTM calls vs 1 $50 ATM/ITM call will net them a larger return but this is false.  The delta on the ATM/ITM would typically be $0.50+ versus maybe $0.08 on the OTM.

10247,hm2bt2q,t1_hm250fq,80% of Millionaires in the United States are self made.  What you consider a small gain and they consider a small gain is purely a matter of perspective.  Neither are wrong.,1,2021-11-26 02:48:38
10248,hm2pslj,t1_hm2gubk,"For sure.  

The stocks you pick to trade options also matter a great deal.  For example; I prefer NVDA & TSLA lately because they often recover very well from selloffs and will give you clearer direction.  Both obviously are popular and their profitability will continue to bring in more buyers.  Also, they are volatile and move well in both directions with NVDA being the easier of the two to trade.  

If you have been losing money trading options because of volatility, getting shaken out, stress, etc then the following strategy may help.  Determine the latest hot sector of the market i.e. energy, financials, retail, etc and trade options in the corresponding ETF.  For example XLE - Energy, XLF - Financials, etc.  These ETFs can still make you good money and won't move dramatically in either position.  They can help you learn the mechanics and make money at the same time without exhausting your mental energy.

My personal basic strategy is to find the ITM call or put that has the highest open interest and volume.  These usually have the tightest spreads and make it easy for me to move in and out.

Try not to focus on the P/L, as you will get shaken out easily, but rather trade the chart. Sell half of your position at predetermined resistance levels that lose momentum without hesitation.  This will ensure profitable trades. 

Also, if you are newer to options trading then I recommend only trading 1 contract at a time as this will keep your stress level down and allow you understand how the particular stock/option you are in behaves.  (Yes, they have their own behavior lol). 

If you are more of an intermediate trader then slowly add to your position.  If i intend to buy 10 contracts I will add 1-2 at the point when I get to my target entry.  Often times what we believe is a great entry will temporarily break down and offer us a better entry.  This is when I will add more.  If I don't get the small capitulation move down then i add on the way up.  All of this is fine and never beat yourself up for not getting it ""perfect"".

I know you didn't ask for all this info but these are the lessons I've learned and allow me to consistently make money and trade for a living.",13,2021-11-26 04:29:23

10311,hm2kbk8,t1_hm1wp4s,"I get the feeling that the ""bubble"" we're in might not even be a real bubble.

COVID just accelerated things and made the companies of the future be worth a lot more a lot faster. Demand for their products/services skyrocketed and lots of people are **not** willing to go back.

A lot of stocks have been crashing, QQQ/SPY are getting carried by mega caps, truth is tech is the present and will be the future, I see no reason not to invest on it. And no, this isn't like the dot com bubble where you had old men investing in stuff they didn't know anything about, now you have everyone investing on what they know is king. In 2000 the Internet/tech was gonna be the future, now it's both the present and the future.

Why go to a shop when I can order shit from Amazon?

Why go to work if I can work remotely and communicate via Microsoft/Facebook software?

Now that I'm going out less might as well buy a new phone that uses either Apple or Google's OS. Then there's like two or three relevant chip producers for phones...

Social media boomed hard, even if everyone claims to hate it.

Everything has chips now so why not invest on chip producers? 

Data centers, AI, gaming, video rendering, whatever, everything grew massively during 2020, and guess who you're buying your shit from when you get into that: AMD, NVDA, Intel, there's no real alternatives.

There may be dips, massive ones, but at this point I'm pretty sure you can hold onto any of those stocks for 10 years and they'll be higher.",13,2021-11-26 03:49:31
10312,hm25elo,t1_hm1p8nq,"That's what they said back in 2018. AMD investors don't care, we made bank",6,2021-11-26 02:03:23

10315,hm31452,t1_hm30ed6,"I'm just talking out of my ass, I believe and invest as if we were in a bubble, but at the same time I consider that the other possibility might be also true.

Lost of money printing --> more money --> inflation --> everything goes up in price *including stocks*. Sure, when we get rate hikes stuff might go down a bit, but a lot of companies I've been following for years now have already crashed badly (30~50% down YTD). The big companies that have been growing nonstop are basically the companies that would've gone that far up in due time, COVID just accelerated things.

Lets be real here, a lot of people work from home now and only started doing so because of the pandemic, the only reason that wasn't done 10 years ago was because of our work culture.

I haven't done a proper analysis because I'm an idiot so I'm just basing what I say based on what I follow, QQQ/SPY seem to be getting boosted by basically 10 mega caps and that's all there is to it... which I'm not even sure is a bad thing. The whole idea about how in a dystopic future a few corporations might run the world instead of governments isn't really anything crazy, over time private mega corporations have been accumulating power and getting their fingers into as many pies as possible. I expect the biggest companies to eventually concentrate most of the wealth, same way the ultra rich get richer faster than the average Joe (see pareto distribution).",4,2021-11-26 05:57:51

Interesting, but I have never considered looking at shorted data for indicators like the TBT even though I track the TNT (TBT equivalent) and VIX daily. But to answer your question, for the month of November, I see the TBT being shorted much less than for October. It went from #582 to #628 in notional value, which may reflect improving market sentiment.

Thank you for that change in perspective.",2,2021-11-26 09:51:17

I think we could roll out a huge list this applies to. I’m not a gold bug, but I understand that when everything tanks and you have cheap gold it’ll be hard to get physical delivery and the premiums will go up to offset low spot.

There is so much unused gold. Store of value only counts if  you attribute so much value to it as you do. In a real crisis you can trade an ounce for 10 loafs of bread or even less. A lot of other metals dont rust or degrade, the only real valuable is:gold is a good conductor, thats it. Wood=i can heat my ass, use it for furniture, boats etc., corn i can eat it and get energy. All these commodities are way more useful in crisis times. Gold is just a great conductor and shiny. It's intrinsic value is way less than people think.",2,2021-11-26 21:22:50

Everyone thinks Intel is gonna catch up which they are doing to an extent in consumer space on performance but I don't think so in servers unless something drastic happens.

AMD is prioritising efficiency now which heavily hints to me they are looking to dominate the HPC server market. Market has barely reacted to them trouncing Nvidia with a GPU that Intel has been failing to make work for the DoD with a bottomless pit of govt subsidy (Ponte Vechio equivalent).

Maybe im misunderstanding something about the deal but the net effect to amd share holders will be a larger float in exchange for assets, which is dilutive, not saying its a bad thing, in fact im very long on both names, but it was just my opinion that a short-run equilibrium would quickly play out.

Their big risk is they are reliant on other foundries.

I think Intel is going to crash and burn personally I think the doubters are right, they are going to overextend trying to do everything and failing to win anything, they are literally copying AMD and Apple, nothing suggests they will exceed them, their big advantage is they have some very well developed accelerated Math libraries but AMD is catching up fast, with CUDA as well. They'll be relegated to a decade of celeron level (relative) chips in budget laptops and languish at a $40 share price imo whilst they slowly lose their grip on distributors and PC brands.

Lowering taxes for corps has done nothing for the economy, which has been on a steady decline in terms of meaningful metrics ( like oh.. wages ), while corporate taxes have repeatedly been reduced to.. well, next to nothing. 

Closing tax loopholes for the wealthy and actually taxing corps would have absolutely closed the pre-Trump deficit, and begun to make progress on the debt. 

Also, corps next 70% of all revenue in the U.S., and also only make up 5% of businesses. I'd wager that the most damage to our roads is done by trucks delivering to them and cars commuting to them, so, they can fucking pay to fix our crumbling infrastructure.

They don't just lose money on that. It's like health insurance.. sure, they technically pay, but they just offload that to employees in the form of salary reductions. They're not going to take that hit. 

The Fed pumping the economy with 0% interest rates for years does not a good economy make, but okay. The economy, by all meaningful measures, got worse for people on the ground. Wages did not rise with cost of living and homes continued to become unbelievably expensive. Stonks/corporate profits do not the economy make. 

No idea what the fuck you're talking about, but okey dokey. They net 70% of all revenue at 5% of total companies. 

Statista and tradingeconomics.com. 

A 25% effective tax rate would have closed ""normal"" deficit from the Bush or Obama eras with much left over. Currently, combined with tracking down the other approximately 500b in evaded taxes, we'd have a deficit that looked much more reasonable, and if next year the pandemic  was sorted out and government spending decreased, we would very likely be in the black. If they'd reverse the Trump era tax cuts as well, we'd also be looking much more manageable. 

As most people are aware, the best way to close a deficit is to raise taxes ( not lower them - not that they could get much lower for corps without going negative ), along with slashing the budget to some degree. Either/or won't fix it at this point without causing a severe recession. UNLESS for some reason you think that your decreased taxes will stimulate economic growth that actually raise tax revenue, but, that can only go so far, and a 3-6% tax rate for corps is already obscenely low. Reductions have already well met with diminishing returns in that area. 

Progressive taxes on corporate PROFITS spur reinvestment in their companies, which benefits the general economy. 

It's actually kinda disgusting to see that small/private business taxes some years are almost as much of a contributor to the budget as corp taxes, considering they make like a third of the revenue.",1,2021-11-29 03:42:24

10823,hmkybzl,t1_hmkowhf,"Earnings season brings a whole new aspect of volatility with the strategy you brought up. By the time you buy options close to the underlying’s current market value right before earnings, the IV is going to (usually) be higher than normal - because everyone is trying to do it at the same time. Which means that even if the underlying goes the direction you want it to, you can still lose money on the option play if everyone else who made the same bet you did starts unloading their contracts at the same time, and *especially* if the underlying goes the wrong direction. 

There are safer strategies when it comes to earnings than buying an option close to the strike. Long strangles could be worth researching.",1,2021-11-30 05:34:28

If you think it's a bad idea, then can you tell me why? I won't try and waste money on something that's already proven to be unsuccessful, and that's why I reached out to this sub to get some more experienced people's takes on this. Your criticism is totally aimed to be destructive because I probably sound like an optimistic ignorant who thinks making money is easy. Instead, couldn't you reason me out with logic instead of telling to me lose money?

10833,hmnj6xi,t1_hmmtkeh,"You have no idea how oversimplistic your theory is… it’s not even a strategy. 

Yes I’m being a smart ass, but I’m also saying correct thing.

If you have a theory and you believe you found a way to beat the system, you should test it out. I believe when you do, you will realize the market is much more complex and “a living thing” than you realize now.

If you believe that stocks back off their all time highs “60% of the time they get there,” test it out. I believe you’ll realize that you just made up a completely random number - and hypothesis. 

Algorithmic and high frequency trading would also exploit anything that simple - if it were that simple. Making money in the stock market simply isn’t. 

Most TA is hindsight. It’s easy to look backwards and see what you should’ve done. 

Finally how will you cut your losses if the trade goes against you? Betting against a stock can lead to infinite losses. You might end up making 1% when you are correct and losing 20+ when you are wrong. 

My suggestion again if you think you have a system is to test it out by paper trading. If you do - it will work and you can continue doing it with real money. 

Otherwise as a novice trader you should expect to lose at least $20,000 before you learn your head from your ass… if you’re really in this.",1,2021-11-30 20:04:23

10968,hnjg6bb,t1_hnj5hr3,"It's not just the proximity, it's how rowhammer interacts with the refresh cycle, Target Row Refresh (TRR) in DDR 4, redesigned and called Refresh Management which does more selective, and less predictable, refresh cycles.

Edit: and, until then, that capex is heavy.",1,2021-12-07 07:50:57
10970,hnjpop9,t1_hnjg6bb,"So from my understanding, you (in ddr4) typically refresh the rows every 64ms. You can double that rate but with performance issues. But even doubling it  isn't a very effective practice against row hammering.  So how would randomizing refresh rates, if let's say the average refresh rate is 64ms with a variance of (and I'm making this up) +/- 48 ms, effect the ability of attack rows lighting up victim rows?

Edit: after reading the publication, I realize their row hammering technique realize on ""base time T"" where T is an *assumed* refresh rate. With out the assumed refresh rate (randomized), it would take a different approach to effectively hammer. However I'm still unsure how optimistic I am on the ability for sudo-random functions to defend against such novel attacks in the future.

Edit2: if I'm wrong about any of my conclusions, please let me know. I'm grateful for bringing this to my attention and would like to understand it correctly.",-1,2021-12-07 11:10:08

I was a Tesla shareholder for over a year, and saw my 1 share for $1,000 split into 5 shares, which then rose to $1,200. That’s when I sold them, the valuation is just bonkers. I thought it was too risky when I bought that one share, now the prices are crazy, ripe for a crash but nobody knows when.

11207,hom1iof,t1_holzhwe,"first thing first, Taiwan and $TSM are key and at the heart of this all and the taiwan geopolitical climate is heating up so take that into consideration, China is saying Taiwan is theirs, and US are saying it's independent country if a cold war turned hot, i would assume there would be more silicon scarcity and supply chain interruption [due to the dependency on TSM and other asian chip fabs ](https://www.supplychainbrain.com/articles/32482-the-world-is-dangerously-dependent-on-taiwan-for-semiconductors)

[might even be an additional reasoning ](https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3159107/us-china-tech-war-china-overtake-america-core-21st-century)

[might also be why TSM is building foundries stateside now](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-tsmc-looks-double-down-us-chip-factories-talks-europe-falter-2021-05-14/) [source 2](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/tsmc-to-build-a-12-billion-advanced-semiconductor-plant-in-arizona-with-u-s-government-support/)

TSM is the market

[some estimates are 70% or market share up to 90% at some points in time](https://time.com/6102879/semiconductor-chip-shortage-tsmc/)  
[another chart on TSM](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EyY0-tgVgAAbgX4?format=jpg&name=medium)

all this being said, i am bullish on semis overall, just gotta know which ones to pick and when   
personally i'm bullish on TSM  and AMD, per reasons above and as they are being put in everything to power many things due to silicon scarcity they offer very good AIO chips that have half decent graphics performance all on same die

i'm also bullish Samsung but i can't invest in them as i'm not KR citizen 

and i'm also bullish ASML just because their hardware is what's needed to produce these chips in the first place

and i'm bearish on INTC overall, [although they are trying to get pork from the CHIPS bill but the irony is it would just be taking tax dollars to send chips to be made in a fab they have in Chengdu, China](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-13/white-house-spurns-intel-plan-to-boost-chip-production-in-china) and [due to the problems they've had in the past with 7nm](https://www.pcmag.com/news/despite-7nm-struggle-intel-to-keep-investing-in-5nm-3nm-chip-technologies) and also [due to their outsourcing of their 5nm chips to TSM](https://www.eenewseurope.com/news/intel-TSMC-5nm) but again they might get some short term upside action with the CHIPS bill 

i day or swing trade the rest for now, i'm waiting to see what these short term catalysts events bring before i go back long into these

all this being stated, i do believe some of these semi companies are a bit frothy via being pumped up via options, if your goal is short term plays or gains, then semis might need to cool off a bit first

however if your goal is to just get into these companies for future growth, then they are all fine companies, some just stick out better than others

finally some resources

Why does every Intel stock owner post this info regarding Intel 10nm and TSMC 7nm.  You use a flawed logic that since Intel 10nm competes with TSMC 7nm then once Intel release their 7nm their way ahead in foundry tech.  In reality their pretty much equal in terms of transistor density.  This confusion is why Intel is relabeling their 10nm node processors to 7nm.

The trailing PE is 93 and the forward PE is 70. 

Where will this stock be when it’s PE multiple reaches that of a mature growth mega-cap stock (ie... PE 35)?


A possible outcome:
They crush next years earnings forecasts by 30% but perhaps sales growth slows marginally because law of large numbers. So Earnings end next 12 months at 4.23 x 1.3 = $5.50 x 55 PE = $300 stock price. 
But really, sales growth doesn’t have to slow for the market to demand some multiple compression. 

Many other outcomes are possible but unless earnings get to $10/share over the next 2 years this stock isn’t going much higher.

Intel has never been doubled ($100) it's current price when it had a 98% market share and record revenue/profits.  And somehow you expect the share price to double while losing market share, with lower margins, a down trending stock market and increasing it's debt to pay for the new fabs??

BUT Ever since Amazon bought Annapurna Labs in 2015, they began using that technology and developing their own custom chips and they did it SPECIFICALLY to cut Intel out of their costs. In November 2020, Apple released the first Macs with an Arm-based M1 chip, so now Intel doesn't even have the PC market anymore. 
So, what do you buy? Look at what the big fund managers are doing. Look at Fidelity's select semiconductor fund FSELX - Intel isn't even on their top 10 holdings. Compute is ALWAYS going to be a thing but Intel let the market pass them and, honestly, I don't know if the new Intel CEO, Pat Gelsinger, whose been holding the reins for 10 months is doing anything worth making a bet on.

Prepare to be down voted by the entire planet of the apes. 


They think that because something happened to a particular stock once, that it must have to happen again. 

GME had a powerful mechanical force behind it's price action, almost like a compressed spring. AMC had a similar, but smaller spring. Those springs were under extreme tension at $20 and $4. Once that spring was released, it lost its potential energy. At $200 and $50, the springs are entirely unsprung. 

Now, you have a bunch of apes jumping up and down on the spring, thinking it'll launch then to moon, yelling ""the spring hasn't sprungze!"" 

But it has. 

Spring has sprungze. 

Now is the time to find the next big spring: another stock that is severely undervalued, with a potential catalyst to release it.",1,2021-12-18 21:52:57

Tips for beginners: if you start shorting when price goes down, you risk shorting at the bottom. Eventually you will.

*Don't short when things are going bad. Short when things are going great, when the market is performing too good to be true.* 

You will never short at the bottom this way. The chance is higher that you will short at the very top. Don't go all-in. Slowly buy your positions consistently over a period of time. Exit your positions as soon as price breaks out against you, and start over again.",5,2021-12-29 17:00:12

Your biggest mistake might have been position sizing, and/or maybe holding too long (don't know if this was an overnight loss or long term). You don't want to be in a position where one or two bad trades wipe you out. Even if you are good, it's easy to be wrong twice in a row.

Things I do:

1. Since I trade only options (mostly spreads),  I keep half of my portfolio in cash all the time, so a black swan event (or bad judgement) doesn't wipe me out. Discipline.

2. I trade many small positions. One (or a few) trades going bad is usually no big deal. Unexpected stuff happens all the time. Diversification in underlyings and time frames is helpful.

3. I enter trades thinking about how much I can lose, not how much I can win.

4. Have an exit plan in case things don't go as expected.

5. I trade boring etfs mostly. Fewer surprises than individual stocks.",11,2021-12-31 12:18:12

But sadly ending the year with a $1k balance after throwing it all into NVDA options that didn't pan out... probably looking at \~$35k-38k in losses. Hopefully next year will be better for me.
