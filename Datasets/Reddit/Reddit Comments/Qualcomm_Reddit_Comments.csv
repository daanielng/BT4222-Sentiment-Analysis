Older QC0M royalty model: well, the industry got a lot more competitive over the years and QC0M has burnt itself badly over this, especially with the Antitrust in China. It would be foolish to even assume a unit sale pricing percentage model for automotive.

Even if SaaS multiples fall back to reality - let's say multiples contract 50% - we're still looking at 5x current BB prices. That's assuming BB can establish itself as having similar guidance and growth expectations as CRWD/PLTR etc.

It's a very rare opportunity when 100% is the bear case.

233,gk118gi,t3_l1o1ta,"I am long BB but recently they have made most of their money by selling patents. Something like over 60% of their revenue is from that, however they were still down 20% in revenue this past year compared to 2019. 

BB is now near a 3 year high off of some good news but nothing to actually show for it. This is all speculation without results. This is a high entry point if you are trying to get in now. BB has been doing extremely poor as a stock and I doubt (but hope) it keeps increasing. Iv been burnt on this like most long BB people and we want nothing more than to see it succeed but, this may be a poor entry to the stock.

389,gk0r96k,t1_gk0q6u5,"The shorts decide when they will have their execution.  So it’s not like GME has a planned date to squeeze.  But it has to happen & there’s a few VERY good reasons it will happen before June.  


So in my head. I know I can’t lose more than 30% on GME, waaay too many people believe in it & waaay too much big money jumped in north of $30.  They don’t have the 2 second attention span that most of us here at WSB have.  


And we know, that there has to be a short reckoning (most likely with the next couple of months).  It could be this week, it could be next week, it could be a month from now.  But you’re not jumping into a squeeze when the price moves from $40 to $200... 


GME is a position you have to be in & ready for the squeeze.  I think it could easily have a 500% return in the next 5 months.  


I don’t see PLTR having a 500% return in the next 5 months (I like them, I would be long PLTR, but I sold my shares & calls to jump in GME).  The math just makes sense to me.  


BB is more likely to maybe double or triple over the same time frame, I’m not an expert on that one.  Some expect PLTR to double by EOM.  🤷🏼‍♂️.  


I would say that if you have calls in PLTR, you are *might* be risking more if the price action doesn’t jump a ton by EOM.  But that’s just my thoughts- I’m just your average idiot, not an advisor lol",9,2021-01-21 10:56:29

481,gk4vf53,t3_l2c4dh,"> Just looking at financials alone and the amount of $ revenue they bring in compared to the industry standards, $BB stock price seemed quite undervalued in comparison. 


Why? What math? 2020 is only year revenue went up. 


> Amazon on a EV platform around data sensors, automation, and cybersecurity.


What rumors. There was the EV platform rumors but that’s all. EV have sensors so sure. Automation as in self driving? Sure but QNX IVY isn’t about self driving and would be very late to the game if it was. So industrial automation? 


Cyber security with Cylance? It made $50m for them and cost $1.4b. 


>FB suit


How much? 


> SpaceX, Zoom, Qualcomm, governments, and many more are working with $BB as we speak today. Sony recently just announced their partnership with $BB for their next upcoming car last week. Overall, lots of exciting news back to back.


Sources. Links. Spacex - for what ? QNX rocket?  Zoom? For what? Data integrity when it already has a China backdoor? Qualcomm? For what ? 


BB has worked with some gov historically but specifically on what? 


Sony partnership. Cool. Sony doesn’t make cars. They made 1 and said they weren’t selling it. BB also gets $5 a car fee. 


> This all depends if $BB is capable of hiring great salespeople to execute on their job. Only time will tell.

Nobody wants to work there. They have lots of job postings for that reason. Would you rather work at BB and get paid less $ and get worthless options or work at GOOG and get valuable options and paid more $? 


The way I see it is it potentially was overlooked and revenue is growing. That’s the only possibility for it’s up value to be real. 


Stocks are overlooked all the time. 


Maybe no profit last 4yr because reinvesting and research expenses etc. and accounting write downs (non cash). But cash flow from ops is also negative I think, or not great. 


EV or not, car sales are probably not spiking any time soon so nothing changed on the sales front for BB IVY, unless these new deals are guaranteed revenue. We’d have to know their details. 


Tech price to sales is 5-10x. MSFT is at 10 P/S. Is BB on par with MSFT? 

BB was at 3-4 P/S and now is at 7.5 P/S which is more reasonable for them. (TTM - trailing 12mo) (https://ycharts.com/companies/BB/ps_ratio)


P/S doesn’t factor in growth of the future. If sales growth then the ratio will go down unless the stock goes down.


 If we can confirm based on the items above that BB sales will increase (which, without the details to confirm it I would argue yes; how much, unknown) then there is room for BB price to increase. 


BB price is fair to increase a bit from its current price as well to perhaps 8.50x P/S. That would put the stock at $14.11. 


Throw in some growth there and in a year it wouldn’t be unreasonable to see **$18.43 share price. **


Again this assumes the initial above points are all vetted and the revenue is strong.",6,2021-01-22 10:53:44

To develop self driving vehicules, you need large amount of data and a cloud connected service like Ivy will allow for real time feedback about the cars, the weather or the driver. That is pointed out in official info releases. Again, not super difficult to find...

And like you said... 2020 revenue was up. Revenue mainly based on automotive software was up during a year where car sales went down 22%.

And then none of this takes into account their cash position which is perfectly fine and their 38 000 patent portfolio reportedly worth between 2-3 billion dollars (and they are looking to sell most of those to refocus on software)",6,2021-01-22 11:44:21

BB won’t be developing self driving cars lol. Not a chance. They are way too far behind and that is not cloud software. Interrupt connection car crash. ??? I don’t know everything so please explain otherwise. And please explain why Tesla would lose to BB in self driving.

Does BB get higher $ per license for EV? If yes, what? What are forecasted sales #?

IoT is buzz word at this point. I need to know how does it make money.

As an interesting aside, back around 2010, their cyber security tools and services were actually in demand by 3rd world and  authoritarian governments, because competitive products by US companies were viewed as being succeptiple to government spying.

From my understanding, QNX is monetized on a per unit basis (it was mentionned a couple years ago between 3-5$ per unit). So the more car, the more money. Now QNX represent about 47% of the market right now for OS and their closest competitor is at 20%.

What they didn't figure out yet is how IVY is going to be monetized like they said in the transcript.
IVY is going to be OS agnostic, meaning your car doesn't need to run QNX to use IVY for data gathering.
Are they going to go with a per unit basis or a subscription basis for the service? Idk, they don't seem to have this figured out OR won't say yet.",7,2021-01-24 14:14:55

With BB the math roughly is something like 2$ stock value per something like I think 1 or 2b. It's not huge.

The stories written about how BB has sold phone patents to Huawei on the other hand turns heads of investors. Why? Because everything still thinks its a cellphone company. Unless you've looked into the company you prob dont know what they do.

In a sense the FB settlement maybe has made some do some research as well.

$NOK has about 5.6 billion shares of float. More or less, this means that the stock price *should* have less volatility due to higher liquidity. 

I mentioned in my last post that on 27 January, daily trade volume surpassed 1 billion shares. This extremely high volume reduced liquidity and caused higher volatility - price extended almost to $10 and then back to $7 in a short period of time.

QCOM has been on my watchlist for many years and I own it, if they can stay out of trouble, not take any law suits, and keep doing what they are now, and make nm shrinks i believe in them. I'm now moving into the defence industry, LMT RTX TXT and there's a reason why In not in that industry anymore. Its because those things happen.

They have decreased production of graphics cards, and new tariffs that were put in place last month have fucked their profits. Same thing for aftermarket cards. 

Can't find a 3060ti at MSRP, can't find a 3070 at all, 3080's are 2x-3x the price (scalpers on ebay), etc.

Plus AMD has some rumors going around that they are making GPU's that will have SIGNIFICANTLY better ray tracing than Nvidia's current GPU's. 

Hopefully the 3060 SUPER and 3070ti or whatever gpu that they want to produce next will come out soon, but it won't come out in time for earnings. I'll play for Q1 or something.

TSMC actually agreed to be a temporary fab for Intel like you said, until they recently announced they were bringing in a new CEO (their ex-CTO, an actual engineer, not just a businessman) who basically shot the deal in the head by implying they wouldn't rely on ""external foundries"" as much as they were rumored to before. TSMC somehow found extra capacity at their fabs for Intel, something that still confuses me since they're basically already operating at 100% and not taking new orders (see also: Nvidia being forced to go to Samsung for consumer Ampere GPUs).

Intel is targeting 2023 for their 7nm process to be fixed, at which point they'll probably steamroll AMD since they own their own fabs and can operate them at maximum speed.

I think it's a good time to be selling shovels (chip fabrication) instead of mining for gold (chip designers).

The problem with TSMC right now is that they're supply-constrained because of a lack of certain materials (mainly Ajinomoto build-up film, or ""ABF""). At the same time there's intense demand from traditional high-performance compute and mobile chipmakers (AMD, Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, anyone-that-isn't-Intel). TSMC is literally operating at 100% capacity at all of their fabs: 5nm for Apple and Qualcomm (who missed hard on earnings due to lack of supply), 7nm for AMD's CPUs/GPUs/console APUs and Nvidia's datacenter GPUs, with 3nm coming online for Apple in 2022, and a shiny new 5nm fab scheduled to open in 2024 in Arizona.

The demand is so intense that even Nvidia with their unlimited amount of money can't get their 30-series GPUs manufactured at TSMC because there's simply no more capacity. The rumor that was floating around a while ago was that Leather Jacket Man supposedly wanted a discount for all Ampere products and TSMC said no, hence consumer GPUs having to being made on Samsung's 8nm node (where yields are very low, one of the reasons for the Great GPU Shortage of 2020-21). Nvidia recently doubled down by signing a new agreement with Samsung to increase production of dies for 30-series cards, but who knows when that'll resolve itself. It also doesn't help that AMD is allocating 80% of their capacity for consoles and 20% for their own products at TSMC on 7nm.

I dont know why governments around the world are blaming* TSMC for the automotive semiconductor shortages, when less advanced semiconductor companies (like NXPI, IFFNY, STM, etc.) are the ones to blame, along with the automakers themselves. When COVID-19 hit, automakers decided to scale back on purchasing less advanced semiconductors (we're talking larger chips for stuff like power steering, not infotainment systems) from these smaller companies because they thought they wouldn't sell any cars last year. Instead they saw increased demand to the point where even Ford shut down the plant where they build F-150s, their most profitable vehicle. Automotive semiconductors literally make up only ~3% of TSMC's sales - compare that to 48% for mobile and 33% for HPC.

Positions: heavily long on TSM, AMD, NVDA, MU, AVGO, might pick up some more QCOM if they dip further. If I could somehow invest in Samsung's fab business or just the chipmaking side of Apple instead of the entire companies, I would.

**tl;dr**: I like the stock.

He left Broadcom after doing some networking stuff.

He left AMD again before Zen was finished.

He left Tesla after working on self-driving tech.

Now he works for a Canadian machine learning chipmaker.

I don't know. I only own some Micron (compared to everything else) for some exposure to DRAM and NAND flash since I can't invest in Samsung or SK Hynix, the other two largest providers of those products. Right now, Micron stock price is at an all time high.

Another one of the factors of why there's a huge GPU shortage currently is because Nvidia can't get enough GDDR6X for the 3080/3090 and GDDR6 for the 3070/3060Ti from Micron. Why Nvidia didn't partner up with Samsung (since they're already partnered up for die fabrication) is beyond me.

>Long game AMD might use this opportunity with Biden to reenter the fabrication game on a discount but who knows.

I really don't see this happening. AMD sold/spun off their foundry business into GlobalFoundries because they were bleeding money. AMD still uses them for the 12nm IO die for Ryzen processors, and that's because they don't need to be as complex as the Zen chiplets made by TSMC so they save money. It's just more cost effective to outsource to companies whose sole business is literally making chips.

The only companies that can pull off designing their own processors while simultaneously owning their own fabs are Intel (because they've always done it that way, but look at how they screwed themselves with their broken 10/7nm nodes), and Samsung with their mobile Exynos SoCs and memory ICs (lots of money to throw at the problem).",7,2021-02-12 13:43:09

1327,gn833h5,t3_liyay9,"A little background info. In 2017 AMD released their zen architecture, and soon after they released zen 2 architecture. They were a commercial success in a time where AMD had something like 10% of all sales or less. Intell fell behind and is not catching up.
Before that, AMD really invested in using PCIe lanes to connect two (or maybe more) processors in the future together. PCIe is an open standard that is used by tons of companies. Intel uses their weird proprietary standard, that has real issues in terms of performance. When AMD needs more performance between chips they just use more PCIe lanes.
Speaking of which, those PCIe lanes are also used to connect high-speed fibreoptic networking equipment. The latest version of PCIe is 4.0, only supported with AMD cpu's. Intel who also makes network cards, had to delay their newest generation network card because it had no intel processor with PCIe 4.0.

Remember that AMD has experience with graphics cards? Yeah the sales for that sucked, but it gave them something else. They have some graphics cards which uses so called HBM memory. Memory that's faster than regular computer memory. This means they have some experience and  technology in house to mitigate an anticipated problem with next gen computers. They have experience with GDDR memory, with DDR, and with HBM. Intel has experience with DDR memory only. There are also rumors that some of that fancy memory will end up on the newer generation AMD chips, boosting their performance even more. I don't remember Intel being that innovative since the forced jump to 64 bit processors that AMD caused them to do about 20 years back.

Intel seems to still be investing heavily in chips that have less cores but higher speed per core, and AMD seems to do thesame, plus they just double the amounth of cores Intel uses. This gives AMD an edge because they just have to double the core count to keep up with intel which is easy for them now, and then every other thing will put them further ahead.

Right now, the fastest server chip is a €7.000,- AMD chip costing 30% less than the best Intel chip. It also has twice the performance. 
So to get similar performance you'd have to spend €20.000,- on Intel chips. People who build datacenters know this, and they are switching over to AMD. Some are still grasping to intel out of historic bias, but that'll die off over the years.
The enteusiast consumer switched already, or plans to when their next pc dies. (These are the people you ask what your next pc should be for €500,- , and they'll probably will recommend AMD from now on.) AMD seems to be also rising on the laptop market, although I don't really have any sales data on that. Only in a select few workloads is it still favourably on Intel, and I can only see that dwindling.

This all AMD in an immensely greater position than Intel. Please correct me if I said something wrong.

On a sidenote, I'd personally like to invest in a chip producer called SiFive if I could.

Lots of products secretly have some RISC-V in there already, and RISC-V has a massive role in university research and training. It makes me wonder who at apple decided with all his megabrain to jump on ARM chips for their new systems. It's already a technology without a future after 10 years to me.

My point is, with demand so high across the technical spectrum and existing players ramping up manufacturing efforts, parsing the anticipated expanded capability of each manufacturer by level of technical complexity (like, how fucking sophisticated the fucking chip is) would be useful--this is supply. Then you parse the demand in a similar way. That would break out into seperate markets for seperate levels of chip based on complexity, and would explain how, in a major shortage, different companies could target different segments of the market and all make a killing.  The non-retard question is; after the highway starts working again does that additional manufacturing capacity crash the price of chips?

As you mentioned, they are lobbying Congress about the chip shortage, and as soon as congress gives in, the stock will likely jump. Also, I see much more potential for growth from AMD compared to Nvidia or Intel, their competitors. Aside from the fact that they are seen as very pro-consumer these days and that trend will probably continue, they also make the chips in the Xbox series x and s, and the PS5.

AMD and NVIDIA will profit less from the chip shortage. They are missing out on sales (esp. nasty for AMD that has to balance consoles (little money), cpus (good money), gpus (less good money). Perhaps some of the price diff can be captured by them. But more likely it’s card manufacturers, scalpers and OEMs.
The chip shortage will not resolve before 2023 unless if some move to other/newer nodes to open capacity on 7nm. But then the same problem exists on 5nm.
Really Intel is profiting from the shortage the most, I think.

Also part of the price increase is a 25% tariff on GPUs imported from china. (New since 1/1/2020)

But you are right. Some of these factors should cause a PT raise. BUT NVIDIA and AMD already trade at a ludicrous forward P/E. (For AMD you have to subtract a one-time ~1B effect to arrive at a PE. It’s more like 60+ not “just” 40.",1,2021-02-15 02:34:24

TSMC seems to be the primary manufacturer for them.  The good news for investors is that this is a classic supply and demand problems, and the demand is significant and will be so for, as you stated, easily a half year.

They are not behind making the machines because of COVID and the machines that chip makers like AMD already have can't keep up with the demand of people wanting new electronics.

3. Works just as much for any semiconductor company.

4. AMD had its chance for price action when they released their numbers a few weeks ago. They are flat because Intel is actually waking up and the market is recognizing it, when Intel was up bigly due to the CEO change, AMD was down.

1670,gngk6qq,t1_gneui31,"I think that may be the better play. I’m bullish on AMD as a company in general (my last few desktop CPUs have been AMD and I’m currently rocking a 5600x), but not as a stock in the medium term. Few reasons for this.

Firstly, the competitive landscape. In CPU land AMD have the upper hand at the moment. This *may* be fleeting, with leaks relating to the next gen Intel chips looking promising (obviously we need to wait and see). It’s possible that they can’t take advantage of their market leading position because of constrained supply. AMD aren’t historically the CPU leaders across the board as they are now, so you have to wonder whether Intel will take the lead again just as supply constraints loosen, taking much larger volume than is currently possible. They may have missed their window. Other competitors come from ARM based CPUs, where you’d have to consider AAPL a threat given the astonishing per w performance of the M1, and Qualcomm amongst others. And then there are the GPUs, where AMD are at least a generation behind on two key technologies compared to Nvidia (ray tracing and DLSS) that are becoming increasingly important. DLSS in particular, and AMD’s dismissal of it as an approach up until recently is worrying as it’s the difference between a game being playable or not. Mining is a consideration, not for Bee Tea Sea as others have pointed out (not used GPUs for well over 5 years now), but for others. This is going to push up demand, but I think there’s another issue.

The other is their corporate strategy of being a chip designer and renting out the foundry. Intel have their own. This means that when there is constrained supply they are going to end up in bidding wars against other customers for foundry resources. At the very least this will drive up costs (Ryzen 5000 series chips are more expensive than their predecessors) and at the worst they simply won’t be able to get sufficient resources and their supply will remain constrained. Remember that their competing against companies like AAPL for foundry resources (AAPL have their own foundry, but are still heavily reliant on external suppliers for volume). I wouldn’t want to be bidding against the biggest company on earth. Generally, I think outsourcing the actual manufacturing of chips to external suppliers has been a good thing, but in supply constrained economies like the one we’re currently in it doesn’t look quite the home run it has been to now. Remember that when the next gen Intel chips launch, Intel can fire up their own foundries to fab them where AMD cannot. If you need a new chip, you’ll probably go with Intel just because of availability even if it’s 2% worse than the AMD competitor. These are manufacturing issues, the distribution issues remain worldwide so if the distribution is more problematic than the manufacturing, then this may not be an issue.

There’s just one other, possibly incredibly minor, issue too. AMD Ryzen CPUs have been using the same socket design for years now. This means that there’s a relatively simple upgrade path for users who can literally just swap out a CPU and get significant performance improvements. Zen 4 is moving to a new socket design, which means people will need a new motherboard should they want to upgrade. This may suppress demand a bit. I don’t think it will have a massive impact, but it does mean that if there are any supply constraints on motherboards (there are currently) this may further suppress demand. Hard to predict this one though, and Intel have been changing socket types seemingly every 6 months without too much issue (although again, they’re a larger player to motherboard manufacturers might be more willing to throw resources at meeting the market).

I’d love to be wrong. Really. I also have either too many or to few chromosomes, so don’t listen to me.",16,2021-02-15 03:58:28

1786,gngtl05,t1_gngk6qq,"Apple's M1 is only a threat if you expect Apple to start selling CPUs to OEMs, which I don't think anyone does.

Apple's change to M1 was to bump their margins. It's not looking like they're likely to steal market share for switching to it so there's no threat to AMD which can do very well just chipping away at Intel's market share.

Apple's M1 is also on a more advanced node than Ryzen 5000 so there's no competition for wafers from Apple. AMD's not switching to that node for another year and who knows what TSMC or Apple will have then in terms of capacity and node use. (You'd expect more TSMC capacity, right? Consoles will have lower demand then. And that's if Apple hasn't moved on to 3nm, which is possible)

>Other competitors come from ARM based CPUs, where you’d have to consider AAPL a threat given the astonishing per w performance of the M1, and Qualcomm amongst others. 

People have been talking about RISC killing x86 for years, yet here we are, and Qualcomm doesn't have a product announced, nevermind one anyone can buy. They completely gave up on their server CPU plans, and that's where the real fat margins are. 


>(Ryzen 5000 series chips are more expensive than their predecessors) 

Ryzen 5000 is on the same node as their predecessor, that was a margin move by AMD, and one that hasn't dented sales at all.

>Zen 4 is moving to a new socket design, which means people will need a new motherboard should they want to upgrade. This may suppress demand a bit.

It won't. It's been the norm for Intel for many generations to need new boards as you said, and Intel boards have generally been more expensive, so it's practically going to be a non-factor for AMD in the same way as it was for Intel. Some uninformed enthusiasts will probably bitch about it, but they've no right to, this has been on the cards for years. In the end they'll upgrade because it's one time vs every time with Intel, and it's not like Intel offers them a better system.

Lastly, you're much more optimistic about Intel's products than I am as someone who's following AMD closely. I think it's going to be 3-5+ years before Intel has a long term competitive product at this point. The weight of their manufacturing capabilities aren't worth much if their products end up being the low margin only offering that AMD used to hold, and that seems to be the current trend based on their financials from last year where they had to slash their margins.",8,2021-02-15 05:18:21

1869,gnh2h4m,t1_gngtl05,">	Apple's M1 is only a threat if you expect Apple to start selling CPUs to OEMs, which I don't think anyone does.

I think it might be a more existential threat than that. The per watt performance is so far ahead of X86, even though the M1 is first generation, it’s going to set expectations in customer’s minds and I can see more consumers going in that direction over Windows (and therefore X86). 

I’m bullish on Apple though. I think some of the engineering work they’ve done recently has been incredibly impressive (not just the A and M series chips but also with APFS and Rosetta 2 on the software side) and I don’t buy in to the whole “they no longer innovate” narrative. This may taint my view a bit, but I certainly see more people cross shopping MacOS devices with Windows and choosing Apple going forward. It’s a compelling product and it’s going to be interesting to see if they can replicate the YoY improvements they’ve been making to the A series chips on the M series. I suspect so for at least a few years whilst they explore the thermal and power consumption headroom a bit.

>	People have been talking about RISC killing x86 for years, yet here we are, and Qualcomm doesn't have a product announced, nevermind one anyone can buy. They completely gave up on their server CPU plans, and that's where the real fat margins are.

Agree, but I think the difference now is that we’ve got a compelling, mainstream, RISC offering in the desktop/laptop space. This may or may not make a difference but I’d argue the number of RISC processors currently shipping is the highest it’s ever been both in absolute terms and relative to X86 (apart from the obvious). I’ve not checked the numbers, but I’d be incredibly surprised if that wasn’t true.

>	It won't. It's been the norm for Intel for many generations to need new boards as you said, and Intel boards have generally been more expensive, so it's practically going to be a non-factor for AMD in the same way as it was for Intel.

Entirely possible it plays out this way. I think it’s only a minor consideration in the scheme of things anyway. My concern is not really about demand but rather supply and getting the motherboard chipsets out to the market in sufficient quantity. Not an issue in normal times, but we are where we are. Even riskier because, as you say, it’s a new manufacturing process.

It’s been compelling for motherboard manufacturers to support AM4 because of the forwards and backwards compatibility. You’re not just supporting the current gen, but also the previous gen and the gen before that. The AMD/Intel market split is roughly 30/70 so manufacturers have a great chance of addressing most of the 30% with AM4. That incentive will go away. Also worth considering whether the motherboard manufacturers will believe AMD will have constrained supply and therefore not go hard in that direction. Who knows. We do know though that new Intel chips still outsell new AMD chips, to the market incentives are to go with Intel over AMD for the motherboard manufacturers if supply constraints remain.

>	Lastly, you're much more optimistic about Intel's products than I am as someone who's following AMD closely.

Nah, not really. They’ve let me down too many times in the past (professionally). I do think they’ve made some positive moves in senior leadership recently though and the leaks do look promising (bearing in mind they’re unconfirmed). My theory with Intel is that they’ve actually got some decent improvements in the pipeline that they can roll out (particularly around IPC) and they haven’t until now because they didn’t need to due to lack of real competition at the high end. Now they’ve got AMD on one side (and not just consumer with Ryzen, but also Threadripper) and ARM on the other they need to, so will. But, there’s a valley of death in there somewhere, probably in two generations, where their recent lack of progress is going to bite. I’m more optimistic about AMD, just more long term as I said. 

I think it’s the foundries that will make bank though because they can effectively auction off their services to the highest bidder, increasing their margins substantially, even if (maybe especially if) the distribution and logistics challenges remain.

Either way, interesting times, and I don’t feel particularly confident in any prediction due to the unprecedented worldwide situation.",1,2021-02-15 06:36:22
1870,gnidfbb,t1_gngtl05,The market may shift to ARM when Microsoft comes out with their chip and better x86 emulation built into their ARM version of Win10.,1,2021-02-15 14:23:12
1871,gnjenty,t1_gngtl05,"I think the whole picture needs to be considered in technological and historical context.

First off, Apple's plan seems to be the merging of OS X and iOS into a single product which will run on ARM. This means that ARM, which already dominates mobile market, now gets a sensible chunk of laptop market as well (to wit, about 10% as of 2021). Latest demonstrations from Microsoft suggest that its principal portfolio of products, at least end user facing, are fully functional on ARM platform. This means that, were someone to give the push necessary for market adoption of ARM based laptops and PCs, the difference in end user experience would be unnoticeable. A major obstacle in adoption is therefore nullified. Who is that someone and why would they give a push?

Intel's mainline CPU business has always been intricately woven into two other dependencies: IBM PC architecture and Windows. The remnants of the original IBM PC are still present in the nowaday motherboards and they severely complicate board design and composition. The convergence phenomenon causes various parts of the original architecture to compress and migrate across components (consider for example the mutation of ""super-IO"" into ""embedded controller"" which collected all sorts of bizzare and useless functions on the way, or the path the memory control logic took from a separate logical unit to the north bridge which then converged into the platform controller hub and following that, memory control began moving out into the CPU itself). The end result is that boards carry around a ton of disparate garbage that is not really useful in modern computing, it's just there because it can't be removed as subsequent generations of technology depend on it. Case in point: an average laptop board will have no less than three different low speed buses (I2C, SMbus and LPC), as well as PCI, PCI-E, 2 or 3 different types of USB and so on. The embedded controllers have literally dozens of built in devices which barely serve any useful purpose. This essentially means that each new generation of intel CPUs, owing to the improvement in silicon manufacturing, makes the previous architecture inefficient, and parts of it have to be moved closer to the CPU, turning it more and more into an expensive system-on-a-chip arrangement if Intel wants to maintain the levels of performance that the new manufacturing methods allow, which it has to do if it wants to sell new CPUs. In fact, system-on-a-chip laptops already exist and they are a complete disaster. If a SoC dies, the laptop goes to trash, because replacing the SoC in many cases is not cost efficient. Part of the current right of repair uprising against technological vendors is caused by this exact problem.

This is where Microsoft comes in. Microsoft has, for years, demanded that Intel retains all backward compatibility with their previous chips. Current Intel CPUs are still forced to be able to execute 16 bit and 32 bit code, and there is a significant amount of software that depends on it. On top of that, AMD occasionally invents some new extension that Intel is forced to implement. The end result is that Intel assembler is internally a nightmare that complicates optimizing compiler design, which in modern computing is responsible probably for a third, if not half, of performance at runtime execution.

In other words, Intel (and AMD) CPUs are literally full of useless crap and the current board architecture is also full of such crap.  At this point, if aliens showed up and wanted to help silly humans to improve their computers, they would probably say something like ""Intel-based computers need to go, better start with something fresh."" And that something fresh is ARM technology. It's way tidier compared to Intel architecture, it can deliver comparable performance at lower cost and lower power consumption, the tooling around it is stable and solid, and the flag day - the hypothetical switchover threshold - can eliminate all the remnants of PC architecture, replacing them with freshly designed, sane and standardized solutions. ARM, in fact, is already present everywhere in PC architecture - just not in the CPU slot. The only thing that was preventing it from doing so until now was the trivial reason that people weren't sure Windows and Microsoft Office would run on it. Now turns out that not only they do, but there is even fully working x64 emulation on ARM, which means you can seamlessly run all Windows software that was written for Intel on an ARM PC, without having to rewrite it. 

Now consider what happens if Nvidia buys ARM. They already own the GPU market, they have a solid foothold in the datacenter market (hello from Mellanox), and ARM gives them the key into the CPU market, and pretty much the whole mobile market. This makes Nvidia a direct competitor to Intel and AMD. If the ARM architecture is able to divide the PC market, then its benefits will eventually overshade the IBM PC architecture, as the end consumer wouldn't be able to tell the difference except on the price. While AMD stands a chance on the GPU market, Intel has nothing of value to offer, and would essentially have to come up with a new clean architecture in order to compete on the same terms with ARM based PCs.  It tried to do this a couple of times in the past and failed. AMD's latest work showed that they are fully capable of delivering technology that's as good as Intel if not better. The end result is that ARM is likely to end up as the world's dominant CPU architecture, and produce the dominant PC architecture, as long as Microsoft plays ball and someone starts marketing ARM based laptops, and AMD has something in its pocket that Intel doesn't.

In any case the real winner is going to be TSMC. They dont really care whose chips they fab, because chips aren't going to fab themselves.

>The per watt performance is so far ahead of X86

I think that's overstated in importance except in the server space. Sure, battery life matters, but not many people are choosing laptops based on performance per watt, and you can buy cheap x86 laptops with 20 hour battery run times already. 

On top of that Apple is using a more advanced process node. It should be no surprise it has better performance per watt. It also means their wafers are [significantly more expensive](https://hardforum.com/data/attachment-files/2020/01/322533_cropped-cost-yield-node-compare-1-1155x719.jpg) and lower yield for now. 

>I’m bullish on Apple though.

Sure, I'm definitely not saying Apple's a bad investment for a moment. I think M1 is a good move for them in terms of margins and ecosystem control. I just think they're not going to threaten x86. People buying Apple will buy Apple no matter what the CPU. I don't expect too many people switching to Apple for M1 though.

>Agree, but I think the difference now is that we’ve got a compelling, mainstream, RISC offering in the desktop/laptop space. 

Apple is <15% marketshare. I'm not sure that's really mainstream as such. On top of that Apple has an ecosystem that makes it easy to transition their architecture like that, but that's an outlier. It will be nowhere near as easy for the rest of the market to transition, and no one's even trying to make chips to do that that we know of. (Edit: Qualcomm was for servers but abandoned that around about when AMD came out with Ryzen and EPYC)

>We do know though that new Intel chips still outsell new AMD chips, to the market incentives are to go with Intel over AMD for the motherboard manufacturers if supply constraints remain.

Agreed, but that's a more complicated equation than that. Again I'd suggest you look at revenue vs profits last quarter for Intel. Their revenue went way up but their profits barely increased. They're selling but at lower margins. That's not at all where Intel wants to be. They're now the cheaper-but-not-as-good vendor. Consider EPYC CPUs give 4x the performance per $ and as time goes on and AMD comes out with even better products opening up that gap, Intel either gives up yet more marketshare OR starts losing money to maintain marketshare. Either way that's not a company I'd want to invest in.

>Either way, interesting times, and I don’t feel particularly confident in any prediction due to the unprecedented worldwide situation.

Yeah, I think this saved Intel face for the last year to be completely honest. They'd have been in a much worse position in terms of stock price if demand hadn't picked up.

As for foundries, TSMC knows which way their bread is buttered. AMD is a golden goose to them if AMD knocks chunks out of Intel. The smarter play for them is to act more partner-like than vulture-like, and benefit on growth, not margin, and TSMC aren't exactly known for being stupid.

For a start, the agreement AMD had was for Zen, a now out of date technology. Why even bring it up now years after the deal ended as a thing to be concerned about with AMD? It's like warning about the year 2000 bug in a discussion on Amazon.

Zen, the only CPU design in the agreement, was on a 14nm process, not on 7nm, so that's another line of FUD-y bullshit you're spewing even bringing up 7nm.

The fact you're trying to compare China's 7nm, Intel's 7nm, and TSMC's 7nm is also ridiculous. Anyone with a clue knows Intel's 10nm is comparable to TSMC's 7nm, and no one knows what China's 7nm is really equivalent to, it could be a complete fabrication of a name. 

What we do know even Huawei (which actually had experience with TSMC's 7nm before AMD did) wanted nothing to do with Chinese manufacturers until they had no choice but to use Chinese CPU manufacturers because of sanctions. That's about where they're at.

That article you linked to was for a GPU, which AMD had no licensing agreement with. Licensing was restricted to a single old CPUs tech as I've said.

Just stop. You're making the world a dumber and less informed place.

2022,gngv3of,t1_gngsb5b,"because DRAM spot prices are still going up constantly, contract prices have lagged spot prices considerably in the prior couple months, meaning they will increase significantly shortly (assuming they havent already).

MU's profit is still nowhere near where it was during the last upcycle, when demand for DRAM has grown significantly more than supply compared to the 2018 peak.

The last 2 trough to peak for MU has been ~5->35 then ~10->60. This cycles trough was $28, so thinking 87 is the peak when valuations have become WAY more stretched than the past seems like incorrect thinking.

Furthermore, look at the previous 2 peaks, they are rounded tops where the price stays near the peak for 3-6 months, which is when institutions know the peak is here and keep the price high while they unload. MU has shown no sign of a rounded top and is still in full upswing.

2029,gni5nc8,t1_gni2imp,">Cool so AMD/NVIDIA market share won’t be affected at all because the deal I talked about was old therefore chinas 7nm chip means.. 

It means nothing. As I've already said. It's as good as guaranteed to not be even close to the same process node, nor the same chip design as what's a current CPU. I mean shit, the article you linked to was for a graphics card. That's how you came to the conclusion you did? That's laughable.

Do you even know what chiplets and infinity fabric are? You don't beat AMD and Intel by copying a 4 year old inferior product on a questionable node with a questionable fab... Only an idiot would think that was possible.

> If you think AMD is going to fly with a new competitor on the field then yolo your account into it and prove me wrong. 

I've done quite well already with AMD thanks, have been doing well for years. I don't need to yolo to be comfortable with my returns. 

If you think you know so much why don't you yolo? You're the one who sold $15 dollars ago.

Just a lurker here but want to do my part.

Just a lurker here but want to do my part.

TSM is a foreign pureplay semiconductor foundry.

INTC is an integrated device manufacturer (IDM) and for this reason has much more control and versatility over the supply chain. Given the current catalysts surrounding the industry, INTC is poised to outperform the market.

SpaceX's Starlink uses a total of **3150MHz** for user links in the Ku-band (10.7-12.7 GHz + 12.75-13.25GHz + 13.85-14.5 GHz), so about **125 times** the spectrum Globalstar hold.

Let's ignore either party's authorizations for gateway links in C- and Ka-band for this exercise.

Obviously Starlink have a hell lot more spectrum than Globalstar which is why the earlier is categorized as broadband service and the latter as narrowband. Since spectral bandwidth dictates how much throughput your system can deliver to your users this means Starlink can delivery much more Mbps to much more users than Globalstar. So at first glance Globalstar's spectrum appears to be minisucle compared to Starlink or other broadband satellite services which dispose of 1000s of MHz of spectrum raising the question of its value.

However there are four aspects here that distinguish Globalstar's spectrum from Starlink:

1. Lower frequencies travel further and propagate much better (spread out wider) than higher ones. Globalstar's spectrum is 4 to 9 times lower than Starlink's. That is why for Starlink you need this expensive, bulky, elaborate tracking antenna which consumes 100W of power while Globalstar has handheld terminals with power consumption in the mW range and days of battery life that do require a clear sky but no antenna pointing. So there are some very significant technical trade-offs between these frequency bands and the required hardware. Globalstar has portable, low cost, handhald terminals that work even in the harshest conditions but with low bandwidth while Starlink delivers very high data rates at the expense of terminal size, cost, power and line-of-sight requirements. Globalstar therefore targets completely different users and applications, such as IoT devices, GPS trackers, personal messengers etc. while Starlink is all about broadband Internet access.
2. While SpaceX share their frequency spectrum with hundreds of other satellites (so far predominantly geostationary ones but soon also with other LEOs like OneWeb) to which they have to avoid interference (posing increasing challenges as LEO will be populated by more and more satellites including such with higher ITU priority), Globalstar has exclusive rights globally  for 7.775MHz of L band (1610-1617.775 MHz) and the S band (2483.5-2500 MHz) globally which means nobody else is allowed to use their frequencies hence there is no risk of interference and they can deploy into those bands whatever they want as long as its a satellite-based service.
3. While Starlink struggle to secure market access for every single jurisdiction across globe Globalstar did that decades ago and are licensed to sell their services in most of the world.
4. Globalstar have authorization in at least the US and Canada to also use the S-band portion of their spectrum on the ground for ordinary cellular networks while Starlink can't deploy any Ku-band service on the ground.

Obivously comparing Globalstar to Starlink is like comparing a trail bike to an 18-wheeler or a Swiss pocket knife to a chainsaw. The two serve entirely different purposes and have their own advantages and disadvantages.

So what could Globalstar's spectrum be used for and who might have an interest to lease it, buy it or take over the entire company?

First of all spectrum is becoming increasingly scarce and particularly in these relative low frequency ranges with their benign propagation characteristics there is simply no unused spectrum left and in particular not such that could be deployed instantly globally.

* Obviously the S-band portion could be used for 5G networks at least in the US and Canada, be it for enterprise campus networks or on a country-wide scale. Although 11.5MHz is not much compared to the hundreds of MHz typically deployed across various frequency bands for 4G/5G in urban areas it could still be interesting for the extra capacity or just for an IoT-focussed service. Maybe Amazon would want to add some licensed frequency bands to their ""Sidewalk"" network which today is based on the unlicensed 902-928 MHz range where there's no protection from interference.
* According to ITU filings the Chinese GW (Guo Wang) constellation of 13k satellites set to counter Starlink will feature both, a broadband and narrowband payload ([https://twitter.com/Megaconstellati/status/1310703406256971776](https://twitter.com/Megaconstellati/status/1310703406256971776)) and the Europeans have also been studying the possibility of multi-mission satellites that combine different payloads including MSS (narrowband) and FSS (broadband) services. Given the many synergies here (sharing the satellite bus, gateway links and ground infrastructure) and the value of integrated solutions (broadband service falls back to narrowband during bad weather or obstruction) I could imagine that some of the megaconstellations like Starlink, OneWeb, Telesat or Amazon's Kuiper could have an interest in Globalstar. As Globalstar will need to replace their satellites by 2025 there's the opportunity to integrate Globalstar's service as a secondary payload into the earlier's next generation satellites which would not only fit techncially but also timewise.
* Various companies including Xona are proposing a GPS alternative based on LEO satellites and actually Globalstar's competitor Iridium does already offer a so-called PNT  (Positioning, Navigation and Timing) service through a subsidiary called Satelles that operates a hosted payload on Iridium's 2nd gen ""Next"" satellites and broadcasts a GPS-like signal in a subcarrier of Iridium's L-band spectrum. However Satelles is not very precise (only 20-50m) and there's certainly a very significant market for a system that (a) is more accurate by leveraging more advanced chip-sized atomic clocks (CSAC) resulting in higher accuracy and (b) works simultaneously in different frequency bands (L and S band) to counter the growing inferference, jamming and spoofing issues of all the GNSS that are all L-band based today. Interestingly at least OneWeb which I mentioned already in the previous bullet point is working on adding a PNT function to their next generation satellites but suffer from the issue that they only own Ku-band spectrum which would require a large elaborate antenna on the receivers, so it would not be possible to receive their Ku-based PNT signal on a handheld device... unless they secured spectrum in another frequency band.
* Various satellite operators use Globalstar for TT&C, so basically to control and monitor their small satellites in lower orbits. This enables realtime control (whereas today most satellites can only connect infrequently for a few minutes during every orbit while overflying a ground station) and eliminates the need of licensing ground stations around the world. While TT&C alone is not a huge market justifying the acquisition of Globalstar or its spectrum it could support the business case as secondary application for the above scenarios. Such system becomes particularly interesting if it also provided a PNT service allowing more precise orbit determination of cubesats and other small satellites.

So there are certainly a number of use cases for Globalstar's spectrum that would unlock much more value than is actually visible today.

The most value could be unlocked if someone bought Globalstar to do all of the four points above: Deploy the S-Band porition terrestrially in urban areas, in parallel maintain a satellite service, put the space segment as hosted payload on a larger multi-mission satellite bus hence reducing the cost of the space segment, introduce a highly precise PNT service and offer TT&C to other satellites.

To truly assess how good their spectrum is for this purpose will need a regulatory expert's point of view, but for us laymen, I think the Nokia stamp of approval is a good indicator.

They got pennies on the dollar (according to them, according to the US Taxpayer, we got rid of extortive spectrum squatters).  

I think capacity is gonna be king in the LEO data space and Starlink is the huge winner. I'm among the lowest level SpaceX fanboy you can be, but I just don't see how they don't eat the entire market's lunch (if they can make money doing it at all).",1,2021-06-23 10:56:23

2815,h3bxwhe,t1_h3bfyxd,"Trust me, I know very well what I'm talking about. ""Potential for 5G or IoT Development"" does not imply GSAT own this spectrum or can even deploy terrestrial services in these bands but rather that the FCC might rededicate this band for 5G in the future in return for which affected satellite operators would receive compensation, so exactly what happened in the recent Auction 107. But that's a highly hypothetical scenario as the FCC has not even considered additional C-band reallocations. Even if that was the case I doubt GSAT would benefit a lot. On the one hand there would be only a single gateway earth station (rather than tens of thousands of C-band user terminals affected by Auction 107) along the satellites which would be subject to compensation and on the other hand GSAT would need to switch to another frequency band for their gateway links and that would need to happen globally. That would not only require a huge regulatory exercise to get all gateways relicensed in different frequency bands but the even bigger problem is that all technically viable frequency bands are congested and there are so many other LEO constellations with higher ITU priority making it effectively impossible for GSAT to operate in a different band... unless GSAT ended up as hosted payload on another constellation which would eliminate the need for their own gateway links as they could share those of that very other constellation.

Another indication that GSAT don't have any exclusivity in the C-band is the fact that on p. 18 of the linked slidedeck (""Globalstar International Terrestrial Status"") they only list their S-band holdings. None of the other bands can be deployed terrestrially, hence monetized at a relevant rate.",1,2021-06-28 23:45:04

2827,gom2fd4,t3_lrivnu,"Fast charging the Bolt isn’t much good without available chargers. Completely impractical for a Bolt to be anything but an urban commuter car until there’s a charging network. Tesla’s charging network is years ahead and *still* makes owning a Tesla impractical for large swaths if the US. EA has some long, thin routes of chargers but is still inadequate for most. 

If Tesla solves self driving in next 5 years then GM is really screwed because the Bolt is not future proofed for self driving. Tesla is so far behind promised dates that skepticism is warranted. But if they do it, it’s backward compatible to nearly every tesla on the road. Offer it as a subscription (which tesla has said it will do) and the used market for Teslas will shine at the expense of things like a new Bolt. Why isn’t GM putting Cadillac Supercruise hardware in every car?

You also didn’t factor in the problem of dealer laws. GM has to sell through dealers. Dealers don’t make money selling cars they make money servicing cars. EVs have significantly lower service costs and pushing a sale requires shitting on gasoline cars. Dealers are not going to sell the Bolt with any vigor until they make most of their money from EVs and not gasoline cars. That’s going to be a long ways away. And even then you’ve got this middle man taking a cut in every sale. A middle man that doesn’t know Jack about EVs or how to sell them (because they don’t really want to). 

Then there’s the casting and structural battery packs from Tesla no one else is doing. If Tesla is Apple and GM and Ford are taking the Android approach to EVs, buying batteries and motors and system software off the shelf, Tesla is a couple years from offering an equivalent to the iPhone SE, trickle down technology that’s more affordable. Maybe the SE doesn’t match a flagship Samsung Android but it has other things going for it like full iOS experience and iCloud integration. Absent major adjustments by legacies to their design and engineering methodology it’s possible (perhaps likely) by 2030 Tesla can offer a better experience at a cheaper price than GM in terms of everyday consumer cars. Teslas are luxury now because of price, just like the iPhone, but it won’t stay that way forever. 

I think the EV revolution will bring several winners and GM is likely one. I just think you’re underestimating the headwinds they face and the ability of upstarts to interfere. You gotta think at least one major manufacturer will suffer the fate of RIM/Blackberry.",14,2021-02-25 02:41:56

2834,gomf2nm,t3_lrivnu,"> 3) GMs cars are comparable to Tesla's cars. The Model 3 isn't actually that good. The Chevy Bolt has a range of 259 miles, about 22 miles longer than Tesla. Both cars cost about the same amount. The newer Chevy Bolts also have fast charging, so Tesla's starting to lose its moat here. Guess Elon's plan to not patent anything really screwed him over. 

&#x200B;

1. The Model 3 SR has 263 miles range (4 longer)
2. The Model 3 SR starts at a lower price
3. The Model 3 SR has some very important features (e.g. Autopilot) included at that price point
4. The Model 3 SR has access to the Supercharger Network
5. The Model 3 SR will soon enough get single front and rear casts, reducing cost to build (and sales price if Tesla chooses), and improving the car in terms of weight, stiffness, and quality.
6. The Model 3 SR will soon enough get the 4680 structural battery which will, reduce cost (and  sales price if Tesla chooses), increase range, reduce weight, improve stiffness and handling, improve charging, improve performance.
7. And the Model 3 SR includes the FSD hardware, so if you think it is worthwhile you can subscribe to that service at any time.

TLDR - The Model 3 is already better then the Chevy Bolt and will with the upcoming changes will be quite a few years ahead of it.

There is a reason why GM trades for lower prices. I actually sold my GM stock recently (at a nice profit). I fully expect GM to in a matter of time fall apart once again.",4,2021-02-25 04:05:11

3690,gt555gv,t3_mikm42,"Hello, just swinging by and saw one of my favorite topics mentioned, fabrication strengths.

For those not into tech, you may not realize that 10nm/7nm is more or less a marketing number - it only measures the distance between transistors in one dimension.  What actually matters is the *transistor density*, which measures transistors/sq mm (two dimensions) instead of just one.  Intel's 10nm has slightly better transistor density than TSMC 7nm, and Intel 7nm will be slightly better than TSMC 5nm, so in reality **if both company's timelines hold** Intel is only one process node behind TSMC.

Although Intel is definitely behind TSMC as far as fabrication is concerned it doesn't actually matter that much.  This is because typically TSMC's leading generation is sold out to Apple, which means that for third parties, the difference in choice of fabrication technology is negligible.  Of course, this part only applies once Intel starts accepting orders from external companies (currently Intel only produces its own products in its own fabs).

**TLDR**: Intel being behind on process node doesn't really matter because 1) at the moment they only make their own products and 2) their only products in need of a cutting edge node are in their CPU division, which are still remaining competitive for now.  

Please note that anything written above not already released by their respective companies may change without notice, and OP's financial disclaimer still applies here too.  Overall, I do agree with OP (also, nice post!), but I wanted to point out that the difference in fabrication technology is closer than the layperson might tell.  Finally, fuck this tiny window to write text in.

Edit: In case if process node is a new term to anyone, if someone is referring to Intel 10nm, that's a process node, while a process node advancement would be moving from Intel 10nm to Intel 7nm (Or TSMC 7nm to 5nm, but you get the point).",257,2021-04-02 22:15:07

Their 10nm Ice Lake SP server CPU is probably going to be a train wreck, hopefully they deliver something useful with the follow-up Sapphire Rapids later this year.

Meanwhile AMD's TSMC 7nm servers were launched in summer of *2019*. This time to market gap is more likely to increase as AMD's financial position improves, allowing it to invest in bleeding edge processes the way Apple does.

INTC warrants a shitload of skepticism for having lost such a commanding process lead over the span of just a few years, and then boldly claiming that they're going to retake a leadership position after they already paid their key people to retire, and TSM is planning something like 2-3x INTC's planned CAPEX.

Not even talking about the plan for INTC to work as third party foundry because that's gonna be a shitshow.

The reality is that Intel is locked into a course of about 2 more years of collapsing gross margins due to the current state of affairs, and the only reason their market share loss won't be catastrophic is AMD doesn't have enough capacity to take more. After that we'll talk again about whether INTC is a good value play. The inertia of the business is in the completely wrong direction.",4,2021-04-03 06:24:24
3825,gt69djh,t1_gt555gv,"Not just that but Intel is more vertically integrated, almost as much as Samsung.  
AMD, Nvidia, and Apple all depend on TSMC/Samsung to make their CPU/GPU chips.  


Intel is also about to announce their GPUs made by TSMC that will compete with AMD and Nvidia in the Gaming/AI/Machine Learning space.  


As you pointed out, when they're on the same node Intel CPUs outperform AMD CPUs by a wide margin. As it stands their 14nm are still pretty competitive with AMD's 7nm. Also from a physics stand point to go below 3nm will be quantum computing (some argue 2nm will be achievable but it's unlikely).  


And once Intel hits 3nm it's going to wipe the floor with the competition. In 15 years Intel will be the leader with a market cap nearly as large as AMD, Nvidia, and TSMC combined. The fact that their P/E ratios are 35-80 while Intel is at 13 shows me the markets are not efficient.  


I'm extremely bullish long-term (10-15 years out) on Intel and it makes up 35% of my portfolio. If the stock price hits the 40s again it will for sure be 50% of my portfolio. Not investment advice.",2,2021-04-03 03:51:07

https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/

This is many years past but Intel was/is? horrifically flawed in culture, strategy , technology.

And that isn't going to change quickly I'd be very careful about placing any long bets on Intel in the future.  Perhaps this can change with their new ceo.

Telling people Intel is competitive is blatantly false imo (I'm retired now so I don't work in the datacenter field and I no longer keep tabs on tech that closely) 

You've got Apple that has gone away from intel and in my short time of owning an M1 macbook air, I can tell you this thing blows away anything intel has by miles, the battery life, the heat, the fanless design, the speed in the cpu, the gpu is light years ahead of whatever intel has.  

AMD is going to continue to own Intel in the datacenter space, it owns them in the enthusiast market, intel still had a good hold of the oem market through shady bribes and deals etc.

Even many years ago Intel literally lied about their advancements in 14nm 10nm etc and it got delayed every year.

3881,gt5fza7,t1_gt55zha,"> Do you have some sources for the transistor density part?

It's not a great read, but [this article](https://fuse.wikichip.org/news/525/iedm-2017-isscc-2018-intels-10nm-switching-to-cobalt-interconnects/6/) has a good image that shows a comparison between gate sizes.  Also it corrects my poor explanation of how transistor density and nm are measured!  Turns out it doesn't move from one dimension to two, but factors in the distance between transistors.

>a lower nm if it's just for marketing

Basically nm is a far easier metric to put on a slide instead of MTr/mmÂ².  At the end of the day, the consumer will always figure out which process is best, so it's not really a case of nm is completely incorrect (because comparing 10nm and 7nm in the same company is still perfectly fine) as much as it is an issue of being incredibly confusing for those who aren't knowledgeable about the space.

> Why do you think Intel fell behind TMC in manufacturing?

They put a financial guy in charge.  It didn't help that they had a technology lead at the time, which made the decision to cut research spending on new processes easier.

> TSMC is also investing heavily in Capex. do you think intel can catchup? 

Intel can definitely catch up, it just depends on how many of the lessons learned on 10 and 7nm can be applied to 3nm.  I think I forgot to mention there are rumors Intel will just jump from 7 to 3nm...  Which to be fair, they would have to do to reach par with TSMC.  As for capex, I wouldn't read too much into it for now.  Aside from reinforcing the idea that Intel will continue to own fabrication facilities, TSMC is at 100% capacity, and Intel near 100% with their existing fabs.  At the moment it just looks like a ""you have to spend money to make money"" thing.",52,2021-04-02 23:47:52

There is nothing stopping Intel and AMD from producing ARM chips except for themselves. They already have the licenses and will begin developing when ARM is past its infancy in the data center world. Let deeper pockets be the pioneers, let all the software transitions happen (x86 software is not compatible with ARM), then poach their engineers. Intel and AMD are sitting back and letting AWS and Apple try their hand at ARM on purpose.

IBM thrived on providing services that were being phased out. x86 isn't going to be phased out this decade and Intel will begin ARM chip production for clients in 3 years. IBM is dying, Intel is 3 years away from the start of unrivaled growth and has potential to eventually surpass TSMC as the industry leader in chip production thanks to the gov/mil backing within 20 years.

If you're looking for big gains in the next 2-6 years Intel is probably not the stock for you. It's at a 13 P/E ratio because people perceive it like IBM which is fine with me, I'll keep adding.

No clue what TSMC will plan to do after 3nm to prevent stagnation. For now they are the leader but physics doesn't let you go smaller than 3nm, possibly 2nm.

Milan and the 5000 series desktop/laptop cpus absolutely blow intel out of the water. I see intel losing lots of ground over the next year in both server and laptop segments. Intel is going to have to price its products next to dirt in order to retain anything. I'm not saying intel is done or over by any means, but a new/old CEO isn't going to fix their problems overnight. I think the speed of the intel ""comeback"" is vastly exaggerated. And from what I've seen so far, I'm not confident in the direction they're taking. I also reserve judgment of any new cpus until I see 3rd party reviews and benchmarks. You can't trust ANY marketing slide or internal claims, especially from intel.",1,2021-04-03 06:02:41
3967,gt6xu4e,t1_gt6k9d6,"I held out for months till I could get an AMD laptop. The AMD cpus have far better integrated graphics than intel. It's actually capable of light gaming and the entire CPU is more powerful.

AMD cpus also produce a little less heat and use a little less energy than Intel which is YUGE for data centers. Power and cooling is about more important than the actual CPU in terms of cost.",1,2021-04-03 07:26:22
3968,gt72ome,t1_gt6yq46,"As pointed out, the server and laptop markets are what's ripe for the picking for AMD. And you better believe people/companies running server farms and designing/producing laptops are putting plenty of research before making purchases of that scale. As far as investment goes, having your own fabs is great, until it's not, like we've seen over the past 3 years. What tips the scales in AMDs favor IMO is their involvement in GPUs as well as CPUs. Their current gen GPUs are actually pretty solid pound for pound, but lack features like DLSS, NVENC, CUDA etc. If they get the software tools figured out, and are able to meet demand, they could have a valuation above Nvidia.",1,2021-04-03 08:12:10

Edit: it’s a solid play. One thing to keep in mind, probe stations past a long time and capacity depends on fab output. Fabs take a long time to build and $B to upgrade (capacity) BUT the probe cards are consumables and cost $200k+ each.

https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/uk-best-mobile-phone-networks-worst-vodafone-o2-a8882301.html

Kind of an old article (2019), but I found it interesting. Also plenty of articles from last year as well. I’ll have to look into it a bit more, but unless this company makes a huuuge turn around, I don’t think they’ve really got much of a future. Also, they’ve been on the decline for the past 20 years. I don’t think a 75% increase (referring to the $35 calls in Jan 2021) in less than a year is anywhere near realistic. 

On a positive side, the recent news seems decent. Not sure if it’s a saving Grace, but at least they are trying to improve their really shitty customer service. Also, this company is huge and a lot of people rely on them for internet, so they aren’t going anywhere anytime soon.

Now it’s on the Russell 3000 and soon even more shares will be owned by tutes and insiders. Retail has maybe 150million shares but already 60+ million were being added by tutes on Friday close. Will be interesting to see what happens Monday but it won’t need wsb to move up. Thats a fact. So join in or don’t but those 2023 calls are cheap AF,6,2021-06-27 04:11:45

Many of the high end companies like INTC, NVDA, AMD, & TSM are drawing all the attention right now when there are much better plays out there not tracked by retail.

4338,h5f8n5x,t1_h5f796m,"Ok, first I will cover the basics of trading. If you have billions of $$ and you want to get in a ticker quick, how do you do it? Well if you go in all at once you’ll pump the price so what do you do? Well of the company is trading at $100.00 and you think you’re going to pump the price to $105.00 …. You sell $105.00 puts or buy cheap $105.00 calls and THEN you pump the stock! Then once you pumped some bullish momentum into the company you buy back your puts for 15% of what you sold them for or sell your calls for a 80% increase in price. Then as the stock continues to pump and you want to get rid of billions in shares do you just dump them all at once? Hell no, too much selling pressure. Rather you sell calls and dump them, … or you buy puts and dump them. Then buy back your calls for a fraction of the price or sell your puts for a huge profit. This is how institutions operate, they don’t care about your long position or which way this company trades. They’re going to make their money no matter which way the stock goes. Institutions can also go short and long at the same time. Which helps a lot if they know they’re about to swing the price with billions of dollars.

4347,h5t1tlx,t3_onn6ek,"OK, I had a look at the post. Immediately there are two issues that need addressed. Talking about Cry&#xFEFF;ptocurrencies and Hed&#xFEFF;gies is what got the post flagged, so that needs to go.

Overall, though, I think the post needs some work before it's ready. Your details about NOK are great, but there's a lot of ""fluff"". Personally, I'd say nuke the entire second half of the first paragraph -just stick to the facts. The same thing goes for talking about Robinhood, and GME/AMC/BB/Metal Miners, etc... Everyone knows what happened six months ago, people have been beating that horse ever since, it's already dead.

Just talk about NOK, that's what the post is about, right? You're trying to lay out the case why NOK has attracted your attention. Like I said, you've got a lot of good information that folks may not know, but keep it to the point.

I'll be happy to look over another draft if you would like, the easiest way would be to publish it to your profile first and ping me.

4453,hcee5lp,t3_pkj5n5," my thoughts are 1. this Rumor didnt start by any joe shmuck in his basement it started when an Expert Apple ananlysis stated it publicly.   
2. Both were asked to comment on the speculation and get this....They both Declined to comment. Its simple as saying, No thats not true, or something to that regard to squash it on the spot but both companies declined to comment. That tells me theirs an agreement that the news doensnt get announced until Apple announces it with the new Iphone. I could see GSAT not saying anything because the speculation is increasing their stock but Apple would surely simply say, No thats not true. 

3 . well 3 is just more 2 but its been over a week and still neither company has denied the link between the two, and whats more is the rumor is getting bigger and more wild in some cases so if not true , wouldnt you think apple of all companies would want to seperate themselves from something that has nothing to do with them when given the opportunity? they are notorious for flying solo, with their own charger ports and own app stores and apple apple apple apple so when people start tying GSAT to apple , if its something apple knew was not true I think they would be the first to to deny rumors like that so that GSAT cant steal none of their shine ESPECIALLY within weeks of the new release, all that attention, IF UNTRUE, they would want to cut it off at the source and keep all eyes on APPLE not GSAT",3,2021-09-11 12:22:16

Just drop an amount of money into it that you can afford to ignore for 5 years.

I feel like there is a huge difference between long-term INVESTMENT ""betting"" on ASTS, and the majority of the ""bets"" and YOLO's on this sub. 

ASTS is not a YOLO, because that implies a short time gamble with short term expiration options where you will find out your win/loss outcome soon and are mainly hoping for a short squeeze. 

I have lost a bunch on this one repeatedly buying next month's expiry OTM options trying to get rich quick. I should have just been averaging up on the 2023 LEAPs I bought back in April that will make me rich like the $10K in Tesla shares I bought at $33 pre-split would have made me if I didn't paper hand them (would be worth $1.15M now)

4512,hc7oobs,t1_hc7k2x5,"I think there are a few factors here. One is simply line of sight, at 6 feet off the ground and with no variations in terrain, the horizon is only 3 miles away. So for two people trying to call each other, the signal hits an obstruction at 6 miles away. But the other component is that a large high powered satellite can ""listen"" harder than a phone. Kind of like how we need some pretty serious hardware to pick up faint radio waves in space - we CAN get them, but small handheld electronics just don't have the capacity to do so.",7,2021-09-10 02:43:16
4513,hc7ufsg,t1_hc7k2x5,"When signals have to travel horizontally they find many obstacles in the middle (trees, mountains, buildings, etc) that attenuate them. On top of that the earth surface is not flat, but curved... So even if there were no obstacles it would be impossible for a signal sent from the earth surface to reach another point in the earth surface hundreds of kilometers away.

When the transmission comes from the space you don't have those problems. You can transmit in a straight line from the satellite to the earth and there are much less obstacles in the middle.",5,2021-09-10 03:22:57

Is MVIS in a Textbook Wyckoff Distribution phase!?

From an investor/competitor standpoint MVIS seems to be the clear winner in regard to their technical specs. But the competitors stocks seem do be following a similar downward trend, which leads me to believe that the market has not chosen its winner yet. 

From a TA standpoint, the stock price has been aggressively held down by short selling. Meanwhile institutional ownership has increased significantly. 
I have been trying to understand the odd price action over the past few months and the other day read about the Wyckoff distribution strategy. If you compare to the daily chart thi seems to be the best explanation for MVIS price action. 

If that is the case, should we expect this to be an accumulation period? And if MVIS is the winner of the lidar race, are we to also expect a huge move to the upside very soon? Seems very bullish!

I was reading about this distribution phase here:

It’s clearly not heavily overvalued (like it’s brother and sister from the first big 3 meme explosion this year), it has real growth potential (when well... who the fuck knows) it gets good news far more than bad news (that moves it 50 cents to 1$ before slowly dropping back down) and it has really high institutional ownership compared to other meme stocks meaning smart money does believe in the company they just are gonna cash out some shares if it explodes faster than they deem reasonable. Which does raise the importance of taking profits for yourself if you play it.

This is the saddest thing I ever saw. 

Honestly fucking heartbroken I've seen this. 

Please tell me either ""$30"" or ""two years"" was a typo. 

This is like taking your ""girlfriend"" out for dinner, paying for all of it, her flinching when you lean in for a kiss and then dropping her off at ""Leroy's"" house only to pick her up again at 3am and then being happy you might get to take her out again.

There's no question Intel is a successful company, but they're still riding on the coattails of their previous success over the last 30+ years. The computing market has been shifting away from x86(their core business) to ARM and other risc based architectures for a while now - ie apple's m1 for personal computers and Amazon's graviton2 for servers.

Also, they have almost no market share in mobile, memory, discrete GPUs, etc. The fact that they dropped the ball so hard here means they have no idea what they're doing and it's a little too late for them to play catch up.

The only thing Intel has right now are slightly faster x86 cpus which just barely beat AMD's from last year. They're actually worse in many ways because they decided to go with stupid ""e-cores"" which waste silicon that could have been used for more ""p-cores"" and massively complicate process scheduling. Whatever tiny lead they have right now will be gone in no time. Like many enthusiasts, I'm waiting for AMD to release zen 4 which won't have any garbage efficiency cores - that alone should scare you as most market sentiment is likely leaning that way which is not a good long term outlook for intc...

Lastly, placing a bet against tsmc because they're in the country Taiwan is ridiculously stupid. They make chips for literally every trillion dollar company so there's massive money behind them to ensure their success - and it's not like intel is going to pick up the slack in case of anything(they actually outsource some production to tsmc).

The US is protecting Taiwan, and they will likely continue to. However, right now most chip designers in the world are US companies and they are completly reliant on Taiwan. China doesn’t need to invade Taiwan to cause issues, they just need to disrupt Taiwan’s production/shipping of goods (like chips) in any way, and then we have an even bigger chip shortage. What good is it if Apple can make amazing chips on TSMCs 5nm node if they can only get 50% of the chips they were expecting from TSMC? Taiwan is only a few miles away from China and the thing with geo-politics is that when they go south, they do so in unexpected ways. I mean, so far this year, we have a chip shortage, magnesium and aluminum shortagw and shipping shortages, all mostly thanks to China. They’ve basically disrupted our whole economy without even shooting a single round, all under the pretext of global warming and Covid complications.

7. Intel is no longer the more power efficient of the two with the recently released latest generation.  They had to dump all the power they could into the CPU to be able to compete with current-gen AMD.  AMD is about to release next gen in 3 months with general expectation to crush Intel's latest gen for the desktop market.  

leading to point 8...

8. AMD's Epyc server has ran away from Intel as competition -- it's no longer even close.  AMD just announced yesterday their next gen Epyc is expected to have \~50% uplift (in *common* workloads, so VM heavy crap); and the following gen to double their core count to 128 cores. Intel's best is a 38 core CPU which cost more and substantially less powerful then current/last gen AMD Epycs.  FB is utilizing AMD chips, Msoft is rolling out VM infra using AMD chips, I've been rolling my own shops servers over to Epycs. 

&#x200B;

The scariest part to your thesis is if AMD continues to make inroads into the AI segment; if they pull off the ai inference chips right that they been working on, big bucks.  Meanwhile Intel has a nasty reputation as of late of bringing interesting products into the foray but then lacking followup and further development-- based on the numbers behind their latest GPU it appears to be going down that path again.",5,2021-11-09 14:56:26

> One worrying factor is in the server market. Everyone seems to be launching their own server chips and AMD is very competitive and eating away market share. But Intel's management seems to be guiding us towards the right path. If their predictions prove to be right, they are on the right track.

Really server space is the key to valuation. But but the only analysis given here is that ""Intel's management seems to be guiding us towards the right path."" Like what the heck does that even mean? What is the management doing that makes you think things are going a-ok in the server wars?

5708,hjwuv3k,t1_hjwmji9,"Why? Embedded devices (IoT) have long been dominated by ARM and MIPS processors integrated into designs produced by contract fabs. Margins are razor thin. They’re up against NVIDIA in the edge computing and autonomous spaces, which is the main portion of the market where their GPU efforts could pay off (and possibly gaming consoles?).

AAPL is a poor example. They have a high market cap because they’re one of a handful of major stock holdings in mutual funds sold in retirement accounts. A typical retirement account will have at least 5% in AAPL. Retail accounts for most of their moves that aren’t virtually in lockstep with MSFT, which accounts for a similar percentage in a typical retirement account. AMZN is lower but mostly following the trend because it’s usually no more than 2.5% of mutual funds in these accounts. So all you’re seeing is the mad dash of boomers to stash money for their retirements in most of the top market cap stocks.",1,2021-11-09 15:51:46
5709,hjwsegn,t1_hjwrvbp,"Yeah, I was also thinking on going into Xilinx for the arbitrage as I recently sold out of AMD (to take profit and deleverage).

But I am having a hard time to believe that AMD could surpass Intel  in revenue in the long run and thinking that the current run is unsustainable.

So, waiting for some pullback on AMDs run actually to get back.😂",1,2021-11-09 15:18:39

5904,hm7hwpe,t3_r1hc4x,"I like this at $7-$8 or will be interesting to see if it bounces of that $9.50 support. I could see BB as ripe for an acquisition, assuming it can continue to penetrate IOT and cyber security and reduce its operating expense by a shit ton, likely would need major downsizing in order to do so as they have like 3500 employees. Looking, I would say kinda,undervalued at $6B when compared to its competitors.

EDIT 1: This company has cash flow issues and needs to downsize in all likeliness in order to reduce its operating expense. All of its revenue is getting raped by its operating expense and it’s revenue is not exactly pouring in either. It’s also disturbing that it won’t have enough cash to cover its short term liabilities for next quarter. I would almost expect them to issue shares to try and raise some capital for its current liabilities this would drop share price however. 

EDIT 2: Earnings don’t look much better. Projected average 177M revenue, which if hit, will be raped by -87% net profit margin sooooo not gonna help much with cash. 

EDIT 3: Yes, I know, COVID has crushed hopes and pillaged cash from companies,honestly shoved BB made it. 

Long term Chen is going to need to stop the bleeding before he can really be aggressive in the software transition strategy…..which is a wise move. Good news is he recently was granted 3M incentive based RSUs so he is def motivated to perform and likely directly motivated to raise SE and the stock price.

On your own slides, **the next projection they have is FOR FUCKING 2030** my guy. That's another 8 year development cycle. It's way too long for this stock to skyrocket for now. Their business partner's are currently irrelevant unless they can crack that $TSLA partnership that they've been cooking for a while, but everyone knows Elon thinks BB is just an old company that doesn't fit their current moat.

Also, hedge funds are not directly increasing their positions on $BB, they increased 50% quantity to add 20% value... That means they are doing an ""average down price"" kinda play, to dump it on top of retail. Also, a 25mm position is pretty much nothing. If a few of us guys together here could buy more then the whole position that Morgan Stanley holds, this means Morgan Stanley doesn't hold anything significant in it.

This stock has nothing to do with AMD man, AMD makes HARDWARE, and you yourself said that $BB is transitioning away from hardware to software-based solutions. They are not comparable companies or comparable positions at all, totally different companies in totally different situations really. You could perhaps say they looked like GME and it would be a more fair comparison, but, still, it's such a different outlook. GME NEVER had golden days and lost all value, it was a average company that went bad... $BB has had it's golden days and lost a ton of value by bad decisions of company management. They had golden days and burned a lot of bridges down. It's different. Don't do it. At least, not for another 6 years. It's way too long of a bet to enter it now.",-4,2021-11-26 07:59:46

6092,hnigewl,t1_hni9bmo,"Love Intel.  PE \~10 seems very attractive, and they still make the best high end x86 processors, though not by much anymore.  Solid safe place to put your money.  But higher PEs need belief in growth.  AI is all being done on GPUs and special purpose chips now.  Mining too.  Intel is a little late getting into that game, maybe Alchemist will help them catch up, but it'll be a while before we know.",2,2021-12-07 05:45:23
6093,hnl95gc,t1_hni9bmo,That’s literallly THE WORST chart in semis,1,2021-12-07 21:21:01
6094,hnjg6bb,t1_hnj5hr3,"It's not just the proximity, it's how rowhammer interacts with the refresh cycle, Target Row Refresh (TRR) in DDR 4, redesigned and called Refresh Management which does more selective, and less predictable, refresh cycles.

Edit: and, until then, that capex is heavy.",1,2021-12-07 07:50:57
6096,hnjpop9,t1_hnjg6bb,"So from my understanding, you (in ddr4) typically refresh the rows every 64ms. You can double that rate but with performance issues. But even doubling it  isn't a very effective practice against row hammering.  So how would randomizing refresh rates, if let's say the average refresh rate is 64ms with a variance of (and I'm making this up) +/- 48 ms, effect the ability of attack rows lighting up victim rows?

Edit: after reading the publication, I realize their row hammering technique realize on ""base time T"" where T is an *assumed* refresh rate. With out the assumed refresh rate (randomized), it would take a different approach to effectively hammer. However I'm still unsure how optimistic I am on the ability for sudo-random functions to defend against such novel attacks in the future.

Edit2: if I'm wrong about any of my conclusions, please let me know. I'm grateful for bringing this to my attention and would like to understand it correctly.",-1,2021-12-07 11:10:08

Plus you don't see Lisa Su or anyone else (besides that GPU dude I guess) spouting off stupid things like how they're going to try to win Apple back. AMD is actively competing against Intel on servers and desktop computers, while Intel is fumbling around like chickens with their heads cut off.

AMD wants to win and they make it pretty obvious compared to Intel. My money is down on AMD for sure.

Bearish arguments. The processor chip space is getting competitive, azure x amd Collab and more companies making their own chips.  

That said, Intel has so much money and expertise I simply can't believe they won't be competitive again. Nothing I've seen recently said they aren't trying or they are in the wrong direction.

Now the other side of the token is that a lot of stocks look overbought, so they may need to consolidate as well. I'm probably throwing 25% of my port at TSM and AMD tomorrow.
