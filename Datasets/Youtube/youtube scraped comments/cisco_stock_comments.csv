mDpvfqjkuiw,"Sorry, I was struggling to understand what you guys trying to say in this video, I believe you are trying to so we should not overpay for growth?  While agreeing with what Joe say in general important keyword is overpaying, so how do we know what is over and what is the right amount? there you as an investor make a judgment based on common sense and numbers/fundamentals.
in your example, you say people who paid for cisco at 2000 (p/e) around (March 24, 2000,	234.01) are crazy of course, there is no way cisco can grow like amazon as an industry it was not scalable as amazon is, and never had a moat or grown moat-like amazon did. Amazon was happy to bleed itself to kill others to gain a monopoly, and they still do. 

They can easily increase prime subscription, such a great high-value service that has so much pricing power and get another 10B in a year as profit but they are not gonna do that as it will create other companies an opportunity (they can compete with margins and scale), at least yet as they still find enough firepower in the tank just simply grow with small margins.

on the other hand, if you bought amazon in 2004 for 662.88 P/E, you are crazy too,  there is no way at that time to understand where the growth will come from. But if you ask now I can tell you amazon will be an at least (worst case)1T revenue company most likely by 2030. it so scalable business and comparing cisco or intel to amazon is just does not make any sense. Amazon just needs to grow 8% year or year until 2030 to become 1T annual revenue, Is it possible? of course, is it probable hell yeah. If they can create a net margin of 10% in 10 years (due to high margin business expansion such as prime, advertising, cloud) they will be easily hitting 100B income and if you even have a 30PE that time it is a 3T market cap company. Now you will ask what will be GDP in the USA by that time let's say it grew 3% YOY from 22T  from today, it will be closer to 30T. 

As you argue can amazon be 10% of the USA economy to me hell yeah,  because amazon is a global company you might need to compare GDP at least G20 context that is roughly 85T today, and 114T by 2030 (3% YOY growth), so it is absolutely possible it becomes easily somewhere 3-5 T company by 2030 before it gets slow its growth around 10%, but just like Apple does it can still give value to the shareholders by buying back shares or playing on its pricing power by increasing prices?

you don't need to look beyond, last 10 years AMAZON CAPEX is around 150B, most of them as growth CAPEX and not maintenance CAPEX, so if you calculate FCF based on pure GAAP cash flow metrics (Operational cashflow - total CAPEX), you really get it wrong because the majority of that CAPEX is a reinvestment of cash that already generated, and if not decided to reinvest, it can be distributed among shareholder. In my mind, though GAAP cash flow is around 25B (2020) and  CAPEX 40B(2020), if you calculate what is growth bit in that CAPEX is and add it back to GAAP FCF you will get around 45B FCF(2020), and if you use this method to calculate AMZN future value conservatively (20-30 P/E and  10-30 YOY growth for next 10 years), you will see why amazon still trading at fair value territory. You can use the buffet(average depreciation for a long period like 20 yrs) or greenwood(Net PPE/Sales ) method to calculate maintenance CAPEX, but I personally take the average of both as they both are not 100% accurate.

Now do the same argument can be applied to a company like Tesla I would say no,  Tesla is most likely another CISCO, their CAPEX is very low 22B last 10 years, and they will not be able to scale as AMAZON did, or create a moat-like amazon did. 100 other car manufacturers will not let Tesla run as amazon did in the e-commerce space, due to obvious reasons.
Sorry about my rant:) Generally, I like to be a lonely investor as I don't like someone influence my line of thinking :) but I often found there are elements in your videos that I think there are a lot of similarities in how I think about stocks in general. To me, you guys sounded like Maneesh Pabrai like 5 years ago, or buffet 10 years ago, until they met Charlie Munger who influence them to buy great businesses at reasonable prices based on FDCF rather than buying the mediocre business at great prices.",2021-08-15T09:55:54Z

mDpvfqjkuiw,"I think you need to explain it like this for simplicity:

If you bought AMZN at the top in 2000, you only 29x your money whilst the revenue went up 200x. You bought AMZN when it was hugely overvalued.

If you bought AMZN when it was undervalued in 2001 for lets say $11, you will have 300x returns given the share price today. And that more than matches AMZNs revenue of 200x to date.

mDpvfqjkuiw,"Sharing my personal experience......i started investing in stock market back in 2006 & 2007. My brother misguided me partially because of his ignorance and we both chased the low cost, high growth stocks and every listed IPO. 4 yrs later in 2011, i lost so much of interest because of losses, that i did not open my brokerage account for 9 years (aversion of looking at losses) and i had to call the brokerage to restart my brokerage account. Looking back at all the mistakes that i made, stock market is a very costly place to learn. 

Please dont chase individual stocks. You will not have patience and diligence to evaluate them at regular intervals, like Paul here does. 

What i learnt....pick a low cost index fund (s&p or total stock market), invest early and regularly, always stay in the market. Just imagine, how much i would have been wealthy, had i adopted this strategy back in 2006, all through out.",2021-08-14T19:11:03Z
mDpvfqjkuiw,"I love your channel.  Tell me this. If intel dropped 20% over the next few months and the fundamentals remained unchanged, would a value investor add more to the position?  Reason I ask is because your premise is that your investment is a one time dump of money into the risk asset and that you can reduce risk by entering when the value of the stock is to your advantage. I would argue that the examples given in this video (cisco,msft,amzn,intel) if an investor kept investing/reinvesting they did pretty damn well over the past 20 years and they didn't have to time the stock price to find good value. They reduced the risk and created the appropriate value by reinvestment and by ensuring the companies fundamentals remained intact. You wouldn't tell someone now to not buy VOO/SPY because the market is high. You would say to make sure you also buy VOO/SPY when the market is low.

mDpvfqjkuiw,"Paul’s two fallacious assumptions: 1) he is conveniently  picking stock price just before the dotcom crush to make his case. How about picking the price before or after the bubble which a better reflection since we donot know the market is about to crush NOW 2) you are assuming that the stock market currently is at peak and about to crush (like the dotcom crush). There is no indication we are at peak market now. If anything there is proof that there is still room for up 🆙 I am certain that Paul would have made the same argument in 2015. Crying, crush is coming; the market is overvalued!!! Look at Amazon stock price in 2018; Paul would have argued the same; overvalued! Since then Amazon stock price doubled. Paul is recommending Intel is a buy; but it is not if your goal is to make gains. Buying Intel will save you if there is a crush, but I can assure you Intel’s stock won’t hit $70 in 10 years! Paul is overtaken buy avoiding risk than making gains. I am in stock market, that is inherently risky. I would have put my money on bond if I was looking for Intel’s kind of return. Paul your problem is you think stock price is reflection of a company’s past; but it has never been that. The future, the growth potential of a company or a stock market matters.

mDpvfqjkuiw,"@Ibrahim Ciftci based on what exactly?  The fed interest rate fluctuates it goes up and down and has for decades.  I'll go all the way back to 1955 and look at every 5 years.  
1955 1.79%
1960 3.21%
1965 4.08%
1970 7.17%
1975 5.82%
1980 13.35%
1985 8.10%
1990 8.10%
1995 5.83%
2000 6.24%
2005 3.22%
2010 .18%
2015 .13%
I'll look at the last 6
2016 .39%
2017 1%
2018 1.79%
2019 2.16%
2020 .36%
2021  .08%

So again historical trends show the interest rates below 2% going back to the  50s to teens in the 80s and back below 2% the last couple years, historical average is 5.5%. This is just math based on historical data.  Projecting the interest rate is never going back to 5.5% or even above that is not based on anything but your opinion and doesn't follow the historical trends or available data.",2021-08-15T14:40:32Z

That's 31 times higher today, not 20, and only if you were really unlucky buying on the worse day during those years. If we were a bit luckier and bought a month before the peak, then today you would've made more than 50 times your return (which indeed shows your point that price matters a lot).

6Dj3d3Hj05U,Regarding buybacks - wondering what your thoughts are on NVR?,2021-05-29T13:33:23Z
6Dj3d3Hj05U,"@Sebastian Schmidt at Aktien-EXP I'm actually a bigger fan of an unknown management that performs well than a management that's in every magazine and does 'ok'. 
It's always worth googling around: when assessing Chinese home builders, I excluded one of my two remaining candidates because one CEO had a trail of a lawsuit and a warning about doing funny things with corporate money. Given the whole smoke where there is fire, I just take a hard pass on companies with even the slightest hint of immorality. 

(the last time I looked at NVR was 4 months ago I believe, so if they had earnings calls in between, this data will no longer be correct: )
In terms of valuation of NVR, to me it looks quite high, but the fundamentals are quite good: although declining the past 3 years it has an above average ROE compared to it's industry, they seem to be able to turn their investments into gross profit at a rate higher than their competitors, they have no notable debt (compared to their competitors one of the lowest). If you compare it to their cash at hand they almost have no actual debt. Their liquidation value is one the the highest (but that's because most of what's on their balance, is cash). 

In terms of price per revenue, yeah, that spiked quite a bit the last year, like a lot... certainly with their revenue clearly slowing down in growth. Price to revenue is almost double of what it has historically been... on the bright side: their cost of goods are fairly stable and have even come down the last few years (raising to an 70% gross profit margin, compared to a 65% 7 years ago). But even still: on a price per gross profit, the price almost doubled the last year. 
They seem to be doing well in optimizing the company: They brought down SG&A from as high as 60% 10 years ago to a low 30% today. Steady rising, but slowing down cash flow from operations, which is not ideal, but good enough. 
Just from the standpoint of free cash flow, they aren't highly overpriced. But also not cheap, certainly there's better deals on the market. Especially if you look international, but even domestic. 

The only thing you should look into is that they are losing ground to their competitors steadily over the last 5 years with about 1 to 0.5% a year. . This could be because they chose to grow slower compared to their competitors, so it's not necessarily a bad thing, but I'd look into that the most if I were you.

Certainly when you factor in their slowing down growth compared to others, things start to look too expensive for me. But that's pretty much the only thing that stopped me from buying in. 
It's just a great solid company, but with slowing down growth, questions I couldn't answer about how long their remaining runway is and the treat of rising interest rates, which I do expect to have a high impact on a housing market, all this combined with the rather high valuation, seemed too much and unnecessary risk for me to take on. 

But if you expect they can go another 5 to 10 years, I think you can do little wrong with easing into it, while you learn about the sector. 

I totally agree on the share price. For me it's more an issue that it becomes harder to ease in to a company. 
Sometimes when I'm learning about a sector, or when I just don't have the cash to buy big positions, I dollar cost average into a company even if I have some open questions about the company... Stock prices in the range of over 1000 euro's make that often too hard to do. Leaving me with the need of a much bigger conviction before I'll buy into it.",2021-05-30T11:21:59Z
6Dj3d3Hj05U,"@Andy Tolle Good question about potential drawbacks. But I must admit I am not very familiar with the home builders sector in general - currently I don't hold any home builder stocks.
Next thing for me will be to look at management - but from what I have read so far they do not spend a lot of efforts on public relations (which doesn't need to be a bad thing) so getting some information about management may be difficult. May also check some of their filings.One thing about their strategy is clear - they will be continue with stock buybacks. That was stated in previous board meetings. So if this continues and they continue to do well stock price will just increase further. 
So I will think about starting a small position. 
I am just not a fan of individual shares being so expensive. Just from a psychological perspective it feels better to own 200 stocks than 3 =). 
Their PE was mostly in the 18 range over the past years. So currently it is only slightly above average.",2021-05-30T09:44:37Z
6Dj3d3Hj05U,"@Sebastian Schmidt at Aktien-EXP yeah man, conversations like the one I'm having with you are invigorating and inspiring for me. 
I looked back at my documentation and with the part what you said about how they take options on land actually makes the world of difference. 

I took note back then that I couldn't explain why their inventory was low (about 28% to their cost of revenue, compared to competitors that are often in the 100% to 400% range). Resulting: their inventory turnover in days is about 100 days, whereas competitors are more in the 300 to 400 day range, pretty much without exception (Chinese property developers are even worse with inventory turnover days going more towards 1000 days... not a typo). 

Back then I didn't know that 'land for development' is recorded as inventory for property developers. Knowing that now and with the information you provided, it makes a whole lot more sense: 
So basically NVR ties up less (working) capital in their inventory, resulting in more free cashflow, I'm the sense that they can just spend cash that others have tied up in land... I saw back then that cash-wise this was going on, but I just couldn't explain how they could do business like that... it makes a whole lot more sense now. 
Thanks to this talk their 10k is back on the reading pile now. 

Thanks man, your info makes a world of difference and I very much appreciate you sharing this. 

Kinda amazing to see... I wonder why others don't adopt that... would you know of any drawbacks or risks to their methods? 

The thing I'm still having a hard time imagining, is where this is going... in the end someone gets a letter that says ""congratulations, you now own all shares of NVR""? :)
Do you have any idea how this plays out? Or if the direction they are on is sustainable and why?

Thanks a lot for your insights and the reading suggestions. I very much like the depth of it.",2021-05-30T08:03:01Z
6Dj3d3Hj05U,"@Andy Tolle it's these types of conversations that make me want to dig deeper into certain companies. So here are some things I have found. Btw. NVR was also mentioned by William Thorndike - author of the book ""Outsiders"", which reports about outstandingly managed businesses and their CEOs. There is a very interesting Google Talks video with him also on Youtube.
But back to NVR:
-They have bought back about 70% of their shares since 1994
-they operate slightly different from other home builders. e.g. they do not buy land but rather options on land so they can walk back from their purchase if economic situation weakens
-they optimize for longer term share value
-their management incentive model works is based on 4-year time frames unlike most other companies, which base it on 12 month performance. That gives them longer time periods to make decisions about buybacks at points in time where they consider the share price attractive within a longer timeframe - is what I understand.
Will do some more research as this could be an interesting buy for me. Currently they are close to their peak price still but at least may be worth putting on the watch list.",2021-05-30T06:29:32Z
6Dj3d3Hj05U,"@Sebastian Schmidt at Aktien-EXP buybacks is one thing... doing it in a sustainable way, is a tricky business.. There's actually about 4 to 5 times wrong ways to do buy backs and about one that's right. So people tend to go blind on the word and forget the pitfalls or long term consequences it can have. 

As far as my understanding goes you must have stable cash flow within the business to be able to pull that off in the extend that they do. And that's balancing a fine line in hard times and when cash can dry up. 
Given their cyclical nature, I haven't quite understood how their can maintain that balance. 

Pretty sure the answer lies in their business model, my best guess is that the fundamentals will bring no real answer. I'm pretty sure I should have picked up on that. 

Given I believe the answer lies in their business model, this would mean I'd be have to do quite some reading in their 10k as well, as well as the 10k's of their competitors. 
For me one of their peers was a better deal price-wise, and their books and business were comprehensible for me, so I took note of their peculiar cash spendings and moved on. 
Personally at the time I didn't understand enough of the mechanics to assess if it was a good idea (as in: sustainable) to invest or not. For me NVR ended up in the 'too hard pile'. 

But the question has been intriguing me ever since. Their entire cash position just clearly stood out from others. I'm quite sure I'll bug me enough some time in the future to find an answer. 

Maybe Sven has some insights. 
Either way I'd be interested to know if anyone has some knowledge or estimated guesses about this. 

Best of luck man",2021-05-29T20:05:25Z
6Dj3d3Hj05U,"@Andy Tolle been wondering the same. I stumbled upon them when reading the book 100 baggers, as they were mentioned in the chapter about different mechanics that can increase shareholder value and that was talking about buybacks. They have bought back a ton of shares in past years and by their buybacks they have been consistently increasing shareholder value. Could be one of these stocks that, if they continue their strategy, are worth 100.000 per share some day. So if Sven would be sharing his thoughts some time I would be highly interested.",2021-05-29T18:37:47Z

Could the difference between DFCF Valuation and the two Ratios Valuations be because the shift in expected growth?
I mean historicaly Cisco have not been growing a lot, so the market would value them at arround 13x FCF, but now because of changes in the way the company makes money, Cisco won't have the same growth therefore not the same FCF multiple.
I think that because DFCF Valuation takes this into consideration when using those high analyst estimates. And maybe that's why the valuation is so high?
Now if you trust those analyst estimates you should also trust the DFCF Valuation result, if not then stick to the historical values.
Is my logic faulty here?
Thanks and keep up the good work!",2021-08-10T08:46:42Z
U-jjCHS5A0s,I do not agree. Why would you use the past FCF if you are trying to analyze the future cash flows? Why would 13x be your standard when other tech entities are trading at 20x.

U-jjCHS5A0s,"I like some of Cisco's moves in recent years. They've been focused on acquiring small security firms and developing subscription models for their software. The changes have been slow so far, but have to remember it takes a while for a company of their size to turn things around. If 3 years from now their service revenue is still only about 1/4 of total revenue, I think that might be a cause for concern. But if we see it grow into the low 30s, maybe even make up 1/3 of revenue, it will show their new business model is working. The last time I looked into valuation I think I had fair value at around $44/$45 per share, so not too far off the $42 from the video.",2021-08-04T16:40:42Z

jQTdoVpHiKw,"I don't understand all this Intel hype. TSM has had their sights locked on INTC for at least the last 5 years and has brought the pain to INTC in 2020. TSM makes semiconductors in the USA.  Right now TSM has 4nm and 5nm tech  when  Intel is still on 10nm. When Intel jams a large buy order to AMAT to make new factories to get with the times that is when I am a buyer. 14 nm tech from 2013-2019 is ridiculously stupid. Intel hasn't given the tech community any form of excitement for years. 

I bought some shares of INTC after they cut their CEO who is a finance guy for a semiconductor guy and did restructuring. Which is the appropriate response to losing their Apple contract to TSM. Then they have TSM working with AMD to kick Intel's ass on the PC front.  On the tablet front Qualcomm / Samsung / Mediatek / Huawei will murder them.

INTC is the Hormel of semiconductors. Yeah sometimes you just need a can of Spam instead of a steak. Spam does sell. Intel is 90% of the data center CPU market right now.  They are fighting for their last kingdom.

TSM and AMD bulls think their ticker will spank that ass. They got the street cred. They got the power. AMD gets approval for the Xilinx merger and it is GG my dudes. Because then TSM gets a backdoor entry into US national security. 

TSM has more cash on hand than intel for a price war on the server CPU front. With AMD semiconductors and their RISC semiconductors. TSM is posting up with a double barrel shotgun.

TSM did what they set out to do so far. I read every line of every statement. They wanted Apple contract - they got it. A partnership with AMD - they got it (because Intel never orders from TSM in spite of repeated efforts and offers to improve their CPUs). TSM doesn't compete with their customers and they never have. Intel was never a customer. That was Intel's biggest mistake.",2021-06-19T19:25:28Z

I’m in the early stages of trying to understand how to evaluate companies, been doing lots of reading and watching break downs on YouTube. I’ve really enjoyed your channel, but it’s still very new to me and I’m not picking it all up. Guessing it’ll take more time and plenty of practice before I become as fluent as I’d like. 

Because I appreciate what your doing, I wanted to offer a bit of unsolicited advice, take it or leave it, but it’s my way of saying thanks. 

Being arrogant, condescending and disparaging others (3:25 mark) isn’t a good look and doesn’t match with what I’ve seen to be true of you guys in other videos, which is the desire to educate and help others. If this was the first video I watched of you guys, I probably wouldn’t keep watching.

BXMylWXaCgs,"Great post 🙌🏻 i must say. Crypto is tumbling, with little sign of stopping throughout the past few days and weeks, with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse, the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Btcoin's lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum. One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months. He believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near-term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead. Tips like this are why it's advisable for investors and newbies to trade with the help of pro traders like Bran Marvel . He is always one step ahead of other traders, he fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money.

cLcjuM0E3bE,"I like the policy of buying stocks of companies that you are involved with, and I work on Cisco equipment every day.
I just don't think that the current price, along with the 12 month price target that it will grow enough this year.

X3i4PV1E9I8,"The RLLCF is a ticker for their C shares which are used as an alternative to cash dividend payments. The don't represent the price of the stock at all, and are more like bonds than anything else. they are redeemable for cash at different times of the year, so their value is actually a fixed amount when converted to cash. part of the reason they seem so volatile is because they were actually trading below their redeemable cash value. So some people noticed that and bought up a significant amount of the C shares. the actual ticker symbol for the US version of the London exchange common stock is RYCEY. This ticker follows the London exchange price movement much more accurately.",2021-02-15T14:22:04Z
X3i4PV1E9I8,"RR and RYCEY is the same stock. RR is traded on the London Stock exchange. It is priced in British Pence. RYCEY is on the US stock market, priced in US dollar.",2021-02-15T20:47:16Z
X3i4PV1E9I8,Is that #rycey rolls royce?,2021-02-14T19:11:56Z
X3i4PV1E9I8,"@TheBooban Good point Booban! Yes, it is  incredibly confusing with Rolls Royce share classes. But even still, the 200% move was what caught my eye when I was looking for interesting to cover. Perhaps one day I'll make a dedicated Rolls Royce video where I'd have enough time to talk about the different share classes and unconfuse the concusion, thanks for your comment Booban!",2021-02-15T04:15:04Z
X3i4PV1E9I8,@The Stock Students the abnormal move is because people think its the real stock! You should be buying RYCEY,2021-02-15T01:54:38Z

X3i4PV1E9I8,@The Stock Students thank you soo much.... subscribed,2021-02-14T21:02:09Z
X3i4PV1E9I8,"Yep Rolls Royce does do their shares a bit confusingly! I found a stack exchange post that kind of describes the differences between the two:

https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/133423/why-does-rolls-royce-have-4-separate-tickers-on-otc-markets

From my understanding, the ticker I covered in the video is the Preferred Share, which has some pros and cons that the RYCEY ticker you mentioned doesn't. The reason why I covered the RLLCF ticker was because that was the one that had the really interesting move up 200%. I also can link to you an investopedia article on common share vs preferred share if you would like to see more of the differences:

https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/difference-between-preferred-stock-and-common-stock/#:~:text=The%20main%20difference%20between%20preferred,shareholders%20while%20common%20stock%20does.&text=Common%20stockholders%20are%20last%20in,%2C%20bondholders%2C%20and%20preferred%20shareholders.

Do those make sense to you? Let me know if you have any other questions! Like I said, I only covered RLLCF because of the abnormal move we saw in the past couple trading days. Thanks for the comment!",2021-02-14T20:51:35Z

SY-QZ7r6FHc,Feels like I'm watching the same video every week buy some new stocks,2021-09-04T16:54:21Z
SY-QZ7r6FHc,"For the watchlist video I guess you can just go through why you picked the companies. Then explain what your thoughts on current price are and what price you want to enter at. From your watchlist I think only Apple makes any sense since ko, HD, and sbux are trading at massive premiums and don't have the growth potential of Apple since they are shifting more to a software service company.",2021-09-04T16:31:04Z

4GHk3A4NH20,"Frank - This is a good one. I do have a small position in CSCO. I like the fact that you released this basically on the stock's payout date. That is probably smart to do. Also, don't be afraid to average up at times. It's hard to do, but sometimes makes sense. All the best.",2021-04-27T14:24:02Z

f22AVR_1D_o,"nice run up might be time for some institutions to unwind and realize some profits, also short interest increased from last month, not by much as less then 1% of outstanding stock is shorted. I am not a fan of Fibonacci, I think retail traders use it more then the big players",2021-11-14T21:18:20Z
