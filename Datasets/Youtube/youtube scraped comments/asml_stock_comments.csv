jBwqPr-86cs,"Very nice video and a good selection of stocks. Can't argue that these companies will remain strong (probably be leaders) for at least a decade. I have a question about Palantir, though. 

Palantir Vision interviewed you about Palantir's stock architecture. After listening to the video, I posted the following comment. (No reply yet.) Please tell me what you think.

If Palantir F shares are not diluted as more regular shares are issued Tiel, Karp, and other class F owners won't care about dilution. Their only concern will be to keep the standard share price high enough so that they can continue to issue shares that the public will buy. The risk for them is that once the market catches on to this game, the share price will collapse. Who would want to buy $PLTR stock if management's strategy is to use the stock as a piggy bank for their own needs? Also, if employees are being paid with regular stock, they won't be very happy about being used like this.",2021-10-10T04:13:45Z

jBwqPr-86cs,"I have always disputed the support pundits give to CRWD....If you think about it, this is a cyber-security company that early on failed its biggest customer (the Democrat National Committee) by its own admission and timeline.  Their claims that the Russians hacked that server not once, but twice came months AFTER Crowdstrike had certified the server was clean. 

So my question is if they are that bad at their core offering (cyber-security) for their highest visibility customer, then why in the Hell should I view them as worthy of investing my money in them?",2021-10-01T17:12:32Z

jBwqPr-86cs,"With a stock going to 500, entry price of 35 or 65 makes a huge difference.  If I have $1000 to buy a stock, buying at $35 means that I will have $14,285.   if I buy at $65, that means I will have $7592.  (Assuming that I can buy fractional shares also for my few left over dollars.)  Well, that's a different of $14,285 vs $7592 which is $6592.  That's ALMOST double a difference. So the difference stays the same in terms of percentage, which magnifies the difference over time in absolute dollars. This is why I don't understand those who say the entry price is not that important if a stock is going to give big gains.",2021-09-30T01:41:38Z

Intel for instance has grown every year since then and haven‚Äôt crossed their ath in over 2 decades. 
In my opinion if you over pay for growth, you cant expect the stock to perform well just because you waited 10 years.

Also, I don't know about Netflix for the long term due to all the competition in the space.  I guess they are great content creators but do they have a decent moat and will they be #1 in 5-10 years?   I haven't been a customer and don't feel like I'm missing much due to Amazon Prime, Disney, You tube, etc. but maybe I'm wrong.

Hjja9e0iqos,"I'm sorry Sven, but something must be completely wrong when it comes to your ASML calculations. They are doing 4,5B Euros in net income right now, so how on earth is it possible that your base scenario of 20% and 15% growths for the next 10 years yields such a low intrinsic value? If that growth rate would really manifest itself within the next 10 years, they'd make 23B Euros in yearly net income. Considering the moat they have, this should give them a market cap of at least 600B in 10 years considering a multiple of 24, which is a tripling of the stock and equals 11% annualized stock price growth from the current level. It's not like you say, that the valuation is only justifiable, when we all become chips in the future.

This indicates that the current stock price isn't completely out of this world. It's not Tesla or some other Cathie Wood hype stock. The valuation is rather much closer to a let's say Microsoft or Amazon (actually between those 2), especially if you compare the moat of the mentioned businesses. 

Did you use wrong numbers? Or not the current ones? Keep in mind, their EUV-lithography technology is just starting to really take off (only needed for 7Nm manufacturing and less), so the recent quarters showed very high growth.",2021-05-19T10:56:33Z

Hjja9e0iqos,"If you like Deutsche B√∂rse, you have to look elsewhere for the real returns. There is a paradigm shift happening in Germany right now when it comes to buying stocks. A lot of new Brokers like Trade Republic are popping up everywhere and are gaining customers like crazy. None of these brokers process their trades using Xetra (Deutsche B√∂rse), but instead they rely on the exchanges of Lang & Schwarz, Baader Bank and Tradegate. The profits of those companies are exploding like crazy. Lang & Schwarz for example generated almost 10‚Ç¨ of EPS just in Q1 2021. Earnings for all of 2021 were 12‚Ç¨. The stock price sits just below 120‚Ç¨ right now, so they are insanely cheap for their current earnings. The market is distrusting their future ability to generate high earnings right now, but with Inflation looming in Europe and no interest for depositors at banks, Germans are slowly but surely waking up and start investing their money into stocks. Because of that I don't really see that trend stopping any time soon.

The same applies to Baader Bank, btw. Those companies are small, institutions haven't picked it up yet. I've been holding since 28‚Ç¨ and I'm not even thinking about selling a single share. The best is yet to come. Lang & Schwarz has a forward PE ratio of just 5 with potentially more growth ahead. This sounds like a perfect Sven Investment ;)

Want to know why your pension or mutual acts the way they do - it‚Äôs probably due to him. I recommend reading his two most popular books, Pioneering Portfolio Management and Unconventional Success (more geared towards individual investors). They will explain to you how to set up a portfolio. The first book is considered almost the bible of fund managers.

Hjja9e0iqos,"Yes! I was waiting for an analysis on ASML, my favorite company. The technology they have could be considered out of this world, like alien tech advanced. I was eyeing them when the stock price was half of the current price, and though it was exuberant... who knew it would double in less than a year...
I dream maybe one day, I might become a proud owner of such company /sigh",2021-05-09T10:08:18Z
Hjja9e0iqos,"Hello Sven, bit late to this one, and I only just watched the ASML, Siemens and Bayer part (I am short on time). I think for ASML you pay a premium for the moat, they basically have a monopoly in the market. They cannot easily scale the business because making more machines they really need to train more employees and invest in production capacity. They just can't grow 100% a year based on the machines alone. Would you think the premium is justified for a moat? And on Bayer, your wife is right, I do not trust the management, not touching that with a 3,3 meter pole for anything other than short term trades.",2021-05-09T09:59:47Z
Hjja9e0iqos,"I invested in DPW last year and have been satisfied so far. With the release of the latest financials, I've valued the company that it would still be considered close to reality even if its price hits 60 Euros this year. If they can keep their earnings up for the next few years that would be great but the question is - is this a one time exceptional event? or here to stay? Will the end of the pandemic make it stronger or weaker? When will the pandemic end? It's also cheap compared to its industry competitors with room to grow. Thank you for the videos! I continue to learn more from them and while I'm an idiot, each day I feel less stupid with your help.",2021-05-09T09:51:40Z

Hjja9e0iqos,"Interesting video, but I am a little surprised by your focus on European stocks. 
I am from Holland originally, but after having a look through quite a few European companies in the last few months, I have come to the conclusion that they are a bit of a lost cause as far as investing is concerned. 
Maybe because of pressure from society as a whole, European companies seem to focus on all sort of 'stake holders'.......  apart from the most important ones, their share holders..... 
As a result even their earnings seem to fluctuate far more wildly and become negative far more often and for longer than for their American and SE Asian counterparts. Possibly because those companies are just much more 'willing' to restructure their costs to avoid excessive impact on earnings?",2021-05-09T06:02:45Z

About Total: nice catch on the debt. Apart from that, it's smells bad that they seem to reduce their capex fairly in line with their declining revenues... I'm not into Total, but for anyone considering to invest: a capex intensive business that suddenly cuts their capex in half, I'd wanna know what happened there, before I put any cash into it.

What you say about Deutche Borse, I noticed the same for Hong Kong Stock Exchange... I personally am trying to get an answer as to how far these kinds of companies are maybe a more 'safer' bet for emerging markets: if they work on the basis of 'payed by transactions', they might even do well in turbulent times, as well as in times where the markets start booming.

Hjja9e0iqos,""" well diversified index fund like msci World""... 66-67% of us stocks (and overvalued too)...where's all this diversification?",2021-05-08T14:14:49Z
Hjja9e0iqos,"I completely disagree. 
A few months ago I had a very detailed look at the 'IOO' ETF (100 big companies in the world). 
For all of those 100 companies I calculated their 'intrinsic values' for a 10% return, similar to what Sven does and I was actually shocked by what I found.  
First of all a large proportion of the ETF was made up by a few very overvalued big US tech companies (Apple, Microsoft, etc.). In fact the more overvalued those companies are, the more the ETF will have to buy them, so you end up with even more........ 
Secondly most of the very large European companies that Sven just described in his video are part of the ETF as well. Typically they have wildly fluctuating earnings, sometimes even constantly dropping earnings, but very high valuations, so to me they are very undesirable. 
All in all my conclusion was that a $100 investment in the ETF only gave me an 'intrinsic value' of $60, so I concluded it was a very poor investment. 
I therefore completely agree with Sven. Pick individual companies with good earnings history, strong earnings growth potential and good fundamentals, but be patient and only buy those that  happen to be cheap.",2021-05-08T14:03:44Z

They're at max capacity due to the high demand for IC: equipment for people working remotely, chromebooks for kids studying remotely, many companies entering the IC market (M1 chip for example), expansion of data centers to handle all the network load, new smart products, or just plain bored people like me looking for something to kill time. I bought a 4K TV,  a gaming laptop, upgraded my gaming desktop, an M1 macbook air, 4 power bricks to run the M1, a PS5,  and 2 3D printers with the 3rd being built just to name a few.

""Rubber stamping"" chips at 3¬µm sounds plausible. That would be wildly cost effective and could dominate the market for a ton of support chips in pretty much anything that has electronics involved. But trying to impression stamp a chip that today requires 10-15 lithographic layers, most of which are done with EUV, does not exactly sound plausible. Heck, the precision of the stamp itself would be EUV class... And getting a transfer with zero defects/warp/creep sounds even wilder..",2021-07-25T22:15:59Z

I have no words to describe how ridiculously lazy kids in the West are right now. They're more concerned about social media than they are about studying.
Kids often skip class and disrespect their teachers. They threw paper at me because I would raise my hand and give the right answer. Even in grade 12 calculus, some kids couldn't even graph a parabola, so about 25% of the class dropped out within a week. This is the current state of schooling in the West.
One more thing I find insane in the West is the debate between ""rote learning"" and ""discovery based learning""
It's a stupid question because if you spend the time, you can have both. But if you don't put in the time, then you will have neither.
It's like asking ""should I cook the main course or should I cook desert?"". The right answer is that you can have both, if you spend enough time in the kitchen.
America is incredibly reliant on immigrants, many of them East Asian. Look at the engineering department at any university and you'll see what I mean.

The West has a legacy of scientific innovation, a result of the historical ""great divergence"". China missed out on 400 years of scientific progress.
The starting point for China was insanely low, as China had a mostly illiterate population living in a country that had few roads, plumbing or running water. Then they‚Äôre hit with Mao‚Äôs insane experiments, and the list goes on.
What I‚Äôm saying is they needed at least a couple of decades of reconstruction and schooling to even come close to being able to make well-designed products able to compete on the international stage. You have to start somewhere, right?
So if Mao died in 1976, then don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs reasonable to give these Chinese kids 30 years to study their math before making judgements on the effectiveness of their studying methods?
East Asians study for hours upon hours, and we soak up the material that nobody else wants to learn because they're too busy smoking weed or skipping class.

Some people say East Asian studying methods don't work.
But my question is ""What about me? I'm a Chinese immigrant who grew up here. Do I have good studying methods? Do I have creativity?""
If you say no, then why was I at the top of my class? Why am I successful in the workplace?
If you say yes, then you'll be sad to hear that kids in East Asia study in much the same way. I have relatives living in China, trust me I know.

oXkj12BgNlI,"Not likely, even reverse engineering it would take quite a long time. The thing about the semiconductor industry is that you can't compete by imitation the way you can in many other industries. With semiconductors by the time you figured out how to copy. Those companies leading the market have already moved to a new more advanced process node. It's also hard to overstate how extremely capital intensive and difficult semiconductor manufacturing is. It took Intel, TSMC, AMD, the US Department of Energy and many other brilliant people, hundreds of billions of dollars and nearly 20 years to get it to market. From my perspective China's best hope is focusing heavily on quantum computing and investing heavily in R&D for the transition away from silicon for semiconductors and other novel future semiconductor technologies. If they were to focus on developing a leading edge node foundry, by the time they actually catch up (if they can at all), we will probably be at a point of major paradigm shift for semiconductors anyway.",2021-04-03T15:03:38Z

sDkBxmWw8Sc,"@tommy lasatira Thats what everybody has been saying for the last decades as well but we keep meeting the Moore's law. Well i should say the architects at our company which are the brains behind it. Which basically means every 2 years we double the amount of transistors per mm2. We know the average atom size is 0.1-0.5 nm and our top line model coming up will when finetuned Probably  be able to write 2-3nm lines. That still gives room to improve. But indeed a good point, if we reach that point the machine with the highest serviceabiity, uptime, cleanliness (contamination is a big issue and ruins the process),.. etc will be market leader. Currently no other company is even coming close to what we can deliver and thus we have 85% market share. We do have older generation models which can do 7nm.

As a Dutch guy this company makes me proud, and I have looked into them a few times to invest, but glad I see my concerns confirmed in your video... The stock has grown way more than the company itself.. 

But good to know the actual valuation is about 445, so when it goes into some kind of correction that may be a good entry point.. but not right now.

ASML has more or less a monopoly, because it has a pile of pattents and a lot of knowledge within the company (The CEO is not the only one working 20+ years with ASML), so the competition cannot make what ASML can make... Guys like Samsung and TSMC HAVE TO buy these machines from ASML, which are technological marvels that is virtually impossible to copy by others... Its super high tech.",2021-05-29T16:16:10Z

Fun fact: it's difficult to get enough tech employees in the Netherlands for ASML. They are recruiting lots of people from India. Around ASML, some traditional Dutch schools now have almost 100% Indian kids. The employees from India are granted a 5 year (I believe, subject to change) tax exemption from the Dutch government to make ASML an attractive employer.

All these are not easily duplicated.",2021-05-29T18:05:27Z
sDkBxmWw8Sc,"@Tom Nash If you look at the suppliers of ASML, it is about a list of 5000 from all over the world. Since the technical challenge is immense, the barrier to entry is so high, there is currently only two or three other competitors of the similar (and less capable) players exist. None of them care capable of producing EUV tools. Since there is no alternative, and within a few years, there is no hope of having any competent competitors are able to appear, I doubt any government of the world will be wise to wield anti trust stick on this one. So, the real competition comes from ASML's  (and its 5000 suppliers) inability to produce enough parts and tools to meet the market demands. In other words, if I can use a typical phase used when talking about TSLA products, ""it is not a demand problem, it is a supply problem"". Only thing prevented ASML stock to the moon, is the lack of production capacity. I see the situation will last for another 2-3 years.",2021-05-29T17:58:28Z

sDkBxmWw8Sc,"@Tom Nash Comparing market cap makes me tear - ASML 282.53B vs INTEL 230.65B vs TXN 175.30B.

I honestly have no doubt that the US will have no choice put to put money in to US companies, especially after the chip shortage. Most of that hit the car industry and TXN is leading the system integration game. Intel also has huge recovery coming. ASML is just too expensive.",2021-05-29T15:09:12Z
sDkBxmWw8Sc,There's no barrier to new entry. What about Intel's new P1276? With Biden putting money in to Intel production there's huge competition.,2021-05-29T15:04:16Z

the moment, there are always two sides: as some
people will want the price to fall to its lower dip for
them to buy cheap, while others will hold and wait
till it skyrocket for them to sell off, but I really see
all this so pointless if it can't yield great result or
grow a very strong portfolio. it's clear now that the
halving is not whot we all imagined and expected
initially but the good thing for me was that I did
not put all my faith in it as I so much believe in day
trading and was able to grow a very strong portfolio.
However this I have been doing since the last bear
marthet with Larry Robinson strategies and daily
signals have proven to be very effective, accurate.
and profitable. Last month I was able to grow a total
of 7BTC having traded with my initial 2BTC with
Larry's daily signals which you would agree is a
very good profit. My odvice is for everyone to make
use of such signals and strategy so as to grow a very
strong portfolio ahead of halving coming soon. You

fv3DUuxdaWk,"Have owned it since 1997, although I owned the company they very generously bought out and I became a grateful ASML owner since the takeover. Cymer, CYMI, was the company, which was based in the San Diego, CA area. You can see that ASML has  facilities in the So. Cal. SD area, those were Cymer's. Cymer was working on EUV in the late 1990s, and when I first discovered it and what it was all about, I thought, ""that's got a very promising future.""",2021-10-19T01:25:19Z

aR4gOFfFUPk,Great company. The Best!!,2021-09-24T01:50:53Z
aR4gOFfFUPk,I agree with the assessment. It may not double or triple in the short term but it still has not hit the near term roof which is around 1000-1200 until we are near that overall market correction around the end of the year or beginning of 2022,2021-09-18T13:15:08Z

Nr19Y_pzfGY,Look up Valens Semiconductor. It will go public on NYSE with SPAC $PTK. Valens is based in Israel and they do great things. It is a sleeping giant. Currently at $9.89. Do your own DD. To me it looks good.,2021-06-09T05:33:19Z

etOE__7pNqs,"Building a fab takes a long time. So the industry is cyclic.
Shortage -> capacity expansion -> overproduction -> old fabs closed, new not build -> shortage ->...
I have no idea when we enter the next phase.
ASML understands this, so they don't want to invest in new production capacity.

I bought Corsair hoping increasing semiconductor production will increase their sales.",2021-10-23T08:13:26Z
