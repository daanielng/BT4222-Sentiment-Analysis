ABhFOTknCGo,"Most newbies usually undermine and neglect the importance of technical analysis with regards to trading. Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of assets prices regardless of what is happening in the wider or broader market. Essentially, the procedure involves studying the paths of a particular asset movement in the past so as to establish a sustainable pattern that can be used to predict future movement of an asset. Doing technical analysis can be quite different which is why most newbies/traders neglect day trading their coins and stick to holding which is very dangerous as when the market goes bearish, My advise any newbies/traders to buy the dip for traders who are still wondering to enter the market or old time traders who are holders to seek help from not just any trader but an established trading expert with at least 96% trade accuracy . I underwent series of trading loses I'd best not talk about before I was introduced to trading analyst Dr Benjamin Aldrich. My contact with her has been the Pinnacle of this year for me, under his careful guide and his signal service I've been able to recover my losses and even grow my trading portfolio massively from 1.6 BTC to 7 BTC in just 5 weeks. I will advice traders esp newbies to have orientation of trading before they involve in it. Ben Aldrich makes you learn daily while you make profit with his signals.

z1R0H8hkJ7Q,Apple is making their M1 processors now. If big tech follows suit a company like QCOM will be in trouble. I looked at this last week and thought the same things from a value perspective but I think investors are worried about the long term scenario of companies making their own chips in house.,2021-03-21T00:01:05Z
z1R0H8hkJ7Q,"@phantomcreamer no apple does not a Qualcomm licensing fees for these chips, they pay arm? Just like Qualcomm pays arm licensing fees.

z1R0H8hkJ7Q,"@phantomcreamer no it doesn't take a lot of capital to DESIGN, you don't know what you're talkin ABOUT. Qualcomm doesn't make chips, they design based off of arm. So that's why their 5 year past revenues are flat. Because people designed their own chips and don't use Qualcomm anymore and it keeps happening.",2021-10-15T22:22:20Z

cLLGX0Pked0,"Why are people buying Bitcon when they could buy QCOM or vice versus? What happens when carbon credit costs are needed for all those 1000's of computers needed to compute a single Bitcon transaction?  Inflation hedge? Real Estate, Gold, Silver? Cash flow positive stocks and rental properties?  Where was Saylor for the 10 years Bitcon traded under $100? So..  how will he cash in on the collapse? Puts on his own stock? Selling Calls? Micro Strategies MSTR buys Bitcon, creates hype, Bitcon goes up, MSTR goes up because their Bitcon asset is worth more making their stock price worth more, they issue more stock or take on more debt in order to buy more Bitcon sending Bitcon higher,  create more hype, borrow more to buy more Bitcon rinse and repeat.... over priced stock chasing over priced Bitcon chasing over priced stock, tulips used as collateral to buy pixxy dust. What's Bitcon worth? Ask the next greater fool who buys it. He'll say more. What's the present value of future cash flows on any investment? Some quantifiable dollar value. Bitcon? No one knows. What happens when carbon credit costs are needed for all those 1000's of computers needed to compute a single Bitcon transaction? What happens when all the Chinese Billionaires  are done moving their money out of the country? What happens when the central banks create their own digital coin?  Do you think Bill Gates would own the stocks he owns or would be buying farm land if he thought Bitcon was a better bet? Saylor is an opportunist. His business is shrinking so he's buying Bitcon because of what I think is a temporary phenomenon, Chinese trying to ""disappear"" their cash, and perhaps people getting paid off to implement policies related to Con Vid.  Crypto currencies are just as infinite as fiat. Dog coin? Ethirian? PonZies are fun while they last.  It'll probably trade somewhere in the range it did the first 10 years of its existence or due to power consumption taxed into oblivion.

Lately, when asked for predictions about bitcoin and cryptos generally, most experts on youtube and other media, predictions are mostly generic with no specifics on the direction. Everyone seems to be guessing and getting even more confused about the future.

With the insight, skills, and experience of a trader like Like Marcus Ramirez the sky is the limit. I came to this realization when I made a return on investment of 87% in my first month using his signals for my trades.

yC2ZzE_qBoA,@Financial Movers Thank you for your input. But asking your accountant friend that he agrees with you doesn‚Äôt add more weight to your argument. Lol,2021-02-05T01:39:25Z
yC2ZzE_qBoA,"@Shiftstart so you said ‚Äúpractical‚Äù which is much more of an opinion based/relative word because what‚Äôs practical to me may not be practical to you. To put this to a close I asked an accountant friend of mine to weigh in his thoughts (retired VP of a bank) and he said that we‚Äôre both correct. I agree with you to an extent that net debt isn‚Äôt a major component to the analysis and that‚Äôs why I did it at the very end of my fundamental analysis segment and not as the opening topic. It‚Äôs been good conversing with you! Thanks for your input. I always like to hear what others have to say, especially those that are educated on the topic.",2021-02-05T01:16:30Z
yC2ZzE_qBoA,"@Financial Movers This is most likely due to conformity with international financial accounting standards.  As other counties require this information.  For example,  most analysts don‚Äôt pay attention to GAAP EPS as much as non-GAAP EPS. In the most practical review of financial statements of a company that‚Äôs going concern, an investor has no reason to focus on ‚ÄúNet Debt Collection‚Äù unless the company has inherent liquidity issue to cover current asset. And when combine with long term debt, it provides better net worth picture.  Qualcomm in this case does not meet any liquidity issues for short term for us to consider ‚ÄúNet Debt Collection‚Äù as viable information in your analysis.",2021-02-05T01:09:41Z
yC2ZzE_qBoA,@Shiftstart Interesting. But if I shouldn‚Äôt do that then why is there a formula for Net Debt? The formula is: Net Debt= short term debt + long term debt - cash and cash equivalents. You can find it on many earnings under ‚ÄúNet Debt Calculation.‚Äù I don‚Äôt understand why there‚Äôs a formula and section for it on earnings reports if investors should do it?,2021-02-04T22:16:56Z
yC2ZzE_qBoA,"@Financial Movers Thank you for the clarification. But you still shouldn‚Äôt use total debt analysis for what they can immediately liquidate because it includes long term debt. Also, the assumption is that the company isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgoing concern‚Äù. Therefore, in such scenario, the total asset has to be liquidated to meet total debt obligations.  I have an accounting degree and certified.",2021-02-04T21:45:45Z
yC2ZzE_qBoA,Thanks for the input. I never compare current assets to long to long term liabilities unless I‚Äôm talking about total debt and if the company can manage it with what they have on hand that‚Äôs liquidable. Current assets vs. current liabilities and total assets vs total liabilities. I did graduate with a finance degree from Indiana University. üí™,2021-02-04T13:52:50Z

The stock repurchase program has no expiration date. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, QCOM resumed stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program, which QCOM had suspended in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the three months ended December 27, 2020 and December 29, 2019, QCOM repurchased and retired 3 million and 9 million shares, respectively, for $444 million and $762 million, respectively.

mKisWsPVyaU,"The major challenges investors face may range from controlling impulsiveness to the frail of compulsion. Most newbies and would-be investors often undermine and most often neglect the importance of technical analysis with regards to trading. Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of asset prices regardless of what is happening in the wider or broader market. Essentially, the process involves studying the paths of a particular asset movement in the past so as to establish a sustainable pattern that can be used to predict future movements. I would encourage investors out there to trade with the little they have or copy trade alerts from a professional trader. I have been using James Clifford's trading Signals and Strategy during the bear market, increasing my daily portfolio. With his strategy/signals and with the current bullish market, i have been able to grow my portfolio to 13 btc with my initial 2.8 btc. Anyone in need of a a legitimate trader can get to James directly on Telegram. for proper Guidance on your Journey to Financial Freedom! Remember, a Bullish market is Reversed Bearish Market.

The S&P 500, which also hit its highest level ever earlier in the session, slid into the red, shedding 0.4%. And the Nasdaq Composite fell further, declining 1%. The Dow held on to a gain largely thanks to the start of earnings season. Goldman Sachs Group accounted for a significant chunk of the blue-chip index‚Äôs advance, rising 2%, after the bank reported sharply higher profits for the first quarter, benefiting from a turbocharged market and an economic recovery. According to Stock Analyst and strategist Dr Rodrick Jonathan, the communications services and tech sectors face the biggest hit to earnings from increases in the corporate tax rate and the tax on foreign income, while the more cyclically oriented industrials, energy and materials sector are at the bottom.

Have you joined AAII or invested in subscription to http://technical.traders.com/sub/sublog.asp.  Also good website for contact with fellow trader is https://futures.io/  .... My friend Great Trading.  Webull... Never heard of that or RobinHood....  If you ever want to talk trading were both #VRAfam.  There are a lot of articles about FISHING STOCK STOPS during off hours.  Even though there are risks involved I hope that your stops are not global market stops.,2021-01-09T02:09:36Z
vL1w5QXJ6Zs,"Goes to show that stock market is always a long-term game and the one needing a proper risk-benefit analysis. The stock might have dropped this morning, but I agree with your analysis, and its book value vs. investor's interest. Sorry that your sell got triggered, but with years of experience in the microchip industry and partnerships with other companies, I'm still bullish on QCOM long-term... tho I don't think I'll be placing any short-term bull spreads on it, bc I can't predict when it will bounce back. I think I'm just gonna buy and hold a few stocks... and now seems like a good entry point.

PS: I love your technical analysis. I'm not too versed with all these technical terms, and would love it if you could make some more videos explaining the basics of technical analyses as well. üòä",2021-01-08T18:19:06Z

0hqoTkloDCc,"Thank you for your time and insight!  üëçüëç..... Anyways investing in *bitcoin and cryptocurrency* is the best way to make earnings due to the recent outbreak. Sometimes when we have that specific money that we want to invest in a particular thing, we always lose focus and then invest or spend the money wrongly. One reason you need to invest in crypto and its technology is because; crypto is changing the economy shape of any nation that approaches the technology and that way being an early adopter gives you an edge over others that will buy into it late. While looking at the growth rate of cryptocurrency and the opportunity it presents, why not look into it and have a rethink about the particular investment you wish to make now. *Get an expert* like Colter Dawson whose daily signals and strategy is top-notch. With his strategy and daily signals, i was able to grow my portfolio from *1.1btc to 6.3BTC* which you can agree is a great profits. Colter Dawson can be reached on *Teleqram (@Dawson24_7signals) and ùö†–ΩŒ±—ÇŒ±—ïŒ±œÅœÅ   (+447868696834)*  for all crypto related inquiries.",2021-03-15T09:21:15Z

m2f5nulEsl0,"U.S. stocks turned south in afternoon trade after a news report said President Joe Biden is weighing a proposal that would nearly double the capital-gains tax for wealthy individuals.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 316.91 points, or 0.9%, to 33,820.40. The S&P 500  dropped 35.56 points, or 0.9%, to 4,137.86. but The Nasdaq Composite  shed 122.71 points, or 0.9%, to trade at 13,827.51. and On Wednesday, stocks ended higher after back-to-back declines, with the Dow rising 316.01 points, or 0.9%. The S&P 500 gained 0.9%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 index  jumped 2.4%.     Stock Analyst and strategist Dr Rodrick Jonathan said the tech sectors and the communications services  face the biggest hit to earnings from increases in the corporate tax rate and the tax on foreign income, while the more cyclically oriented industrials, energy and materials sector are at the bottom. The picture changes, however, depending on the mix,  so he warns Traders to be careful,  for now you can only make profit by trading a working strategy instead of panic selling,  i was able to make $40,000 with $10,000 on Swing trade in 3 weeks with his stock trading strategy, reach him  on telegram Rodrickjonathan  orWhatsApp+1(66O)474-OO3O,",2021-04-22T22:20:22Z

txIyfFGM4ro,"<BlTCOIN> is becoming more appealing to lnvestors seeking low-correlation assets that diversify portfolios. The U.S. investment bank noted that high volatility ‚Äúacts as a headwind towards further adoption.‚Äù The signs that BlTCOIN‚Äôs volatility is diminishing could see it ‚Äúcrowding out goId‚Äù as a portfolio diversifier and suggests a long-term price target which makes now the right time to stack up more BlTCOIN.  As big as Bitcoin is now, it‚Äôs a mere fraction of what it will be so it never too late, one important note is to follow the guidance of a professional <in three weeks of trading I have been able to make 9.2 BTC using signals from Anika Hobson.

q_V_Zeu8eqw,Awesome thank you for the review. Part of the sideways trading the last few years was regulatory and licensing issues. But those have been settled within the last year which i think was part of the run up. YoY sales and profits should be strong over the next few quarters from 5G tailwinds.  Part of the problem I think right now for Qcom is that a lot of people think they are too deep on the mobile side and they need a wider moat which qualcomm has been trying to adress with IOT and such but there is a lot of negative sentiment/articles out there. I think the pros will continue to accumulate and hopefully will see some nice gains over the next couple years. Thanks again GL,2021-06-23T02:07:53Z
Fcd_V6XETIg,"<great post üôåüèªVery detailed and precise video you put up mate I love your contents, it's funny how some people out there still haven't accepted the fact that cryptocurrencies continue to reshape the world globally, It's hard for anyone going against it these days, though from a trader's perspective I feel we really need more experts in the field updating newbies/investors on how the community works, lately the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently open and you can't tell if it is going to bearish or bullish, this uncertainty pushes most traders away and forces investors to hold, I'd say it's out rightly wrong to just sit back and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stock up more coins should be our ultimate goal thereby making profits, it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your strategies. I started with 2 BTC and I have accumulated over 5.5 BTC in just 4weeks, with the right trading strategy given to me by an expert trader MR Patrick Timothy .. His methods are top-notch and profitable and he can be contacted easily on T e l e g r a m [ @patricktims] and also WhatsApp‚Äî(+15852018593.)for Crypto related concern‚úä.",2021-07-09T02:51:36Z

nK46_Tx38-8,Now this is a good stock to watch the macd might reverse to the upside very soon wouldnt recommend a buy till in crosses.... but its in a trading ranging from 181 to 188 so if it gets over that range expect to see a test to see if it can turn that level to support,2021-12-12T15:19:00Z
