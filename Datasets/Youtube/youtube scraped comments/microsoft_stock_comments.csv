Easy to put it 9n someone else. Like school shootings. You guys point to NRA and gun dealers. No way it could have been the person pulling the trigger. Looking for someone else to blame instead of looking at the actual problem. Nothing but excuses and lies. What for? Can't let the American people know the truth.

xNDHiiJaxes,"Nice to see something resembling actual journalism. Krystal's comments about Trump are something his supporters should start questioning. The more he stays in the shadows and doesn't use his infinitely expanded power being a citizen in the free market, not restrained by the office, the more he looks like a puppet. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of the guy...but I NEVER trust a politician. He's an outsider, but once you run for office, you are a politician. And anybody that plays that game is suspect. I didn't even decide I liked the guy until halfway through his term. I applaud his dedication to using that pulpit to promote traditional cherished values and be a strong leader, but where is he now? 
He has the clout and connections to form an alternative video and social media platform. His entire base is being silenced with no voice in the press. I think he has a responsibility as a person of wealth and influence to do good for society. As a man who talked the biggest game of all, he needs to put his money where his mouth is and use every means at his disposal to help the American people. 
MAGA doesn't need Trump or any one man to save us. We are legion. We are responsible for our own governance and liberty. But we also gave that man more energy than any politician has seen since JFK. 
I just find it odd he isn't still going full speed ahead, in spite of the election outcome. Superheroes don't quit being superheroes just because they don't hold office in Gotham. When he took that office, he assumed that title for life. Just because he's not in office anymore doesn't absolve him of the responsibility to the oath he took.",2021-04-19T17:01:58Z

Why do you think the saying is: 'the only way politicans leave the Senate is in cuffs or a coffin'? Cause they rig the system to always get re-elected once they see the piles of cash they can make for themselves and their family members. Political positions are called 'public service' because when our country was founded, the local baker, shoe maker, blacksmith, banker, etc volunteered a few hours a week to serve on a committee to run their local govt.

xNDHiiJaxes,"I'm as upset about insider government trading as anyone, but this is not the story you think it is. Pelosi's husband purchased those calls in Feb 2020 with an expiration of 3-19-2021. If you look at their options history, they regularly exercise deep ITM calls upon expiration. So, unless they knew this deal would happen around this time back in Feb 2020, this isn't the smoking gun you think it is.

Is it possible Pelosi influenced the decision to award those contracts to Microsoft knowing they were invested in MSFT? Certainly. Was the exercise of the options a direct result of the Microsoft deal? It would be impossible to claim that unless you also claim they knew this would happen back in Feb 2020.",2021-04-18T21:28:53Z

xNDHiiJaxes,"Krystal @ 1:30, ""Why are members of Congress allowed to trade stocks while they are holding public office..."" BINGO!!! A call option is when a first party pays the second party money to buy their stock at a certain set price but agrees to have the option to buy it at a later date. By that later date, the price of the stock may be up or down as dictated by the open and ongoing market. The speaker of the house can buy a stock option at (for the sake of argument) $50 per share and pay perhaps $5 per share for the option. She can then lead the appropriation of money for the military to buy Microsoft products (Congress appropriates expenditures of money). When the news of this government contract with Microsoft hits the public the price of Microsoft stock is going to go up. Let's say it goes from $50 per share to $70 per share based on this news (I'm making the numbers up for argument's sake). Pelosi can then exercise her option at the later date to buy the stock at $50 (the agreed-upon price) when it is on the open market for $70 making $20 per share profit. Now multiply those $20 per share by millions of shares. Any Congresscritter doing this should be arrested and thrown in jail. Listen to Krystal's commentary from 0:50 to 1:30 for the full effect. She actually says the word ""Corrupt"". RIGHT.",2021-04-16T08:02:57Z

Congress can't stop it or change it .Neither  the President or even the Supreme Court can stop it . The U.S. Constitution is a product of the American Revolution , not the French Revolution.

If they do well in office, they get a return on their investment, if they do poorly... not so much. No one is ever allowed to serve more than one term in office, and they are barred from accumulating any wealth while they are in office or as a direct result of their tenure.

xNDHiiJaxes,"This kind of stuff happens because Congress works in the shadows, away from the eyes of American voters. Those shadows facilitate the domination of the US government by special interests.

The solution to this is not a lot of new rules (which would have loopholes). The solution is for Congressional leaders to engage in nationally televised pre-election debates every two years. That is, the Democratic and Republican leaders of the House and the Democratic and Republican leaders of the Senate should debate each other before elections every two years. That would acknowledge the fact that voters are choosing parties as well as individuals for office, and trades like these by the Speaker could be the subject of debate questions. The president and vice president may be the only nationally elected Federal officials, but they are not the only nationally relevant Federal officials, and election practices should recognize the importance of Congressional leaders.

Another place where you see this in a way that's somewhat funny and cute but also pretty serious is that Biden seems to have unironic affection to Ireland as his home country and has been decidedly pro-Ireland in the current Brexit Northern Ireland debates, and has even decided to have a ""home away from home"" in Ireland during his Presidency.

I mean I'm not going to say that's a completely false assessment, but comparing the situation on Capitol Hill now compared to the Obama admin seems false.   During the Obama admin we had the rise of the Tea Party and Libertarian candidates who were massively against any increase in spending and a Democratic Party that was still big on compromise. Now there's an influential super progressive wing of the party and the culture isn't so deficit hawkery compared to what it was under Obama.   On top of that, Biden has been much more supportive of labor rights then Obama ever was so far and I do suspect that although there will be a good amt of haggling, that we are going to get some sort of sizeable infrastructure package and maybe the PRO Act along with it.   There's also the chance of filibuster reform which would be awesome.   But yeah so there's quite a bit going on",2021-04-13T18:26:09Z

Upfront I agree that people in government should not be allowed to directly invest in stocks, there should be clear separation between them and any decisions regarding their investments during their time in office.  But to be clear Pelosi and her husband weren't ""caught"". Public officials, their spouses, and dependent children must report financial transactions valued at more than $1,000, typically within 30 days. Also Microsoft has been on a roll regardless of any military deal, Microsoft’s stock has been on the rise for over a year and their fiscal-second-quarter earnings, reported in January, crushed estimates. Goldman Sachs is upbeat on the shares so investing in stocks like Roblox and Microsoft are prudent investments for Pelosi's husband who runs a venture capital investment firm. As bad as this looks, nothing they did is ""illegal"" unless congress passes legislation. I do think however think the mainstream media needs to step up and point this out and force a conversation directly with Pelosi.",2021-04-13T15:43:39Z

xNDHiiJaxes,"@lisa mcginnis It looks like no one answered you, so I will give you a start on learning about this.
Insider trading is a set of laws that apply to people who work in the industry and are supposed to be enforced by the SEC. Congress doesn't and gave themselves their own exemption to the rules regarding this kind of behavior that all other public employees are subject to, decades ago.
Martha Stewert was licensed (Trader IIRC) and therefore was subject to them. Pelosi is only one of an enormously long list of politicians in both parties that have traded, either themselves or through their spouses, on their own insider information going back into the 19th century. It is the reason for making the rules on ethics and financial disclosure in the first place, but of course those rules are so vague and broad as to be nearly useless, even on the rare occasion they are enforced. They are the fig leaf elected officials hide behind whenever people do demand an accounting.
That's a very brief start. If you have any specific questions, I'll try to point you in the right direction.",2021-04-19T06:05:29Z

I was so frustrated because I was jobless and I have a family to take care of at that point in time. A childhood friend of mine talk to me about investing on crypto currency and I started watching different videos of trades onYouTube but I still don’t understand anything about it, I was about given up on it before i met a man named Edward Rowe who several persons have been praising him and writing good testimonies about him. So, I decided to give it a try by investing with him, I started with $3000 and from then till date it has been profits upon profits and I can proudly say now that I’m living very well with my family. You can reach Mr Edward via tele-gram: @EdwardRowe for assistance and guidance",2021-12-09T09:27:04Z

Knowing how the powers that be operate it's always some sinister shit going on.. y do they want all black people to get crypto credit and vaccinated.. none seem to secure.. bitcoin ain't backed or insured by anything.. at least if I keep my money in a bank it's fdic insured for up to a million.. if I lose I get it back.. bitcoin is if u lose then u lost.. end of story.. no insurance... it's pretty much a stock but more volatile.. also who would accept a currency that fluctuates as much as this does.. if I except payment from u today and tomorrow that money is valueless then I just took a loss..people need to start thinkng and quit letting the screen think for u.. their are agents everywhere pushing white agenda.. u know it's agenda cuz everybody is pushing it.. plus like I told u the feds took it over.. one day someone's gonna trip over a cord and there's no more bitcoin.. everybody's money lost and no recorse.. there are waay better investments that offer high yielding dividends with more security on ur money.. don't listen to these bitches.. the best investment u can make for the future to come is ....guns and urself.. learn a trade learn how to farm and how to sterilize water,2021-11-04T08:49:38Z

People are rising and uniting, people are standing up for the animals, the animals are standing up for the humans, so all evil even hunting is going down and it's ending as it was divinely written and passed down by our ancestors.

People are essentially getting right back with nature and living alongside nature while realizing that nature provides everything we need all the plant medicine or the plant foods and all the friends and joy as well. 

Only a small amount of people are really going to toss themselves into this metaverse crap, the rest are going to continue to unite, enjoy the real life and defend all of life including the animals as you are all seeing globally.",2021-11-03T15:56:03Z

So I have about $200 the next two weeks to invest and I can buy 3 rivian stocks for between $52 and $62 each when it IPOs  because I think it will hit $300-400 within the next 3-5 years. Or, it is a metaverse etf that is $15/share that I plan on amassing over the next year, because in about 3-4 years, I believe it will be at $45/share and who knows where it will go beyond that at this point.

Bm_R6_5SQ_o,"@Thought Garden dude. i travelled there as a tourist. i dont care about the politics.
 but let me tell u one thing! if u go to china now, every chinese are very optimistic to their future. they love their government. and they trust the goevernment. they don't have any reasons to dislike the ccp. a government that can lifted up their life and bring their nation to second largest ecpnomic in the world, why would they dislike it? 
i know, bbc, cnn etc keep saying that there are no freedom in china. people there are living in hell, blah blah blah.
the chinese there are always laughing when see that kind of news.

I told you I was open and I will remain civil, it sounds more like you just don't want to answer hard questions. Tell me about the social rating system, also do they still call the government a communist one, even though the country has taken on western economics? What does the CCP say to its citizens about Taiwan? Do you feel fulfilled in your life? How big is your living space? Ask me anything about america I will tell you the gods honest truth good or bad. I think that's more of the difference we can speak out about our government at all levels without haveing the fear of vanishing like all of the doctors and media folks who have vanished from china after the outbreak started.",2021-10-22T11:56:47Z

CCP0YTykb8M,"<“Don't fight the trend"" is an old saying, and there are other variants of the phrase like ""never catch a falling knife."" The bottom line is that traders should not try to anticipate trend reversals, or even worse, try to improve their average while losing. It really doesn't matter whether one is trading soy futures, silver, stocks or cryptocurrencies. Markets generally move in cycles, which can last from a few days to a couple of years. In B -TC’s case, it's hard for anyone to justify a bullish case by looking at the chart. It is much more complicated than some would have you believe but from Melisa Mondino, approach, bear market aren’t worth losing from if you use the ongoing new bie/investor programs.

Robinhood and the shutting down of the p;atform so their buddies won't get burned( which has never beendone foe the hundreds of investors I  I know) get away with point blank criminal activity?  The SEC is a criminal enterprise. Why hasn't the Justicer Department done their job? Cramer just refused to present the paperwork the judge the asked for and got to walk. I haven't ween anything to Robinhood. The SEC and their master the Federal Reserve have to be held accountable for what they are doing! Since '33 we have been on this Path. The FEDRES money machine has just about reached the same point in history that it's debt based based monetary expansion POnzi reaches a point THAT it's exponential nature is too much to control. GENSLER..IF YOU'R SO MUCH FOR THE INVESTOR WHY DON'T YOU AND THE ATTORNEY'S FOR THE RIPPLE SUIT HAVE A LIVE  TELEVISED EVENT WHERE YOU ANSWER  QUESTIONS OF THE PEOPLE YOU ARE SCREWING OVER?  THE FED IS A PRIVATE ENTITY. WHY HASN'T IT BEEN AUDITED? IF YOUR FOR THE INVESTOR ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FEDRES FOR US ON LIVE TELEVISION..  It's followed by a huge depressions and a big war generally just like every other example of 2000 years. These guys just want to manipulate every aspect of the markets, interest rates, employment levels and who is allowed to even take advantage of many of these financial opportunities. They seem to believe that we need our hand held and that we need brokers to steer us by mandate. If we were allowed to actually make the kind of money like they do without them. That would soon lead to knowing the truth about how corrupt  Yellen and Gensler REALLYare as well as how they are not here to protect the investors. Gensler is telling lie after lie in public as well as several of hi s predecessors. SEE YOU IN COURT BECAUSE THIS CLASS ACTION WILL HAPPEN. AND TELL THE FEDRES THEY BETTER GET A HANDLE ON THINGS.BECAUSE WHEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE MADE FULLY AWARE OF THE TRUTH.. CHARLATANS LIKE GENSLER WHO ARE EXTORTING COMPANIES BECAUSE THAT'S ALL IT IS- THE HINMAN DEPOSITIONS AND THE SEC REVOLVING DOOR MAKE THAT PERFECTLY CLEAR. CORRUPT MEMBERS OF BOTH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND CONGRESS WILL BE NEXT.  YELLEN has taken over 20 mil from big banks to Influence regulations she doesn't know anything about. Their actions are harming hundreds of thousands of people and they won't even acknowledge THEIR PRESENCE. AND THE REAL PROBLEM EVERY ONE IN CONGRESS IS TO MUCH OF A PUSS TO BRING UP IS THE FEDERAL RESERVE. IT'S  ENGINEERED AND MEANT TO  KEEP US IN DEBT AND WORKING FOREVER. UNTIL THEY DEVALUE THE CURRENCY SO MUCH THEY SEIZE WHAT  LITTLE BIT IS STILL OWNED BY US.

Doesn't stand to reason that talk and enthusiasm don't mean much if it isn't accurate?   Thank you.",2021-08-20T19:08:19Z

1rN025TqHSE,"For most investors who entered late last year, the recent historical highs were extremely attractive profit-taking targets. It is the consequences of such profit-taking decisions that we are now witnessing in the crypto market. There is no trend reversal because there is no panic selling. Active asset purchases immediately after the plunge below $30K indicates the preservation of the pool of investors who are still willing to believe in the continued upward BTC dynamics. Market participants are still undecided about the relationship between Bitcoin and the traditional market. On the one hand, the asset has become part of it, as buying by traditional funds ramp up. On the other hand, it is unlikely that the decentralized digital code will ever fit into the market framework, which began working long before the advent of the Internet and computers in general. Investors are looking to make a bullish move so as to earn from hoarding, while traders are earning from price movements. Trading has always been a more profitable means of earning, this has been a major step for me, I have found a crypto guide in Burwell Coleman and his signals are top notch. I must say, I haven’t seen any service as his, I made over 12 BTC within 4 weeks, and this was done solely from my daily trade sessions on my live trading account, trading from my experience is the most lucrative opportunity crypto offers yet, every crypto trader should learn the art and utilize its gains.

J31rd7tRPow,"My opinion on the dividend discussion here in the comments:

If you are looking to retire on your dividend portfolio in less than 5 years, microsoft would probably not be the best choice, because you dont have enough time to proit from the potential massive dividend growth. Especially if you are 50 or older, and looking at around 30 years of life left.

On the other hand if you are in your 20s or 30s and plan to retire in 20+ years, you have the time to wait for microsoft to increase the dividend payment, probably outgrowing titles like AT&T in that time span and hopefully keep growing in your retirement.

I personaly am in my late twenties and own both dividend growth and dividend yield stocks.
I like to have yields stocks like AT&T because the cashflow motivates me and can be used flexible to reinvest im the same company or invest in other opportunities.
I also like to own dividend growth stocks like microsoft where the yield on cost is improving rapidly over the years.

I personaly find both motivating and think it is smart to have a mix of both, especially for young people like me, who have the time to let the stocks develop.",2021-02-27T21:08:43Z
J31rd7tRPow,"Very impressive video thanks.

J31rd7tRPow,I buy a Microsoft computer.,2021-02-20T08:14:23Z
J31rd7tRPow,"Be glad you can only invest into Microsoft and not Xbox specifically, Microsoft is the far wiser investment. The launches of the the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S has largely been mishandled and rushed, and the GamePass system has been a cataclysmic failure with server side issues that have rendered the service unusable for many. Not to mention, the structure of a streaming service like Netflix doesn't jive well with Video Game content... Letting people play full Triple AAA games that took years to develop for nothing but a flat monthly fee instead of an individual purchase is a finacial death sentence to small and medium game developers of all kinds, and many are only on the GamePass platform because Microsoft has essentially bribed them to be on their platform, at cost.

The Xbox division is essentially sinking money into GamePass by paying developers to use their platform, and they're hoping it will get enough viewer/player engagement to balance out the cost of providing the service... but in my opinion, it is not a sustainable model, and will probably be fundamentally changed or even scrapped later on. 

Its also worth noting that even though Microsoft is the bigger and more advanced company, Xbox is technologically behind its main competitors, Nintendo and Sony. Nintendo's Switch tablet style design and motion control has synergized with the mobile gaming demographic incredibly well in addition to expanding and solidifying their own loyal consumer base, and Sony's PS5 has graphic capability and processing power that, so far, seems to have badly outperformed both the Series S and Series X in both regards.

Xbox consistently dominated the 7th generation of console gaming with the 360, and they performed moderately well in the 8th generation as well... but we're moving into the 9th generation of gaming consoles now and so far Xbox has severely underperformed while PS5 has been almost impossible to obtain because of its insanely high demand.

My feeling is that Xbox will not perform well this generation, and this will result in them either diminishing their gaming sector or doubling down on innovations for the next gen... but the next gen will be some time from now.",2021-02-20T01:13:01Z
J31rd7tRPow,Nice video man. You just earned a subscriber. This stock is the majority of my stock (small and just starting) so I’m wondering.... are all the things you’re talking about in the gaming section already up and running? Are they all baked into the price of the shares?,2021-02-19T23:24:29Z
J31rd7tRPow,"Best video explaining a stock ive ever seen! Great job, thank you",2021-02-18T20:44:06Z
J31rd7tRPow,"A common thing for everything that Microsoft does... It's business branches that have barely any customer volatility.
The main competition is for new customers. And in some instances, even then it's more or less a matter or priority vs competition.

Either you choose to go OSX.. or Windows. And once you are on a platform, there's barely any switching. Especially for companies.
With Office... The Apple-version is pretty much limited to the Apple-Ecosystem, the only competition to it is Google-Docs. And then it's unlikely to change for quite a while. In case of companies, they're already invested in Azure at this point and likely to get other Azure services (instead of going to the competition) for ease of management, integration benefits, etc.
Yes, AWS does some things better than Azure, and for those things it's an incentive to go hybrid between clouds. But there's always to option for MS to satisfy that ressource-demand with the aforementioned benefits.
And the same goes for pretty much all of their cash-cows.
Since almost any change in IT-Systems also has the almost guaranteed potential to also cause a change in organization structure and/or at least business processes, the cost to change is substantial, so the barrier to switch is pretty high. And for highly demanded applications, there's always integration into their other systems providing very strong incentives to leave the rest as it is. In essence, they do have the same benefits as they'd get from customer loyalty measures... by simply providing a decent and affordable enough alternative to subjectively and objectively better products with that wide of a portfolio. And they have enough funds to outright buy aspiring but unestablished competition... and the cloud ressources to strike a deal and profit from their existance.",2021-02-18T11:23:47Z

J31rd7tRPow,MSFT is currently undervalued based on their exceptional earnings too,2021-02-15T14:49:55Z
J31rd7tRPow,"I’ve been wondering whether I bought in too high ($214), but you’re right, it’s just a quality company and worth owning more at any price for the long term. Great analysis! It was a 2-for-1 with that Xbox vs PS5 thrown in",2021-02-15T14:31:57Z
J31rd7tRPow,"Quality company, yes

Dividend stock? No.",2021-02-15T14:02:34Z
J31rd7tRPow,"@Wil Lyons ""Now that is unlikely, but that's how this works."" ;)",2021-02-18T21:07:10Z
J31rd7tRPow,"@RuleOfSeventyTwo It's funny that you want an explanation from me, but you shutting it down as a dividend stock in your comment pays you no mind.  

1st off, lets take the stability of Microsoft, it's not going anywhere, the dividend safety is so comforting.  Now lets take a look at the payout ratio, 40% is nothing, especially when you're talking about the kind of capital Microsoft rakes in, meaning 60% of their profits are in pay to potentially increase a dividend.  They dividend has a 10% annual growth rate, which is insane.  Meaning, 20 years down the road, if it stayed at that rate, they would be paying a $13.  Now that is unlikely, but that's how this works.  Unless you're dumping huge amounts of capital into a stock, finding companies that have great cash flow and are still increasing their dividends at a high clip is the way to go, especially when you're thinking 20 years down the road.  The room for dividend growth in Microsoft is much higher than a company like ATT, especially when you figure in potential value of the share price climbing with it.  

Dividend yield is only one piece of the pie, you need to take into account Dividend growth, dividend safety, payout ratio, market cap & cash flow.",2021-02-18T13:21:59Z
J31rd7tRPow,"@Nick I disagree with dividends growing proportionally, in that was the case the yield would always be the same. MSFT is a great company in my mind, but entering at this low of a yield is like choosing to start with a smaller snowball to roll down the hill.",2021-02-18T13:20:08Z
J31rd7tRPow,Dividend grows proportionally to company stock and because Microsoft grows a ton in a few years the dividend will be much higher in a much shorter period of time. Essentially dividend snowball gets bigger faster.,2021-02-17T21:50:22Z
J31rd7tRPow,@Wil Lyons why dont you bother telling me reasons why? instead of just thoughtlessly telling me im wrong...,2021-02-17T18:14:42Z

J31rd7tRPow,Incase you wanted numerical values an investment of 10k in 1995 spy would be now 108k with 9.77% annually. In comparison to MSFT would currently be at 680k with 17.98% annually.,2021-02-15T07:51:36Z

J31rd7tRPow,"I'm glad I watched this on a Sunday, otherwise I'd have paused the video and bought 1000 shares of MSFT 😂. On a more serious note, great video, I also happen to own only two shares, but MSFT is one of the few companies I'm planning to DCA as well. I also ""own"" more MSFT shares through ETFs and index funds, but I'd like to buy more individual shares. Hopefully you're right and one day becomes a dividend King.",2021-02-15T01:26:56Z
J31rd7tRPow,"excellent vid!!!
I bought MSFT in the march dip at $159.  I concur with your complete analysis of the company.  this company will be a heavy hitter in my portfolio.  as a rule of thumb for me, I buy enough stock so that the div will be enough for at least 1 full stock of repurchase (DRIP).  in the case of MSFT and AAPL, I was short on cash so to get as close to my rule in 1 year of divs I'm able to purchase more than 1 full stock.",2021-02-15T01:11:10Z

Read some articles and look at the overall sentiment of Activision’s releases compared to prior years and you will clearly see a decline.

They’ve always had a very toxic frat boy type of workplace but this is the last straw for many people. A lot of gaming channels in the community announced there own boycott of the company and will no longer cover/review their titles (which has held true in the last few months). Also call of duty has been losing steam over the last few years with overall interest dying down, World of Warcraft has been on the decline, Overwatch as a casual game and esport has been on the decline, and the overall sentiment around Diablo 4 has been dropping since Blizzcon 2018 which demonstrated how tone deaf the company is when Diablo Immortal was announced sparking the “Don’t you guys have phones?!?” meme.

Amazon is investing so much money, that no competitor will ever be able to catch up.

Money is one of life's most powerful forces
To fulfill and sustain our Earthly need.
We work for it, spend it and waste it away
And sometimes we're the victim of greed.

When blessed by the powers of money and fame
We must stay rich in our giving, trust and love.
Meeting the needs of the less fortunate

 I was cured of an incurable pancreatic cancer that had metastasized to the lymph nodes.
 I am Pastor Dae-Kyung Kim from Korea.
 I have dreadful pancreatic cancer.
 One day I suddenly collapsed at dawn
 I was taken to the hospital.
 The doctors told me to prepare for the funeral.
 That I can't live anymore.
 I was declared dead in vain.
 But God gave me
 He performed a miracle of healing.
 With an earnest request, I once again underwent an MRI scan, CT scan, spinal cord test, radiographic test, and blood tumor test, and found that the cancer cells had completely disappeared.
 The doctors told me there was no way this was going to happen, and they said it was a miracle.
 I also gave up the 36 radiation treatments my doctor ordered.
 But it is medically impossible for me.
 A healing miracle appeared.
 I am only by the grace of Almighty God
 I was cured of cancer.
 I have also been given the gift of healing for the sick.
 Post my testimony on YouTube
 It testifies to the power of the living God.
 I want this fact to be spread around the world.
 testimonies in each language
 It was made into a short video within 2 or 3 minutes.
 I am so grateful
 to you through the comment section
 Let me tell you what I experienced.
 Clearly, God the Creator lives and
 He is in charge of human life and death.
 Only believe in Jesus Christ
 You will be saved and go to heaven.
 I am leaving this world,
 I want to meet you in heaven.
 Always be healthy and happy.

I know this is supposed to be for the general public and illustrates the company's growth, but what investors really care about is how MSFT will be poised to grow in the future. Maybe talk about prospects or competitive advantages or management. Finally, I think you need to take a step back in your valuation. 8T by 2030?! For reference, the US GDP was a little over 20T in 2020. Companies can't grow infinitely and large ones tend to revert back to the overall GDP growth rate.",2021-09-03T03:33:51Z

wYgOgEElr0Q,"Really wonderful video, once again! Thanks a lot for all the good work! Keep it up!

The fact that you did a video about MSFT around June last year give us some good perspective of what is behind of every stock price estimation and company valuation. It is a pure guess, and that is alright. We are all guessing here. 

Your´s is an educated guess, it has past performance data supporting it, but at the end of the day you are guessing how much is going to be the growth rate for the next 10 years, and that has a huge impact on your valuation and your expected return. I think the right question here is: What has happened from June 2020 to August 2021 that made you change your EBITDA and FCF growth estimate? 

In your previous video, after five years, growth rate turns a one digit percentage amount. In this one, you keep a two digit EBITDA and Cash growth percentage all the way till 2030. That´s the ultimate reason you end up with such a high price difference between the two analysis. 

Why to change the growht rate percentage so significantly after 2025? Does Microsoft´s performance during last year really justify keeping a 2 digit growth percentage from 2025 till 2030? Is the previous estimate was too conservative? Or is this last estimate too optimistic? 

Last year the stock was trading at 200 USD when you did the video, it was supposed to be 350 USD after 10 years,  and as of now we are at 300 USD. It was a ""meh"" on your video. Too expensive! Overpriced. Clearly, last year stock performance indicates that your previous estimate was too conservative. 

Will the future stock performance show us this 840 USD estimate is too optimistic? Or will it surpsie us once again? Only time will tell. 

At the end of the day, I think, the exact amounts or final price estimates are not so relevant. Microsoft is a hell of a company. Last 10 years performance is outstading, as you clearly show on your video (kudos to you for that) and they are checking every indicator. They keep growing Revenue, EBITDA, margins, Cash. Not too high CAPEX and repurchasing shares. What else do we want? :D. The same of everything but bigger? The same of everything but cheaper? Can that even be possible? 

They seem to be able to continue performing in the same way in the next years, and then slowly reduce the growth as they become more mature (one would think that they already should be on that post growth phase, as they are bigger than 2 Trillion now, but they keep surprising us).

So yeah, I might wait till next dip or the next big red day in Nasdaq, when everyone is freaking out about godknowswhat, and buy a few shares. Or knowing all this, we can keep waiting till the next big crash or 50% market correction, to get all the upside, and no downside, but nobody knows when that will happen.",2021-08-29T16:51:01Z

wYgOgEElr0Q,"Fantastic analysis, really great value and absolutely nothing to say there. 

Regarding the projections though I would feel to factor in a valuation contraction based on higher interest rates (which I reckon it could be a very likely scenario which would pull the stock prices down like gravity🙈) and also for a company so big already I feel it hard to believe they can keep on growing at this level for eternity.
I therefore feel to disagree with the future projections as I hardly believe in my modest opinion that they will be able to grow more than 10% in the next 5 years and even less possibly further down the line. 
I think as it stands now the risk/rewards are not there at all and the stock price is overvalued to me with a markt cap. of 2.2T; call me crazy but I will be only looking at it if it crashes 40%. 😊",2021-08-25T13:48:20Z

wYgOgEElr0Q,"I will take the Devil's Advocate position on MSFT.  First nothing wrong with Cameron's analysis, but no one has a crystal ball into the future.  I have owned MSFT since June 2011 and have done well with it.  I still own 160 of my original 250 shares.  One of the tenants of my investments is to recognize ""crowding"" in both the markets and in business.  So much investment is being put into IT and software that I am concerned that over investment into IT and software will hinder future returns.  I have no crystal ball either, but I sold 40 shares of MSFT this week.  MFST is in a highly competitive winner take all (most?) industry.  It has been performing at near perfection for several years, but I have serious doubt that it, or any company, can perform so remarkedly well for ever.  Given the current MSFT valuation and my concerns about industry over investment, I would have sold more if not for taxes.  Next year I would easily sell another 30-50 shares depending on the situation.",2021-08-19T15:56:55Z

wYgOgEElr0Q,Why don't you add Cash And Equivalents to Excess cash when you calculate EV?,2021-08-19T08:26:39Z
wYgOgEElr0Q,"Hello Cameron, 

one ""question"" about the FCFE-forecast. Do you do an integrated planning (PL/BS/CF) for the 10 years to come up with FCFE/share?

From my perspective it would make sense to especially forecast annual ""excess CF"" (meaning FCF after debt service and interest payments). This CF could be used annually to buy-back shares or pay down debt (in this scenario not relevant because 0 net debt). Of course you'd also have to forecast profits (to figure out how much buybacks are possible in every year if profit < ""excess CF""). Why do I think this makes sense? 

Because the FCFE/share gets an additional boost over the 10 y period, because buybacks reduce share-count and thus increase FCFE/share. Am I talking bullshit or does this make sense? 

Thanks again for your high-quality content. 

BR,
Chris",2021-08-19T06:00:57Z
wYgOgEElr0Q,Any reasons why ebitda growth is projected for 20% in the next couple of yrs when historically it grew at 12% and fcfe only at 8%?

wYgOgEElr0Q,"Excellent video, as usual. However, I have to disagree on the current value of MSFT. It is WAAAAY overpriced, and the assumptions way to optimistic. Why would I pay for any company that would take 25-26 yearsmto get my money back? Predicting 20% growth on a business that has now becoming a comodity and very clouded is way to optimistic. The main revenue source andmthe company's groth is cloud computing. Yes, it is steady, but also subject of very strong competition and possible recession fallout (companiesmthat go bankrupt or downsize will not buy/increase subscriptions). Windows is free unless companies want very expensive extended support. MSFT will not grow its sales nor profits the way they did in last 5-10 years. No way Jose. PE ration of 36+ is way to rich and too risky for me. I will wait for a correction. Having said that, I still appreciate your analysis of MSFT.  Grsst job Cameron. Thank you.",2021-08-18T21:36:41Z

wYgOgEElr0Q,"Great analysis as always, but I just think the projections are more optimistic that before.

I looked up the older video valuing Microsoft, the forecast is much more conservative and with a lower market multiple. The projected share price in 2029 was $356 in the older video, which is way lower than $839. For a company that is bigger than 2 Trillion, it hard to grow +15% for total of 10 years (making it 6.6 Trillion), isn't it better to forecast much more conservative estimate to lower the risk ?

The signal line also remained above the candles, suggesting that the price was moving lower. The Relative Strength Index affirmed a rise in selling pressure as it was dropping from the equilibrium zone and closer to the oversold zone. If the price didn’t hold at $393, it may continue its fall till $336. As  a crypto trader the past few weeks has recorded immerse benefits all round, my only regret now is not knowing Burwell Coleman on time, his top notch signals remains the bedrock of the successes recorded in my  personal trading portfolio.

Indeed its a tough decision for both old and newbies whose intensions are just to hodl and sell but rather the potentials of tradn Btc would allow you grow your Btc not minding the present price chart and also saving your ass from any future deep that may occur .

I really do appreciate the education in fundamental analysis Everything Money has shared but sometimes you need to see where the puck is going and not where it's been.

However, it might dip or trade sideways more likely after beginning of the year run up. What I am saying if I thought like these guys I would do a lot of waiting and investing in shitty undervalued companies. I made my money I don’t care but it bothers me when I see these YouTuber halfwits on all channels spew like they are Ray Dalio, it just hurts people and then they just disappear or ignore screwups.

Qe_SXoHKSsk,@ElCaro wtf are u even talking about. it's kinda clear to me. why would I research something when it's selling at 36x earnings with a 2.5T market cap. I'll wait till it comes down to a more reasonable price. If you genuinely think 5T is reasonable for a company in a decade then so be it. I can't lose on something if I don't invest in it.

Qe_SXoHKSsk,"@Kaden Weinheimer I love that line of thinking, and you are not alone. This whole channel can be summed up as snake oil salesman praised for amazing snake oil. Not researching a company but knowing its overvalued must be an amazing skill. Now notice I am not saying you are right or wrong I am just saying you have no idea if you are right or wrong. What you could say is that Microsoft's 4x growth over last 5 years will slow down but I am targeting 5T+ by 2030. Can you get better returns elsewhere? Sure. Will it be as stable as MSFT or APPL? No. There is so much that can be said but there are no real investors on this channel.",2021-12-31T01:25:57Z

Tengo desde la Xbox original,  hasta la One X, y jugando desde el ZX81,  ya ha llovido. Y esta situación no la he vivido nunca, quizás al principio de la Ps3 con el procesador de emulación, que voló el primer día, al menos en Londres. Es una estrategia de marketing,  pura y dura, para crear demanda y empujar la venta de la S, que a la mayoría no interesa. Es como comprar un PC con Netflix, sin poder reproducir discos.

3kEC8WJHGms,@Miguel ARG no digo lo contrario también encuentro que es una muy buena consola y el servicio de Game Pass excelente y económico.,2021-05-12T22:58:15Z
3kEC8WJHGms,Cuestión de gustos al fin y al cabo. XBOX es una buena consola para aquellos que les molen servicios como el GamePass,2021-05-12T20:51:52Z
3kEC8WJHGms,"@Emir Medrano No soy una persona que dice lo que el otro quiere escuchar para hacerlo sentir bien, soy una persona que le gusta hacer lo correcto aunque incómoda, yo en ningún momento e desvalorado el Game Pass como servicio, tiene mucho juegos y como dices juegos día uno pero es un complemento para un gamer y no lo es todo, si eres un gamer sabes que es una pasión que cuesta dinero, no todo el mundo lo puede financiar y es una pena pero es la verdad, si no tienes dinero y solo te quedas con el Game Pass porque es conveniente estás tomando el jugar como algo casual dónde lo demás en juegos solo lo experiencias por noticias o porque vez a alguien jugar eso es muy relajado y demuestra que para ti no tiene tanta importancia que día uno disfrutes de los nuevos títulos que van apareciendo.
Por otra parte el comprar juegos, servicios o una consola también ayuda a qué se hagan más juegos, principalmente comprar juegos donde el desarrollador se lleva una mayor ganancia eso un gamer lo tiene claro.
No te sientas mal con la verdad, las cosas son como son y en algún momento cuando crezcas y ganes tu propio dinero podrás comprarte todo lo que quieras y ser tan activo como jugador como lo deseas, yo por ejemplo trabajo por turnos de 7x7 así que me hago tiempo para jugar.",2021-05-12T18:03:31Z
3kEC8WJHGms,"@Emir Medrano no estoy diciendo lo contrario de lo que opinas en tu comentario y no me confundo, si eres gamer te importa un pepino las plataformas lo único que importa es donde está el juego que quieres jugar porque una vez que parte el juego no importa el control que tengas en la mano por eso depender de un servicio como único factor para jugar es de casual, por más que digas verdades como los títulos que salen día uno, no tiene nada que ver con qué este mes el Game Pass no tiene novedad y por lo tanto para cualquier gamer su importancia sería baja y este mes tendrías que meter la mano en el bolsillo y comprar juegos, si no puedes comprar bueno lamentablemente no eres gamer porque no estás atento a la actualidad con la experiencia de juegos.
Las cosas como son, por más bueno que sea el servicio Game Pass no puedes depender de el para tener lo mejor que sale todos los meses.",2021-05-12T16:33:49Z
3kEC8WJHGms,"@Emir Medrano para mí los gamer son los que compran consolas de salida, se interesan por jugar los juegos cuando apenas salen a la venta, no se limitan a una sola plataforma y están pendientes de noticias de los video juegos, no voy hablar de los que se dedican profesionalmente a los juegos.
Pero por eso depender de un servicio es más casual porque aunque tengan muchos juegos en general no juegas lo más actual, por ejemplo ahora un gamer estaría jugando RE8 y Returnal como prioridad por ser novedad y son juegos que el servicio Game Pass no tiene, de hecho ningún servicio los tiene.
No encuentro para nada negativo ser un jugador casual que solo use un excelente servicio como Game Pass porque tienen muchos juegos estupendos pero no son early adapters (entusiastas en comprar lo nuevo) y como el profesor mostró en unos vídeos atrás el jugador de Xbox compra muy pocos juegos de salida en comparación con los de Playstation que como no tienen grandes servicios entonces sus jugadores se acostumbran a comprar juegos de salida en mayor cantidad.",2021-05-12T07:29:26Z

Ademas eso es patetico por que tu hablas del empaquetado interior. Y ese solo puede verlo quien compró el producto. No lo ves en la estanteria ni eso significa el 0.00000000000001 de la razon por la que comprarias una consola. Si aqui en usa todo mundo tiras las cajas,2021-05-16T20:28:57Z

Y la mayoría de youtubers juegan con las funciones del dualsense desactivadas o con el mando conectado, así que ya me dirás para el sirve tanta tecnología si tienes que desactivarla para jugar más de 6 horas sin cargar el mando.

3kEC8WJHGms,@Carlos Calderón el quick resume tambien hace que no ocupas guardar partida solo lo apagas y lo vuelves a prender y en 5 segundos ya estas en donde lo dejaste y los juegos se guardan por semanas pues yo estoy jugando dragon quest 9 y me entran ganas de jugar crash ctr solo lo cambio y ya esta en el menu XD creeme que amaras el quick resume,2021-05-12T00:05:25Z
3kEC8WJHGms,"@El Nublado Clon lo que comento es en base a mi experiencia, en mi caso cuando juego algo, suelo hacerlo durante sesiones bastante largas, no ando pasando de un juego a otro a cada rato, quizá estoy acostumbrado a jugar de esa manera porque nunca ha habido quick resume sino hasta ahora, ya veremos si en el futuro cambia mi hábito al jugar y el habito de la mayoría de jugadores que también juegan sesiones largas de un solo juego.",2021-05-11T22:03:56Z

3kEC8WJHGms,"@Carlos Calderón Aun con juegos single player es algo útil. El poder pasar de jugar algo como Ori o un Dark souls o un Fifa a otro juego para reanudar su campaña es un regalazo (no estoy enterado de la lista completa de juegos que lo admiten pero vamos, que sigue pudiendo tener mucha utilidad)",2021-05-11T21:03:07Z

3kEC8WJHGms,Curiosidad sin malicia. Dijiste que no ibas a comprar ninguna consola de lanzamiento porque no aportaban nada. ¿Qué ha cambiado hoy? ¿El The Medium? ¿El RE Village que es third-party?,2021-05-11T19:09:08Z
3kEC8WJHGms,"Si, si lo he visto y entiendo que ha sido un poco por hacer ""renove"" de las antiguas Xbox en su trabajo. Pero no se, eso se podía haber hecho también antes y quería saber si había algún motivo extra, porque no es ninguna novedad con respecto al lanzamiento. Ese era mi punto. Que no hay mucho de diferente en estos 6 meses en Series X. Supongo que ha tenido mucho que ver la escasez y que más vale pájaro en mano.",2021-05-12T07:57:22Z
3kEC8WJHGms,Hace mucho tiempo hizo un vídeo explicando porque se iba comprar un xbox y no un ps5 . Ya se lo compro ahora quién sabe si se compre el ps5,2021-05-11T20:17:36Z

I only just found something that I like, that's actually what better than this software, for less money. I'm still reviewing it to be sure though. 

 Their software does work and their valuation is their opinion. I just think they're clueless, like you said, about tech companies. Microsoft is God tier levels of performance. I mean, the boy just prints. Margins, yoy, qoq, I mean, just wow. But on the software front? If you've got good recommendations, I'd love to hear it.

I believe Jim Cramer recently characterized Microsoft as ""...a company like no other"", and I agree with him 100%. I am perfectly comfortable paying a premium for quality and almost certain growth. As far as I'm concerned, though I'm not going to add to my positions at this level, I'm definitely comfortable holding.

Guys, they don’t even factor in Equity Risks, 10 year treasury spreads, working capital deductions, deferred tax assests & liabilities, etc. And you are waiting for it to drop to $800 B. 😂😂.

However, when Paul is saying crash he means it the same way in more loose general speaking terms such as when people say, money, alpha or gains.

I have one question that has been confusing me a lot: when comparing the numbers on your software (e.g. revenue, net income, free cash flow) to the numbers on yahoo finance, seeking alpha, morning star I find, that these numbers do not match up. The tendency is always right but they're not the exact same. It cannot be because of rounding etc. the gaps are too big. 
Shouldn't the numbers on your software be the exact same as the ones on other websites? Am I doing something wrong?

And this is perfectly aligned with their Azure business segment, both leveraging their growing global datacenter infrastructure. They're nipping at the heels of AWS and I would not be surprised if they eventually overtake them.

Back then MSFT had EV/EBITDA = ~50 and P/E= ~75, currently those figures are much lower even after their expansion due to the transition to the subscription based revenue model not one time unit sales, the same story as with Adobe 

Plus the interest rates back then were ~5%, not 0% and unlimited money printing as it is right now 

These are like two completely different universes and he still wants to apply 20 P/E for every company regarding its industry, business model, and the current economic environment

BNFeQY2j520,"Shot in the dark, but a serious question - Do you need programmers to build or further develop the everything money app? I have quite a bit of experience with this sort of stuff. Myself and another programmer built a python / django web-based framework that could construct portfolios with various methodologies and rules, selecting an investment universe of shares by country/region/exchange, estimating expected returns or other signals through some sort of regression model, further filtering out the universe based on econometric data, setting constraints, and applying all sorts of weighting methodology. Basically rules-based investing with a tonne of options to construct your portfolio , e.g. for all US listed tickers, estimate a set of expected returns using whatever methodology you like, filter out the worst 25% expected returns, filter out everything that isn't ""value"", and then apply risk-parity (or inverse vol or prop-weighted, etc) to the remainder and produce a set of weights for the month. You could then backtest the portfolio and run it going forward. The app would also take daily and monthly stock data from csv's produced via Bloomberg and do all sorts of data transformations and inferences, so that one could use this to produce live portfolios. 

I've also been heavily involved in another app which takes a more top down approach to investing, you upload indices and funds and with these you can produce returns or holdings-based attributions of portfolios, you can do an investing style analysis if you have the holdings of the portfolios and see how much you are better on various sectors or by investing styles (e.g. value vs momentum), you can also drawing a 3D feasible set based on a set of uploaded indices and funds and vary how the set was constructed (e.g. does risk concern you or are you actually concerned about tracking error) as well as reporting various risk metrics. Essentially, a tool for multi-fund managers to decide to how allocate ""best"". It's a very cool app if I don't say so myself. This baby was built in R, which produces very cool graphs and has a lot of useful statistical functions, but not great for a web-based app to be bluntly honest - R is a language built by statisticians and not programmers! However, it runs and is used by (a few) people to allocate money IRL, so hopefully I can toot my horn a little here.

Anyway, I have 1 to 1.5 days free a week and I could always do with a bit more 'free cash flow', ""financial programming"" is my niche, I like the channel, I like what ya'all are doing - I think I could help enhance your Everything Money app. Is your dev team full / are you even looking to hire remote part-time?",2021-06-24T18:44:10Z

The reversal was imminent because obviously, the Bitcoin market needed a correction to gather the right momentum to give the bulls more steam and this just makes it the perfect time to invest and accumulate as much as possible.

6027wWyAm_Y,"I think there's a huge chunk of the picture missing. Cult45's feud with Jeff Bezos due to his (Bezos) owning the Washington Post (which had written scathing articles critical of Cult45), demanded that the government and Department of Defense drop AWS (Amazon Web Services) for their cloud computing upgrade services.

This was a huge scandal and pretty sure against the law for a sitting President to leverage his federal power just to settle personal vendettas in breach of government contracts.

So, Uncle Sam's contracts with AWS were rescinded (Bezos sued Cult45 and the USG for this). So what other alternative is there? Why, Microsoft, of course.

Anyone with a brain would've seen the writing on the wall and sure enough, government contracts went to Microsoft for their cloud computing services.

I wouldn't call this insider trading so much as it was publicly known and that it was a direct result of Cult45's holding grudges and abusing his official government position to settle personal scores.",2021-05-03T06:19:25Z

Yeah, I guess so, but pretending that the head of a successful venture capitalist firm does not have connections in Microsoft on his own is also a little bit naive. There is simply nothing to criticize here. I'm guessing that her husband makes dozens, if not hundreds of stock trades everyday. I'm sure if you dug into any of them, you could find a reason to be suspicious. Is it because Nancy Pelosi tipped him off, or is it because her husband's own sources tired him off? The fact is, as long as the family of a politician is trading and investing in stocks, you could always find something suspicious. There's no point to this guessing game. We need to reform the laws on politicians and their families trading, but I'm also not sure how that could work. Like is her husband not allowed to trade? Is he not allowed to be a venture capitalist? What about her children? What about her cousins? Nieces and nephews? I'm sure there are solutions that go beyond what my non-politician and non-business mind can come up with, but I don't know what they are.

First, I would like to see your sources.

Second, 
Summary of Uranium One ""Scandal""

- Canadian company Uranium One sells controlling interest to state-owned Russian company Rusatom.
- Due to the fact that Uranium One mines uranium in the US among others, the sale has to be approved by CFIUS.
- CFIUS is a nine-department commission headed by the Treasury Department. Other departments include Defense, Homeland Security, 
Justice, State and Energy among others.
- Then-Assistant Secretary of State Jose Fernandez was the State Department representative on CFIUS.
- The sale is approved by CFIUS, and a recommendation is sent to the President.
- The President, on CFIUS' recommendation, does not veto the sale. Veto from the President has happened before.
- Congress does not veto the sale. Veto from Congress has happened before.
- Supreme Court does not veto the sale. Veto from the Supreme Court has happened before.
- The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission issues the necessary permits. Permits has been withheld before.
- Independent watch dog organisations does not raise questions about the sale. Questions has been raised before.
- The sale is accepted, on the condition that no uranium mined in the US (about 20% of US' production capacity of uranium) can leave 
the US and must remain under US control.

Conclusion: The statement; ""Hillary sold 20% of US' uranium to Russia"" is almost ENTIRELY FALSE, and makes anybody who utters it look 
like a dumbass.",2021-05-03T06:46:30Z

Lawmakers shouldn’t be allowed to play the stock market, I wouldn’t even allow a blind trust if it were up to me.

The point is, her (and her husband) are buying and trading 10’s of millions of dollars worth of stocks while David pretends that’s impossible because she’s only ‘worth 5 million.’ He literally said, idk where they got that number from.

He refuses to speak bad on any Democrats, even when deserved. He just pretended that Nancy has a net worth of 5 million. I’ve researched for 30 mins and I have absolutely NO IDEA where he got that number from. He is literally the definition of a shill. She’s worth an estimated $114 million, according to her OWN 2018 personal financial disclosure. This is something David has started doing more and more often, so I call him out. Am I not allowed to?

That’s a legit argument to be made.

But he’s still voiced support for any possibility of bipartisanship being possible.  If you could do anything other then create unfaithful arguments while pretending to understand liberal talking points, maybe you’d understand.

Investor who bought early are still in profit despite the recent price crash and they also earn by trading  I'm still an investor and still I'm winning by applying the same method in every trade you can also become a winner today. we should follow the way of earning more regardless of the current market (bulls or bears ), which is trading. buy the dip and trader ....I have made over 5 btc profit not just buying the dip but implementing tradess with s!gnals supplied by Walter Smith . you can easily get to him on =at w°h°a°t°s°A°P°P[]

p99VQQrYU8g,"Companies with 18 P/E are usually companies with almost no future growth. So the “high assumption” Paul has, is that in 7 years MSFT will have almost no growth. That’s pretty pessimistic for a “high assumption”. This ignores high growth opportunities in Cloud, emerging markets like Asia and Latin America. One has to look at the actual business before asserting that growth will stagnate. 

And if that day ever came where MSFT revenue growth slowed down that much, their management team will divert their Billions in cash flow from R&D to stock buy backs, at a much higher rate than Paul estimates. We’ve seen this happen with other tech companies like HP. When growth slows, the buybacks accelerate. Which keeps the per share metrics and stock price growing higher. Remember, CEOs get compensated mainly based on stock price performance.",2021-08-05T18:23:22Z

p8kSjuNqQO4,"Palantir would not be involved in developing the s/w for the VR systems,  that would be left up to Microsoft, MVIS and others.  However, the data being
formulated and the mapping of the battlefield, along with target id and selection, would definitely be a product of the systems Palantir is operating.

It's interesting that google refused to support the DoD on Project Maven so Microsoft and Palantir stepped in to do the job.  When push comes to shove, 
it's nice to know who fights for our side and who decided to support the communist Chinese instead of the elements of the U.S. government tasked with 
protecting the homeland and the country's interests abroad.

Microsoft and Palantir would make a fantastic team driving the JEDI project which Microsoft just won over Amazon.  Defending the nation should never be
considered controversial.  The controversial part is that there are mega corporations who have made their fortunes in this country that would put the interests of 
the our competitors, i'd dare say enemies, ahead of those of the United State's.  THAT is by far the most controversial part of the entire matter.",2021-04-02T02:12:49Z

The Nasdaq and small caps led the way, but both needed to the take another big step. Thursday's premarket action was positive.

Bitcoin moving up is inevitable and would see the price of bitcoin surpass it's all-time highs. The reversal was imminent because obviously, the bitcoin market needed a correction to gather the right momentum to give the bulls more steam and this just makes it the perfect time to invest and accumulate as much as possible.  I'd strongly advise any newbie/traders to buy the dip for traders who are still wondering to enter the market or old time traders who are Holders to seek help from not just any trader but an established trading expert with at least 89% trade accuracy. I underwent series of trading loses I'd best not talk about before I was introduced to trading analyst Dr Teller Blinkeen . My contact with him has been the Hallmark of this year for me, under his careful guide and his signal service I've been able to recover my losses and even grow my trading portfolio massively from 1.2 btc to 4.6 btc in just 5 weeks. I will advice traders especially  newbies to have orientation of trading before they involve in it. Dr Teller  makes you learn daily while you make profit with his signals. He can be contacted via what's app :+44-7868-80-6884 and  Telegram @ Teller_keen for more Inquires and more profitable Trading System .",2021-07-15T09:05:14Z

1g4WaQXfyvo,"if u didn't go all in on NVDA because ""PE is High"" that would have prevented you from investing in the past as this stock has always had a ""high PE"" so was Amazon back in 2014 lol , PE is an irrelevant metric imo when valuing a hyper growth story into the future. I remember all the fundamentalist bashing TSLA, AMZN, back in the day due to the same reasons XD.  NVDA is number 1 in its field for a reason and it has a cult like following for a reason which will only get bigger from here. u see people already hoarding massive amounts of GPUs like its some kind of diamond collection.",2021-12-19T20:37:14Z

DCF may be a good tool for new companies but it may not work on reputable companies such as COKE, MSFT, APPLE. I don’t know how long we will have to wait in order to drop to $200 level.

2j42Bp9FoSk,Isn't the DCF from 2021 to 2024 rather low especially when the debt of MSFT is approx 65 bil on average over the past 6 years? adding it to the DCF calculation will conclude with a higher fair value,2021-05-29T12:11:59Z

One question remains:
If net debt is negative, do you write it down as negative or just 0? For EA I get 177 with 0 net debt as Jimmy, but if I add - 4.5b or so then its higher. But for AAPL Jimmy used their negative debt of 95b to get 118 fv (same for me).",2021-05-27T16:10:57Z

2j42Bp9FoSk,I wonder at what point MSFT was ever considered 'fair' or 'under' valued?  I'd rather not wait for some sort of financial catastrophe to try and time things perfectly.  Much better option is to dollar cost average over time.  Also great for dividend investors...my yield on cost is well over 5% and I started investing in MSFT during the height of the dotcom bubble!,2021-05-27T14:19:35Z

2j42Bp9FoSk,@Jake Artis This'll blow your mind (at least it did mine!)  I looked at my very 1st purchase of MSFT which was way back in late 1995.  My yield on those shares today is a brain-popping 40%!  Pity is was such a small position,2021-05-28T17:33:03Z
2j42Bp9FoSk,@Andrew Eber I definitely missed a good opportunity but my 0.77% yeild after tax should someday balloon into something greater. Last 10 years has seen that dividend 3.5x along with share appreciation. Been investing in their partner Avepoint in hope one day they'll pay a dividend or just give some decent returns,2021-05-28T15:08:32Z
2j42Bp9FoSk,"@Jake Artis Meh.  Believe it or not, my yield isn't particularly impressive.  A purchase of MSFT just 5 years ago would still generate a yield today of about 4.3%.",2021-05-28T15:03:46Z
2j42Bp9FoSk,Couldn't agree more. I personally believe if you was to buy one MSFT share a month then you'll be alright in 10 years time. Also wow on that yeild!,2021-05-28T11:58:10Z

I've been into trading for quite a while now, and I must say it really goes with loss without the right approach and strategy. I have gotten to the point where I understand that strategy is a key element of a long term successful trading. You can keep making wins at the beginning of a period and later you start recording losses toward the end of the trading period or even halfway. This results from little or no attention to the need for sustenance and consistency with the prevailing market structure. I've earned impressive profits so far this month trading with Mr. Ramesh Vijay  strategies and working with his trading signals and I do that through his registered trading investment company. You may never find it easy trading on your own. If you are tired of losing so much money, I recommend him.

According to Famous Stock analyst Dr Rodrick Jonathan The culprit behind the sell-off last week was the rapid rise in bond yield,   He warns new stock buyers to be careful as the picture is not clear yet and for now you can only make profit by trading your stock with a strategy instead of panic selling, for me i advice you to multiply the little you have with Rodrick's strategy, i was able to make $60,000 with $10,000 in 3 weeks with his stock trading strategy, reach him  on telegram Rodrickjonathan orWhatsApp+1(66O)474-OO3O,  if you want to sleep well at night and still make money.",2021-03-09T00:03:10Z

While Microsoft had a vulnerability, the reality is, you’ll never 100% be protected. The only way to help mitigate is to ensure you update your systems, create security protocols, and ensure you’re on the latest update. 

The problem is also when dev’s are creating applications, security is not always the #1 thing in mind. (See NetworkChuck’s response on this).",2021-03-09T00:10:42Z

jMde9kICuF8,"The biggest challenges investors face can range from controlling the impulsiveness to the frailty of compulsion. Anyways investing in bitcoin  is the best way to make earnings due to the recent outbreak. Sometimes when we have that specific money that we want to invest in a particular thing, we always lose focus and then invest or spend the money wrongly. One reason you need to invest in crypto and its technology is because; crypto is changing the economy shape of any nation that approaches the technology and that way being an early adopter gives you an edge over others that will buy into it late. While looking at the growth rate of cryptocurrency and the opportunity it presents, why not look into it and have a rethink about the particular investment you wish to make now. Day trading is one of the easiest way to earn good money but it need a lot of your time to analyze the trend of the market and make the right decision according to that trend, Get an expert like Dr Bruce Olsen  whose daily signals and strategy is top-notch. With his strategy and daily signals, i was able to grow my portfolio from 1.1btc to 9.3BTC which you can agree is a great profits.

26bZNftY46g,"Chainlink can be expected to stabilize at $36.6 or at $35.2 before resuming its upward trajectory. Augur projected rangebound behavior, while Enjin C0in was tipped to break up from a falling wedge. With year-to-date returns of 215%, Chainlink has been a solid performer in 2021 so far. The pr!ce has been particularly bullish since end-March and a breakout from a symmetrical shape boosted the pr!ce to a new ATH slightly above $38. The RSI reversed direction from the overbought zone and suggested some stability for LINK, before the next upswing. This could take place at the support level of $36.6 or at $35.2. The Squeeze Momentum Indicator highlighted a strong bullish market with high volatility. Post the minor dip, LINK’s uptrend would likely see levels above $45 in the coming weeks.

Yep, I bought a ton on the dip.   It's getting cheaper relative to its current earnings (half compared to last year). 
...With the Delta virus coming at full speed ahead, pandemic sales will make a comeback.

Amazon's not going anywhere so I know that eventually it will come back.    
Fidelity considers Amazon as a large growth company (probably because as big as it is, it still only has 7% of the retail market)

-4kITyqjuKM,"📉Most people don't understand the concept of ""buying the dip"" buying the dip is all about buying digital assets when their prices are down and selling off when the price rises. Holding is profitable, although trading is far more profitable. I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypto assets early enough, but i was still limited due to my lack of technical understanding of how to analyse the digital market, all that changed when i encountered Jayson Brian services., although i have been into numerous services but Ivan wright  stands out with experience and expertise playing in his favour.

7UEnvCoGa1w,The intrinsic value for oracle is 55.00…. But based on the 8 pillar model i bought the dip in the 60s …. I bought it to hedge some cash in my taxable account rather than sit in savings,2021-07-24T12:22:03Z
7UEnvCoGa1w,"Our company just rolled out a cloud based oracle product across 20+ subsidiaries. I couldn't buy it to be honest.
The software is originally from an acquisition they made in 2014. And they have made NO new features to the product. They just reskinned it and offered it as a cloud service.

I'm obviously biased but I just can't - it has been an awful experience.",2021-07-18T21:40:41Z
7UEnvCoGa1w,I believe Oracle is struggling in the cloud race.,2021-07-06T03:23:37Z
7UEnvCoGa1w,"I think you really need to revise your 8 pillars. Based on your analysis, oracle is worth a buy.  I will say a straight no! Their total debt is double their yearly revenue. I do not think anyone should buy a company like that. This might be something you also want to add to your pillars",2021-06-27T07:53:22Z
7UEnvCoGa1w,Can you guys do UPS,2021-06-25T01:03:30Z
7UEnvCoGa1w,I'm working for a tech corporate that uses its products. Oracle is very expensive and more and more companies like ours are turning to open source software because it's free and high performance like postgres or cassandra.,2021-06-19T18:56:55Z

1)There is a question presented in the title which is NOT answered, is ORCL a better buy than MSFT? (clickbait)

2) 8:18 ""Doctor Mo"" noticed a gap down around March in 2020 just when the Western world realized Covid 19 was not just an Asian thing but he  ""assumes"" it may have been a bad earnings report,  rolf really? and Paul doesn't say anything? (Doctor Mo deserves a beating for that comment in the same way as Paul has been doing commenting on other youtube videos on mostly deserving other YT folk) so keep the honor to yourselves and make your own critical video about this episode

7UEnvCoGa1w,I took a look at it and I think the long term debt is increasing.,2021-05-20T18:25:39Z
7UEnvCoGa1w,"They bought Java and messed it up with all the licensing etc. All the major companies are either migrating away from Oracle's JDK to OpenJDK or migrating away from Java entirely (Android -> Kotlin for example). Also their database might still be the most popular relational DB but the trend in big tech companies (which are usually the ones that can afford to pay for their DB, the others can just use a free one like Postgres or MariaDB) is to migrate to more scalable database solutions. I can't argue about the financials as I don't have enough experience there but as a software engineer, Oracle's future doesn't look bright to me. Not saying it will disappear or anything like that of course but it doesn't look good to me, especially compared to the likes of Microsoft, Apple, Google etc, which might already be huge but they keep innovating",2021-05-17T10:17:13Z

I'm already anti-IP, but to say that the way people write and use code is proprietary, is a huge no for me. They aren't growing well, so they want to generate revenue by having people pay them for something people already do for free and fair use. I won't invest in companies that do business like this, no matter how good they look or how much money they might make me. Oracle is a no for me.",2021-05-15T15:09:32Z

It’s 2020 10-K reports FCF of $11.6 billion while the share repurchases cost $19.2 billion (BTW- this doesn’t appear to reconcile to what is on your screen and would be interested to understand the difference if you have a moment). Sales from marketable securities helped offset the difference. Unfortunately, the most recent 8-K also shows that over the past 6 months repurchases are outpacing FCF by approximately $2.3 billion.

sYitg0EK5Xw,@Jill Kaluza Personally think it isn't worth worrying about inflation. Paysafe has a lot of control on the fees it can charge and with optimization can reduce costs. It's worth noting it's trading at such a low multiple compared to its peers then it has more upside then downside in my eyes,2021-05-24T15:18:35Z

TSLA is at the beginning of its S curve, so there’s more room for exponential growth.  TSLA is disrupting 2 of the top 3 industries when it pertains to market cap.  MSFT is a mature company that will yield you modest returns compared to what TSLA can/will yield.

smMV1omWFWE,You need to ban the bots who appear in your Comments section. This will affect your credibility.,2021-05-27T09:23:24Z
smMV1omWFWE,I would like to know what Charlie Aitken thinks about Palantir (PLTR) and Draftking (DKNG).,2021-05-27T07:56:45Z
smMV1omWFWE,There. are many alternatives to M$ products.,2021-05-27T07:54:29Z

0y1tWXBe2_8,If,2021-10-24T21:43:12Z
0y1tWXBe2_8,I’d rather buy PLTR directly than buy ARK ETF. ARK has a lot of dangerously overvalued unprofitable companies (yes I realise PLTR is also unprofitable but I’m more confident in PLTR than some of the junk in ARK).,2021-10-24T11:45:17Z

0y1tWXBe2_8,Thanks for info,2021-10-22T17:00:59Z
0y1tWXBe2_8,Fantastic!,2021-10-22T15:34:34Z
0y1tWXBe2_8,Got plenty of PLTR & AMZN. Both are going to keep growing. Most of the world including retail traders I think still don't understand that Amazon isn't just an online retailer. They've got around 20 major divisions many of which are still in early growth stages but going to pay off in the next couple of years and Wed Services is hugely profitable and still growing. Plus of course the whole load of Prime members that signed up during lockdowns will mostly stay. Many of them weren't big online shoppers before but now Amazon will be a regular option for them so even gloomy outlooks on their retail performance is overblown.  Palantir is growing really nicely and I think they're underestimating the impact large sales teams will have because they lack experience with them. I'm sure they're also working on other products/services or just adding to their existing platforms making them even better which will only ever increase contract size and longevity.,2021-10-22T13:52:50Z
0y1tWXBe2_8,Great company will be huge in the future,2021-10-22T09:29:27Z

lOCc4LKB9_E,Your analysis would be better if you could more clearly outline how Windows 11 makes money for MSFT. They're releasing it for free. Are they going to sell analytics off of it? How exactly does 11 tie into their Cloud services? Or will it boost their Office 365 offerings? One illustrative example. In this very video you're using Google Sheets which is basically Excel but free. Why would people pay for Office when they can get the same services for free?,2021-11-01T21:38:33Z
lOCc4LKB9_E,"I feel dumb here, but I can't figure out where to trade fractional shares on the desktop version of Webull.

I selected Market, but I still don't see an option.",2021-10-05T18:57:01Z
lOCc4LKB9_E,"Windows 11 sure gonna be a fluke. The Office package is outdated, and Google's suite is way better in every way.

lOCc4LKB9_E,"Yeah ... tablets may not seem like much to the average consumer, but it is big business. Many (large) companies (e.g. the one I work for, an oil and gas company) have locations where site workers will use tablets to do things like maintenance checks, daily run-downs etc. ... all that data is uploaded from the tablets while workers do their daily rounds into the sites/company's cloud system. That data is then analysed (through AI etc.) and helps feed into maintenance schedules etc. etc. etc.

It is quite amazing how over the past 5 years or so cloud-based solutions and mobile devices have completely changed and streamlined work processes ... I'm not saying we use Microsoft tablets, but they are Windows devices 100%.",2021-10-01T13:03:07Z

xL99LSoCLdk,"Here’s the issue I have with this being a buying opportunity.  Robinhood is limiting more and more securities.  Good example.  Amd had a blow out quarter, but yet Robinhood has added it to its limited list of securities.  Being that there is a tremendous amount of Robinhood accounts and no one can buy, how is that stock suppose to go up?  Will they limit Apple next? This leads to uncertainty.  Let me explain how this ends.  Eventually at some point you run out of Buyers, and that will happen.  There will be a lot of bag holders caught at the top. A lot of there bag holders will be on margin accounts... be it on Robin Hood or wherever.  When it does crack stocks go down harder than they go up.  These bag holders (a lot of them) will get margin called.  Prices will drop so fast there will be no buyers to catch it.  ( we call that price gap).  And when you get Margin called and there are no buyers... guess what you may owe your broker money.  Now imagine something like Robinhood having 2 million margin calls with no buyers and now Robinhood is on the hook because they have to actually go collect millions and possibly 100s of millions of dollars from accounts that for margin called and couldn’t get out.  Do you think these people will have the money to pay back Robinhood? Well.. what happens now? Robinhood goes belly up, sends a shockwave through the financial system Bc Robinhood has no money to pay people Bc they had too many margin accounts stuffed all into 1 stock.  Resulting effect mass sell offs and uncertainty across the board.  I real sh^^ fest. Anyway this is only my theory and I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, just my opinion and idea.",2021-01-30T17:21:00Z

xL99LSoCLdk,Hi investor channel! I know this is little bit boring to talk but would you please take an episode to discuss the company Energy Transfer (ticker ET)? I have a large amount of holding of this stock as one of my dividend income stocks but I am worrying about the debt of it that are going to keep the stock price even lower and cut the dividend further. Could you share your view on this whether it is still worth to hold for dividend (long term) or should I go for any other dividend stocks? Thanks 🙏,2021-01-30T15:36:00Z

Definitely overdid it but I really think it is way undervalued here.  Short term target of $285 and 1 year target of $410.,2021-01-30T03:45:59Z

xL99LSoCLdk,"EV needs infrastructure.  First on the agenda is power generation for charging.  If every household in the US that have 2 cars is replaced with 2 EV, where is the power infrastructure?   It is not just the power plant, but the power lines, switches and transformers plus home wiring needed to meet this power need.  Faster charging requires heavier power lines and home wiring.  Add to this commercial fleets of trucks, vans, buses and etc.  Every 5 to 10 years the entire battery pack must be replaced.  Lead acid batteries are recycled.  Lithium batteries contain flammable metals and electrolytes.  Needs special storage and handling.  Current cars contain about 100 pounds of copper.  EV need about 800 lbs of copper.  Do we have the copper mines and refineries to meet EV demands.  Lithium is a rare metal.  Do we have enough lithium mines and refineries?    Electric motors use rare earth magnets.  Do we have enough mines and refineries for such materials?  Today our power grid is struggling to meet population growth and energy needs of a digital society.

SO2TTVbxSKU,The situation at the ports in California will be this way for the foreseeable future. The democratic socialist party passed AB-5 which has banned owner operator truck drivers from working at the ports. A majority of truck drivers are owner operator business so thank the unions for screwing over the economy to line their own pockets. In additional climate change activists got the democratic socialist party to again ban any truck manufactured before 2010 banned from operating in the state. Since most trucks last like 50 years and costs over 6 figures the democratic socialist party has created a shortage in trucking. People voted for these people in office so enjoy what ya get in return. Massive inflation and shortages.,2021-10-16T16:45:17Z

I started with 2 BTC and I have accumulated over 5.5 BTC in just 4weeks, with the right trading strategy given to me by an expert trader Mr Tony..

We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps, narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. This is the worst possible time in history  to invest as so many don't back up their  crypto assets.

Unlike (say) Adobe, it seems that its core business is limited to large enterprises (a smaller pond in which to fish), at least from what I can see on its website. I need to do more research, but if is a business that is able to cater across business sizes (employees etc) then yes, I can see it has terrific upside.

Qp-zPHdbKNI,"most experienced traders like myself would rather learn proper skills to analyze price charts in making our own trading decisions, but many traders out there especially amateur traders still wonder if they can really fast-track their trading success using Signal Services only, now don't get me wrong signals are great, especially if you find the right one, but it is also smart if traders could be able to positively and accurately analyze price charts and make good trade results. if we closely have a look at some of the main reasons why people fail to make money from investing/trading online. whether it is stock trading, binary options, forex or cryptocurrencies, you will find out that the problem lies on traders being lazy and depending too much on signal services and also lack understanding of trading before going into it. so to be on the safe side it is best that traders, especially those still learning and practicing how to trade should know these tips first before entering into any online investment scheme: 1.Use a signalling service. ... 2.Learn to use technical indicators. ... 3.Trade stocks before trading binary options. ... 4.Track your performance in each trade option security. ... 5.Buy the right option length for your trading style. for more tips and trading strategies that can get you $20k-$40k per month kindly get in touch with me by mail as i am ready to show interested traders, both newbies, pros and amateurs how to trade confidently and make good profits using strategies that fetches $20-$40k per month.

ppclLLrAfAU,Gcam sucks in microsoft device make sense,2021-07-31T09:32:47Z
ppclLLrAfAU,Gcan works on my Oppo Find X2 pro better than the stock one. But I have one problem with it though. Pictures are so detailed that you think some magnification is going on. I love it on object but not on human body.  You can even count the facial hair. I have all the HDR settings working. Night sights work as well,2021-07-30T23:40:55Z
ppclLLrAfAU,"By looking at these shots we can see that HDR+ only worked on the portrait shots, that's why GCam wasn't better than the stock camera overall. Let's hope the Devs are eventually able to port it properly to the Surface Duo. If Night Sight were working it would've made a huge difference both in good and low light.

Oh and btw for HDR+ Enhanced to work you can simply turn the flash on (even on good light,) because it necessarily requires HDR+ Enhanced to work. Not sure if this workaround will actually work for the Surface Duo though, of course.",2021-07-30T16:42:11Z
ppclLLrAfAU,I think details wise the stock cam seems better.,2021-07-30T14:23:09Z
ppclLLrAfAU,Seems pretty back and forth between the two cameras apps. Overall I prefer the stock one. It seems to show more detail and has better contrast. The gcam seems to be better at maintaining highlights from being blown out.,2021-07-30T13:49:52Z

WerZ4U3VgA4,"<The recent bitcoin correction down fall has had the market in a panic. However, not everyone has seen it as a bad omen. The digital asset’s price had gone down below $60,000 causing investors to believe the bear market has arrived. Most investors has been hit the most by panic as sell-offs happened through the space. Nevertheless, the correction was bound to happen following the incredible run that bitcoin had. Market corrections are always normal and expected after a bull rally, that is why it is reasonable to ride the bear market with a working strategy from a professional.

Yep, I bought a ton on the dip.   It's getting cheaper relative to its current earnings (half compared to last year).

Fidelity considers Amazon as a large growth company (probably because as big as it is, it still only has 7% of the retail market)

g10c1oBfCH8,"Just watched your Alibaba video. My thoughts on Microsoft Pro's - 1) Cloud growth is really good. They are gaining market share. everyone defines cloud differently, but if you listen to things like cloudwars.co podcasts, then its pretty clear microsoft is doing well. lots of tech companies talking about cloud, but i think the three major players are aws, azure, gcp. China cloud is kindof its own market as I don't think many western countries want to have their cloud information stored by a chinese company.  2) they've converted to a consistent annual flow already which you've mentioned 3) less likely to have fines / business model changes related to monopolies. A lot of US memebers of congress / senators) owns shares of msft. 4) company has been transforming out of the old msft days quite well for a number of years. 5) trusted partner of large multinationals and governments. The Con's: 1) the valuation is trading a little high, but i'd rather pay a little more for a great company than to risk a bad company. its trading as a multiple of earnings which is much better than some companies these days that trade off a multiple of something like revenues 2) it can't change prices that quickly unlike raw materials which hurt a little bit in a short run if inflation continues, but they have a strong command as to what price they charge in windows / office 365 in the long run.

It's kind of amazing that a company so big could have such good growth prospects. However I guess every business that digitises ends up using the same few big tech companies for it's tools, which gives them access to more and more of the economy.",2021-05-12T13:43:45Z

if you believe that the company fcf will grow by 20% for the next 5 years thats ok, but its not conservative imo..

i used 15% fcf growth to be conservative
which means that i wont pay more then x30 fcf..

I've been trying to locate a cheaper alternative to MSFT so that my account can be eligible for options trading with the same general outlook because I can't make any trades using MSFT given my portfolio size (3-5k). The ETFs with the highest holding of MSFT I could find are XLK and TECL. I'm not crazy on the idea of using TECL given it being leveraged. I'm basically just trying to take advantage of MSFT EPS dates without the high cost of actually using MSFT. Is XLK my best bet? TECL is significantly cheaper than both, but I feel XLK is a more steady choice. Lmk 😊",2021-12-07T21:41:51Z

U5jCuFW7v6k,@king of games I think there is still room for an exclusive modern day flagship bigbudget fps franchise on gamepass. Cod is one of the best selling franchises and really gained that crown when it started ditching ww2 and embracing modern day settings. Battlefield established its popularity with the same settings  and Tom Clacny Rainbow 6 and Division have been very popular all with modern settings. Counterstrike the same.  So maybe Bungie could ditch scifi and embrace real world settings,2021-11-01T04:21:05Z

Its the reason Bungie had to approach Chinese publisher Netease for that 100 million dollar deal.  But 100 mill ain't alot in this day and age, all it takes is one poorly sold game for them not to recoup that level of money, given dev costs are ballooning past 100m.",2021-10-31T17:51:25Z

gTRhI91H0HY,"<The cyrpto market has been unstable. People ask themselves if this is the right time to invest? before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first. BTC price fall means analysts remain divided over whether it is entering a bear market or is just suffering a brief correction on the road to more record highs. Investors who bought early are still in profit despite the recent price crash and they also earn by trading. I'm still an investor but still I'm winning by applying the same method in every trad e, you can also become a winner today. We should follow the way of earning more regardless of the current market (bulls or bears), which is tradlng. Buy the Dip and Trade...I have made over 6 btc profits not just by buying the dip but implementing tradess with  s!gnals supllied by Kennedy Pulk.

MuMdNkn8x84,"@Manuel Sánchez i think Dye & Durham is a well managed company, though if you look at it - it just IPO'd back in 2020 hence there is not enough history for this stock. I do like stocks where I can go as far as 10 years in history on their revenue, FCF, Debt history, CAGR on their top line & bottom line, operating cashflow, and other financial aspects. One thing you have to truly consider in tech industry is that Technology is a disruptive industry hence the company must be absolutely aggressive on growth (either organic or acquisitions) otherwise other new and budding tech companies (which appear like mushrooms) can easily eat up their market share.

LR-yeIorALQ,"Spot on, the crypto market has been unstable. People ask themselves if this is the right time to invest? before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first. BTC price fall means analysts remain divided over whether it is entering a bear market or is just suffering a brief correction on the road to more record highs. Investors who bought early are still in profit despite the recent price crash and they also earn by trading. I'm still an investor and still I'm winning by applying the same method in every trade, you can also become a winner today. We should follow the way of earning more regardless of the current market (bulls or bears), which is trading. Buy the Dip and Trade...I have made over 15 btc profits not just by buying the dip but implementing trades with signals supplied by Mr. Seth Leonard. a veteran trader from New York.",2021-10-29T01:52:35Z

Peter Lynch always mentioned this great quote “Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has 
been lost in corrections themselves.” Buy great companies and just hold for the long run!

zemOp_WAIh0,"Great video!!!!

Also did you notice the monthly  MACD for the NASDAQ? The monthly MACD shows the NASDAQ will be in bearish for several more weeks or maybe even months. 
Also the pattern of the candles on the weekly chart is very similar to what happened last year February to beginning of March that lead the major correction (crash) of 2020. 
Also the NASDAQ is showing as over bought on the monthly RSI spanning from mid 2020 to now, in total it needs a 15% correction from it's all time high for 2021",2021-03-05T01:33:46Z
zemOp_WAIh0,The rich stay rich by spending less and Investing more while the poor stay poor by spending more but with no investment,2021-03-04T23:42:29Z
zemOp_WAIh0,"Investing in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is the best form of investment anyone can implement right now.  Sometimes when we have that specific money that we want to invest in a particular thing, we always lose focus and then invest or spend the money wrongly.  One of the reasons you need to invest in cryptocurrencies and their technologies is;  Cryptocurrency is changing the economy shape of any nation, that way being an early adapter gives you an edge over others that will buy into it late.  While looking at the growth rate of the cryptocurrency and the opportunity it presents, why not look into it and rethink about the particular investment you wish to make.  You can earn up to $20,000 per week
