but i hav been facing one issue..
issue : I have bought X company share 40 qty @ INR 97.85 per share on June 2021 and sold the same 40 qty @ INR 237.80 per share in Oct 2021. 
so in Oct 2021 dont have any share of this X company. 
Now in Jan 2022 I again purchased this company shares 70 qty @ INR 226.80 per share .
now as per the ur excel tracker the average cost per share is INR 179.89 but actually the current average per share (of my current holding) cost is INR 226.80

qtY1NOVQ6iE,"Average price of stocks is not coming properly when there is sale and purchase for that stock is multiple times.
Its averaging from starting value. 
Suppose there is 1000 shares of INTC we sold 100, 120 two occasions and then purchased 200 and 250 again with higher prices. In this case it should be 1000-100=900 then 900-120= 780, calculate average price  over 780. After this 780+ 200=980 its average then  add 980+250=1230, then again take average. Curently its taking simple average which is not fulfilling the purpose by giving wrong average.

Not sure if it is my mistake, but i have an issue where if I buy a stock, then i sell all off.

When you have mutile transactions for example you buy1- apple 100 shares for $100; buy2 - apple 200 shares for $110; and buy3 - apple 300 shares for $130. The sheet will calculate the weighted everage for my buy, but when I sold say 100 shares, the buy in price wasn't changed. so for tax or reconsilidation purpose. if I closed my first buy 100 shares @$100. The cost for apple should be weighted everage between 200 and 300. If there is a way to reflect that, the sheet would be perfect. Thank you again.",2022-02-02T13:45:08Z

qtY1NOVQ6iE,"Hi, thank you for sharing your wonderful portfolio tracker. I am still working my way through it. Very comprehensive instruction. 

Question: For the calculation Average Purchase Price in the Position sheet, it doesn't seem to take into consideration if a specific stocks are partially sold. 

Example:

1 jan 2021 MSFT Buy 200 $100
1 feb 2021 MSFT Sell -200 $120

then 
1 mar 2021 MSFT Buy 300 $130

The Average purchase price should only take the purchase on 1 Mar and ignore the purchase on 1 Jan since it has already been sold in Feb. 
but it seems the formula still takes both Jan and Mar into the averaging. 

Not sure if I am correct.",2021-10-14T11:37:24Z

qtY1NOVQ6iE,"The video is really good but i have found a major problem .
The way u are calculating weighted average is completely wrong as u are considering all the buy(history!D:D>0) from the history tab and not considering that some stock might have been sold and the average price depends on the sold stocks as well .
eg :

you buy stock A at 200 of 2 qty so avg =100
later u will sell 1 stock at 150 so avg =100 (bcoz we havent invested any money yet)
later u decide to buy another at 200 so avg = (1*100+1*200)/2 = 150
but what u will get the way u are doing is (2*100+1*200)/3 = 133.33

so Purchase price in position tab is completely wrong . But all other logics are right. It would be great if u fix that or reply how u would fix this issue.",2021-08-18T09:49:22Z

qtY1NOVQ6iE,"It is fabulous! You know that!  I spent 6 hours following the video, pause, rewind etc and finally finished my Sheets.  Time well spent.  I will tweak my sheets in time, but if @Think Stocks or any other readers can help, I have two nagging issues.

I collect dividends on my stocks and enter them in History like:  XYZ Dividend 1 $101.07 - (info from my broker)  The spreadsheet is then averaging the $101.07 into my Purchase Position.  This is the line of code I need to change, such that it does not average in the amount of dividends I get.  How to change it? if(isblank(A3),"" "",Average.weighted(filter(History!E:E,History!B:B=A3,History!D:D>0),filter(History!D:D,History!B:B=A3,History!D:D>0)))

The other issue is less technical.  How can I reset the sheet to only include date from Jan 1 of each year?  This is a great sheet for analyzing what I have now and what I have done over all time but it would be so much more handy if the dates could be played with.

However there is an issue I wanted to share.

Lets say you averaged a stock in Jan, and sold the whole position in Feb.

Now you are again averaging the stock in March. When we compute weighted average cost of the stock, as per the formula, it will take the purchase price of Jan month as well, which we had already liquidated and realized gains/losses for, therefore average cost of that stock is coming out to be wrong.

qtY1NOVQ6iE,"Hey this was an excellent video, thank you so much for uploading it! I made a few small changes to the formatting and one thing that you may prefer doing in the future is adding an x- and y-axis to the price chart on the dashboard. It's pretty easy to do using google finance data. 

Take the formula that you use to generate the sparklines plot and create a 5th sheet (I labeled mine ""Selected Google Finance Data""). Paste the formula into the first cell and it will automatically populate the first two cells of each row with the closing price and date for the entire year. This data can then be used to generate a Closing price vs. Date chart for your security of interest. Copy and paste the new chart onto the dashboard and you're good to go. Since you're referencing the ticker symbol in cell J1, it will automatically update just like a sparklines plot would but now you'll have labeled axes to get a sense of scale for the price change over time.

A small problem that I encountered was in the history page for the transaction. on the first row D3 I placed cash and deposit. However, when I look at the portfolio of active positions I notice that cash is considered a ticker as if it was an ongoing position. I've tried removing it but  it has been unsuccessful. The only way I see that it works is if I remove the formula from the TOTAL column cell F3 of the history sheet  .The rest below the first row works fine.  It seems to me that the problem is only the first row because,  later I make other deposits in the other rows  and the deposit is successfully added to the account and does not appear in the portfolio of active positions. Please let me know if there is something I am doing wrong or something that can help me to fix the error.

For example, let‚Äôs say these transactions were carried out in order:

1. Bought 1 AAPL @$100
2. Sold 1 AAPL @$105
3. Bought 1 AAPL @$110

Using the weighted average formula, purchase will be $105 per share. However the real average should be $110 since the first share was already sold off and shouldn‚Äôt be counted in the weighted average. Because of this the realised gain row in the dashboard will also be off, showing $0 gain when it should be $5. Is there any workaround for this? Thanks :)",2021-03-03T18:33:01Z

If i sell a stock, then rebuy, this formula sum's up the value of the stock i first bought as well.

example:
Buy - appl - 10 stocks - U$ 110,00
Sell - appl - 10 stocks - US 115,00
Buy - appl - 20 stocks - U$ 120,00

I made a small change for calculating the purchasing. You just average and weight the bought price of purchasing a stock.

Just take the shares and prices array as an input, then keep track of the partial sums as you go through your for loop. Here's my code:

  var total = []

In watching this video, it struck me how telling the last part of it is. When you extend the look back to 500 days, you comment about how most of the charts reflect when the pandemic hit.

It's interesting to look at the companies you chose and how their charts responded to the pandemic.

Amazon, Tesla, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple took off.

Delta, United and Spirit fell off the face of a cliff and have struggled to make it halfway back to where they were.

I didn't read all the other comments, so I'm not sure if somebody else already pointed this out.

q7ulBoWLtuU,Hello floss.  I am a little lost  concerning the  camera  part of this review. What exactly makes  this camera better than the  fold  one? Is it a software issue or a sensor issue?. I mean on the  papier the  Samsung sensor is not  worst than the pixels one. Does that mean that using another application on the  fold to take picture instead of the  stock Samsung one would make  the  fold take better pictures? Would that pixel camera  app upgrade the picture's quality  of for exemple the redmagic 6?.,2021-08-23T10:05:21Z

q7ulBoWLtuU,"Great video. I was looking for a backup phone for my Galaxy S21 Ultra 512G, and this might be it. It would be, but I would want the Pixel 6 Pro. I hope it has 512G, and this should have 256G available. Oyherwise, I really like it, especially the metal back. I will probably get the Pixel 6 Pro and get this for my sister when she needs to replace her Galaxy S10E, but she doesn't use her phone as heavy as me, so it will be a while. I had the original Pixel XL after I switch from the Motorola Droids when they went to the modular format. It was great back then and ran smooth, but I ran that into the ground, especially killed the battery. So much more advanced features and performance. The storage size was tge only real thing holding me back from using this as a main phone. The pro should match the hardware specs of the S21 Ultra 512G, at least processor, 16G RAM, 512G storage and large battery.",2021-08-23T01:56:44Z

q7ulBoWLtuU,"I wish the reviewers hadn't all been given different spec sheets by Google - it's really confusing / annoying.

Half the reviewers make a point of talking about how much more scratch resistant it is than before as it now features gorilla glass 6. MKBHD for example. 

The other half like Flossy say no it doesn't it features GG 3 just like the 4A.

Does anyone actually know - including Google - which it is?

Then Flossy says video maxes out at 4k30, when everyone else says 4k60. Although in fairness it's academic as it overheats and can't shoot anything after 2-4 minutes.

I'm a minute and 30 seconds into the review and 2 of the major specs are different.

I feel like this launch has been a mess.

On a positive note on the overheating, one reviewer decided to take advantage of the new IP 67 rating.

He dunked his 2 mins overheating 5a into a jug of cold water having pressed record and instead of shutting off after 2 mins it was still recording at 20 min no issues. 

So as long as you film underwater it's fine ! üò¨",2021-08-22T14:58:17Z

If I cared that much about the random pictures/video I might take day to day,  I'd carry my DJI Pocket 2 around or bring one of my DSLRs. Heck, Sony dropped a decent camera for $600 recently. I can't imagine purchasing, paying for a data plan and carrying around a second phone just because the camera processing is slightly better.  To each their own,  though.",2021-08-21T14:04:44Z

q7ulBoWLtuU,I prefer the fingerprint sensors on the back. They sit exactly where you normally put your finger.   I feel like people championed the umderscreen sensors because of form and lost some functionality in the process..  they str8 up better,2021-08-21T13:55:58Z

q7ulBoWLtuU,@Ryan H I had samsung phones since the epic 1. I haven't had an fingerprint sensor complaints at all since my s20 fe so yes. I think it's user error,2021-08-26T03:16:48Z

q7ulBoWLtuU,"@Ryan H I've never had an issue with my fingerprint sensor. If I'm cooking I can double tap my screen and use fingerprint or face unlock without getting crap on my phone. You'd have to pick yours up. 

You are making issues where there are none. My s21 ultra is near instant when I put my finger on the screen.",2021-08-26T02:59:19Z
q7ulBoWLtuU,@J D isn't face unlock the solution for everyone?   I suppose for the rare occasion you need to glance at your phone while you can't pick it up  yes it's better    however it seems to me that in every other circumstance it requires more shifting of the phone in your hand      and it also doesn't work when your hands are sweaty or slightly damp. Which I've never had that issue with a physical sensor..,2021-08-25T14:16:46Z
q7ulBoWLtuU,"@Ryan H I don't think that matters.. the inscreen scanner is under where your thumb hits the screen. I can't see any reason why a back of the phone scanner would be better in 2021. Not to mention face unlock. 

You can't unlock your phone on the counter while cooking without picking it up. Not convient.",2021-08-25T14:07:23Z
q7ulBoWLtuU,@J D o guess that depends on what you do more often.   Read your phone when it's laying flat or read your phone when it's in your hand.  I personally don't think when it's laying down or standing in a dock is the greatest way to in a phone. So for me.  It's on the back,2021-08-25T13:52:45Z

I remember back when I had the LG G5, that phone got swung so many times when my wired earbuds would latch onto a door handle or something and my G5 would drop to floor (didn't use a case sadly) and the modular portion of the phone would fall off and battery would get removed.",2021-08-28T03:43:10Z

It shouldn't be a surprise by now. Its been gone for a couple generations now. They saved money and made more space in the phone. It's not coming back because Bluetooth makes more sense.

Hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey
Hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey (oh-oh-oh), hey-hey-hey

I had to move because it was muddy in New York
L.A. has, but it is always a little bright
And I don‚Äôt want to hurt you anymore
So I set my model very low

I'm fine, I'm fine (ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
You say it, but you don‚Äôt say it
You're crazy, you're crazy (ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Close up and enjoy this kind of feeling
Do you love, don‚Äôt you love?
No, I'm not happy
But I‚Äôm not sad

Do you love, don‚Äôt you love?
No, I'm not happy
But I‚Äôm not sad

Hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey-hey
But I‚Äôm not sad
Hey-v-he-by, the-names-out-n-hey (oh-au-u), He-he-hey
But I‚Äôm not sad

I wake up and I‚Äôm not angry with Twitter now
Livin took a deep breath, but now she breathes a little
And I don‚Äôt want to cry anymore
So I set my model very low

I'm fine, I'm fine (ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
You say it, but you don‚Äôt say it
You're crazy, you're crazy (ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Close up and enjoy this kind of feeling

Do you love, don‚Äôt you love?
No, I'm not happy
But I‚Äôm not sad

Do you love, don‚Äôt you love?
No, I'm not happy (still happy)
But I‚Äôm not sad

I can do it wrong, I can make mistakes
It‚Äôs silly, but all I have

Do you love, don‚Äôt you love?
No, I'm not happy
But I‚Äôm not sad

Well, I couldn‚Äôt sleep and my heart sank
Because half of us passed and my brain was on fire
I counted the sheep, but the sheep died
And I‚Äôm working hard, but I can‚Äôt try

Well, I couldn‚Äôt sleep and my heart sank
‚ÄòWe were halfway through and my brain burned (my brain burned)
I counted the sheep, but the sheep died
And I‚Äôm not dead yet, so I thought I‚Äôd be fine

Do you love, don‚Äôt you love?
No, I'm not happy (still happy)
But I‚Äôm not sad

Do you love, don‚Äôt you love?
No, I'm not happy
But I‚Äôm not sad

I can do wrong (I can do wrong)
I can do wrong (I can do wrong)

There was only one person in the Chevrolet
You want to know
Tonight in the small
Summer is me too
Then we woke up and the summer was over

But the speech of ""Tim McGraw"".

I hope you love your favorite song
Dance here all night
Only in the middle of the lake
When you are happy
Let it remain dark
Think of me
Blue clothes
If you think the team is happy
understood

That was until September
Thank you for not being there
So watch me
But under the bed
Here is the post you did not read
At home only
It is not difficult to know that everything is delicious and tasty
It is good to know everything and believe in everything

But the speech of ""Tim McGraw"".
I hope you love your favorite song
Dance here all night
Only in the middle of the lake
When you are happy
Let it remain dark
Think of me
Blue clothes
If you think the team is happy
understood


I came for the first time
I'm playing
There is a letter on the door
The first thing you read

But the speech of ""Tim McGraw"".
I hope you love your favorite song
The radio started one day
I look forward to your return
When you are happy
Let it remain dark
Think of me
Blue clothes
If you think the team is happy
understood


No, understood,

(translated version:) Love who loves you
He loved it touched, and a voice, so you know you
Death nutrition support. death is real
I have to listen to the knowledge of the Greeks, they shall refer here to the Alpha Delta
Dead, dead (fatigued)
It must be approved birth.
When we speak of the body, and His blood is to be gathered together,
The connection of mind and spirit
Michael Thomas knows that he is dead (also)
There is no surprise!
If you do not, you have the heart of the people and thy people: to-morrow, however, is to begin to
If the table Tomorrow
The sisters look
bone
Because no one like you
They do not know anything of the things which are seen
It's been about 6 months
other
Try the sky after 27 years
Listening to the response in the market
Dead, dead (fatigued)
Alas, but they are dead?
When we speak of the body, and His blood is to be gathered together,
The connection of mind and spirit
We use some of them, and severe (right)
Not you?
should not be afraid
Love loves us so much, remember
The last way Eternal
Purity and happiness fill
Then the other hand, I love numbers
A new hand in a new living bodies
The effect is to resolve
Assembling all your life;
Do not worry about the love
We follow billion in eyes
From the serious to the door
Ordinary woman?
Dead, dead (fatigued)
It must be approved birth.
When we speak of the body, and His blood is to be gathered together,
The connection of mind and spirit
Michael Thomas knows that he is dead (also)
There is no surprise!
If you do not, you have the heart of the people and thy people: to-morrow, however, is to begin to
If the table Tomorrow

(Og song:) Die hard fans adored your hands
They loved your throat and quote unquote ""you""
Hey, remember Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson really happened
Delta Echo Alpha Delta, walking on the moon forever
You are dead and buried, you are dead (Oh no)
That's being revised!
Even as we speak we're synthesizing blood and organs
Synthesizing heart and soul
Even Katy Perry knows you're dead (Oh no)
Won't she be surprised!
When we get your heart to start tomorrow
When you see the chart tomorrow you'll be number one
Bro, you look amazing
Really put together
It's like you haven't aged a day, oh
It's like we know what we're doing or something
You've been gone for way too long, like half a year
An entire career for some
Good luck getting into Heaven if you live past 27
Listen to the radiation put you back in circulation
You are dead and buried, you are dead (Oh no)
Oh, but you never died!
Even as we speak we're synthesizing blood and organs
Synthesizing heart and soul
Ain't no cemetary you can't shed (Oh no)
Ain't nowhere you can hide!
Don't be frightened of us
Soon enough you're gonna love us, just remember
This is your last ride ever, forever
Fill up your lungs, feel better
Look, it's you, good as new
New hands, new throat, new living tissue
You earned this new purpose
Lifetime achievement award
Don't be nervous baby
We put a billion eyes back on you
From the grave to the stage
You're a natural, babe!
You are dead and buried, you are dead (Oh no)
That's being revised!
Even as we speak we're synthesizing blood and organs
Synthesizing heart and soul
Even Katy Perry knows you're dead (Oh no)

Translated lyrics:

Travel to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, two tbsp
And change jacket
Laugh at what little things you look like
(Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)
See funny representatives
Tired of singing well
I bet all her friends brag and say she's special, hmm

So when do you tell him what we did?
I think it's special, but use everything again.
This is our house, I found it the first time
I'm kidding you to tell him when you're with him

Did you see him when you were with him?
Have you seen it? (Ah) Hmm
Do you see that?

Call it, you can almost say my name?
Honestly, they somehow kept the same thing
Another player
I would not think I'm your type
And I bet he knows Billy Joel
Because you played ""Girl Out of Town.""
From Chicana
I'm sure you're telling him you love him too
Between the choir and the song (oh, I love you)

So when do you tell him what we did?
I think it's special, but use everything again.
This is the program we are talking about
Now you have played the songs he sang

Did you see him when you were with him?
Have you seen it? (Oh oh)
Have you seen it?

A glass of strawberries from Malibu
Do not be like us
They change coats as before
(Yes, everything is reused)
He plays the piano, but he does not know (oh, oh)
What I taught you, Billy Joel (ah)
Another girl, but nothing new

I know you've seen it before
I know you've seen it before
I know you've seen it before",2021-04-07T02:35:17Z

Translated lyrics:

Tell me, girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or you need more
Are you looking for something else?

I fell
Everything good
I want a change
And I'm afraid of difficult times

Tell me what a man he is
Isn't it enough to fill this void?
Or you need more
It's not hard to bear, is it?

I fell
Everything good
I want a change
And I'm afraid of difficult times

I see myself sinking to the ground
I will never find land
They run to a level where they can't hurt us.
We are now far from shallow water

Yes aha, aha weekend
Sha-ha, sa-la-la-la-lav
Yes aha, aha weekend
We are now far from shallow water

'Cause I-I-I'm in the stars tonight

So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight

Shoes on, get up in the morn'

Cup of milk, let's rock and roll

King Kong, kick the drum, rolling on like a Rolling Stone

Sing song when I'm walking home

Jump up to the top, LeBron

Ding dong, call me on my phone

Ice tea and a game of ping pong, huh

Can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready (woo hoo)

Life is sweet as honey

Yeah, this beat cha-ching like money, huh

Bring a friend, join the crowd

Whoever wanna come along

Word up, talk the talk

Just move like we off the wall

Day or night, the sky's alight

So we dance to the break of dawn

Ladies and gentlemen, I got the medicine

So you should keep ya eyes on the ball, huh

This is getting heavy

The sinful city is cold and empty.
Do not judge me (d)
I can't see it happening.

I can't touch and touch until they fall asleep.
I said good night
When will they believe me?

Hitting a child on the street is quick, oh

The city is desolate and cold (d)
Do not judge me (d)
I can't see it happening.

She said, ""Oh, the light is on.""
I can't touch and touch until they fall asleep.
I said good night
When will they believe me?

Just call me to check
I can't talk on the phone (call)
I will never go now (Huy)

Translated lyrics:

I live in the visual world
Babies cry in front of the beds
I saw a world with eyes filled with paint and white wipes
They see me dragging what they hear me crying

I love everything
The fire is spreading in my room
My world is very clear
Trouble breathing but okay
Silence
At night

Open your eyes to find out the truth (no)
Why doesn't he let me eat your happy weight?
I live in the visual world
Babies cry in front of the beds
Some days I feel weak compared to others
Sometimes I can‚Äôt see it being my body

I love everything
The fire is spreading in my room
My world is very clear
Trouble breathing but okay
Silence
At night

I want to enjoy your content
Hold your breath and understand the feelings
The devil is hiding behind a heretical woman
Honesty is the door to hell
I want to taste the consumption
Breathe quickly to lose oxygen
He listened to great children's songs
This music melts
Silence

I just want you to be happy soon, yes
Avoid tired flowers
You have a lot of bricks in your pocket
Think of them as four-leaf clover on my handle
The verses do not match, yes
He just got into his dream
I practiced bad lullabies
In kindergarten, he can rot and count the sheep.",2021-03-07T05:31:18Z

Translated lyrics:

Barbara and the umbrella
Describe, describe, describe

Take care of my baby
He's the only one in me.
She's not a real woman
I have nothing (from Barara, from Barara)

I did not say very often
That's a bad joke
But I love mom
It's easy to say you've found a new friend
I know this for a long time
But the copy fell to my right.
And I'm leaving, but I'm scared
Spread the towel on the rug, wave my white flag (from Barra)
I think he's still making pancakes for me.
And if your stomach hurts, Elka-Seltser
I do not know what love is without love
We still need to shake hands
My band loves music
I know I'm young, but if I choose the sun
I want to be a child at night (look at the sound, look good)

Take care of my baby
He's the only one in me.
She's not a real woman
I have nothing (from Barara, from Barara)
Take care of my baby
He's the only one in me.
She's not a real woman
I have nothing (from Barara, from Barara)

The last conversation continued for a very long time.
And I do not want to say that right away
But I think my father finally found this
Happy woman your son is proud of
And I know you heard the last song
The girls would not
But promises a new level
I know the pronunciation of my name (Mabrara)
I like the method I call
He also has his own ringtone.
I do not know what love is without love
There are several ways to get home
But when he got home, he knew it
Open the door, take off your coat and drop your bag on the floor
He turned his arms happily

Take care of my baby
He's the only one in me.
She's not a real woman
I have nothing (from Barara, from Barara)

His smile makes them Norwegians.
The old country is evil (not over yet)
His eyes are beautiful
And that's not all (I swear)
He has Chinese skin, but is 10 years old.
He still has a song.
This is the shortest smile I've ever heard
And we can talk on the phone for 3 hours.
And watch anytime, anywhere
It was an important ingredient when I started creating the future.
Nonsense, luck and love
Or what did you say
Wherever I go, I have pictures of him in my pocket.

Take care of my baby
He's the only one in me.
She's not a real woman
I have nothing (from Barara, from Barara)
Take care of my baby
He's the only one in me.
She's not a real woman

Translated lyrics:

I like this glue, but it works well on surfaces.
We have a cigar and a cup
I don't try to worry about the world
I have a lot of trouble

And I know I have something that no one can deny.
You're good you know it's you, what are you doing? please do not go
We're here before you lie
How accurate

And you know what's troubling.
How can you help solve this problem?
I love you, not just love, but practical

I like this glue, but it works well on surfaces.
We have a cigar and a cup
I don't try to worry about the world
I have a lot of trouble
Like me
You can enjoy laughing at your message.
We can't be cheap though
I don't try to worry about the world
I have a lot of trouble
For the chaos of the world

Above, I've eaten a probationer's clothes all my life,
The neighbor knocks on the door
And now I think of you
Now when I am a tired man I look special.

And you know what's troubling.
How can you help solve this problem?
I love you, not just love, but practical

I like this glue, but it works well on surfaces.
We have a cigar and a cup
I don't try to worry about the world
I have a lot of trouble

Translated lyrics:

On the way to the dark desert
A little wind
Strong smell of heat
Success
A few seconds later
Look at the white world
I have a headache and it hurts
I need to get up at night
There is
I heard a PR call
And I thought
""Rain or Hell""
Then hurry up
And he showed me the way
Noise in the room
I think I heard them

Welcome to a hotel in California
Nice place (great)
The picture is beautiful
This room is in California
At any time of the year (at any time of the year)
You can find it here.

Tiffany had an idea
Mercedes Benz e
You have a lot of good people and good people.
Invite your friends
She dances around the fence
It‚Äôs summer again this summer
Dance to remember you
I forgot to dance
So I called the captain
""Give me a drink of wine.""
""I haven't had a soul since 1999,"" he said.
But the sounds of songs are far from over
I woke up in the middle of the night
He just listens to them

But they could not kill the animal
I think later
I ran to the door

Translated lyrics:

The boy is in pain, he is shocked
I want your love I want your love I love you now
I feel pain when I'm not with you
Kneel down.

I don't need your love
I will love you very much
And if they don't kill me
Child
It doesn't matter where you are
i want to be like you
And I have to try

thank you
Do you have any questions?
I am here because I am here
A little love, a little grace
If you show me good love, do the right thing
I want sweetness in my life
Thank you for your education
Do you have any questions?

Let your kids break
do not make me sad
Give me
It's not safe without you
Only you will be with me

I don't need your love
I will love you very much
And if they don't kill me
Child
It doesn't matter where you are
i want to be like you
And I have to try

thank you
Do you have any questions?
I am here because I am here
A little love, a little grace
If you show me good love, do the right thing
I want sweetness in my life
Your education, yes thank you (in a way yes thank you)
Do you have any questions?

It's OK
I like this red velvet
I like this sweet cake
Don't touch me until you see me
On the contrary, it must be human
Because I had sex in Southern California for more than a day
I don't want to play, just calm down
Don't give me everything
I don't like sugar

Friend (thank you)
Do you have any questions? (Come to me)
I'm here because I'm here (I'm here because I'm here)
A little love, a little grace
If you show me good love, do the right thing
I want sweet things in life (yeah)
Your education, yes thank you (in a way yes thank you)
Do you have any questions? (Come to me)
thank you
Do you have any questions?
I'm here because I'm here (I'm here because I'm here)
A little love, a little grace
If you show me good love, do the right thing
I want sweetness in my life

Me and you all night.
There is nothing wrong,
Nothing true.
I swear in those walls to turn,
Swear the roof is underground.
Satan does not sleep at night.

I try to turn it off,
The day is going well for me
But inside I (O-O-O)
Say these words over and over again.
When I try to breathe
Now you count on me.

So I laughed
But I know that you know me well.
That‚Äôs right,
You‚Äôre like heaven when I‚Äôm in hell.

You were there,
Holding me tight.
It looked light but tasted darkness.
I look forward to it all
I was not fit for your company.
Self-love is very difficult.

I try to turn it off,
The day is going well for me
But inside I (O-O-O)
Say these words over and over again.
When I try to breathe
Now you count on me.

So I laughed
But I know that you know me well.
That‚Äôs right,
You‚Äôre like heaven when I‚Äôm in hell.

(Insomnia)

So I laughed
But I know that you know me well.
That‚Äôs right,
You‚Äôre like heaven when I‚Äôm in hell.

So I laughed
But I know that you know me well.
That‚Äôs right,
You‚Äôre like heaven when I‚Äôm in hell.

So I laughed
But I know that you know me well.
That‚Äôs right,
You‚Äôre like heaven when I‚Äôm in hell.


The actual lyrics

You and I, up all night.
Nothing‚Äôs wrong,
Nothing‚Äôs right.
I swear these walls are upside down,
Swear the roof is underground.
Demons don‚Äôt sleep at night.

I try to turn off my mind,
Say I‚Äôm doing just fine,
But I‚Äôm screaming inside like (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Say these words on repeat,
While I‚Äôm trying to breathe,
Now you‚Äôre counting on me.

So I fake a smile,
But I know you know me too well.
And that‚Äôs alright,
You‚Äôre like heaven when I‚Äôm in hell.

You were there, 
held me hard.
Felt light but tasted the dark.
I‚Äôm waiting for them all to see,
I don‚Äôt deserve your company.
To love myself is way too hard.

I try to turn off my mind,
Say I‚Äôm doing just fine,
But I‚Äôm screaming inside like (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Say these words on repeat,
While I‚Äôm trying to breathe,
Now you‚Äôre counting on me.

So I fake a smile,
But I know you know me too well.
And that‚Äôs alright,
You‚Äôre like heaven when I‚Äôm in hell.

(No sleep)
(That‚Äôs alright)
(No sleep)

So I fake a smile,
But I know you know me too well.
And that‚Äôs alright,
You‚Äôre like heaven when I‚Äôm in hell.

So I fake a smile,
But I know you know me too well.
And that‚Äôs alright,
You‚Äôre like heaven when I‚Äôm in hell.

P9uP0BHaDEU,"Products are sold in shops and in the whole world, so a lot of money every day. Look at the wallet. The shareholder, also known as the shareholder, also focused on the owner of the company. If you share, you have your own business. For example. Hand over the cheese and 1,000 cheese tools or you can buy it. Have one 1,000 cheeses. How about as the value of this business increases, as does the value of your work. Make lots of friends, but never leave the company. Reasons for selling the company: this will save you a lot of money. By doing so, the grades will not increase. Also, if the company wants to sell its shares, it needs space to do so. Space stock exchange. A company known for its trade. This is a company. They are not sold in exchange for wax. Example. If you build a $100 Craigslist, you will receive hundreds of emails from people asking you to buy the list. Now you think, ""Maybe this table will find me."" Upgrade to the highest and highest levels until the end user pays the same price. Without a paycheck, we will begin to reduce costs until someone gets a job. The speed of the stock market is important. Cragsystal didn't change prices, however, but, had millions of transactions per second related to supply and demand. Powerful technology offers nothing new. More importantly, millions of families have lived there for millions of years. Soccer discs are also sold with essential items. If they want to stay in the market, the price is too high. I have to pay. Look, emu. If you bought 1,000 shares of Arizona in 1997, now it's almost $1.10. Despite all this, owning a property is still far from the average person. On the other hand, if you earn more than 5% of your income, you need to be more selective about how you help others. Well, no happiness, no happiness. No time, no friendship. Everything has to be shown. To do this, you need a one million dollar cash-soup. You can use the appropriate service of Robinhood. Once you have an account, you need to choose the company you want grabbing from. Money: did you buy the stock. The cost of a product is thousands, it's clean. Before you buy, make sure you do not want to start a business. Ask your doctor before starting a business. Getting started is the best way to deal with it. Win. Being a good investor.

There was a time when I was just about to go somewhere and there was nowhere to go home. My only friend is Moon and he disappears every now and then. So one night when I closed my eyes I saw the bowl rise high. He reached me with the sweetest smile and said he'd like to talk sooner or later.

He said, ""Peter Pan, they tell me, I promise you'll never be alone"" and from that day on ...


I'm the prose son of Neverland, usually Peter Pan.  When bored, play in the forest and always run from the captain's circle.

Lost kids like me live in Neverland and lost kids like me are free. Lost kids like me live in Neverland and lost kids like me are free.


He sprinkled me with fairy dust, he believed it, he believed it, and he asked me to believe in myself. He never loved me when I was in town and realized I was fashionable. We arrived in Neverland early and have been digging in the sand ever since....


I'm the prose son of Neverland, usually Peter Pan.  When bored, play in the forest and always run from the captain's circle.

Translated lyrics:

In the past it was a sailing ship
Billy is the name of the ship.
The wind blows and the spring blows
Beat my hooligans, touch them (Yes!)

Wellerman is coming soon.
Serve with sugar, tea and rum
It was a sunny day
Goodbyelier and leave

More than 2 weeks on earth
Keith looked good when he landed.
The captain shook his hand and swore.
I pulled the whales out of the trailer (Aha!)

Wellerman is coming soon.
Serve with sugar, tea and rum
One day the tongue disappeared
Goodbyelier and leave

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

Before the ship could reach the water
The whale's tail came
Next, fight and fight with them
Deep dive (yes!)

Wellerman is coming soon.
Serve with sugar, tea and rum
It was a sunny day
Goodbyelier and leave

The line will not be cut and the sample will not be released.
The captain is not fat
But it is part of the electoral process
Increase shipping balance (Yes!)

Wellerman is coming soon.
Serve with sugar, tea and rum
It was a sunny day
Goodbyelier and leave

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

Less than 40 days
The lines are smooth and then hard again.
All the canoes are gone. There are only 4
But no choice (Aha!)

Wellerman is coming soon.
Serve with sugar, tea and rum
It was a sunny day
Goodbyelier and leave

The war continues as I listen
Leaders do not come and the election does not run.
Wellerman calls the standard phones
Support the captain, the crew, the people (Aha!)

Wellerman is coming soon.
Serve with sugar, tea and rum
It was a sunny day
Goodbyelier and leave
Wellerman is coming soon.
Serve with sugar, tea and rum
It was a sunny day
Goodbyelier and leave",2021-02-18T01:07:27Z

The popular law of thermodynamics thermodynamic entropy concept of a physical system.  Entropy role as predicted irreversible processes are impractical or where the necessity of obedience draw power conservation, which is the first law of thermodynamics.  The popular law can be formed by becoming the entropy of isolated systems can be diminished when there is a natural evolution, which do not always come to a state of thermodynamic equivalent librio, entropy is the highest.  For if all things that are done with the system is reversible, for it is the entropy constant.  [1]

   Entropy reasons for the increase in the irreversibility of natural repeatedly with Ensley was conceived by the arrow of time.  [2]

   Historically, it has been popular received an empirical law and found that as an axiom of teaching thermodynamics.  Statistical Mechanics provides little explanation of the terms of the probability distributions of large assemblies of molecules or atoms.

   The law is a popular expression in many ways.  His first presentation, backyard, echoing the definition of entropy and the caloric learning to Carnot's theorem, credited to the French physicist Sadi Carnot, 1824, which shows that the efficiency of the heat center is a heat engine has an upper tours.

The prettiest
I think ""yes wrong"" (right)
I believe in God
Do not believe in best before date
Call me (play with me)
We play for fun (oh)
You really don't know my idea
View the model as a model
Sore throat
No rain, no electricity (waste)
You can see this disease everywhere
My fashion is a bit longer now
I don't know where I'm going
It was cold in the river, but I think it was still burning
Power controls me
Remove the soap

Let's do it now, I work (yeah)
Even if you don't pay for improvements I can (oh, check this out)
I only call (winter)
I practice (yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes)

I don't think I am to blame for framing this song
What I said was awful
Urgent nature of the disease
You're red
Both gods pray with both hands (pray now)
I'm looking for a group (masked wolves).
I do it over and over

Translated lyrics:

Parameter
I wish you were here, but you're not
Because all the memories are back
For the rest
Bread here today
French toast on the street
Because all the memories are back
Accepted by heart, remembered by heart

I remember when I wasn't in pain
I believe forever and everything is the same
Now I feel my heart when someone says your name in December
I can't register, but I know that one day I will say yes

Everyone was injured at times
Yes, it hurts every day
But everything will be fine
Say yes to a glass

Parameter
I wish you were here, but you're not
Because all the memories are back
For the rest
Bread here today
French toast on the street
Because all the memories are back
Accepted by heart, remembered by heart

You're not
Du-du-du-du, du-du-du
How beautiful
Restore memory, restore memory

There are times when I don't feel far from the place
When I think there is so much to stop all hatred (oh yes)
My heart is now like coal and the light is dark
I brought you a torch, so you know I'm not going, yes

Everyone was injured at times
Yes, it hurts every day
But everything will be fine
Say yes to a glass

We have these things (oh-oh)
I wish you were here, but you're not
Because all the memories are back
Everything we went for (no, no)
Someone is in pain here (no)
French toast on the street
All memories will make you drunk
Accepted by heart, remembered by heart

You're not
Du-du-du-du, du-du-du
How beautiful
Restore memory, restore memory
You're not

Translated lyrics:

I was very aware
I was very aware
I was very aware

If it was dark
I'm very hurt
Open heart (I have great knowledge)
How do you read the stars? (I'm very smart)
And now I'm ready
That's what you see
Not always visible (I understand)
Yes, I dreamed for a long time

Now I know what I mean
I will not drown, I will not give up
Gravity hurts, you did a great job
When I get up on the cement

I fell into the clouds
An error has occurred
I remember that night
Unless they fall from the clouds

I was very aware
Don't lose sleep
I recorded all the songs
And I woke up
I don't need fuel, no
Yes, I was born again
Eat milk
I don't have to pretend (and now it's too late)
Finally, the story ends

Now I know what I mean
I will not drown, I will not give up
Gravity hurts, you did a great job
When I get up on the cement

Clouds at nine in the morning (don't embarrass me)
An error has occurred
I'll leave you tonight (I'll leave you if I leave you)
I fell from the clouds (woke up)

Very screaming
Fallen castle (I can't sleep)
I'm trying to fight (I'm awake)
God knows what I want to do
She looks nice (she knows a lot)
But I'm not blind anymore

I was very aware
I was very aware

Yes, Al, that sounds a lot of shit to me, it seems to me that BT is not for me either.
An error has occurred
You know I'm leaving you today
I didn't read it from the cloud

I was very aware
I am very conscious
I am very conscious
I am very conscious
I am very conscious",2021-02-17T21:31:52Z

Breathing in clean air
What a day, yeah
What a sunny, funny day
I feel so high, I can't deny
A little better than okay
Nowhere to go
I shoot for stars, I'm Galileo
Pack your bags and don't be late
The scenery flies before my eyes
Don't you dream of home, cuz it'll have to wait

It's good to be alive
It's good to be alive
I'm happy to survive
So good

Can't kill my la-di-da vibe
Suffocate my feelin' alright
Or asphyxiate my hype
My bridges burned, no stone unturned
It's a relations' massacre
My new absolution
My new lease on life has just begun today
I ain't worried 'bout the fakes, or the bodies in my wake
Baby, I'm a firework, like Pompeii

It's good to be alive
It's good to be alive
I'm happy to survive
So, so good

The saints and angels sing
Choir of the bells chime, ring ring ring
I feel alive

The place moved before my eyes
Do not stay on earth because you have to wait

Life is fun
It was fun being together
Life is fun

You can't kill me, Redida
Send me an idea

There will be carnage in it

My new life begins today.

I also believe the Poco X3 has better camera sensor's.,2021-04-02T10:49:05Z

QYDcM7kyMoc,@Maripaz Manuel welcome! Also pala eToro min deposit is $500 or mga p25k. Medyo mataas,2021-06-28T06:39:50Z

QYDcM7kyMoc,"Wala na kasi ph bank transfer option si eToro since May. If you deposit also through credit card, sa credit card din yung withdrawal which is super hassle (you have to call your bank pa and all). I have 2 Etoro accounts but I‚Äôm not gonna put any more money in. I‚Äôm focusing on gotrade and binance. Etoro has more commodities/securities lang bit some are CFDs also. They have forex, crypto, copy trading, and leverage (which can be dangerous to newbies din).",2021-06-27T23:29:05Z
QYDcM7kyMoc,@Charm de Leon much better ba ang gotrade kaysa etoro?,2021-06-27T14:17:12Z

mZ48zgy1MKI,"Using Pixel 4a Device. To me, Stock android is over hyped. Itna saara bugs hai isme ki pucho hi mat, but 5 month se no bug fixing update. Yeh log sirf security updates hi dete hai.

Some of them:

1. My Widevine L1 UHD Stream gone. (No fix yet) (Favourite tha ye üò≠)

2. Out of 10 I Can't receive approx 8 incoming calls when im in another call. It hangs the phone if i try to receive for approx 30sec. 

3. Sometimes google's app like YouTube, Drive, Chrome behaves like drunk people.

4. Heating issue; (Full Volume me kuch paly karne se bottom speaker portion kuch jayda hi heat ho jata hai, Camera 3-5mim use karne se heat ho jata hai. Baki phones bhi camera se heat hota hai but pixel 4a ka heat se kuch jayda hi lagab hai.

5. Kabhi kabhi Slo-motion video leke play karne se hang & reboot hota hai automatically.

6. Wifi auto connect approx 10-20% nahi hota. Wifi options open karke manually connect karna padta hai.


Mai burai karna toh nahi chhahata but kafi dino se man me frustration tha, nikal diya. Ab halka feel ho raha hai ü§£ü§£

I hope android 12 official will make me happy ü§û.

Utsav Bhai apse request hai.... Stock android bug fixing long delay k upar video banao please. Ta ki humara(user) man ko thandak mile. ü§ó

                 Sorry to say but Parrot is a known kanger, and he steals the work of other Gcam developers & makes small changes and rebranding it as his mod. Therfore he is not respected either in Gcam community... Please don't promote ""Parrot""...,,, 

 Burial's 7.3 beta 11 is his latest version available in celsoazevedo website..... Burial is also working on latest Gcam 8.1 aka( Pixel 5), which soon will be released on his channel on Telegram..... Hope this information will be helpful for all who wanna use Gcam on Xiaomi devices..,,

LTaufWTNrYU,@deepak dabral are you getting yellowish screen in youtube and playstore,2021-01-13T12:12:58Z
LTaufWTNrYU,"@AMAN PANDEY Chill dude, I am also using the mi 10i, and yes it does stutter a bit but I guess it's because the 750g is not optimized properly (same issue with the moto g 5g with stock Android according to beebom) so it will probably be fixed in the next few updates. 
It's just a matter of personal choice, if you prefer realme, great! Amoled is always nice. 
Also don't watch those random videos which ""reveal the price"", they are just clearly fake. Realme x7 is priced at CNY 1799 in China while redmi note 9 pro 5g is priced at CNY 1599 (but it came in India at 22k lol) so AT MAX they are gonna price the x7 at 21k, they already have the upcoming realme 8 pro to be priced at around 20k, and with amoled display you have to compromise over a lot of features, heck even iPhone 11 had an LCD display (not comparing tho, that was pretty high quality) but still.",2021-01-13T09:13:14Z
LTaufWTNrYU,"@AMAN PANDEY debloat the phone and you'll get like 15-20% more performance out of it.

LTaufWTNrYU,@Ashutosh Patel I think I overestimated things cause it was based on a video of some YouTube I am not able to recall the name of the the channel but I may be incorrect about the price but definitely I am still after using mi 10i for more than 1 day can say that there are shutters and since I had used stock Android as well as realme's ui which was much more smoother for me may it is my taste or something like that but whenever I switch back to 60hz from 120hz display  and use the phone the difference is there it's great but for me I have used realme 6 pro to it's fullest with on average screen time of 7hrs per day and it never shutters but this so called value for money thing is quite disappointing at times. It is like I just upgraded to a bigger screen with slightly better display but with a software which bottlenecks the hardware a lot and if someone is die heart mi fan than sorry for hurting your sentiment but I had used asus max pro m2 stock Android my fathers oppo f7 and even my cousin's Samsung m21 but even it was better so for me it is my judgement my experience for me it is a bad experience and even I have given my feedback regarding this on mi feedback software they have received it and let's see if they work this out cause this device lacks a touch of optimisation.,2021-01-13T06:15:47Z

LTaufWTNrYU,"@AMAN PANDEY realme x7 is going to cost more than 20k. I think at this price Mi10i is definitely better. Especially the camera and the premium quality that you expect at this price range. Yes, display is descent but if you haven't used amoled in the past then this is the best.

LTaufWTNrYU,@AMAN PANDEY Okay bud,2021-01-12T15:14:27Z
LTaufWTNrYU,So I would advise everyone to wait for realme x7 series since they are going to offer a 5g chipset and that to with a amoled screen and around 17k which would be far better than this deal I regret for my impatience and this 108 camera is not at all a big deal even a 64  and 48mp quad cameras equivalent to it and all those additional features which are there in this stock cameras from clowning function which I am using since morning it takes a lots of time in processing and the post processed photo is not good I don't wether it is there with only my device or it is a common problem so wait for more 5gs to come even the Samsung today has teased a new exynoss which is clearly a new 5g chipset from samsung which was Rumuoured launch around 26 January and would be priced same as m51 so I would also suggest to wait for it rather than buying m51 and realme x7 is also coming around that time.,2021-01-12T15:09:24Z
LTaufWTNrYU,@deepak dabral Okay bro.,2021-01-12T15:01:45Z
LTaufWTNrYU,@AMAN PANDEY this helps for sure. Thanks bud,2021-01-12T15:01:30Z
LTaufWTNrYU,Even I am using it I would rate it 8.5 out  of 10 since I switched from realme 6 pro therefore the difference is visible I am able to feel it though I have given that phone to my mom but that phones ui was much much better mi 10i shutters here and there despite having such a good hardware just because of ui if they didn't bring some changes in the ui it is advisable to wait and buy the  realme x7 series which I am regretting now since firstly I ordered m51 but thought about future proofing my buy thus sacrificing the amoled display and much better camera of m51 cancelled the order in the very 1st hour of ordering after watching the reviews of this phone but if someone has used a stock Android phone or a realme's ui then they are definitely going to find lots of flaws in the ui's it is like since in sports one need time to get warmed up then can perform up to or equivalent to mark therefore the time difference is there between the below average and average performance similarly mi 10i takes some time in switching to average performance from initial below average performance which is not at all there in any other phones of this price range and even the 10-15k phones of realme work like butter from start itself I should have considered the poor performance of ui which bottlenecks the hardware,2021-01-12T14:59:38Z

- Dow jones industrial avg in Red. 
- SGX Nifty in Red. 
- S&P 500 in Red.
- NASDAQ 100 in Red.
- European Mkt in Red.
- Nifty P/E beyond 40+ whereas it is supposed to be at 21.
- Dollar Strong.
- Crude & Gold Dropped.
- New corona identified So fear of lockdown in Europe.
- Budget on 01 Feb.
- DII in negative.

Only thing holding mkt up are the FII‚Äôs ... any day any time they will exit in panic of budget. Nifty will Crash 1000-2000 points. 

Max high can be 15000 but drop will be 12000. So gain is limited now and loss will be Huge. So exit & save your capital. Reinvest when its at bottom.",2021-01-16T02:42:11Z

NvUK53srVyU,"Hi Sven, why did you remove the whole PV row? How does it have to do with dividends?",2021-06-08T19:47:30Z
NvUK53srVyU,"Hi Sven, when you evaluate a company of which the free cash flow has grown an average of, lets say, 80% per year for the last five years, how does that play in your model? Do you do the best case scenario as continuing that sort of growth for the next 5 and then half for the other five? 

I feel that it is very hard to evaluate a company with such high growth rates. They all seem undervalued. Look at Innoviva (INVA)... constant increase of free cash flow of over 300% per year in the last 5 years: $323.74M - $254.26M - $250.27M - $163.9M - $81.22M - $19M

NvUK53srVyU,"I remember about a year a go when you bought it. that time I asked you if it pays dividends. you answer me Not it doesn't, so I didn't bay it. However; since then I have been watching all your videos And I have been learning a lot of stocks. I truly appreciate your videos. Thanks.
 ** Last year (from today) I made 75.74%.  GOOG made 75.05%, but if I would bay  GOOG inside. I will have so much time off to enjoy.

Just one question/comment on the 10% expected rate of return that you show on your spreadsheet analyses, is it fair to adjust this based on the perceived risk?

In contrast, the EU is supporting old media outlets at the expense of big tech, also using those huge cash flows to skim some money from time to time. 
And in the US there are serious anger towards social media platforms, from progressives as they regard them as outlets for far right demagogues and from the conservatives who see them as progressive-leaning, censoring propagandists.

NvUK53srVyU,"Hi Sven,
As always amazing analysis. I think Google is one of the best if not the best tech company out there.
I wanted to give you some feedback thou, personally I think that the privacy concerns with Google are serious, I stopped using Google search a while back now and use the browser Brave which helps a lot with privacy. It also pays you for watching ads, but you can also turn them off. The ""coins"" that pay you are called BAT and can be used to convert to dollar or donate to content producers (such as yourself). Google has always been shady with how they use data of users so I believe it's a serious concern going forward.
Also political scrutiny should be stronger in the future.
In any case, it's an amazing business. Keep it going! 
Cheers from Italy",2021-04-18T16:25:33Z

NvUK53srVyU,Fyi: I have stop using their search. Other platforms are just as good with better privacy and less censorship. I would change viewing platforms as well if enough creators moved. I know that I probably don't represent a trend yet but I was very surprised by how good the competing platform was. Search may not have the moat you think it does.,2021-04-18T13:49:38Z
NvUK53srVyU,"Duckduckgo might be small, but their growth rate is accelerating. I believe they are a bigger threat to Google search and web browser than most people realize. I think the name holds them back",2021-04-20T03:35:28Z
NvUK53srVyU,"Startpage, duckduckgo, ecosia",2021-04-18T22:16:24Z
NvUK53srVyU,@Bhavin Palan I do use duckduckgo. I was not trying to advertise for them on a competing platform but here we are. I am curious about what benefits and conveniences you mean. At least for what I use it for I have found it comparable or even superior in some aspects. Possibly I just don't use those functions.,2021-04-18T19:01:53Z
NvUK53srVyU,"Competitors like duckduckgo hardly provide the benefits/convenience that google search provides through  personalization features which you and I are so accustomed to. Getting away from that is very hard. Google has a great moat around that, especially as search improves as more users use it every day.",2021-04-18T18:31:52Z
NvUK53srVyU,thanks for sharing - for now their share remains at 80%,2021-04-18T18:13:02Z
NvUK53srVyU,@kimbeyjay what alternatives are you using? i use duckduckgo alot but still find myself going back to google for some things,2021-04-18T16:40:22Z
NvUK53srVyU,I also left their browser as well.,2021-04-18T14:07:46Z
NvUK53srVyU,"Great analysis, as allways. Though last year in May, you made a video on google where you focused much more on the fact that the future growth is unknown and that it slows down. You focused on the risk that it underperforms a lot if growth is not there as expected (decline in delta of the delta). While you did not conclude that it was not a buy, your main focus was on the risk and it did not check many of your boxes (already global thus limeted growth potential, slowing down, risky high PE and so on). Back then it was at 1350$, so roughly 40% cheaper than today. Now you mention that it might become interesting when it crashes 50%. Shouldn't it have been very interesting back then when it was at these levels that we are now hoping to see again? ;-)",2021-04-18T13:46:07Z

NvUK53srVyU,"Hi, Sven. Would like to see your analysis on these companies:  Qualys(QLYS),  Vertex(VRTX),  Vistra(VST).  Imho, they are undervalued and I own them in my portfolio already.
Another interesting company is Schrodinger (SDGR). They create software for drug discovery. Bill Gates owns about 10% of it. Also, recently the company made partnership with Nvidia for their HPC platform.",2021-04-18T13:12:46Z

NvUK53srVyU,@Erik Berg Thanks for the comments on BABA. I'm going to look into that one.,2021-04-18T16:21:47Z
NvUK53srVyU,@Erik Berg so does Amazon but at least you can rest assured the US government isn't going to randomly start investigating and fining them billions. BABA will only be worthwhile if Xi stops being a crazy dictator. It's not gonna happen.,2021-04-18T16:06:50Z
NvUK53srVyU,"@Erik Berg BABA is currently out-of-favor due to problems with the government. EM's are also relatively cheap compared to US. Could turn out to be brilliant value investment. For GOOG, the next crisis or if the Dept. of Justice opens an anti-trust case against Alphabet, might present an attractive buying opportunity. Remember, it is more than search, there is YouTube, Waymo, etc. Great businesses are rarely cheap.",2021-04-18T16:01:49Z
NvUK53srVyU,@Kiru Girum They have almost the entire Chinese market plus part of the rest of the world and the Chinese economy is running on all cylinders now.,2021-04-18T15:55:59Z
NvUK53srVyU,@Erik Berg yeah you've proven my point. It's a smaller foreign company carrying a lot more risk than the American big tech competitors. Buy it if you want but I'd rather stick to what I know and use everyday.,2021-04-18T15:52:34Z
NvUK53srVyU,@Kiru Girum Try Munger's BABA.,2021-04-18T15:50:05Z
NvUK53srVyU,@Erik Berg yes they were... Google was less than a $1000 two or three years ago. And yeah you could buy smaller companies with bigger growth potential but they'd be alot more riskier/volatile too.,2021-04-18T15:47:10Z
NvUK53srVyU,"@Kiru Girum They weren't priced between $250 and $3,300 during the last ten years...depending on the stock. In any case, there are so many cheaper stocks and so many search engines now.",2021-04-18T15:40:23Z
NvUK53srVyU,@Erik Berg Google and the other big tech stocks currently trade at similar pe ratios than they have in the last ten years. They've always been deemed expensive.,2021-04-18T15:36:33Z
NvUK53srVyU,"@N Reed Not really. Charlie Munger just bought a lot of BABA and Warren Buffett bought a lot of VZ. They don't usually buy bubbles. They probably believe at least BABA is significantly undervalued. I suspect Buffett bought VZ for the solid good dividend and because it's also a pretty safe bet. In another video even Sven says BABA, BIDU and Tencent are undervalued. Those are the top three Chinese internet stocks.Also, BABA and BIDU went down significantly. I suspect Munger wouldn't be buying BABA unless he was pretty sure that it would not go down very much more even in a crash. Charlie rarely buys anything.",2021-04-18T15:28:23Z
NvUK53srVyU,"@Erik Berg We're in an Everything Bubble. Everything is overpriced, but Big Tech names seem less overpriced than a lot of businesses. Plus, you're getting quality and moats. I feel better about investing in Alphabet than bitcoin or many other things.",2021-04-18T14:22:33Z

-4ZR07iVQAE,"I prefer stock camera of RN10PMax over GCAM. Xiaomi has done an excellent job for the color grading. Highlight Management,  good Shadows, excellent dynamic Range, Details. Kudos. Only problem is Over sharpening. But I guess it brings out texture more in photos, but still Too much over sharpening can ruin Human subjects but excellent for landscapes. GCAM doesnt even come close this time, All that tailored image processing for RedmiN10PMax is woofed in an instant. As if google worked on Samsung HM2. LOL Obviously Stock cam is better. 

But for the 64MP camera of the regualr Note 10 Pro GCAM does better, Xiaomi has not really put in much effort, too much magenta tones , too warm color tones, Dynamic range sucks Shadows are crushed too aggressively. And being the 64MP Sensor which is recognized by GCAM (Found in a lot of devices) so there GCAM Makes sense.

But for RN10PMax the 108MP HM2 is still not optimized in all the GCAM ports, really poor results. But seriously it doesn't need GCAM at all for its primary. Xiaomi has extracted all there is to give with HM2 and SD 732G ISP Processing.",2021-04-20T03:27:10Z

As leverage increases from 0 to L‚Äô value increases. Moving past L‚Äô and value tends to go back down. 
The median US firm has L‚Äô at 30%.
Should be noted not all firms have the same optimal leverage. Cash flow volatility, tangibility of assets, size, profitability and Market to book ratios all effect L‚Äô.

Having some debt helps to keep more of the profit in the company instead of paying in taxes. Debt is also better in some cases when the company don't want to increase stakeholder in the establishment through stocks. Once the debt is paid, no need to worry about sharing the profits with outside partners. When comes to reinvesting in the business debt provides leverage that expands the operation much faster rate than equity. Mostly for these reasons debts are structured in all operation's finance.",2021-12-08T13:49:02Z

w6XybOvBzII,"As you have got the developer preview version of OOS 12, kindly give feedback to OnePlus team to have a design consistency like One UI in this new OS. Last time OOS 11 was a half baked UI . Also some important features are missing from Oneplus for a long time now,, Oxygen OS should overhaul their camera ui and add more features there as miui,one ui have ton of camera features. If they can't improve their camera algorithm then at least increase good and useful features. Also they should overhaul their gaming interface as Oxygen OS has the least features in its gaming tool. This new Oxygen OS should include the feature of recording both system and microphone sounds simultaneously in screen recording . And a video toolbox like miui should be included. There is no problem of having color os features in Oxygen OS if they give all the better features of Colour OS in Oxygen OS without loosing its identity.",2021-08-23T06:48:30Z

I believe they're going to be in several headsets in the market & grow at an accelerated rate from here (especially with the billions that are being invested already in the metaverse) and with them being perfectly suited for the gaming / virtual reality (VR) market... which is expected to grow as a whole at a 48.7% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next 5 years.",2021-11-18T17:52:29Z

IJIHdCNDPZw,"Is there any Google stock alphabet Inc class c ? I found in mutual fund , is there any Google subsidiary  stock",2021-04-10T08:25:00Z
IJIHdCNDPZw,"Google (Alphabet) is an amazing stock to buy, in my opinion, for these reasons:
1.	Strong revenue growth with an expected growth of 23.9% for 2021
2.	Low forward P/E ratio of 26, considering it continues to have double digit revenue growth
3.	The market for Google search, YouTube and Google Cloud will continue to have strong growth, in my opinion, as Google search seems to be essential in almost every aspect of life.  YouTube also continues to produce top quality content for every niche category you can think of and will help eliminate cable in conjunction with Netflix, in my opinion.
4.	Alphabet‚Äôs financial statements are incredible with strong revenue growth 12.77% in 2020 even when it was in a worst-case scenario with lockdowns and reduced advertising budgets.  Google‚Äôs paid clicks for advertising was up 19% in and impressions were up 15% in 2020.  
5.	The company is highly profitable and has an incredible balance sheet with $136.7 billion of cash and marketable securities.
6.	Alphabet stock seems like such a safe investment, in my opinion, compared to many other high flying tech stocks trading at 50+ forward P/E ratios.  I sleep very well at night holding Alphabet in my stock portfolio.

As with every company, Google stock also has some risks.  There is a risk of government intervention on how Google collects and uses its customers data and there is a risk the government may try to break up the company which I believe is unlikely to happen.

I got a Google Chromecast about 5 years ago and used it for a while but since then I got a new TV and haven't touched the Chromecast since because it's not needed. The same for Roku?

I'm in agreement with this video, I own Google (4th biggest holding) but I just find it funny how I was having a conversation with my friend who is a computer scientist and he told me ""Palantir has more potential than Facebook as far as data goes, and just as much as Google."" and watching this I remembered watching your video on PLTR lol... anyways, maybe with the research you'll like it with time. If you want to wait a long time for it to be ""established"" like Google is... that's fine too, that comes at a premium though of course. My friend is an investor as well (not a trader) and his research led him to believe his PT of $500 by 2025.
If you want to *TRY* to understand it better... all the info is on Google/Youtube (Ironic... Get it? On a google investing video? LOL) Search for ""Leaked"" videos on PLTR, watch the demo they have (multiple times if you have to) and look for ""How L.A. Police Department uses Palantir.""

For example, if your own channel is only slowly growing or stagnating in terms of views while your ad revenue is increasing without you adding more commercial breaks than usual, it means google is making more money from ads.

suKDXyuMlAU,"Over the last 50 years, the average PE for companies in the S&P 500 is 19.4, and over the last 30 years it is about 24. PE is highly correlated to Interest rates, which have averaged about 2.6% over the last 30 years, and been below 5% for 77% of that time. Even if rates were to rise to about 3.5% long term, I would expect a 22ish PE to be reasonable given a regression analysis I did. 

If you use a 22 PE for Google and your other assumptions stay the same, GOOG looks close to fair value (maybe a touch over-valued). I'd be a strong buyer under 2600!

I would highly recommend you update your baseline for what P/E to use. Would be happy to share this data with you, as I think it would help make for more accurate stock analysis.",2021-11-03T17:31:08Z

suKDXyuMlAU,"@The Fishing Nomad I GUARANTEE he does not look at interest rates. And I don't think you should in the short term. However, in the long term, we are likely never going back to interest rates of 20% like in the 80s, when the average PE was 10. I would expect ""normalized"" PEs to be 18-25 in the future. I personally use 22 as the average, which is actually lower than the S&P500 PE over the last 30 years.",2021-11-04T03:46:33Z
suKDXyuMlAU,"@The Fishing Nomad I agree you should have a margin of safety, but using 14 is about at least a 30% buffer. As well, I find he uses pretty conservative numbers as it is (8% growth despite it having grown 19% per year over the last 10 years,). I prefer to use accurate numbers, and then work the buffer in afterwards. Again, it's about being able to have a bit of a margin of safety, but not such a big one that you never invest in great companies if the value is close.",2021-11-04T03:43:21Z

I mean imagine clicking a single button and pic gets processed by both gcam and stock camera. That way they can cover each other's weakness and we can just select the pic we like better and delete the other,2021-03-03T07:24:58Z

Essentially this means that in the document the value of the british stocks will be calculated incorrectly by a factor of 100. Due to them being taken as GBP instead of GBX or GBp. For examply your Rolls Royce RR.L holding is valued at ¬£102.95 per share but that price is actually in pence so in reality it should be ¬£1.0295 per share.",2021-03-23T15:11:20Z

CmOsvJObZpk,Please do a stock analysis on Citigroup and Goldman Sachs,2021-08-02T18:38:25Z
CmOsvJObZpk,"Paul has a fundamental misunderstanding of macroeconomics. One of the reasons why people are willing to pay 30 P/E for a fast growing tech company, is that treasuries - which currently pay about 2% - are essentially 50 P/E (2% interest rate). So you can buy Google at 30 P/E, Treasuries at 50 P/E, or hold cash and get hammered annually by inflation. It‚Äôs not that the market is irrational, it‚Äôs that the other investment alternatives (cash, bonds) have higher P/Es.

Historical P/E ratios were lower, because interest rates used to be much higher. The P/E the market will accept, has ALWAYS been partially a consequence of interest rate.

So unless you think treasury interest rates are going to triple to 6% (16 P/E) within the next seven years, Google at 12 P/E is a stretch.",2021-08-02T18:36:54Z

CmOsvJObZpk,"Good video, but to me google FVE for a 15% return would be around 2400 if I assumed they could grow at a 17% growth rate(which is somewhat conservative considering analyst estimates). Also one would have to adjust for cash. I think 17% is a fair growth rate considering their historical growth rate and the fact that the new ventures they have put money into like Verily, Waymo, Google Cloud, etc. will pay off and their margins could expand. Additionally, unless interest rates raise a lot or something else happens, I think a PE of 25 is fair in 5 years for them. Youtube, Google Cloud, and others will come to make up a larger percentage of revenue in the future as I see it, so I think buying the company today one can expect market-beating returns with somewhat conservative forecasts.",2021-08-02T17:15:45Z

F5OAbECJP8g,I really hope you continue this. This is really helpful. I'm a registered nurse trying to learn more about reading balance sheets. Thank you!,2022-02-11T15:47:33Z
F5OAbECJP8g,"Mr. Stewart says it's a conserwative forecast. The growth rate - may be, but the multiples and FCF yield are not conservative at all.",2022-01-23T23:13:51Z
F5OAbECJP8g,"Does anyone know how he gets the figures used for Debt ST + LT at around 2:31?  LT Debt is easy to find, but I can't find the figures used to add the ST debt and need help.  It appears that there are 5 years from 2012-2020 where there is NO ST Debt, while other years like 2019 and 2020 where the ST debt outweighs the LT debt.  Investopedia defines ST debt as 'current liabilities' that the company is obliged to pay off in <12 mos, but that definition seems rather vague and I can't pinpoint an exact number in the balance sheet.  Can anyone recommend solutions to find the historical data for Alphabet's ST debt so I can arrive at the same figures Cameron is using?",2021-12-16T20:32:57Z

F5OAbECJP8g,"Does anyone know what he specifically means by excess cash? As far as I understood, he used the Other Short Term Investments account on the balance sheet as Excess Cash. However as far as I know, in the calculation for the net debt, we have to subtract cash equivalents from net debt.

Can you help clear things out? Thanks!",2021-05-19T17:45:42Z
F5OAbECJP8g,"Hey Cameron, amazing content as always. Could you check out Royalty Pharma ($RPRX)? It has a unique business model being in the pharmaceutical sector, where they invest into receiving royalties of various drugs that pharma companies sell. I watched the video on BMY, and one point you raised was that, certain drugs sometimes fail to get FDA approval which is why we should look for higher IRR when investing in these companies. Royalty Pharma most of the times, invests in already approved and growing drugs and receives royalty payments on it for the life of the patent, thus reducing the risk of failure and also no risk of any lawsuits later on, should the drug unfortunately have any adverse side effects even after approval. The advantage for the pharma companies is that they can then take that money and invest it into research for their next drug. And as for royalty pharma, it gets a diversified exposure to the various drugs sold by these pharma companies. It's a win win for both!",2021-05-19T11:22:36Z

F5OAbECJP8g,"Decreasing the projected EBITDA multiple (compared to the current 28 multiple) to be conservative, is reasonable to me.  Going with a more optimisitc projected free cash flow yield of 2,5% (rather than current 3,6%) is, as usual beyond me. And as usual I strongly suspect this to be the reason why the FCF valuation ends up much higher (almost 50% in this case) than the EBITDA valuation. However, at this point I have given up to hope for an explanation from Cameron on this issue. :-(

Appart from that a great video.",2021-05-12T21:54:58Z
F5OAbECJP8g,"@Cameron Stewart, CFA Thanks for the reply. No objections against two estimators. My only suggestion would be to be more careful when deciding on the yield, especially at these low percentage numbers. The difference between a 5% and a 2.5% yield is the equivalent of a 20 vs 40 multiple.",2021-05-17T09:13:07Z
F5OAbECJP8g,"@kai Jager,  You might be right on the yield, perhaps that's too low.  I'll watch that more closely in the future.   Good thing I use 2 price estimators. :)",2021-05-17T01:11:49Z
F5OAbECJP8g,@Aaron Brown thx,2021-05-14T23:58:47Z
F5OAbECJP8g,"@Sennettdamanz An it is out of line with the EBITDA multiple that he uses. Yield and multiple are essentially different expression of the same thing. A 2.5% yield is the equivalent of a P/FCF ratio of 40 (as you said 40 years). It always appears strange that he is so optimistic with his FCF yield but conservative with his EBITDA multiple. And almost always the FCF projections ends up higher...suprise. 

Sadly he never adresses it, even though I have noted it under a lot of his videos. 
Tbh. There have been other issues that seemed strange in his videos. He added the total float for an innsurance to the earnings instead of just the return on the invested capital. No doubt that Cameron is good at what he is doing, but I am weary that there might be hidden ""mistakes"" in some of his calculations that could bite investors in the butt later on.",2021-05-13T14:04:04Z

CegiUCH1q_g,Somewhere between the mid and high estimate was the current price for Google,2021-11-10T22:05:52Z
CegiUCH1q_g,"if google was not ban in China, Baidu wouldn‚Äôt be Baidu today in China. Outside of China who use Baidu?",2021-10-16T16:00:01Z
CegiUCH1q_g,Why would you take a chance on Chinese stocks at this moment.  You seem to be minimizing the risk of the CCP.  President Xi is a diehard communist.  Chairman Mao is a hero of his.  He does not believe in Capitalism and is trying to consolidate power so he can become ‚Äúpresident for life ‚Äú.  People think he would not harm his largest companies.  They are making this argument looking through the lens of western capitalism.  That is not China.  There are too many good companies out there to take the on the risk of CCP.  These companies sell at a huge discount for a reason.,2021-10-09T13:48:24Z
CegiUCH1q_g,@9:10 lol that was actually one of the most ignorant statements I have heard in MY life....does Moe really think the CCP is going to allow Google to be the dominant search engine in China?!,2021-10-06T21:55:09Z
CegiUCH1q_g,Writing on the whiteboard is extremely blurry.  So I‚Äôm not sure what the buy price was for baidu.,2021-10-06T18:41:59Z
CegiUCH1q_g,Nice explanation between Baidu and Google. Keep up the good work. I would be interested in your perspective on FMX.,2021-10-05T14:06:07Z
CegiUCH1q_g,"How them bags looking? You buy when people are forced to liquidate? That is just dumb. Let it get lower. You don't have to be the first on the train. You should tell people to wait to buy. Let the dust settle.  

Yeah you might not get in at the absolute bottom, but WHERE IS THE BOTTOM?  The Chinese stocks are being margin called.  You don't buy into that.",2021-10-04T05:55:44Z
CegiUCH1q_g,"Love your content, but i can't agree sell Google low then buy high. Could just be a shake out. Break out trading works sometimes, but wouldn't try on a power stock after such a nice dip",2021-10-04T03:19:26Z
CegiUCH1q_g,Y‚Äôall should watch the China Hustle documentary. This would actually educate you & save you from lighting your money on fire ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù in China.,2021-10-04T00:49:22Z

Do you cover MOS mentally after the fact or is it essentially the conservative and aggressive target price? (E.g. conservative price is essentially high MOS where as aggressive is limited to no MOS. - may have missed this on a past video of you covered it prior

It would be more tax efficient for the company to take the amount of the dividend and buy their own shares back so you are not taxed until you recognize capital gains which is taxed at a lower rate.,2021-10-27T13:45:51Z

For example when typing in AAPL, this part of the URL: ""quote/AAPL?p=AAPL&.tsrc=fin-srch-v1"", no longer is recognized by importHTML. I initially suspected it is because instead of generating a new HTML which can be imported, they are now using a script to modify the current HTML, so the quote part of the URL was not seen by google sheets and only the browser that is currently viewing it can read it.

-I modified the market value with *GOOGLEFINANCE(""CURRENCY:USDCAD"") for my USD stocks to get an accurate impact of exchange rate fluctuations.
-I incorporated my fees into my adjusted Average Cost per shares

0tky8n9nUQw,"Thanks Jack for the update. One feature I would like to see is, instead of always updating average cost and total shares, is there a way we can add a tab which shows list of all transactions individually with price at which they are bought. The main sheet can consolidate that information. 

This will be handy because let‚Äôs say example:
In my personal account I have 4 shares of mfc at 27$
In my TFSA account I have 11 shares at 22.67$. Now for me to average them out maybe challenging. I hope this explaination helps.

RYQOR6J6Hvg,Works great. The hodl part is annoying though. Makes it so you basically get emails everyday. I just removed HODL notification and now I only get emails when price is buy or sell. So i dont get bombarded with emails everyday and only once in a blue moon when i need it to.,2021-09-07T14:49:42Z
RYQOR6J6Hvg,"Everything seems fine. Follow along and all works as planned. Just never receive the email after I run the script. Script says it executed fine. I tried 6 different emails, including a Gmail one. I never receive the emails.",2021-08-09T21:11:08Z
RYQOR6J6Hvg,"Hey man, just wanted to thank you and Torrin for this content! It helped me a lot. To make the code even better, I have a couple of suggestions: 
1 - define a cell in the sheet to put your Email in. That way you don't need to modify the code when you want to change the Email.
2 - I've removed the ""range.clear()"" line. That way the sheet will store if a previous Email has been sent and do that check in the IF condition every time  it runs, stopping the flood of repeated messages. Later on if you don't need the stock alert anymore, you can simply delete the line.

Here's an example of the code I've implemented (I've changed the numbers in the ss.getRange bit, as my code is a little different):

var email = sksheet.getRange(""C3"").getValue();           //GET THE EMAIL FROM CELL C3


  if(email == """") { 
                                    //IF THE EMAIL CELL IS EMPTY, DO NOTHING
  } else {
    for (var i = 2; i<n+1; i++) {
      var emailRequired = ss.getRange(i,8).getValue();

      var subject = ss.getRange(i,10).getValue();
      var message = ss.getRange(i,11).getValue();
      if (emailRequired==""YES"" ) {                                     //IF EMAIL IS REQUIRED AND HAS NOT BEEN SENT YET
        MailApp.sendEmail(email,subject,message);      //USES THE VARIABLE email PREVIOUSLY DEFINED
        ss.getRange(i,9).setValue(""YES"");
        
      }
    }
  }


Hope it helps, cheers!",2021-07-22T14:51:40Z

RYQOR6J6Hvg,@lauro looks like u are pretty strong with sheets and as well as stock market .. i am beginnier to both the fields... Can u please let me know what code or function u will write to have the current avg price of a share which u r holding ? (Consider u have had many transactions of the same stock and the fuc/code u write should show the avg price as per the current holdings ) i have seen many videos all just consider the buy shares and apply average.moving but it gives wrong in some scenarios like we buy 5qty of a stock A for 100 each ..so avg is 100 but next day suppose u sell 2qty for some price and 3rd day u again buy 5 qty at 150 each... So the avg should be (3*100+5*150)/8 ...but everywhere they simply apply fr all the buy transactions so it will be (5*100+5*150)/10 ..so its wrong,2021-08-25T06:40:37Z

Fidelity considers Amazon as a large growth company (probably because as big as it is, it still only has 7% of the retail market)

- The Crow (Immortality)

Revelation12
""And I heard a loud voice saying in Heaven, Now is come SALVATION, and STRENGTH, and the Kingdom of our God, and the POWER of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.""

""Therefore rejoice,¬†ye¬†Heavens, and ye that dwell in them. WOE to the inhabiters of the Earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having GREAT WRATH, because he knoweth that he hath but a SHORT TIME.""

""And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman (Bride of Christ) which brought forth the man¬†child.""

""And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle (Rapture), that she might FLY into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, FROM the face of the serpent.""

""And the serpent cast out of his mouth WATER AS¬† A FLOOD (Russia's Posiden Weapon) after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.""

""And the Earth helped the woman, and the earth OPENED HER MOUTH (Giant Earthquake), and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.""

""And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the REMNANT (Those Left Behind) of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.""

1 Corinthians 15
""BEHOLD... I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep (Me), but we shall ALL (You woken out of Sleep) be changed,""

""In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be RAISED incorruptible (Bride of Christ, Raptured), and we shall be CHANGED!""

""For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal¬†must¬†put on IMMORTALITY.""

""So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have PUT ON IMMORTALITY (Me Raptured), then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is SWALLOWED up in VICTORY.""

""O death, where¬†is¬†thy sting? O grave, where¬†is¬†thy victory?""

""The STING OF DEATH IS ¬†SIN; and the strength of sin¬†is¬†the law.""

""But thanks¬†be¬†to God, which giveth us the VICTORY through our Lord Jesus Christ.""

""Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye STEADFAST, UNMOVABLE, always ABOUNDING IN THE WORK OF THE LORD, forasmuch as ye know that your LABOUR IS NOT IN VAIN in the Lord.""¬†(Those Left Behind)

‚ÄúBut every man in his own order: Christ the Firstfruits; AFTERWARD they that are Christ's at his coming.‚Äù

Revelation 20:4
‚ÄúAnd I saw thrones, and they sat upon them (Russia, China), and JUDGMENT was given unto them: and¬†I saw¬†the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had NOT worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received¬†HIS¬†MARK upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.‚Äù

BlBGh1ow-Jw,"@deepak pareek books are not a good media for teaching Spreadsheet. video is by far 10 times better. Just search GoogleSheets on Youtube you should have more than enough to learn. In the last decade, I have learnt from scratch in building website simply by watching youtube. And of course it depends on your luck in running into a good video matching your needs. However, YouTube is by far the most effective learning tool for me in the last decade.

The key challenge in learning spreadsheet is the complicated wrapping of functions within functions. They way I develop the spreadsheets as shown in this video is my long tried method in developing complex formula by copy and pasting the formula within another formula. It helps to break a very complex logic into smaller chunks.

If you can handle what I have shown in this video, it's likely that you are already a very advance user.  If you understand but cannot apply it on your own idea, it's likely that you need to ""try to do it"" so many times that one day it just ""click"" in your brain.

This is how I learnt anyway, through years of trial-and-error.",2021-05-10T18:47:58Z
BlBGh1ow-Jw,"‚Äã@deepak pareek yes. Sounds like a logical step. It will be a complex combo of index(), match(), max() and googlefinance().

Range of stock on march 16 is 100 to 105. Step 3  Compare the current stock price with Range. If the stock is above 105 it is bullish, If below 100 is it bearish. If between 100 to105 it is neutral.",2021-05-10T18:05:06Z
BlBGh1ow-Jw,@deepak pareek Ok. The whole thing is just to match the date using match() to find the index( like a row) within the range and  then use GoogleFinance to find the OHLC data of that specific date. then you can comparison with current price from Google Finance.,2021-05-10T17:54:00Z
BlBGh1ow-Jw,"@Stan Suen CMP is current market price. suppose the highest volumes candle of last 100 days happened on say 17thMarch 2021 and that day stock was between 100 to 105. Now on say 5th april 2021, the stock closed above the 105. so it is bullish stock. so basically comparision of current market price of stock and higher volumes candle range gives the stock view.",2021-05-10T17:46:46Z

_4msUWspeOI,Your analysis is on target and credible. I have been a customer of SOFI very long time and only decided to invest in it recently. I bought 1000 shares last month and bought some long term call options then. It went down about 7% but I was convinced it would go up to around $30 in a year or so. Now it went up 10% or so. Both holdings are in the positive area and I plan to hold them long term.,2021-10-11T17:27:54Z

So for Google Pay and Samsung Pay to powered by SOFI would hopefully mean a consolidation of both mobile payment platforms.  I'm not so sure on this one but would be great if so.

These are facts. 
Auto drive vehicles is generally a bad idea. They've had auto pilot on airplanes for nearly 50+ years. If they had auto driving buses that stay in one lane than i can see this being a good move and help the auto infrastructure.

I also see millions of Fords and GMs i rarely see a Tesla and when I do I think its a Chrysler (lol)
No offense to Elon cuz he is a nice & smooth criminal but in a America Id bet Tesla will not become popular. Its more like seeing a Porsche or a Maserati but a cheap version. Hopefully GM or Ford get MVIS and it is the root of safety feature enhancement to reduce accidents. 
However i woudnt feel comfy letting my car drive for me 100%.
Both my 2020 and 2021 GM vehicles drive auto ""within the lines and has sensors all around that gives a heads up on the scene your driving in. Ive used it driving thru the most dangerous road in Arizona and it saved me from falling off a cliff. So now I live to tell... üòâ

SMJSNYzKa6I,"I agree with your views on CHPT and DIS. I was surprised to hear Charlie giving those long term buy n hold. I love GOOG, but want a better deal and will wait. I watched TTs vid yesterday on TGT but I‚Äôm a little sceptical of that price too - its pricey when you look at it and I‚Äôm not convinced of their online compared to others. TSLA I don‚Äôt want pay above 1K. Snagged some in the low 900s and will wait and see if there are other opps. I like V for a long term hold, but where was Charlie $20+ ago. I got a little at this current price on the way down, but bought the dip on it sub 200.  Great video today!!!",2021-12-23T14:03:04Z

8iqUTjZeVyM,May I ask which stock should one buy now please?,2021-04-17T09:42:05Z
8iqUTjZeVyM,"Google (Alphabet) is an amazing stock to buy, in my opinion, for these reasons:
1.	Strong revenue growth with an expected growth of 23.9% for 2021
2.	Low forward P/E ratio of 26, considering it continues to have double digit revenue growth
3.	The market for Google search, YouTube and Google Cloud will continue to have strong growth, in my opinion, as Google search seems to be essential in almost every aspect of life.  YouTube also continues to produce top quality content for every niche category you can think of and will help eliminate cable in conjunction with Netflix, in my opinion.
4.	Alphabet‚Äôs financial statements are incredible with strong revenue growth 12.77% in 2020 even when it was in a worst-case scenario with lockdowns and reduced advertising budgets.  Google‚Äôs paid clicks for advertising was up 19% in and impressions were up 15% in 2020.  
5.	The company is highly profitable and has an incredible balance sheet with $136.7 billion of cash and marketable securities.
6.	Alphabet stock seems like such a safe investment, in my opinion, compared to many other high flying tech stocks trading at 50+ forward P/E ratios.  I sleep very well at night holding Alphabet in my stock portfolio.

As with every company, Google stock also has some risks.  There is a risk of government intervention on how Google collects and uses its customers data and there is a risk the government may try to break up the company which I believe is unlikely to happen.

wL2SjDtvu7U,What about GOOGL?,2021-06-20T16:30:51Z
wL2SjDtvu7U,It can take a decade to see a drop in this stock and the new 1000 could be 4000 at this time. Stocks grow over time and quality growth blue-chips and Google/Youtube are monopoly and have wide economic moats they deserve a premium. The 33 p/e / 25 p/fcf this year will be like 20 p/e 15 p/fcf same date in 2022. It's more like 2250 than 1000 a good entry point unless you never want to own it or only want to buy it at a higher price in a decade after a global crash. So we all need to sell FAANG and go cash or buy Intel 55.30-1.88 (-3.29%) because they are cheap and hope they don't get eaten by better technology and management team. The 1% earnings yield you really want this year you get it with shares buyback.,2021-06-18T17:40:26Z

It was kind of annoying to not see it go up as much as the other tech stocks last Summer... took me a while to realize it was more of a recovery play for when things opened up.

 I think it'll pull back some though, old Joe Biden will raise the corporate and capital tax or threaten to break up monopolies to appease the poors and have good soundbytes on CNN. It may drop 10% in a week. But Biden won't do anything to them because they are lining his pockets and all his constituents too. Not to mention Google controls what you see on the news so they will only post favorable Biden stories to your news feed. Bottom line when it pulls back, I guess just buy more Google.",2021-04-29T07:50:51Z

OPw6aHWxM00,Will Google Pixel 6 come to India?,2021-09-28T13:34:35Z
OPw6aHWxM00,Bro can u please tell which is best between realme x7 max and iqoo7 for long term use.... based on overall performance...and subscribers ur thoughts also...,2021-09-28T13:20:00Z
OPw6aHWxM00,Bro what about software support,2021-09-28T13:19:51Z
OPw6aHWxM00,"Nope it doesn't make any sense to buy Google Pixel right now with so many good options.
1. After spending more than 25k the phone definitely should have 5g and it's the deal-breaker I guess.
2. Yes the camera is good but hardware isn't just try taking multiple photos at once the phone will have queue of photos to process and just a single cam no ultra-wide which also a bummer.
3. No higher refresh rate 
4. No fast-charging and whatever the optimization is it will be a bummer for a slightly heavy user.
5. Lastly the design of the phone will remind you of a under 10k phone with very generic camera module and plastic build with just a single color option(though the build quality is good).

If Pixel buds were at 1k with it than it would have a been killer deal but at 26k Pixel is just for the very very niche people who just want a stock android or a good camera that too for still photography.",2021-09-28T13:13:20Z
OPw6aHWxM00,you know this phone is not for everyone definately not for mumbo jumbo lovers. so you can stay away,2022-02-05T16:02:31Z
OPw6aHWxM00,"Google photos unlimited storage for 4a, if u don't know. 
All wants 5G..Bt it comes after 1.5- 2 years later, that time present 5g device's battery efficiency already down by 60-70 %... later they start using 5g at that efficiency level wch may cost heavy on battery backup...",2021-10-08T23:12:30Z
OPw6aHWxM00,"@Mubashir Tanwar It would have been fair paying extra for the experience when processor, display, build and charging were almost same or little difference not day and night difference. The pixel experience can also be enjoyed on a custom rom. And you want to just brag and be a nerd just for using Pixel that's totally fine bro.",2021-09-30T07:29:14Z
OPw6aHWxM00,@Nitin Soni that's the thing the extra 5-6k is the Pixel tax we're paying for the experience,2021-09-30T07:15:54Z
OPw6aHWxM00,No ultra wide camera doesn't mean u can't capture ultra wide photos .... Just the method is different for capturing ultra wide photos in 4aüòÜüòÜ,2021-09-29T04:09:26Z
OPw6aHWxM00,"@Mubashir Tanwar Me haven't said it's a bad phone, I said it's not value for money and you forgot the price just remove the pixel name this phone will feel overpriced for a 20k also. Lastly hope google won't intentionally brick this phone like they did with Pixel 3 line up.",2021-09-28T17:28:13Z
OPw6aHWxM00,"My counters on your opinion

1. It will take 2 more years for 5g to get implemented smoothly.

2. No Ultrawide Camera might be a bummer but some people rarely use it, plus other phones which have ultrawide camera in this price range are just shitty 8 MP camera.

3. Why do we need high refresh rate? Movies are capped at 24fps. And YouTube videos are max 60 fps.

4. No fast charging is a good thing, the battery health won't decrease unlike other phones.

5. The design is minimalist, it's plastic body might be a issue for some people. But plastic have its own durable properties.

In short this phone is not for everyone, it's only for people who need basics right (camera, call quality, sensors, software, security updates, etc.) 

And the small size of pixel is the sole reason I'll buy it üôÇ",2021-09-28T16:53:59Z

KVK1ot6AGMU,"Very nice video.  But I have some comments. 1) The transaction dates you obtained from meroshare give the dates of share debit or credit but not actually transaction date. 2) So you need to mix the meroshare data for IPO, FPO, Bonus, Rights etc with secondary buy/sale data from Broker Ledger to get actual transaction date 3) with this way you need to first prepare an upto date DATA sheet and only after that we need to input the data for new transactions. 4) New persons will be lost if the DATA sheet is not up to date and will have problem in calculating WACC",2021-07-14T07:20:36Z

Xn4VWSqr5ec,"There are many projects that Google do that make them so great and can be having many growth engines.
As heard in recent news they are making there own chips and if they can even pull out some sheets from Apple book they have a recipe that only apple currently have of having full control of hardware and software and same can be done by them as they already have good mobile and pc buisness and how small they currently are and how big they can become make if they get close to a great phone brand can go as high as $100-200 billion and when we see what they are doing with Google maps I personally feel the next stop is.
Buy out a delivery service like doordash and just destroy other as they can direct food advertisement,most people food eating place,maps support.
So now people can get personalised food selection option,can even order on maps,more accurate location features and many more with so many perks how can other food delivery or even normal delivery service can compete with them.

Xn4VWSqr5ec,Yeah I put some money in Google last April or May. So yes it went up but they actually have a lot more ad revenue to explore on their platforms as they start to get things dialed in over the next 10 years or so with the next batch of content creators and such. No not a 100 bagger but likely better than cash. Also I think Twitter if their new products preform well will start creeping up very well this year. Their backend profits are really dialed in. If they can get a few decent products launched they will 2-5x easy. If products don‚Äôt do well they will drop quick. They need products to drive users. Per user their money making potential really good on the backend. This earnings will tell a lot for the next year. We will see.,2021-04-29T03:51:22Z

EN7-UbBi2Dw,"I love google. I work on phones. Years ago, warren buffet invested a lot into Apple and I didn‚Äôt get why...I realized part of the reason was he looked at their single digit market share in phones, and he *expected* their market share to grow multiple folds because of their new iPhones coming out, namely the iPhone X. I handle a lot of phones, and Google currently has single digit market share in phones, so a lot of people think the Google Pixel is just another one of their ideas that was kind of a scratch...But I‚Äôve watched every single generation of Pixel become more and more efficient and durable, they have tremendously improved upon the reasons that no one previously liked the Pixel phone, their marketing is getting better, and their price is staying low: I think the Google Pixel is an up and coming strong competitor in the smart phone market, eventually to achieve double digit market share and beyond like Apple did years ago. They have so many branches and projects like this going on that give them potential for incredible growth, even though they‚Äôre already huge.",2021-08-29T17:23:12Z

Our main discussion was comparing Google to Tesla stock, and I was bringing the idea of how Google is the king of its field/business type, and no one could compete close to the tools, and services they provide, and its stock undervalued. On the other hand, was referring to many EVs company who are competing to Tesla, even if not all of them will succeed, but Tesla won't be the only successful EV in the market anymore.",2021-09-27T16:05:19Z
EN7-UbBi2Dw,@Haider Alsaman You have no idea what you are talking about.GM will produce maybe 1 million cars in 2025 Tesla by that time will pump out 7 million cars and in ten years time have over 100 million cars on the road.Ten years time Tesla will pump out 17-20 million EV'S. The computer in the other cars are a joke. Most legacy auto makers will go under.Do your research before spewing out garbage.,2021-09-24T13:13:53Z
EN7-UbBi2Dw,"@Rick Hammond Would you check numbers before making a big bold statement? Do you know Google EPS is almost 90 times than TSLA? Also, Google stock last split was in 2014, Tesla did it last year, so don't let the current TSLA stock price fool you, it is way over valued. Another way to think about these two companies, think about what we use every day, or let's say almost every day: Google search engine, google maps, youtube, drives and no one can even compete close to those tools. On the other hand, how many people are going to drive Tesla cars? Or going to need Tesla batteries, and don't get me started on Lucid, GM, Nio, Rivian, Volkswagen all of these companies are competing with Tesla.

kq4YHq1vqPQ,"2 days ago  (all this week in fact) growth stocks were up decently  until sellers sold off in the last 1/2 to 1 hr. before the close. Two days ago the  market appeared to be waiting for today's unemployment data on first time claims. Hiring has been woeful with a poor track record under the current administration so funds stayed on the sidelines. The point is you could have been proactive with growth stocks seeing how they were acting the last 7 to 10 days
 The alleged bearish tone was  generated by late volume market selling and low volume on the growth stocks up during the last week or so .

So I take issue with the commenter who charged IBD being overly bearish during the last two days and that technical analysis is a lagging indicator. IBD recap this week pointed out the positive action that the indexes were weak but growth stocks were holding up. So IBD gave sufficient clues ahead of the last two rally days that if you were listening with your ears and were fishing in the right pond you had more than enough warning to get in  ahead of the rally.",2021-10-14T21:03:56Z

AN4Pw4b-V-A,"I had no clue what Yield Farming was a few months ago. I had heard of it and knew people were making thousands of dollars doing it but had no clue on how to participate in it. So I started researching and had a good friend from Binance show me how I could participate in it. I am now making 10% daily returns! Who knows how fast 10% daily returns can grow?!! let's do the maths, let's say you invest $500, 10% of $500 is $50, now do it daily for a period of six months and see how much you will be getting, it is quite amazing, even those holding their coins buying low to sell high will not even be making what we are making within that time frame. But more importantly, you get to compound that daily! CRAZY! 
Yes, we are moving towards a crypto economy, whether we want to or not.  Might as well find out what it is, and  MAKE A FORTUNE from it. I know a lot of us thinks if the return is high, in this case, 10% a day, then it won't be around very long, well you are wrong because yield farming has been around for a while and will always be around for a very long time, and simple video proof will show how your investments will MAKE more profits for you on the Yield Farming Platform. You really don't have to do anything, it is all done by automation, the good news is that this particular investment option helps investors who seek to put their cryptos/alts long term instead of losing to the bears, once you set up your account all you do is watch your profits grow within your desired time frame.
I have been in the home-based business industry and have been involved in all forms of online investment ventures for over 9 years and have NEVER seen ANYTHING as Profitable as this.I am earning over $600 per day within my first 36 days (do the maths!) and most of the folks I have referred including some of my business associates are at over $200 Per day within 3 weeks (once again do the maths) and the list goes on as I have referred so many folks that are just making profits while they sleep and within 2,3 weeks or 1,2,3,4,5,6 months can collect their profits which are all being Paid INSTANTLY!
you can start with as little as $350 or more, You can choose to be totally Passive and earn commissions every few minutes or be active and make even more money quicker. Who wants to participate and get 10% daily from this amazing investment means with crazy profit results?!

Amazon invested $14 billion in the last quarter alone, the same as it spent in 6 months before that.   It is a do not sell stock.

Amazon is investing so much money, that no competitor will ever be able to catch up.

Amazon's not going anywhere so I know that eventually it will come back.

wcrvq7lZ7T4,Thank you for this very helpful presentation. Ciao,2021-04-06T07:51:58Z
wcrvq7lZ7T4,"Google (Alphabet) is an amazing stock to buy, in my opinion, for these reasons:
1.	Strong revenue growth with an expected growth of 23.9% for 2021
2.	Low forward P/E ratio of 26, considering it continues to have double digit revenue growth
3.	The market for Google search, YouTube and Google Cloud will continue to have strong growth, in my opinion, as Google search seems to be essential in almost every aspect of life.  YouTube also continues to produce top quality content for every niche category you can think of and will help eliminate cable in conjunction with Netflix, in my opinion.
4.	Alphabet‚Äôs financial statements are incredible with strong revenue growth 12.77% in 2020 even when it was in a worst-case scenario with lockdowns and reduced advertising budgets.  Google‚Äôs paid clicks for advertising was up 19% in and impressions were up 15% in 2020.  
5.	The company is highly profitable and has an incredible balance sheet with $136.7 billion of cash and marketable securities.
6.	Alphabet stock seems like such a safe investment, in my opinion, compared to many other high flying tech stocks trading at 50+ forward P/E ratios.  I sleep very well at night holding Alphabet in my stock portfolio.

As with every company, Google stock also has some risks.  There is a risk of government intervention on how Google collects and uses its customers data and there is a risk the government may try to break up the company which I believe is unlikely to happen.

Sometimes when we have that specific money that we want to invest in a particular thing, we always lose focus and then invest or spend the money wrongly. One reason you need to invest in crypto and its technology is because; crypto is changing the economy shape of any nation that approaches the technology and that way being an early adopter gives you an edge over others that will buy into it late. While looking at the growth rate of cryptocurrency and the opportunity it presents, why not look into it and have a rethink about the particular investment you wish to make now. I can help you trade Your bitcoin to earn good income aside your work. You can make up to 0.78BTC   Ask me how?  or add me up on whatsapp; +447451270371   for more info ...... ..........................",2021-04-17T20:35:21Z

LUBoGpvjYoY,"DT had been green since 12/17. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, that was a crazy selloff with such news but it came at a time when there‚Äôs a lot going on. End of year selling, I mean from the PM pop yesterday the stock was up like 40% in less than 2 weeks, the news is STILL relatively new, I don‚Äôt necessarily think this can be attributed to market sentiment, not for DT right now, at least. It‚Äôs been very strong since 12/14 while all my other growth stocks have been getting killed. Also I think the ‚Äúrisk‚Äù in DT is really overstated. 1. They have spent years building strong relationships with OEMs and carriers. 2. They make money for Google. 3. That single tap is a monster! You know Meta is currently testing it? What was the huge risk, biggest risk people were worried about? Well, what if Google decides to change privacy policy or take over preloading apps or some other way impede the progress of DT? Well, this news yesterday should put the so called biggest risk to bed. We‚Äôll see.",2021-12-29T11:40:42Z

Very good point about portfolio anchors-

When I bought AAPL (apple) stock, my dad told me I lost my mind. He couldn‚Äôt believe I sold LUV (Southwest Airlines) to buy a ‚Äúsmall computer company.‚Äù After the iPhone came out, he called to apologize to me and said he wished he would have purchased AAPL when I did. I told him, ‚Äúyou still can buy apple stock.‚Äù Years later, the thought that apple wouldn‚Äôt jump like it did again is silly. 
He still owns zero AAPL.
In the big scope of things, like the video implied, the internet isn‚Äôt going anywhere. This isn‚Äôt the 2000s. We know who won the internet search engine war and became a growing ETF.",2021-07-24T07:16:57Z

APPLE 2.4 T do you see them getting to 5T sure in 10 years 
MSFT 2.1T same thing 10 years until next double up 
AMAZON and GOOGL you get the point.

t6xkZiJ_HOM,Why did you buy goog instead of googl? I'm debating which one. I know that one has shareholder votes and the other doesn't. But I don't care about that. Thanks!,2021-06-22T16:22:54Z
t6xkZiJ_HOM,Goog is a great choice. But for me 2500 a share is too much. So I  bought  some shares of Facebook last week. And still buying apple as well.,2021-06-20T17:23:14Z

YouTube ads/Premium and YouTube TV make up 20% of their revenue and is growing 30% annually since 2018.

9bZm3dJzHnE,"Fantastic Video ‚ù§Ô∏èMost newbies often undermine and most often neglect the importance of Technical analysis with regards to trading. Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of asset prices regardless of what is happening in the wider or broader market. Essentially, the process involves studying the paths of a particular asset movement in the past so as to establish a sustainable pattern that can be used to predict future movement of an asset. I actually admire the logic behind those who would stack up crypto currency awaiting a rise in price around the nearest future, it's cool if they call that investment üòÑ I personally don't really channel my energy nor equity to what merely earns you in bits with so much uncertainty in between. From experience crypto offers alot of financial opportunities but trading continues to be the most lucrative under the right strategy of course and i have come to understand from trading experts on the profitability of trading crypto assets over hoarding. Although i have been a keen follower of copying trade signals from a professional trader like Mr Logan Henri who understand the market and his knowledge on crypto market analysis are applaudable üëè. It would be a plus for us all if we could trade crypto assets rather than  hoard with the hope of a positive price move. Mr Logan makes you learn while earning massively.

I just want to point out a small detail in this video:
If I'm a developer,  out of100$ advertising Google kept 30$ of that until yesterday and from tomorrow drop it to 10$, my revenue won't go up by 20%! It'll be up by 20 / 70 = 28.57%",2021-10-22T21:40:58Z

RnlGzQA-yLw,@AO hmm ok. It would be interesting to know how much Spotify would be affected by this. They have complained earlier to Google about the high fees. If it would be a great affect then it will be revealed 27 Oct from the Earnings and forecast. So I wonder if it is a high chance for the stock to spike up next week.,2021-10-22T20:20:39Z
RnlGzQA-yLw,"@maynen93 sorry, he was actually right, Spotify and Netflix are subscription apps:
""Google is lowering commissions on all subscription-based businesses on the Google Play Store, the company announced today. Previously, the company had followed Apple‚Äôs move by¬†reducing commissions¬†from 30% to 15% on the first $1 million of developer earnings. Now, it will lower the fees specifically for app makers who generate revenue through recurring subscriptions. Instead of charging them 30% in the first year, which lowers to 15% in year two and beyond, Google says developers will only be charged 15% from day one.""",2021-10-22T19:32:13Z

Yep, I bought a ton on the dip.   It's getting cheaper relative to its current earnings (half compared to last year). 
...With the Delta virus coming at full speed ahead, pandemic sales will make a comeback.

Fidelity considers Amazon as a large growth company (probably because as big as it is, it still only has 7% of the retail market)

Yep, I bought a ton on the dip.   It's getting cheaper relative to its current earnings (half compared to last year). 
...With the Delta virus coming at full speed ahead, pandemic sales will make a comeback.

Amazon's not going anywhere so I know that eventually it will come back.    
Fidelity considers Amazon as a large growth company (probably because as big as it is, it still only has 7% of the retail market)

2myVsNEq0mA,"I like to hear your discussion on stuff, but allow me to throw some critisism to the concept of DCF in particual. Yeah DCF are cool and all, but most of it is based academic jargon such as WACC and Beta. Google has 100 bill net cash, wacc is irrelevant. Beta means volatility, in finance, they believe volatility = risk. But this is just a smoke screen to make laymen think ""oooh it go down it mean it bad i should sell"". In reality as Buffet and the other few investors with intergrity state= Risk is the chance of permanent capital loss. This is slim with google, probably the slimmest of all companies in existence. So instead, I would just extrapolate the earnings forward and do some scenarios of market sentiment, like 15-25 pe for example, and then apply a margin of safety and then buy. Your analysis is cool, but some common sense aspects gets overlooked by doing a WACC based DCF in my opinion. Some things are inherently complicated, like quantim physics and rockets, but investing is inherently simple. No need to make it more complicated, even though the pension fund industry has thrived on this since the inception of the 401k in the US and the adoption of these concepts in Europe etc.",2021-12-09T16:19:32Z

7YTXCUj7jqI,"Regarding google's biggest product, the search engine. I think you are missing a point in the moat. Google has the best product for searching but not really a moat in Buffet's view of a moat. A moat allows you to charge a superior price. If google charged you 10 cent for each search they would loose 90% of all user to bing in 1 day. That's is one of the reasons I believe Buffet never invested in FAANG - he doesn't see og understand the moat and for the search engine I believe he is correct.

It was a B E A UTIFUL week thus far as many of these tech stocks experienced a sell off on Monday which is exactly when I went ahead to take advantage of stocks on sale.

Fidelity considers Amazon as a large growth company (probably because as big as it is, it still only has 7% of the retail market)
