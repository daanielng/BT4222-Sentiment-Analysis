Then, Bitcoin started spinning the charts up and down, Ethereum surprised pretty much everyone with its price hikes, altcoins started booming like never before (just think about DOGE), new market actors even rushed in to join the race.

j9oCHB69W9U,"@Apache Attack Helicopter I'm still waiting for your Bear thesis on why AMD and NVDA are overpriced compared to their long term growth potential. I'm happy to hear it, in fact, I'm really quite curious on why somebody would be bearish on two great companies.",2021-11-29T04:20:10Z
j9oCHB69W9U,"@Apache Attack Helicopter YouTube deleted my larger due diligence reply, but Broadcom is at a PE 42 with 16% year-over-year revenue growth, and AMD is trading at 46PE with 54% revenue growth. Broadcom isnt a bad company and it is good for dividend growth, but for accelerated capital appreciation AMD is a great choice. 

Just saying that there have been other companies with good products and management teams doesn't say anything about why AMD won't excel.... Please, create a Bear argument because that's the whole point of making an investment thesis. Please let me know how your semiconductor plays have turned out.

j9oCHB69W9U,One of my favorite stock.,2021-11-15T15:41:12Z
j9oCHB69W9U,May I ask why your required return is always 7.5%? Theoretically you can just buy S&P500 and make around 10% without any headache.,2021-11-15T15:35:03Z
j9oCHB69W9U,"@George Bals the DCF model is used to determine the price in which the security will appreciate at a rate equal to the market so that you can buy when it trades for a decent amount below that. The real annualized return for the S&P 500 for the past 200 years is 7%. The past 10 years have averaged higher at 13.6% before inflation, giving the wave of new investors heightened expectations going forward.",2021-11-18T21:57:49Z
j9oCHB69W9U,"@Agent D as a comment bellow said apparently his rate is what he wants above the risk free rate. Now that makes sense because if not, his rate would be below or at par with your number of 7-8% percent real return, in which case it isn‚Äôt worth bothering hand picking stocks.",2021-11-18T21:46:57Z
j9oCHB69W9U,"@baseballwarrior17 oh in that case yeah it makes sense, I thought that it doesn‚Äôt take into the account the risk free rate",2021-11-18T21:44:40Z
j9oCHB69W9U,It‚Äôs basically what rate he requires above a risk-free rate of return (like a government bond). He requires that the stock return at least 7.5% more than a government bond would in order for him to take the risk of buying the stock.,2021-11-15T21:09:52Z
j9oCHB69W9U,Real return of S&P is around 7-8% adjusted for inflation,2021-11-15T19:50:04Z
j9oCHB69W9U,"I agree, it should be at least 12.5%",2021-11-15T15:45:38Z
j9oCHB69W9U,Dang‚Ä¶. I have no money to buy now..  looks like a really good buy. Thank you Jimmy,2021-11-15T15:30:26Z
j9oCHB69W9U,"FANTASTIC video Jimmy.  I was hoping you'll make a deep dive on Broadcom for a long time, so much appreciating you did that. It's a fantastic stock and indeed at a discount. It also is a fantastic dividend payer, with quite an incredible dividend growth rate, which is most likely going to increase yet again in Dec.  By the way, I think it'll be great if you can also show us what the discount rate actually is if we use the current stock price. What I mean is ... you require a 7.5% and calculate the fair value. That's cool. but it will also be nice to know for the current price ($560) what is the rate of return this price actually suggests.   Perhaps it's something you can do in your next videos. Good work as always man.",2021-11-15T14:53:33Z

bsv0QEatvUE,"@T H Hey, TH. No problem. Sorry if I came across as harsh. I just see so much misinformation on YouTube. I do my best to keep it accurate here. As for your question, Morningstar is better than most when it comes to financials. Seeking Alpha is good for news.

bsv0QEatvUE,"@T H That is wrong. This is a good example of why I recommend to use a company's own IR site and financials over a third-party website (which may or may not have correct information) for stock-specific information (like earnings and the like). CCI never cut their dividend. That's fake news. You can hop over to CCI""s investor relations site and check historical press releases and dividend history. Again, there was never a dividend cut.

5pVmb-_gsIM,"Companies like Avago (Broadcom) that buy companies for their IP and gut the R&D departments, are incredibly destructive. In the early 2000's Symantec morphed into this type of company (ironic that Broadcom bought them recently). Symantec gutted their R&D and could no longer develop new products. They would simply acquire new companies and gut them. It works great in the short term but eventually it catches up to them as their products start to become outdated, quality drops precipitously, and customers flee in droves.",2021-10-04T20:24:15Z

5pVmb-_gsIM,"It's kind of interesting how over the decades ""Silicon Valley"" has lost all its high-end silicon fabrication capacity to South Korea (Samsung) and Taiwan (TSMC), with some non-bleeding edge fabrication capacity still in the US (from Intel, GloFlo and others, mostly outside of California). Now the companies that dominate ""Silicon Valley"" are software companies (mostly advertising technology companies like Google and Facebook), with some fabless semiconductor firms (like Qualcomm) remaining in California. Some say it's America naturally moving up the value chain (software has much better economics than hardware), but it's clear there are worthwhile profit margins to being the leader in high-volume advanced manufacturing industries like semiconductor fabrication.",2021-02-15T02:04:48Z
5pVmb-_gsIM,"@Andrew Hicinbothem Millitary reasons to have a fab on defensed ground? After the story of counterfeit Supermicro server boards i take a look at the possibilities of using counterfeit masks at foreign fabs. Yes, it is possible to fit in hidden functions which are uncovered in test, but you have to trigger them in the system which, is under your control. So you have to inject the code triggers to have a counterfeit function. And this could happen also with clean hardware. I do not see an incentive to go this way. To me it is a counterfeit argument.",2021-05-15T17:04:54Z
5pVmb-_gsIM,I agree that a video about why fabs are returning to the us now would be an interesting video. This is especially true with Intel‚Äôs announcement of starting up it‚Äôs foundry business again.  Interested to find out if this is driven by the us military or Silicon Valley customers or likely a combination of both.,2021-03-25T13:24:48Z
5pVmb-_gsIM,I read somewhere one of the reason TMSC decided to build a foundry in Arizona is the U.S. taxpayer is paying 40% of the cost.,2021-03-25T03:24:46Z
5pVmb-_gsIM,"My company set up the factory in south eastern U.S.A. because of free land and free electricity.  The engineering and software development will stay in Silicon Valley because none of these people wants to move there.  Silicon Valley will still be expensive anyway because hi tech firms are competing for the same talent.  There is another YouTube channel named techlead, who is a computer science major, talks about how much money computer science major can make in Silicon Valley.",2021-03-25T01:59:56Z
5pVmb-_gsIM,The problem is that the capital market gives higher PE to software companies as they low investment and R&D risks with high margins while hardware are much heavier investment and risk and are sold at low margin to get software and service income. That is why they have to or prefer to go to lower cost  countries.,2021-03-25T01:02:03Z
5pVmb-_gsIM,"A fundamental reason why business like Intel build future foundries outside of California is taxes.  California has this tax on manufacturing equipment, and the tax is assessed on the value of the equipment every year.  Plus, there is inventory tax, and if you can set up your warehouse in the next state over, you will do it.",2021-03-24T22:41:56Z

IJITPBqZuhg,"Hi Jimmy, After watching your video, I checked out this company. Their business fundamental seems OK. However, these are my doubts: (1) company is very highly geared, rating is one notch above junk. (2) dividend has been more than profits over the last 3 years. There was a one time tax reversal gain in 2018 but not sure why they didn't pay down their debt or used it to acquire other companies. Instead they have been buying back own stocks (3) profits should be used to pay down debt, instead they pay dividends and buy back lots of shares. (4) I think it is over priced based on PE. We cannot just value a company based on projected profits. We need to look at behaviour of the company - the way they gear and pay shareholders.",2021-06-15T15:22:23Z

If we take a close look at some of the main reasons people cannot make money investing / trading online. whether it is trading stocks, binary options, forex or cryptocurrencies, you will find that the problem is that traders are lazy and too dependent signaling services, and also do not understand the trade before starting it.

Use a signaling service. ... 2. Learn to use technical indicators. . 3. Trade stocks before trading binary options trading security. .. 5. Buy options of the right length for your trading style.

tAFnOxHDMQQ,I'd love to see a variant of the calculator where you start the CAGR with whatever the 5 year average is but then add a yearly decrease multiplier to simulate how the CAGR would naturally likely decrease over time. I saw you changed the 45% to 11% in this video but the numbers would look more realistic if we could see the current CAGR for the near term upcoming years and then have it decrease over time at a specified realistic rate. What do you think?,2022-03-02T06:41:56Z

glEzoU2rCTk,"I really appreciate the objective views on companies; none of these titles like ""THIS STOCK IS GOING TO EXPLODE IN THE NEXT 1.25 MONTHS!!!!!!!!*?*""
This is really helpful in my decision between SOXX, SMH, USD and SOXL, ETF funds at the moment; THanks =)

So far im swaying toward the ones which dont have more than 10% in any one company; and like the idea of the 3x leverage SOXL
so 80% investment in SOXX and 20% in high risk SOXL;..... if anyone's interested!

Thanks again",2021-01-22T14:39:44Z
glEzoU2rCTk,I would prefer Qualcomm,2021-01-12T01:23:55Z
