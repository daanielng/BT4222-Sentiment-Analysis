Some of the highlights from the IPO prospectus

* Revenue grew 6x in the last 10 quarters (from $19m in Q1 2019 to $114m in Q3 2021), and 74% over the last twelve months;

Today I want to introduce you to another shitco on which luckily you can buy shitputs.

Brief intro about myself: I'm a retard like you all, but when I don't waste hours [making video memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r8eboq/brief_recap_of_todays_market_action/), I sometimes write [killer DD on shitcos](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q7i6ot/hudson_bay_capital_hedge_fund_pulling_off_a_scam/), with extra focus on hedge fund managed scams. If you were smart enough to figure out the company (couldn't post the name of the company due to the 1.5B$ market cap rule - solution in the comments), you could have shorted or bought put at virtually any strike/expiration and made some honest money.

For the next one, fortunately, the ticker has been pumped enough to cross the WSB threshold! As I write this, the company is trading at a market cap north of 2B$. In case you missed the title, today's shitco is:

# $LWLG

The company has been around since 1991, public since 2006, and named Lightwave Logic since 2008. For what they claim, the company focuses on the ""development of photonic devices"" or whatever else. But let's dig a little bit deeper into their business.

Throughout this DD, I'll include info I found myself, as well as some from the SA report of:

\- Gold Panda (GP): Lightwave Logic Looks Overvalued Based On Fundamentals

\- White Diamond Research (WDR): Lightwave Logic Is A Tiny, Glorified Science Lab, Recent 500%+ Runup Is Without Substance

I can't link them due to Reddit rules, but I recommend you have a look especially at WDR, excellent work on what a trash company this is.

**So, you may ask, what does this company sell?**

Their revenue is consistently zero. This has been the case for at least 10 years (thanks WDR). If anyone has the patience, you're welcome to look for more zeroes in the past. 11 years ago, someone posted a junk article on SA, claiming:

>For the last 7 years or so a small company named Lightwave Logic (LWLG) has been developing a new electro optical polymer material (EO polymer) that promises increased life for Moore’s Law.

So, they started developing this stuff 18 years ago, and still have to sell anything. This is getting comical, to the point that of their 70+ patents and applications, some are [so old they'll soon expire](https://patents.google.com/?assignee=lightwave+logic&oq=lightwave+logic&sort=old).

[Cumulative sales of LWLG's core product](https://preview.redd.it/uplh6n88wc581.png?width=1830&format=png&auto=webp&s=32f56b2520869d69792dcb0fc1d4bf2acd5bb1cb)

Their main product are shares. They [sell millions of them every year](https://ycharts.com/companies/LWLG/shares_outstanding) to their customers/bagholders, who are in turn rewarded with a [constant flow of PRs](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LWLG?p=LWLG) talking about the next investor conferences, their latest ""breakthrough"" or some award at random events they are attending.

**Ok, but how did they do a +2,000% YTD?**

There must be something behind such a rally, right? Not really, except stock promotion. This appears to be happening with the blessing of $LWLG itself, as it all started with them [casually showing logos of companies](https://youtu.be/rcY5vhsWHKo?t=381) to which they ""planned to sell components"" mid-this year. These included the likes of $CSCO, Huawei, $NOK, and why not let's also throw in the logos of $AMZN, $GOOG and $VZ.

[A few companies that have no interest in LWLG's products](https://preview.redd.it/vanascdbwc581.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=03c8797288e4b261c19fff59d8c123d24e3f1b07)

You can probably tell from $LWLG revenue how much interest there is from these companies to buy their products.

Fun stuff, looking at the YouTube account that posted this (likely an employee), I found [this gem in a March 2017 presentation](https://youtu.be/U60ijsAC70s?t=662).

>The market is ready for our solution: it's scalable...and we have great timing  
>  
>Our technology platform is exactly what customers are looking for...

This was happening 4 and a half years ago. Great timing.

The stock has undergone a promotion campaign by [https://insiderfinancial.com/](https://insiderfinancial.com/) (through its website, twitter and youtube), which is famous for promoting OTC stock scams. A penny stock boiler room basically.

**What's the thing with the hedge fund?**

There's this hedge fund called [Lincoln Park Capital](https://www.lpcfunds.com/). According to them, they are a:

>Chicago-based *Investment* Group and Asset Management Firm focused on opportunistic investing in public and private companies

Not so surprisingly, one of the first suggestions when typing it on google is ""Lincoln Park Capital pump and dump"". Their main business is signing agreements to purchase shares from shitcos, and then dumping them on retail bagholders. [Utopia Capital Research](https://utopiacap.com/lincoln-park-capital/?amp) took some time to go through a series of their pump and dumps, pointing out that such stocks have horrific yearly returns of -42%.

(side note: considering going short the whole LPC scam portfolio)

Fortunately, we don't need to worry about $LWLG finances:

[The intern preparing these slides forgot they shouldn't mention it](https://preview.redd.it/p1kkqrffwc581.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2bafd6485f127362c620cc785be839ce2bc4b61)

Their [previous pump and dump agreement](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2019/01/22/1703512/0/en/Lightwave-Logic-Inc-Secures-25MM-Common-Stock-Purchase-Agreement-with-Longstanding-Investor-Lincoln-Park-Capital-Fund-LLC.html) was for 25M$. [The latest one](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lightwave-logic-announces-33-0-million-financing-agreement-with-lincoln-park-capital-fund-301395039.html) came in on Oct. 7th. Following a few weeks of nothing, the stock price has suddenly started flying on no news. This is somewhat unusual, as LPC has the right to purchase shares at $9.16 (we are north of $18 now). Such agreements are typically very bearish, since they put the market buyer in a position of disadvantage. Wash sales? Stock promotion? I don't know.

But who knows, maybe LPC is genuinely investing in $LWLG, holding shares for the long run? That would fit well with their mission, as stated in their website:

>long-term, win-win relationships where Lincoln Park incentives are aligned with the best interests of common shareholders

Well, as you may have guessed, no chance on earth. A look at the [ownership structure as of Sep. 29th](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LWLG/holders?p=LWLG) reveals as much as 1.45% of the shares are held by institutions. LPC doesn't appear to be in the top 10, meaning they own less than 37k shares. I can see your shocked face expression.

It's also interesting to note that insiders appear to own 0.74% of the shares outstanding. Talk about having skin in the game.

Can it get worse? Of course! $LWLG recently got into bed with H.C. Wainwright. This is another shit company that pumps junk stocks and then hits them with a share offering. Also, they're a larger player than LPC, and when they dump shares, they dump like there's no fucking tomorrow. I've previously fallen for some recommended by their analysts (Azurx biopharma and Eyegate pharmaceuticals, both renamed into other shit this year), which promptly turned out to be trash and were hit with an offering. In this case as well, a google search can help confirming HCW's great reputation for scams.

[$LWLG recently went to one of their scam conferences](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lightwave-logic-present-h-c-014800849.html). Wouldn't be surprised if an offering is coming in the next few months.

**Sounds like a solid investment so far, anything else?**

The management is either retarded or lying to shareholders. They state in their [most recent corporate update](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lightwave-logic-provides-third-quarter-133100829.html):

>As of November 15, 2021, the Company's cash and cash equivalents are approximately $15 million, enabling it to finance operations through March 2023.

For the last two quarters, cash burn was north of 4M$. At the current rate, their reserves should run to zero some time between June and September 2022.

**Why should I buy puts now?**

There's an event hosted by Oppenheimer tomorrow, at which [$LWLG will give a presentation starting at 10:45](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lightwave-logic-present-december-investor-133100984.html). Some dumbfucks on Twitter/stocktwits ([here just an example](https://twitter.com/atlsutiger/status/1468931900630880257)) believe they will announce a foundry partnership. It would sound somewhat improbable to me, considering they have participated in hundreds of these conferences, and consistently announced zero such things.

If the run-up is caused by retail investors interest, this may come crashing once the presentation turns out to be the usual nothing burger. If it's just wash sales, LPC could rugpull.

If you feel adventurous enough to bet on the presentation, based on all the shit you've read so far, there's puts for Dec. 17th (this Friday), which should well satisfy your gambling desires. If you typically hang out on r/investing, but somehow ended up today here on WSB, there's some for June 17th, 2022. By then, they would likely have started dumping shares.

**IMPORTANT UPDATE: HUGE VOLUME IN DEC 17 17.5-20 PUTS**

Had the brilliant idea of checking out the options volume for basically all the puts in existence. Turns out on Dec. 8th somebody purchased in a single order [\~500x 17.5 puts](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/LWLG211217P00017500#eyJpbnRlcnZhbCI6MSwicGVyaW9kaWNpdHkiOjEsInRpbWVVbml0IjoibWludXRlIiwiY2FuZGxlV2lkdGgiOjQwLjM5Mjg1NzE0Mjg1NzE0NiwiZmxpcHBlZCI6ZmFsc2UsInZvbHVtZVVuZGVybGF5Ijp0cnVlLCJhZGoiOnRydWUsImNyb3NzaGFpciI6dHJ1ZSwiY2hhcnRUeXBlIjoiY2FuZGxlIiwiZXh0ZW5kZWQiOnRydWUsIm1hcmtldFNlc3Npb25zIjp7InByZSI6dHJ1ZSwicG9zdCI6dHJ1ZX0sImFnZ3JlZ2F0aW9uVHlwZSI6Im9obGMiLCJjaGFydFNjYWxlIjoibGluZWFyIiwicGFuZWxzIjp7ImNoYXJ0Ijp7InBlcmNlbnQiOjEsImRpc3BsYXkiOiJMV0xHMjExMjE3UDAwMDE3NTAwIiwiY2hhcnROYW1lIjoiY2hhcnQiLCJpbmRleCI6MCwieUF4aXMiOnsibmFtZSI6ImNoYXJ0IiwicG9zaXRpb24iOm51bGx9LCJ5YXhpc0xIUyI6W10sInlheGlzUkhTIjpbImNoYXJ0Iiwi4oCMdm9sIHVuZHLigIwiXX19LCJzZXRTcGFuIjpudWxsLCJsaW5lV2lkdGgiOjIsInN0cmlwZWRCYWNrZ3JvdW5kIjp0cnVlLCJldmVudHMiOnRydWUsImNvbG9yIjoiIzAwODFmMiIsInN0cmlwZWRCYWNrZ3JvdWQiOnRydWUsInJhbmdlIjpudWxsLCJldmVudE1hcCI6eyJjb3Jwb3JhdGUiOnsiZGl2cyI6dHJ1ZSwic3BsaXRzIjp0cnVlfSwic2lnRGV2Ijp7fX0sImN1c3RvbVJhbmdlIjpudWxsLCJzeW1ib2xzIjpbeyJzeW1ib2wiOiJMV0xHMjExMjE3UDAwMDE3NTAwIiwic3ltYm9sT2JqZWN0Ijp7InN5bWJvbCI6IkxXTEcyMTEyMTdQMDAwMTc1MDAiLCJxdW90ZVR5cGUiOiJPUFRJT04iLCJleGNoYW5nZVRpbWVab25lIjoiQW1lcmljYS9OZXdfWW9yayJ9LCJwZXJpb2RpY2l0eSI6MSwiaW50ZXJ2YWwiOjEsInRpbWVVbml0IjoibWludXRlIiwic2V0U3BhbiI6bnVsbH1dLCJzdHVkaWVzIjp7IuKAjHZvbCB1bmRy4oCMIjp7InR5cGUiOiJ2b2wgdW5kciIsImlucHV0cyI6eyJpZCI6IuKAjHZvbCB1bmRy4oCMIiwiZGlzcGxheSI6IuKAjHZvbCB1bmRy4oCMIn0sIm91dHB1dHMiOnsiVXAgVm9sdW1lIjoiIzAwYjA2MSIsIkRvd24gVm9sdW1lIjoiI2ZmMzMzYSJ9LCJwYW5lbCI6ImNoYXJ0IiwicGFyYW1ldGVycyI6eyJ3aWR0aEZhY3RvciI6MC40NSwiY2hhcnROYW1lIjoiY2hhcnQiLCJwYW5lbE5hbWUiOiJjaGFydCJ9fX19) (premium: 1.1-1.3), and [\~900x 20.0 puts](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/LWLG211217P00020000#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) (premium: 2.45).

Also interesting, the orders are typically executed around 2pm, both days.

We are talking about a total of \~350k$ in put options expiring in a week, which is not something one would throw in the wind for the fuck of it. This could be an indicator of an upcoming short report. Last time I've seen the exact same thing happening, it was with another shitco called Moxian (now below WSB threshold). Premium spent in puts was also in the 100ks order. Tried to check the usual suspects (Hindenburg, Muddy Waters and Scorpion Capital but haven't seen much hints.

And yeah, I wish that was me, but I doubt IBKR would be happy giving me 10x leverage on 1 week options.

**Can I somehow get fucked?**

Of course! And you likely will! Timing the market is notoriously impossible. All these elaborate hypotheses could be invalidated if $LWLG announces a revenue-generating partnership, LPC decides starting tomorrow they'll hold all the shares they're buying, or whatever else.

Not financial advice and all the usual crap. Hasta la vista and see you in valhalla.

*Position: nothing but puts, with expirations Dec.-June and strike 10-17.5.*

# [Stocks rise led by tech shares as Nvidia soars](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/17/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stocks rose after Nvidia, the world’s most valuable chipmaker, reported better-than-expected third-quarter results and gave a positive outlook.
*****
> Dow futures rose 24 points, or 0.07%. S&P 500 futures gained 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.5%.
*****
> Trading has been choppy this week with the major averages mostly wavering around the flat line, but the S&P and Nasdaq are still on track for a positive week and are sitting less than 1% from their records. The Dow is 1.7% from its record.
*****
> Nvidia shares popped more than 8% in premarket trading after beating on the top and bottom lines of its quarterly results and issued a bullish revenue forecast for the current quarter ending in January. The chipmaker reporter a 55% gain in data center sales from the same period a year ago and its biggest market, gaming, reported a 42% sales increase.
*****
> Those gains helped lift other chip stocks in early morning trading. Advanced Micro Devices gained 2% while Skyworks and Micron Technology added more than 1%.
*****
> Retail continued its big earnings week. Shares of Macy’s and Kohl’s kicked the day off jumping 11% and 7%, respectively. Both companies smashed quarterly profit and revenue estimates, much like its peers who reported earlier in the week. Most have reported same-store sales gains from the previous year and investors are optimistic going into the holiday shopping season.
*****
> Elsewhere, Deere saw its shares rise more than 1% after it came to a resolution with workers who had been on strike since Oct. 14.
*****
> Dow component Boeing also saw its shares rise another almost 2% following on upgrade from JPMorgan, which said the aerospace giant has significant upside as it clears up several issues that have dogged the company.
*****
> Going in the other direction, Cisco Systems fell 5% due to weaker revenue guidance and a revenue miss. Kraft Heinz shares also dropped more than 2% after the company announced a secondary offering of common stock.
*****
> On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 211 points, dragged down by a 4.7% loss in Visa shares. The S&P 500 dipped 0.26%. The Nasdaq Composite ticked 0.33% lower, despite most mega-cap technology companies closing in the green.
*****
> The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 was the relative underperformer on Wednesday, dropping 1.2%.
*****
> “Recent economic reports remain strong, but today’s stock market action highlights that it is already discounting another Covid cycle,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.
*****
> “Concerns about Covid also caused the 10-year bond yield to decline for the first time in 6 days and kept downward pressure on commodity prices including another sizable drop in crude oil prices. If inflation keeps rising while another Covid surge again stalls real economic activity, we may find out how the stock market handles a pseudo-stagflationary episode,” he added.
*****
> Investors await more retail earnings on Thursday with Applied Materials and Palo Alto Networks reporting after the bell.
*****
> The Labor Department will report last week’s jobless claims data at 8:30 a.m. on Thursday. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting initial filings for unemployment insurance fell to 260,000 for the week ending November 13, from the previous week’s 267,000 claims.

# [Stock futures are little changed after Lowe’s and Target post earnings beats](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/16/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures were little changed in morning trading Wednesday as investors weighed earnings reports from big-box retailers Target and Lowe’s.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 14 points. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were little changed.
*****
> Home improvement giant Lowe’s got a boost after reporting earnings that easily beat Wall Street expectations. The stock initially popped in premarket trading as the company not only topped the Street view but also raised its full-year sales forecast. Shares were last higher by less than 1%.
*****
> Target posted beats on the top and bottom lines, however, its CEO noted rising costs related to supply chain issues and compensation could have an impact going forward as the company plans to absorb those costs rather than passing them onto the customer. Shares slid 3.3% premarket.
*****
> Shares of Dow component Boeing rose nearly 2% in premarket trading after the company received an Akasa Air order for its 737 MAX worth $9 billion. The aerospace company’s stock has been a laggard this year, up just 5.5%.
*****
> Also, Tesla moved higher by about 1% as the stock continues its rebound after founder and CEO Elon Musk sold a chunk of his shares.
*****
> On the downside, Visa shares slumped about 2% after Amazon said it will stop accepting payments made via Visa credit cards issued in the U.K. starting next year.
*****
> The moves in futures trading come after fresh economic data and corporate earnings signaled U.S. consumers are ramping up spending despite rising prices.
*****
> The Dow added 54.77 points, or 0.15%. The S&P 500 gained 0.39% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.76%.
*****
> Retail sales rose 1.7% in October, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday, faster than economists expected. The figure measures how much consumers spend on goods across a number of categories.
*****
> Strong quarterly results from Home Depot also boosted investor sentiment Tuesday. The home improvement retailer led gainers on the Dow after earnings topped analyst estimates. Walmart also reported better-than-expected results, though its shares declined.
*****
> “US stocks rallied after an impressive retail sales report, solid industrial production data, and retail earnings showed the consumer is handling the current pricing increases. All signs are pointing to a very strong holiday season for retailers and that should help keep sending stocks higher,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, said in a Tuesday note.
*****
> Investors await more retail earnings Wednesday from TJX, Bath & Body Works and Victoria’s Secret. Other major companies reporting results Wednesday include Cisco Systems and Nvidia.

What’s poppin’ bull gang, Flux here with your weekly Historical Post Earnings Moves spreadsheet! Last weeks theme was selling options, and boy did we sell! **$APPS short strangles returned close to 100%, with $BIDU following closely behind netting around 80%. Meme stocks also had muted volatility. I sold an $AMC 34 strangle for $630, and although I closed early, I was given the opportunity to close it out at the end of the week for mere pennies on the dollar. Last but not least, a long strangle on $UPST would’ve netted you a whopping 460% return!** Unfortunately for us, earnings season is slowly coming to a close, meaning the quality of our plays will be diminishing greatly! Those looking to trade this week should proceed with caution, as there isn’t much of an edge to be gained this time round. If you wish to track my trades and try them out for yourself, feel free to check out the community links on my profile! Let’s get into it.

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **This week is an awful week to play earnings.** Most companies are low quality, and don’t have historically big moves. Options are also priced properly in most cases, meaning there isn’t much edge to be gained on the buy side or the sell side. It’s literally all just gambling, and as a result I’m probably gonna sit this week out entirely. Pay little attention to the sample plays below, as I’ve only included them for inspiration, and in case anyone sees something I may have missed.

&nbsp;

- **Selling $DNUT puts may prove to be profitable.** Although justified, Krispy Kreme has been on a downtrend since its IPO. $DNUT is literally hemorrhaging money and fundamentally the company is a terrible investment. A couple of years ago they actually went private after defrauding investors, doing shady audit practices, and literally using company money to buy back stores owned by family members of the executive board for FIVE TIMES what they were worth. More info on that [here.](https://www.cfo.com/risk-compliance/2009/03/three-krispy-kreme-ex-execs-settle-sec-charges/) Nowadays, the stock is priced as what it is - a fraudulent, cash burning business. Earnings is priced to fail, and as a result, any semblance of positive news will likely send us going upwards. If you have the balls, selling puts may prove to be profitable. The 15P is going for $0.80 giving you a breakeven of around 5.5%. You can even pickup pennies in front of the steamroller and sell the 12.5P for $0.05, giving you a breakeven of 17%. Everyone is expecting $DNUT to fail, so if we get even a smidge of positive news, we’re going up.

&nbsp;

- **$CSCO options are inefficiently priced.** This is literally the only pricing inefficiency at the time of writing. Options are pricing a 2% move, while historically Cisco moves around 5%. Given that prices remain the same or get cheaper by earnings, a strangle should net you some nice profits. If you’re poor or want a binary directional play, I’d look to buy puts. $CSCO is at ATHs so we’re probably gonna do the classic “dump after earnings regardless of the outcome“ thing that everyone seems to get tricked by. Regardless, at the time of writing, $CSCO strangles give us nice edge.

&nbsp;

All that being said, there aren’t many trades to run this time round! If I notice anything extra during this week, I’ll look to keep you guys posted on my socials. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.

#Summary and Conclusion

All in all, pretty awful week for trading. Most tickers are complete garbage, and there’s little edge to be gained among those that aren’t. No shame in sitting this one out! That being said, if you see any appealing plays I’ve missed, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment! If you want access to more trading tools, or have any specific questions or observations you’d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links within the spreadsheet or on my profile. **Happy Trading! :)**"

Its server business was under serious threat with the advent of cloud computing; its personal computing and productivity business were... stagnant, to say the least.

But with the help of its scale, MSFT reoriented its entire towards new business models like cloud and SaaS. It opened up its Azure platform like AWS, and transformed Office into a huge ARR generating machine. The result? Its share price appreciation and valuation speak for themselves.

On the other hand, IBM decided to double down on its on-prem centric business, paddling products like hybrid and private cloud. They decided to focus on their relationship with large accounts and didn't advertise their platform to the burdgeoning startup community. The result? Stagnation.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today, everyone thinks VIAC is dead. Its linear business is under the threat of streaming platforms like NFLX, and its ad business under structural decline thanks to programmatic advertising platforms like GOOGL's Adwords, which are miles better in terms of targetability and traceability.

The response from VIAC management has been a swift shift into streaming. They bought Pluto, which enables Adwords-like targetted advertising; consolidated their vast media assets into P+; and reconstituted the entire company's leadership to focus more on streaming.

Will VIAC become more of a MSFT or an IBM in the age streaming? I think chances are good for the former."

Realistically you won’t go wrong holding CLOV considering it will probably trend upwards - albeit more slowly - throughout the rest of the year. But that’s not what we do here, especially as we watch the feds print money. So, real degens need to find the next big thing. Fortunately it seems like there are a few solid picks swirling around, one of them being WELL health $WELL $WLLYF. 

WELL is one of the top providers of digital health services and is severely underrated considering its insane potential for growth. there are a couple key points making this so appealing. 

#1 Billionaire Investors. 
With direct investment from the 30th richest man in the world, Li Ka-shing, WELL has been buying up the competition with multiple 9-digit Acquisitions this year positioning WELL as the largest operator of digital health clinics in the country. In a space with such high barriers to entry, political power is king like we saw with Clover.

#2 NASDAQ listing. 
WELL recently announced their partnership with renowned law firm Fenwick & West, which helped companies like Facebook, Amazon, Cisco, and Coinbase with their IPOs. This is important because WELL’s equivalents in the US are currently trading at much higher multiples making this a unique opportunity to catch the rocket before it leaves."

That's still a sweet opportunity.",207,40,2021-06-10 09:31:12,"Hey Ya! Remember the early 2000s? It was all about lace-up jeans, giant cargo shorts, Gilmore Girls, Lord of the Rings, the Atkins Diet ... and the BlackBerry.

Long before the iPhone, the BlackBerry was the most beloved mobile gadget in the universe, known especially for its reliability, its security, and its full keyboard. But Research In Motion, the company that made it, didn't change quickly enough with the times, and the sweet fruit of its labors went sour. The company renamed itself BlackBerry (NYSE: BB) in early 2013 and set on a course of reinvention — first around smartphones, and then around software. Many people wrote it off.

And that's where we see a major opportunity.

BlackBerry has been quietly accelerating in its new mission securing all the connected devices that the modern world increasingly relies on. You've heard of the Internet of Things, chips embedded in all the stuff around us transmitting a wealth of data? Call the business angle ""the Enterprise of Things."" BlackBerry's new focus still draws on its expertise in endpoint security, which shows us the fruit hasn't fallen so far from the tree. But this time around, it's securing things like self-driving vehicles, emergency health networks, financial reporting, and much more.

If your image of BlackBerry is stuck in the past, read on. This is a company with a future.

Second Bloom!

It's no surprise that most investors would pass BlackBerry by after a quick glance. Revenue has declined every year since 2011 — and even then, the company's share price was far below the peak of nearly $150 that it reached in mid-2008.

But this is, quite simply, an entirely different company than the BlackBerry most people remember, and its turnaround is just starting to take hold. Moreover, the company's progress is masked by the continuing decline of old legacy businesses that aren't part of management's vision or our investment thesis going forward.

BlackBerry continued to sell its own handheld devices until mid-2016, and there are still BlackBerry-branded devices available, so current results continue to suffer from the decline of this business. Service access fees (SAF), related to legacy users of BlackBerry operating systems, are also dwindling. Given that these two businesses still represented roughly 50% of revenue in fiscal 2017, their continued decline has been keenly felt.

But the meat of the current business, Software and Services, has grown at an average annual pace of 15% over the past three years, reaching $782 million in fiscal 2018 (the company's fiscal year ends in February). This is now by far the largest part of BlackBerry, and we expect revenue for the company as a whole to stabilize this year and start rising thereafter.

The company's QNX operating system, in particular, has been driving growth. Traditionally used in vehicle infotainment systems, it has grown into the software backbone that can run all the chips in a vehicle, including safety and communications. BlackBerry has struck key deals with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU), and others around this technology. Baidu, in turn, has made QNX the core of its Apollo platform, and has partnered with automakers like Ford (NYSE: F) and Hyundai to make this the core of future autonomous vehicles.

This certainly isn't the only area where BlackBerry's business is growing, but it's emblematic of the niche the company is carving out: securing endpoints in the Internet of Things, with a particular focus on enterprises. It has been a leader in Gartner's (NYSE: IT) Magic Quadrant for enterprise mobility management for the past two years, making it one of the Top Dogs in a sector that's expected to grow revenue at a 25% annual pace through 2021. 

Still Green!

That hasn't yet put BlackBerry in the black, but it's building the core of a very profitable business.

Since being recapitalized by Fairfax Financial in 2013, BlackBerry has boasted a strong balance sheet, with $2.2 billion in cash and $810 million in convertible debt (which will likely convert to shares rather than being repaid). Gross margin improved from 49% in fiscal 2017 to an amazing 73% in fiscal 2018, indicating not only the company's shift from hardware to software, but also some considerable pricing power. Management also expects the company to deliver positive free cash flow this year (it did last year, too, albeit thanks to a large one-time adjustment).

Add it up and this is a $5.4 billion company currently generating around $800 million in very high-margin software revenue (leaving aside the remaining hardware and SAF businesses), with over 80% of that revenue recurring. With a gross margin that improved to 76% in the most recent quarter, we expect this business to ultimately produce profit margins in the 20% to 25% range, even as the top line continues to grow. That looks like an attractive price point.

Risks and When We'd Sell!

There are a lot of reasons to look more deeply at BlackBerry's financials, but the surface picture remains unflattering. For the time being, this remains a company with shrinking revenue and marginal profitability. Changing that relies not just on continued growth of the software business, but scaling the business so that BlackBerry's relatively high sales, marketing, and R&D costs come down as a percentage of revenue.

The company is a leader in a growing sector, but its competitors — companies like IBM (NYSE: IBM), VMware (NYSE: VMW), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO), and others — have a lot of resources. That's why it's important that BlackBerry establish an especially strong presence in areas like vehicles, but we would like to see it keep getting wins in other areas, too.

The Foolish Bottom Line!

Not every turnaround works, but BlackBerry has already become a leader in enterprise mobility management by leveraging its security DNA. This company has spent the last five years under CEO John Chen honing its new focus, and at this point he says the company is ""largely done reinventing itself"" and ready to focus on furthering its leadership. Chen should know — he's a turnaround expert who was previously brought into database company Sybase, returning it to profitability before it was sold to SAP (NYSE: SAP) in 2010.

Whether or not BlackBerry remains on its own or is ultimately acquired, we expect it to continue expanding its capability and reach in keeping connected ""things"" safe and secure. The best part is that many investors can't see the green shoots growing from the rotten fruit of a decade past. That's a sweet opportunity."
nvncdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvncdw/well_health_is_the_canadian_clov_now_theyre_doing/,WELL Health Is The Canadian CLOV... Now They're Doing a NASDAQ IPO with Fenwick & West who Just Completed The COIN IPO!!!,543,25,2021-06-09 12:38:16,"Obviously CLOV has gotten all the attention as of recent. CLOV was up 85% today and had volume over 732M. The reddit army has taken charge and sent CLOV to truly to the moon. 

I want to share what I think is lining up to be the next CLOV... 

Still largely under the radar is Vancouver based WELL Health Technologies (TSX:WELL) which also has significant short interest, strong fundamentals , and billionaire backers. They just completed a $206M acquisition of “MyHealth” now making it the largest private clinic operator in Canada.

Just prior to that, the company recently announced the $372.9M Acquisition of CRH medical which significantly increased WELLs footprint in the US... This is where it gets interesting. Not only did JP Morgan extend there existing credit line to CRH medical by USD$100M to $300M and RBC provide a C$200M secured credit facility for the recent “MyHealth” acquisition. 

But the company legit partnered with Fenwick & West to assist with a NASDAQ IPO in Q4 of this year.... Fenwick client base is Facebook, Amazon, Cisco, and recently COIN... We are on a launch pad waiting to take off. 

Jumping into the charts now... WELL has consolidated for a year while they have exponentially grown the fundamentals of the business. Just recently they blew through every moving average.

I think it's very likely we see this breakout of its consolidation period tomorrow and find new support above 8.50 which would set it up for a potential Squeeze/Run into new ATH.

The sky is really the limit here as the company approaches $500M in revenue with Positive EBITDA and a NASDAQ IPO on the horizon. I think it has the potential to be 1 of 2 things. 

1. The next CLOV as it has high short interest and all the same if not better fundamentals
2. A smart diversification tool (Geographically & Financially) for everyone that just made Huge gains on CLOV."

The initiative follows a [$4.5 billion commitment](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Telecommunication/US-and-Japan-to-invest-4.5bn-in-next-gen-6G-race-with-China) by Japan and the U.S. toward the development of next-generation communications technology, in a partnership announced in April. Extending the cooperation to ""third-countries"" to promote secure connectivity is seen helping in the competition with China to set global standards.

The Beyond 5G Promotion Consortium, which aims to commercialize 6G technology in the 2030s, includes the University of Tokyo along with major Japanese telecom players such as Nippon Telegraph & Telephone, NTT Docomo, KDDI, SoftBank Corp. and Rakuten Mobile. 6G Flagship is led by Finland's University of Oulu.

Members of the Japanese consortium will engage in joint research projects and personnel exchange. The group is in talks for future collaboration with an American counterpart that includes telecom supplier Cisco Systems and chipmaker Intel.

Shares of 5G patents owned by Japanese developers have fallen behind the likes of South Korea's Samsung Electronics and U.S. player Qualcomm. NTT Docomo holds about 6% of 5G patents, compared with roughly 10% for Qualcomm and China's Huawei Technologies.

The internal affairs ministry aims for Japan to command at least a 10% share in 6G patents together with a slice of 30% or more in equipment and software.

Motley fool had a great piece come out this morning [https://www.fool.ca/2021/06/02/well-health-hints-at-nasdaq-ipo/](https://www.fool.ca/2021/06/02/well-health-hints-at-nasdaq-ipo/) (They were also a top 3 pick for June yesterday)

What I love here is that the story keeps getting better and better by the day and so do the technicals...

Literally today the company announced another acquisition

Short volume is also decreasing significantly... and I assume the available shares to short are decreasing a lot meaning the cost to borrow is increasing (maybe someone could confirm that?)...

Short Volume summary:

Technicals are also looking very strong. We are seeing the same 3-4 month consolidation period that we saw before the prior ATHs -

Apr - August 2020 before the stock went from $3-$8.6 // Nov 2020 - Feb 2021 before it went from $6-$10 // and now we are in another consolidation period... With the fundamentals getting better and better by the day and the chart holding it's ground I still think it's lining up for the next major move.

Since the market has re stabilized in the last 2 weeks the chart has gotten even more interesting. Take a look at this massive bull flag forming on the 10day 30min. Pay attention to the RSI as well... Back above 50 now.

Now without the lines to keep it clean. Look at that 200day SMA support. It's now found support on the 20day SMA and is breaking through its 50 day... Very important it broke these levels. Bulls are winning.

Short term price action is super bullish. Broke through all major moving averages and is now trying to break out of this range.

If the historic timeline is accurate (which it seems to be lining up with) then I'm super excited to hopefully watch this come out of its consolidation period over the next few months.

If you really zoom out (Weekly) you can see we found our support over the last 3 weeks. Take a look at the hammer we are forming this week. Literally one of the most basic bullish reversal signals. Not to mention the stochastic & RSI are extremely oversold but showing some bullish divergence.

In this post I'm going to not talk about some kind of currency that can get this post removed. Hint: it crashed big time yesterday. You know the one.

There is a new kind of this currency that uses a lot of computer storage space. How much? Well - 7 EXABYTES and it's currently adding 1 exabyte every 3 days. I'm going to assume you know about this currency and if not you can look through my post history and see which subreddit I've posted to recently involving this particular one.

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

[1 leap Jan '23 70c](https://i.imgur.com/SAqvMhA.jpg)

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency. STONKS ONLY GO UP"

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It’s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

And here's where we are **(LOSERS IN BOLD;** *N/A, draws, or otherwise flat trades in italics)***:**

&#x200B;

1. **$CLNE:  This one got ugly.  Real ugly.  Volume completely dried up, which gave the shorts free rein to walk it down into oblivion all week.  They had an earnings call on Thursday, which was actually quite good (missed on top line EPS, but beat on revenue, upgraded forward guidance, and opened up more about the 1.5bln $AMZN contract, which sounds better and better the more I hear about it.  It actually traded up for a while this morning, but then just got absolutely assaulted the rest of the day because everybody was sitting it out.  I've averaged down - hard - on this one at this stage to make sure that I'm always within a day or two's striking distance of at least breaking even on the June calls.  I have started buying September calls at the same 13 strike.  I also started buying up more shares at $8.85 this afternoon.  I love a sale.   I'm going to re-evaluate how I feel about the June calls in the coming week.  Given that this stock has had 6 red days out of 7, any moves I make right now would be reactionary.  Further, one interesting thing I noticed was that, in the last 5 or 10 minutes or so, other whale buyers showed up HARD at the $8.79 price.  For a stock who's order book all day was just a series of 3-digit and low 4-digit offers, to see 50,000 share bids show up tells me that the shorts who had been fucking this thing all week were covering AND the buyers were coming back in (probably the same assholes who shorted it).**
2. *$MA:  I'm still yet to open a position here.  I just haven't liked the price action, and the charts have been very choppy.  If you've played it, let me know how it worked out for you.  Looking back at the weekly, I see some openings NOW, but they weren't real clear in the moment.*
3. $BABA:  I took the opportunity at 226 to finish filling out my call position as referenced in the last solo stock DD.  I know I said in that DD it was impossible to screw up, but apparently I underestimated the internet some, because I've had people messaging me saying they bought in at 234 and are down and ""feeling pain"", when I explicitly said not to buy at those levels.  It's interesting to me that the Chinese stocks, which are universally accepted to be underpriced, are moving in sympathy with domestic growth stocks.  That's broken.
4. **$BE:  Bought more August 31's on Thursday when it was at the bottom.  Sub-$20 was too good of an equity price to pass up.  I really liked the price movement on it yesterday and today.  Their earnings call was SPECTACULAR, and their leadership said all the right things.  I feel really good about this one to finally start moving independently of the rest of the green energy sector. Loser for right now, but I'm not getting shaken out**
5. $CAT:  Those July 230's were made of latinum.  Closed out today for fat profits.  I consider this trade over until $CAT comes back down into the 220's.
6. $EXPE:  Bought in yesterday morning.  Closed my position at about 2 pm EST today.  I sat on this trade a little too long and left about $3 a share on the table, but profit is profit.  It was a very nice trade.  This trade is closed
7. *$AAPL:  I never actually got into my long position.  I closed my pre-existing short on Tuesday and have been eyeing an entry, but haven't found one I like yet.*
8. $ALGN:  In Tuesday @ 575-ish, out today at 600.  Trade is closed
9. $PSFE:  As discussed in last week's post, I ended up removing this because the apes started trying to meme stock it, and I replaced it with $CVS, which has made me enough tendies to spring for the top shelf lube for when I fuck.  The $CVS trade is still ongoing and a good one to eye an entry, IMO
10. $CVX:  Jumped in Monday, and I'm still in the trade.  I like the movement on this one.  Still a good trade to enter, IMO
11. **$ENPH:  I'm upside down on this one, largely because I've been unwilling to average down on it.  My bags aren't super heavy, but I do have some Samsonites right now.  Going to just store it away and let it marinate.  The price action is still downwards here, so if you're eyeing this one, let it come in further**
12. $TSCO:  The price action on this has been amazing.  I've actually been holding this for quite some time, so my entry is way in the rear view mirror.  But I love how smoothly it's run and feel it's still got a lot more room to till.
13. **$CAR:  This is another one I've been holding forever, and just don't want to create a taxable event on.  The price action has generally been flat, if you remove the fact they had earnings this week, and we all know what earnings means in this market.  I still like this one for a buy and hold**
14. $KMI:  We don't talk about $KMI.  But if you're interested, maybe go look at a chart, because it'll make you wet
15. **$BB:  I haven't done anything with this, and honestly, couldn't even tell you how it's performed.  Probably poorly.**

&#x200B;

# The shorts:

1. $TSLA:  I jumped in at $712.11.  Everybody in the daily told me I hated money.  I got out at 666, even though I was swearing up and down it was going to 650.  The price action just looked like it was turning, so I took tendies.  Then it went to 650 like I thought it would.  Could have done it better, but profit is profit.  I'm eyeing a re-entry to the short side on this one.  I'm thinking 685-690 I'll likely re-establish.  Related note:  Think I've finally got a grasp on this one - 6 successful trades in a row, and I was even able to call the closing bell price within less than a dollar this morning.  This stock is finally starting to play by the rules.
2. $UPST:  My most reliable short  I'm twenty-some dollars a share in the green already and still holding.
3. $TWTR:  It's been SUUUUUPER choppy this week.  I got out at 52.80 for a nice gain, but I've hated the price action.  Staying away from here on out
4. *$CLOV:  Never had a good opportunity to play it.  Still watching*
5. $SPCE:  Death, taxes, and $SPCE tanking.  Still holding for a modest gain with stop losses in place.  Been pretty flat.  Probably still a good short if you can time it.
6. $PTON:  God bless that Shortbus All-Star kid who got eaten by the treadmill.  Lambo squad trade.  Closed out, and consider the trade done unless I see it in the mid 90's again
7. *$TSM:  Never entered.  I thought I had a price target in mind, but I wussed out at the last moment.  Doesn't matter, Theta Semi living up to its name*
8. $BLNK:  30% gain.  I'll look for re-entry at 35.
9. **$GS:  Defying the odds.  Trimmed my position to hedge losses, but this one isn't working out so far. Will look for weakness to re-establish in full**
10. $PINS:  Closed half my position at 60 for a nice gain.  Holding the other half with tight stop losses, but I'm optimistic it's got further to fall
11. *$BMBL:  I missed it.  Kicking myself for it, too.  I knew it was gonna fall.  Not sure how much downside is left*
12. $EGHT:  Oh the sweet sound of an equity dying.  This one is printing for me hard, and I think it's still got another 3-4 dollars to the downside in it
13. $MDB:  See $EGHT.  Exact same story
14. $PCG:  Riding it down like a submissive whore.  I'll probably run this one the entire month.  Printing nicely, still plenty of room to drop
15. $DASH:  LAMBO SQUAD!  Oh man, this one has been magnificent.  And it's still got downside.  Fair value IMO is 80.  It'll never hit it, but I think 110 is entirely doable.
16. $GRUB:  Reliable gainer to the downside, but not as nice as $DASH.  Still holding.
17. $WORK:  Quietly dropped on no news.  Just shows how broken the market is, because the buyout price is baked in.  I was following this so I could see news to potentially short $CRM, but none came.  $CRM, however, fell nicely on the week, but I wasn't there to catch it.  Trade is likely running out of breath
18. *$CAN  Never entered it, which is sad because it could have been a good gainer.  I'll rectify that mistake on some upwards momentum*
19. $BYND:  Yacht squad.  What an amazing loser.  Still holding.  I want to see 95
20. $AFRM:  I love the concept, but I hate the business model.  This one has been a great gainer for me, but I want to see 44.  Still room to drop
21. $COUR:  Inadvertent earnings play.  Didn't realize t hey were reporting this week.  Happy accidents.  2 bagger, excellent play.  I covered this afternoon.  I think there's probably still another 10% to the downside possible, but I actually like the model and don't want to tempt fate.  This trade is closed to me.
22. *$HEP:  Got in and got out at dead even.  Thought I had a good entry but then things got choppy and weird.  Removed it from my watch list.  This trade is dead to me with a draw.*
23. *$CSCO:  never entered.  Which is good, because it's run up.  I'm eyeing an entry*
24. $PLNT:  Another great winner.  I wanna see another 4 dollars to the downside  Trade still live
25. $QS:  Patently obvious this was gonna drop like a rock.  Ask me when it's at $10 and I'll probably still be shorting it
26. *$WMT:  I got cute and walked into a flat trade.  Will exit next week, win lose or draw.*
27. **$ADT:  Took the L here.  Entered at $9.27, got scared off this afternoon with a small loss.  They treated me like Ned Beatty in Deliverance.  Took it off my watch list, trade is dead to me just like that dude who wanted to fuck a pig.**
28. *$TW, $RTX, $COF, $NOC, $ADM, $AAL, $WHR, $LUMN, didn't enter any of these.  $COF, $AAL and $WHR are the only ones I'm even still tracking.  The others are dead to me*

&#x200B;

Wild card:  Scalped some nice puts on Brooklyn Pharm.  But any idiot could have done that.

Unexpected long:  Entered into $ON again with 1500 October 45c's and 300 1/22 45c's.  The price was just too good.

**Record after 1 week:**

&#x200B;

* *Longs:  8-5-2 (given the week that just happened, I'll take it)*
* *Shorts:  18-2-15:  Most of the draws are simply because I never entered the trades.  Take out the trades where I never expended powder and it's 18-2-2.*

Note that, when it comes to shorting, I do a lot more scalping and very short term swing trading.  May is typically a month of low volume, so you have to be agile.  Puts are generally 2 steps out of the money at open.  Do your own DD.  This is also not a complete list, just a daily watch list of companies that I feel are going to fare roughly or whom have typically underperformed this time of year.  This is also not a short and hold list.  If you don't know what I'm saying, you should stay away from these.

n0yqv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n0yqv1/reddit_called_it_right_nokia_hype_is_real_q1/,Reddit called it right - Nokia hype is real - Q1 results,624,77,2021-04-29 14:55:09,"You guys were right - Nokia is the share to look out for on its way to the skies!

I spent 10 years with the company, now off and not under any NDA or limit to trading, so I’m now happy to throw some money at the share.

Nokia results this morning show good growth and strong pick up in profitability! Beating the estimates with a comfortable margin. With the house cleaned from bad leadership and product transformation well on its way, I think there are a few benchmarks that support price doubling.

Base business alone supports 50% up: Look at Ericsson: Although Nokia’s business is broader (I come to this why the real gem is there), at the heart is a business similar to Ericsson: 5G Networks. Ericsson trades at double the valuation. This should not be as customers, Operators, want to keep their vendors balanced to avoid paying massively more for their equipment and SW. This valuation gap will close as the roadmap gap has now been closed. Nokia is well ahead on future technologies such as Open RAN and Cloud RAN. 

In addition to Ericsson, Nokia has a better licensing and patenting business being a stronger brand and getting all the patents from Alcatel-Lucent as well. Also in terms of 5G patents, the long term money maker, Nokia is well ahead. This business is basically revenue=profit, thus its key to keep in mind.

Then there is the gem of the business: IP and Optical Networks. This is the crown jewel here, this part is always forgotten by analysts and investors. These guys are brilliant, top engineers and researchers sitting in Mountain View and Belgium, and as shown by the Q1 results, in a growth area. They make incredible products. Go and have a look at the valuation of Cisco (200B company), Juniper. Back? Good, these guys absolutely smoke both companies when it comes to technology alone. Have a look at Arista. Now Network Infrastructure division also provides similar dc networking equipment to the webscale companies like Apple and Microsoft. Arista alone is worth as much as whole Nokia, so there is massive upside here. The worst case is that this part is sold to a Private Equity investor, I know some are after it. This means maybe 10-15B valuation for it. Great, but I think this has potential for so much more. 

Why it has underperformed: Bad management and badly managed merger with Alcatel lucent. Nokia was held back for years by really incompetent management - that management has now been cleaned out. How incompetent? Think hiring senior people based on private life matters…Think throwing half of your R&D budget on a single customers request… New CEO, new Business Group presidents, transformation well under way (since 2,5 years in 5G), and potential in the share to double when executed right. And way beyond that thanks to that nice IP and Optical business. Think Cisco scale. 


Excited to see how the market takes to this today. The fundamentals are solid, and engineering competence is there, the results are coming in!!"
mznbvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mznbvw/covids_massive_effect_on_the_semiconductor_market/,COVID's Massive Effect on the Semi-Conductor Market: What This Means for Electronics Manufacturers on Earnings Week,44,17,2021-04-27 20:27:43," Chip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020’s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand. 

Cisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could “...\[take\] another six months…” for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware. 

The effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW’s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, “...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter…” So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.

The United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders earlier this month to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.   
Meanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC has announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang’s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap. 

The increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reports earnings on Wednesday. Analysts are looking for the technology giant to post earnings of $0.98 on revenue of $77 billion after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple’s first product showcase of the year last Wednesday, and the company’s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it’s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat. 

Microsoft will report earnings Tuesday. Analyst estimates place earnings around $1.78 per share over $43 billion in revenue. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft’s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector."

The stock saw an insane increase of activity from insider trading, hedge funds, and general volume in the last quarter. 

While we don't like hedge funds, it's odd to see this volume of buy without much selling - especially as it's dipping. 

  
Q: **Why is this a post lockdown player?**

A: The tool was sold to lodes of companies trying to better themselves. Carnival cruise bought it when there weren't any cruises. Ceazers bought it when no one was gambling. Chevron USA when oil hit all time low. These companies are now imbedded to the service. 

Q: **Why don't companies do these things in house?**

A: The training, and learning, is free. In-house teams can learn this and join the community for free. In-house teams want this instead of trying to build there own.

Q: Why is May special?

A:  Annual conference, Inspire, will take place May 18-21 “**This year, we will announce major innovations across analytics automation, data science, machine learning and AI and the Alteryx Community platform**.”

Transportation and delivery stocks took a hit last March when the disruption of pandemic came. Almost one year later they have recovered strongly. Staying at home and working from home have created unprecedented demand for transportation and delivery of goods via vehicles on highways. As the vaccination looms and the economy reopens, the demand might drop, but the habits nurtured during the pandemic could linger for quite a while. I am still cautious about airline stocks; air travel is still far from recovering even 1/3 of what it was before the pandemic and I won’t make a move until the volume reaches about 1/2 . 

Looking at: PAG, KSU, UPS, FDX, UBER, UNP

2 More traditional/” big players” financial stocks

I have opened another post asking for advice, so I will just be copying and pasting:

Fintech stocks and ETFs are popular on the market nowadays and I’ve reaped quite some profits from ARKF, PYPL, SQ, V, virtual currency ETFs e.t.c. But now I am eyeing in on the more traditional/big Wall Street players like Citibank, JPM, Morgan Stanley, Goldman e.t.c. All flaws and blames and crooked behaviors aside, they are still the biggest players in the financial market nowadays and the establishment can’t be overwhelmed by a few Reddit short squeezes. I am trying to observe if these stocks could sort of ""recover"" from the shock and respond to the innovative trend.

There’s also another realm of more diversified asset management player such as CG, BX, BLK, NTRS e.t.c. It seems the pandemic has a very strong asset/wealth reallocation effects and the wealthiest that could afford to have their assets managed by these players are doing well. These institutions also typically have quite established footings in emerging markets such as Asia and South America in both government and private businesses. CG has recently published a pleasant Q4 2020 report and their stocks climbed. I am waiting to see if BX, BLK and NTRS would follow suit.

Looking at: JPM, BX, BLK, NTRS, CG, BAM

3 Military and Defense

The mainstream media tries hard to paint a layer of peaceful color to the new administration, but tensions around the globe won’t just disappear. The US military has quite a few major contracts for new weapon systems delivery coming up, and US arms sales to allies could increase as many of them are located at the forefronts of tensions (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Saudi, India e.t.c).

Looking at: LDOS, LMT, GD, NOC, BA (more for its military contracts rather than for commercial airplanes)

4 Tech Infrastructures

With everything shifting to online platform, Tech stocks (IT, cloud computing, semiconductors e.t.c.) have done well in 2020. I am in MSFT and TSM, and I just want to take a look at stocks that offer a more infrastructural exposure to the tech advancements, such as base towers for 5G, solutions for cloud computing and online platforms, workstations, hardware production e.t.c.

Looking at: CCI, AMT, CSCO, MSI, ERIC

5 Virtual Currency

I am not a big fan of virtual currencies so far, and it might be a bit late to enter the game. but nobody could deny the soaring prices of every major virtual currency, and I certainly don’t mind to ride the bandwagon and get a few extra bucks.

This has been the biggest weekly inflow since March 2008.

In 2008, after big inflows into the stock market happened, the stock market crashed. Most well-structured conservative portfolios lost one-half of their value. Momentum stocks lost 80 - 95% of their value.



Stock Funds See Biggest Inflows Ever as BofA Warns Top Is Near


BofA’s gauge of market sentiment-- the so-called Bull & Bear indicator-- is approaching levels of extreme bullishness, which can trigger a sell signal that hasn’t been set off since January 2018, according to the note.

Fed knows of the inflation spike and they will have to react



S&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio

In Yale economist and Nobel laureate Robert Shiller’s book Irrational Exuberance, he introduced a price/earnings ratio for the S&P 500 that averages inflation-adjusted earnings over the prior ten year. Today’s Shiller P/E multiples are the highest they have been in two decades. 

Dot com bubble: 44
Today: 35 


Warren Buffett’s favorite valuation metric, a simple ratio of the total U.S. stock market capitalization to annual gross domestic product, effectively gives market watchers a reference point for current prices.

The current stock market value of $42 trillion, compares to annual GDP of $21 trillion. One year after the dot-com bubble popped, Buffett said the unprecedented highs should have served as a strong warning signal. ""If the ratio approaches 200%—as it did in 1999 and a part of 2000—you are playing with fire,"" said Buffett.

Current Buffet Indicator: 195%
Dot com bubble Indicator: 159%


Margin debt balances have exploded on Wall Street, recently hitting an all-time high of $778 billion—nearly 37 times the $21 billion investors held in March 2000. However, the more important metric to focus on is margin debt to cash in customer accounts. It’s currently at 72% more debt than cash, versus 79% at the peak of the dot-com bubble. Speculation is contagious


Among stock market indicators the put/call ratio measures the weekly volume of put options, which are purchased when investors think stocks will fall, divided by the call option volume, contracts purchased by bullish investors


Currently the put/call ratio is 0.4, nearly identical to the 0.39 it registered in March 2000, at the peak of internet stock buying mania.


S&P market-cap concentration is at an all-time high, making index-tracking funds, which represent trillions of dollars in market value, extremely vulnerable to swings in just a few companies. 

Today, the top five—Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla and Facebook—make up 21% of the index’s total market capitalization, even more than the 18% of market value commanded by the five biggest in 2000, when Microsoft, Cisco, General Electric, Intel and Exxon Mobil were on top. 

Is this it? The end is near?

ljdboy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljdboy/nok_nok_whose_there/,"NOK NOK, WHOSE THERE?",609,134,2021-02-14 08:37:05,"**Current Status Report:**

* Nokia has benefited largely from the ban of Huawei and ZTE due to them being targeted by Trump during his anti-China campaign. Nokia has since netted around 40%-50% of these outstanding contracts due to the absence of these prior competitors.

* Nokia fumbled early entry into the 5G space because of a bloated and expensive product line. This is now all changing and ReefShark (management's answer to this mistake) is now taking off. ReefShark is a new chipset and subsequent product line that promises better margins for the company. 75% rollout by EOY 2021. 100% by EOY 2022.

* The new CEO as of last August is Pekka Lundmark. This man has demonstrated incredible financial responsibility and a very disciplined leadership modality. He is significantly more competent than the last CEO, Rajeev Suri, meaning the company's future is probably stable for now. Unfortunately, Pekka is also an old dog, you should not expect him to make any exciting or ambitious plays anytime soon.

* There is some price erosion in the North American market, meaning that there are currently bidding wars going on here - leading to reduced margins for Nokia. In addition, the U.S. dollar is also dropping compared to the Euro, thanks to free money from the federal reserve - leading to reduced top line figures for Nokia. Every other market has remained relatively stable.

**The Bull Case:**

* ReefShark is mostly coming online by EOY 2021. This has potential to kickstart a significant bull run for Nokia OYJ.

* Nokia OYJ is a profitable company, a rare thing in this economy of overinflated tech stocks and overly optimistic COVID recovery plays.

* Nokia OYJ has a solid balance sheet that consists of more than $10-$12 billion dollars of liquid assets (e.i. cash/short term investments). Half the company's net worth is basically in cash.

* Nokia OYJ (NOK) 23.67B is significantly undervalued compared to relevant competitors such as Cisco Systems (CSCO) 199.61B and Ericsson Systems (ERIC) 41.94B despite having a sizable market share in one of the world's most important tech markets - 5G communications is set to skyrocket due to higher demand via IOT and next-gen technologies such as self-driving cars.

* Nokia OYJ is worth only about 60% of Ericsson Systems despite having nearly identical balance sheets and income statements. Ericsson indeed has a lead on Nokia in terms of profitability margins and secured contracts - but the importance of both is overstated without context. Increased profits of a few hundred million when you are dealing with tens of billions in overall revenue is an absolute joke. As for the additional 5G deals Ericsson has, Ericsson is agreeing to them at a loss - in hopes that they will be a loss leader in order to secure and lock down clients to their tech stack. Again, maybe, but ever since the banning of Huawei and ZTE, clients have insisted on more and more flexibility in terms of cloud service alternatives - thereby negating any ""early bird"" advantage.

* Nokia OYJ is important politically, financially, and strategically to Europe and North American interests. You can expect help from politicians in the future.

* Nokia OYJ is already at the very bottom. At $4 per share, this company is trading as if it were in the same industry as hot dog vendors in terms of cash flow and price to earnings. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that at $3 - $3.5 per share, Nokia had to take actions to prevent itself from being bought outright in a hostile takeover bid.

* Nokia OYJ has one of the highest number of outstanding option contracts in the entire market. This has the potential to lead to some very funky market-driven events such as the company hitting $9.75 per share on January 27th 2021.

* Prominent hedge funds were holding major positions in this stock at $4 per share at the end of December. Have they sold already during last week's high? Who knows? But what it tells us was that even without that weird peak on January 27th, hedge funds felt that $4 per share was an absolute bargain.

**The Bear Case:**

* Nokia is in a highly competitive market with low margins. Even with Huawei and ZTE out of the picture, Samsung poses a significant risk as the Korean conglomerate can easily undercut Nokia's margins. Samsung unlikely to be met with the same restrictions due to South Korea's diplomatic ties with North America and Europe.

* Nokia is late to the game of 5G with their earlier fumble under the mired leadership of Rajeev Suri. Why bet on the underdog when you can bet on the incumbent that is Ericsson?

* By investing in Nokia, you might be losing out on better investment opportunities that have been severely discounted due to COVID-19. 

**Summary Recommendations:**

**If you are bullish)** Buy more and hold. You currently own a safe haven asset that is unlikely to be affected by further market downturns related to COVID-19. Unemployment is still sky high and the rest of the market hasn't realized the consequences of this yet.

**If you are bearish)** Hold until at least March or April. Recent sell off is the market reacting irrationally to Pekka Lundmark saying the forbidden words of ""price erosion"" and ""difficult year"" in the same sentence - even though the fault of this is largely due to American companies engaging in bidding wars and the U.S. dollar shorting itself into the ground. All in all the earnings report was still good and I expect a rebound.

**Important Disclaimer:** 

NOK is a relatively safe investment, not necessarily a good one. If you find a better opportunity in another stock while waiting for NOK to moon - don't be afraid to take it. Do not get sucked into sunk cost fallacy if you bought in at a high price."
lhab8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhab8w/ntdoy_is_the_most_undervalued_company_how_do_you/,"NTDOY is the most undervalued company, how do you not see this?",115,118,2021-02-11 10:08:47,"Srsly, how has everyone missed this undervalued gem. Let's break this down simple:

1. This thing has a PE ratio under 18 putting its valuation lower than other boring value stocks like Cisco, Comcast, or Walmart. You even get a 1% dividend yield which is more than your Chase saving account provides you. You'd think having such a low PE under JPow's economy would mean this is a dead company with no prospects, but...

2. Their latest game console, the Nintendo Switch which has been out since March 2017 keeps selling units by the millions. 80 million Switch devices sold to date, 15 million of them in 2020 alone. They're still selling at a consistent pace at the mid-cycle of the console's lifespan. This would be bad if they sold it at a loss like new game consoles from the competition, but...

3. The Switch is cheap. You can get the Switch Pro for less than $300, or the lite for $200. When your console is so cheap not only can you sell it at a profit but your customers have more money to buy games. And who makes those games?

4. Nintendo has basically a monopoly on Switch games taking all the profit. This isn't particilarly hard when you own excellent IPs that raise nostalgia levels so high. All their 15 top selling games are self-published, 9 of them solely developed by then. Their top 6 each sold over 20 million copies, they're in 25+% of Switch owners. This is important when you factor in that 80% of games sold in 2020 were released in prior fiscal years so new Switch Owner will buy these same old games that already broke cost. And with such popular IPs they can even release phone quality games or emulated 10-20 year old parts at $50 for cash grabs. Only stronger competition could stop them, but...

5. You can't get a new Playstation or Xbox. Srsly, have you tried buying one? You get a notification from Best Buy that they have some in stock and that same minute when you try adding to cart it's already sold out. Despite the demand, the supply chain is so backlogged that less than 5 million PS5s have been sold.

6. CHINA - did you know that video game consoles were banned there until 2014? The Switch wasn't even launched there officially until 2019. This is a nascent new region for the expansion of the videogame industry, especially today when less than 2 million Switch/Ps4/xbox ones were sold. Of those, 1.3 million were Switch meaning they already have over 2/3s of this nascent new market share. As more chinese come out of poverty and try out these game consoles from their rich software engineer cousins who came to visit them from California, they will demand regulatory change to make it easier for video game consoles to sell in the country.

7. What about growth outside the videogame market? Well, they might be the future leaders of AR games. Mario Kart Live? Mario Legos? What other toy companies have you seen pushing the boundaries of AR? With their excellent IPs it should be easy to dominate the toys market, with total global market size of $100B.

8. All that hype is all well but what to the actual numbers say? Well, this baby had a Q1 - Q3 YoY growth in Net Sales of 37.3%! But there's more! The Operating Profit grew by 98.2% and the Net Profit by a similar 91.8%. How is this not a growth company? Stock is up 67% YoY but keeps being valued at low PE 😮

Price target? Do I look like an analyst? I'm just a retard who likes 🚀🚀🚀 and playing games on the couch while eating tendies. Maybe one day we'll be playing Nintendo games on Mars."

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-10-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to bounce after breaking a six-session win streak

> * U.S. stock futures rose Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average indicated up nearly 100 points. A late fade Tuesday resulted in the Dow and S&P 500 falling slightly from closing record highs and breaking six-session winning streaks. However, the Nasdaq managed to hold on to a modest advance and notching another record close.

> * On the economy, the government releases its look at January consumer prices at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell on Wall Street. At 2 p.m. ET, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks at an Economic Club of New York webinar, in an address focusing on the state of the American job market.

*****

> # 2. Coca-Cola, GM report better-than-expected Q4

> * Coca-Cola on Wednesday said the coronavirus pandemic is still hurting sales, but cost-cutting efforts helped it top analyst earnings estimates. Shares of the Dow component rose 2% in premarket trading. The beverage giant made 47 cents per share in the fourth-quarter. Net sales dropped 5% to $8.6 billion, missing expectations. Unit case volume, which strips out the impact of foreign currency, shrank by 3%. All four of its beverage segments reported volume declines.

> * Shares of General Motors fell more than 1% in the premarket after the U.S. automaker said Wednesday that a global semiconductor chip shortage could cut earnings by $1.5 billion and $2 billion this year. GM’s crosstown rival, Ford, last week said the chip shortage could lower its earnings. GM also issued fourth-quarter profit of $1.93 per share on revenue of $37.5 billion. Both beat analyst expectations.

*****

> # 3. Twitter is ‘bigger than any one account,’ CEO says

> * Shares of Twitter rose more than 5.5% in Wednesday’s premarket, the morning after the social media network reported fourth-quarter earnings of 38 cents per share on revenue of $1.29 billion, both of which beat estimates. Monetizable daily active users gained 30% to 192 million from a year ago, but still fell short of expectations. Twitter is “bigger than any one account,” said CEO Jack Dorsey, in his first earnings call following the ban of then-President Donald Trump last month, days after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.

*****

> # 4. Trump impeachment trial continues with opening arguments

> * Opening arguments are set begin at noon ET Wednesday in Trump’s second impeachment trial. An emotional first day ended with the Senate voting to hear the case on whether to convict the former president of inciting the Capitol riot even though he’s no longer in office. Watching the proceedings from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump was furious at what he saw from his attorneys Tuesday, according to a person familiar with his thinking. The 50-50 split Senate is expected to acquit Trump.

*****

> # 5. Covid spike in the U.S. show signs of slowing

> * The crushing coronavirus spike in the U.S. has been showing signs of abating, with 95,360 new cases Tuesday less than a third of the record high new daily infections of 300,282 on Jan. 2. The number of people in U.S. hospitals being treated for Covid-19 totaled 79,179 on Tuesday, the first daily count below 80,000 since Nov. 18. U.S. deaths from the virus averaged 2,857 over the past seven days. Fatalities reached a single-day peak of 4,432 on Jan. 12.

Being an IT person, their products are best in class and rock solid. They also sell routers & switches as well as a ticketing platform for IT departments/companies. When they first launched their IPO a few months ago, I bought some shares and have been following them since. Their network equipment reminds me of Cisco Meraki, just at the very beginning of their launch(I did the same w/ Ubiquiti $UI, and have rode it from $55 to $350/share).

They are about to release their 2nd earnings report on 3/11. This is where I found a pretty good options play. Share price is roughly $24.87-$25 right now, and the 3/19 call options at $22.50 is trading around $4. This means the stock only has to rise to $26.50 or $1.63 during their earnings report timeframe to win on this. Given this is their 2nd earnings release(their first one was right around their IPO, so it was pretty buried), if they have good news, this could be a big winner. I believe the $20 call options may have an even smaller gap to cross, likely closer to $25.75, or $1.10.

&#x200B;

The bonus is that their equipment is generally sold in contracts, so the likelihood of them having a poor quarter is minimal. I have bought call options and own shares. Not financial advice, I just like the stonk.

  
EDIT: I was able to get a $20 call option at $5.50. Stock trading at \~$25.15, so only $.35 before ITM!"

&#x200B;

I was in my early teens during the '08 crisis. I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life, and the lives of those close to me. I was fortunate - my parents were prudent and a little paranoid, and they had some food storage saved up. When that crisis hit our family, we were able to keep our little house, but we lived off of pancake mix, and powdered milk, and beans and rice for a year. Ever since then, my parents have kept a food storage, and they keep it updated and fresh.

Those close to me, my friends and extended family, were not nearly as fortunate. My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work. Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like? My friends got to find out. Almost a year after the crisis' low, my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others, he was hiring my friends' dads for odd house work. One of them built a new closet in our guest room. Another one did some landscaping in our backyard. I will forever be so proud of my parents, because in a time of need, even when I have no doubt money was still tight, they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it.

To Melvin Capital: you stand for everything that I hated during that time. You're a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage. Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the '08 crisis were not punished. And your blatant disregard for the law, made obvious months ago through your (for the Melvin lawyers out there: alleged) illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven't learned a single thing since '08. And why would you? Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions. I bought shares a few days ago. I dumped my savings into GME, paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME (which for the people here at WSB, I would not recommend). And I'm holding. This is personal for me, and millions of others. You can drop the price of GME after hours $120, I'm not going anywhere. You can pay for thousands of reddit bots, I'm holding. You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us, I don't care. I'm making this as painful as I can for you.

To CNBC: you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions' agenda is just that - short term. Your staple audience will soon become too old to care, and the millions of us, not just at WSB but every person affected by the '08 crash that's now paying attention to GME, are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us, and tried to tear down the little guys. I know for sure I'll remember this. In response, here is a [list of CNBC sponsors and partners](https://www.cnbcevents.com/sponsors/). They include, but are not limited to, **IBM**, **Cisco**, **TMobile**, **JPMorgan**, **Oracle**, and **ZipRecruiter**. Their parent company is [NBCUniversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal), owned by **Comcast** and **GE**.

To the boomers, and/or people close to that age, just now paying attention to these ""millennial blog posts"": you realize that, even if you weren't adversely effected by the '08 crash, your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were? *We're not enemies, we're on the same side*. Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers, and start rooting for us, because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago, and we're taking that opportunity. Your children, your grandchildren, might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we're fighting against. You really want to choose them, over your own family and friends? We're not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet. We're just asking you to be understanding, supportive, and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago.

To WSB: you all are amazing. I imagine that I'm not the only one that this is personal for. I've read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the '08 crash. Whether you're here for the gains, to stick it to the man as I am, or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement - thank you. Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance. I've never felt this optimistic about the future before. This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you, and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible. I love you all.

THESE ARE FUDDERS TRYING TO GET IN CHEAPER OR EXIT POSITIONS. THE HYPE IS REAL**

Nokia is now a market leader in networking and enterprise level technology, essentially providing infrastructure for all types of networks. They also manufacture telecommunications equipment and engage in licensing. The most exciting opportunity in their current business model is 5G, which could be the main catalyst for this seemingly boring stock to finally break through resistance and become a valuable asset in portfolios. I'll give some key updates and price targets below. 


Partnerships and beneficiary of 5G rollouts


For starters, it's been a common thesis that 5G will be the greatest investing opportunity of the decade, yet Nokia remains in a flat/downward pattern on the chart. They've recently earned several contracts that will give them a stronger moat in the 5G domain as well as steady revenues and growth opportunities. Recent contracts come from a very diverse group of partners, including: 

-A 5 year deal with T-Mobile, in which T-Mobile will power it's 2.5GHz mid-band spectrum using Nokia's AirScale Radio platform. In addition, Nokia will facilitate T-Mobile to upgrade it's mid-band LTE network to a 5G network. 

-Secured a government contract via the National Cybersecurity Center for Excellence. Nokia was selected as the tech provider and collaborator for the 5G Cybersecurity Project. The federal agency plans to utilize Nokia's technology for the transition to 5G from 4G. The project intends to identify 5G use cases to highlight the efficacy of the components of 5G architecture against security threats as part of a government initiative to beef up it's cyber security and anti-spying tools.

-Partnership with Google Cloud in which the 2 firms will work in unison on businesses' digital transformation at the network edge through both 5G connectivity and cloud-native applications and capabilities. The partnership's purpose is to develop solutions for communication service providers to modernize network infrastructure and ensure smooth transitions to cloud-native 5G-core. This will likely build an ecosystem of services that deployable anywhere, from network edge, to public clouds, private clouds, and carrier networks. 

-Nokia has also recently announced partnerships with M1 for 5G solutions in Singarpore, as well as TeleZ to deploy key infrastructure solutions for TeleZ subsribers in Sweden, Lativa, Lithuania, and Estonia. They were also awarded a contract by NASA for $14.1 million to build 4G infrastructure on the moon. 


Nokia has more than 220 large enterprise customers across industries worldwide, of which at least 30 have deployed 5G. They were also in a geopolitical battle in which the U.S. expressed interest in owning a piece of the company, and in response Finland built it's stake in Nokia via Solidium Oy, the state's equity-asset manager, to 1 billion euros($1.2b usd). Nokia also intends to repurchase 500 million shares in the coming months, so demand for the stock is picking up on all levels. 


In addition to infrastructure, licensing is a huge part of Nokia's business model that will benefit from 5G. The ""Nokia Technologies"" Arm handles patent licensing, technology licensing, and brand licensing. This includes an industry-leading patent portfolio including ~20,000 patent families including ~3500 5G standard essential patent families. 


So why is a company with so many valuable assets and recently announced deals/partnerships still trading flat and so seemingly undervalued? The short answer is the former CEO made several bad choices which gave Nokia's competitors an upper hand on the current 5G landscape and put NOK share price in a long term downtrend which has gave it a reputation as a boring stock with an ugly chart. However, with new CEO Pekka Lundmark's expertise in driving returns to shareholders, as well as the scrutiny and subsequent bans of Huawei opening the door for competition, Nokia now has a much needed breath of life and a chance to gain market share to become the biggest beneficiary of the 5G revolution. The new CEO is determined to get Nokia to the top and pull in solid returns to shareholders, as evidenced by the slew of recent contracts/partnerships along with his plans for spending aggressively on R&D, as well as developing a leaner business model by cutting unnecessary expenses and unprofitable endeavors. 


Nokia is primed for growth as they plan into several emerging, high growth markets including 5G, IoT, Edge computing, Network Encryption, Cloud Radio Access, Software Defined Infrastructure(SDI), Cloud Managed LAN, Optical Communications and Networking, as well as established high growth markets such as Smart Wearables, Defense/Security, and LTE. 



Despite the slew of positive news surrounding Nokia and their partnerships/contracts, the stock is still very undervalued, even at today's price surge. 

That may soon change, as the stock's chart is beginning to signal incoming volatility. The implied volatility(IV) and volume for NOK call options are indicating big moves in the coming months. Open interest is on the rise as well. 




NOK is trading at a Price/Book ratio of 1.3x, compared to it's peers average of 4.0x and the sector average 2.2x 

NOK is also undervalued in terms of Price/LTM sales. It has a ratio of 0.9x, it's peers trade at an average of 3.9x, and the sector average of 1.8x

To establish the Fair Value Estimate, we'll use 2 models taking input from previous NOK financials, as well as data from competitors. (Competitors include: CSCO, ERIC, MSI, MSFT, and AAPL.

P/E Multiples: $14.94 target 

Earnings Power Value: $15.64 target 

The average for the 2 models imply a Fair Value Estimate of $15.29 




These estimates are based on historical data, therefore are fair values for the current price and past performance, not taking into account the market share and recurring revenue recently secured. I believe over the 3 months ad beyond the fair value will be much higher as earnings begin to reflect the value and growth from 5G contracts and recurring revenues. 


Even currently, those estimates are a bit low as Nokia's closest competitor, Ericsson, has a market cap that is nearly 70% higher than Nokia, despite the two having very similar financials and even trailing Nokia in several key metrics. 



At NOK's current share price of, it remains undervalued as ERIC is only ahead of NOK in 2 key categories, EBITDA and Profit Margin, and ERIC is only outperforming NOK by a slim margin in these categories. I believe NOK should be valued much higher, than ERIC since they are gaining contracts MUCH faster than ERIC and also Huawei, which would imply a share price of $7.11 before any buybacks place shares into the treasury, which would increase the price even further. 


Nokias Fair value is over $25

This is based on competitor ERIC who is valued 68.4% higher despite having trailing NOK in almost every key metric for valuation, and the valuation of Huawei who is losing tons of revenue and contracts in favor of Nokia"

After briefly looking over the past couple quarterly reports, I’ve found Nokia is as resilient as the phones it manufactures. **Today I’m discussing the long term case for Nokia.**

**The Gossip**

As some of you less smooth-brained retards know, Nokia has been getting shat on from shareholder’s perspective over the past couple years. Seeing a few big dips in share price both in 2019 and 2020 (which I will explain later). It appears that a lot of traders have left the company by the wayside for corporations like Motorola (MSI) and Cisco (CSCO).

**I see you lookin’**

Investment Journalists have already been discussing speculative success for Nokia long-term.

Here are some examples:

Cramer said he prefers growth, but with Nokia's long-existing foothold in many facets of the telecom industry AND Pekka Lundmark's EXPLICTLY EXPRESSED focus for Nokia's efforts on dominating a specific niches of mobile access:

>“We have a strong position in technologies that are important for critical networks, such as open and virtualized radio access networks and we are on course for a 100% cloud-native software portfolio,”

We are looking at serious growth within a particular spectrum (spectrum, like frequency spectrum HAHA TELECOM JOKE) and I think it dubious to dismiss Nokia's potential for growth where it *wants* to grow.

**Oh look blue crayons**

Here is a nice, smol-brained visual expression of Nokia’s 2020 weighted 5G conversion rate so that you fuckwits can grasp what’s going on.

&#x200B;

[Source: https:\/\/www.nokia.com\/system\/files\/2020-10\/nokia\_results\_2020\_q3.pdf \(pg. 4\)](https://preview.redd.it/73g1gglcjcd61.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&s=d71f43fd792c1559a7df369c1c4198252f7697d1)

The dotted square represents all of Nokia’s existing 4G footprint at the end of 2018 and the dark blue represents where a 5G footprint has been created to replace it. Notice that some dark blue exists outside the dotted square? That’s all NEW STUFF LOOKIE THERE FELLA UR SO SMART. At the same time, some of the 4G footprint remains because of interest in providing service to..um.. legacy products?

As of the Q3 report, Nokia owns 27% of the 4G + 5G mobile radio market share- excluding the Chinese market for that matter. This hasn't been a company that has lacked resources or experience, but direction and focus; there is a LOT to telecommunications and there are many doors this company can take. It has the connections, money, and focus necessary to achieve these long-term goals that its leaders set. If done right, 2021 won’t be a year of killer cash flow and revenue, but will establish Nokia with one massive cock.

I know it’s not exactly flashy/sexy and won’t see immediate results in the next two or three quarters, but the newly appointed Chief Technical Officer, Nishant “Big Daddy” Batra knows R&D and knows the ins and outs of Cloud Service Programs. Nokia has some BIG brain boys steering the ship. Let’s talk about something you troglodytes can follow: money.

Net sales, operating profit, and margin are on track for another consistent year albeit *slightly* lower than 2019. This is good news considering that it lost a large north American customer this previous year due to its lackluster 5G footprint WHICH Lundmark (the aforementioned new president of Nokia) has explicitly stated that this will be the primary focus: R&D in tech that will position it as a long-term leader in the 5G space. They can do it too. I’ll dumb it down for you retards:

Boys, this is FISCALLY-DISCIPLINED leadership.

“BuT sHoUldN’T aLL lEadErShIp bE gOoD wItH mOneY??”

First, shut the fuck up and let me explain. There was a major dip in share price in 2019 after Nokia announced that it would not be paying dividends for two consecutive quarters. The boomers and gay bears in r/investing didn’t like the sound of that and decided to sell to really stick it to Nokia, and bought shit like CRUS because MMs told their sheep to.

**Nokia cut dividends temporarily in order to offset the cost of rolling out 5G tech**. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-24/nokia-cuts-earnings-outlook-and-pauses-dividend-to-invest-in-5g](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-24/nokia-cuts-earnings-outlook-and-pauses-dividend-to-invest-in-5g)

It was supposed to be a short term biting of the bullet for shareholders in order to see long term benefits, but God forbid people didn’t get their 19 cent-a-share dividends. There has been open discussion of bringing back dividends within the next couple years if the company sees continued growth in its cash flow, Nokia mentions the possibility of:

>“an earnings-based growing dividend of approximately 40% to 70% of non-IFRS diluted EPS, taking into account Nokia’s cash position and expected cash flow generation.”

*source:* [*https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/buy-nokia-stock-before-the-company-resumes-dividends-2020-10-21*](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/buy-nokia-stock-before-the-company-resumes-dividends-2020-10-21)

If Nokia officially announces a re-rolling out of dividends, boomers will get  **Rock. Fucking. Hard.** and slurp up shares on the cheap. This is where speculation comes in and is **ultimately why I am posting this shit in WSB.** Nokia has some major competition, minus Huawei in the United States which is a big fucking deal and I’m amazed how that escapes people considering the recent contracts Nokia secured with the US government. Some of that competition currently has the leg up on Nokia and betting on them is risky, but if Nokia can prove within the next year that it has a plan, we have got some SERIOUS upward potential.

Also, check the options activity on Nokia for the next 2 weeks leading up to its Q4 report. It’s getting me \~frisky\~

I could further dissect additional strategies associated with Nokia’s portfolio including what else it has it’s toes in, but big picture: Nokia will begin to hone in on a specific set of specializations (5G and Cloud-native software services).

As a long on Nokia, I have been lurking this sub and I see a lot of the same misconceptions about Nokia and well, I believe its time for me to bring some clarity to the reality that is $NOK

**Myth #1 Nokia is a phone company.**

This is wrong, Nokia is not a phone company. They sold their phone business to Microsoft back in 2013 for over 7 billion dollars, later it was sold by Microsoft to HMD for 350 million dollars in 2016, who currently makes the phones. Nokia just gets royalties for the use of their name.

**Myth #2 Nokia has been under the same failed management for 25 years.**

Correction, Nokia hired on a new CEO Pekka Lundmark in August of 2020 and took full leadership in September. He previously worked for Nokia between 1990 and 2000, when he helped oversee the company’s emergence as the world’s biggest mobile phone manufacturer and a significant player in mobile infrastructure.

**Myth #4 Nokia is losing market share due to competition**

While yes, there is strong competition in the 5G market, Huawei the global leader, is facing bans across the United States and Europe, ZTE who makes up a small fraction of the market share is also seeing geopolitical pressure. Current estimates of market share show the following Huawei 28.5% Ericsson 26.5% Nokia 22% Samsung 8.5% ZTE 5% and others 9.5%.

Here is an updated list on each countries stance on Huawei and ZTE. The list is growing as more and more countries decide to venture away from Chinese telecommunication equipment.

[https://www.channele2e.com/business/enterprise/huawei-banned-in-which-countries/](https://www.channele2e.com/business/enterprise/huawei-banned-in-which-countries/)

With more countries joining on the list, there is an increase demand on the others within the market to pick up the lost market share.

**Myth #5 Nokia isn’t a cyber security company like BlackBerry**

Nokia actually is involved in the cyber security field in many important ways. Nokia Smart Grid for example, is designed specifically for one of our largest threats faced by modern nations, Power Utilities.

**Myth #6 Nokia isn’t doing anything to make itself more profitable**

Nokia Cuts Jobs in France

Staying in Europe, Nokia said it was cutting 1,233 jobs in France, largely impacting research and development positions at its Alcatel-Lucent subsidiary.

Nokia has been slashing jobs amid a global cost savings program originally announced in late 2018. “Nokia is reinforcing its efforts and has earlier launched a global evaluation of its \[research and development\] operation that has led to significant adjustments globally,” a company spokesperson said in a statement.

The Finnish vendor, which is trying to cut $556 million in costs by the end of 2020, announced plans to cut about 180 jobs in its home country at the beginning of the year and hinted at more to come.

This shit is ridiculous. The EV market is shockingly similar to the dot com bubble and its not even like people arent aware, its just that everyone thinks they will be able to sell their shares to some idiot at a higher price which has been true thus far, but that second people stop believing that we are in trouble.

I can already see people saying ""how did we not see that coming"", the writing is on the walls. Countless IPOs/SPACs with companies WITH NO REVENUE. Imagine 2 years ago, if a company with no revenue went public people would laugh. Now people will pay ridiculous amounts for QS, a company with NO REVENUE FOR 6 \*\*\*\*\*\* YEARS.

Companies jumping 10+% just because they announce they will be apart of the EV market. 

Maybe im just not chad enough, but I can no longer stay on this ride with you all. I wish you all the best.
