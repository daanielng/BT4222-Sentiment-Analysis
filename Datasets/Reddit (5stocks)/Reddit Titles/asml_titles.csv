pccqus,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pccqus/mu_the_most_undervalued_semi_stock_has_2030/,"MU, the most undervalued semi stock, has 20-30% upside potential in a month, 70-100% upside potential in 3-6 months. The sentiment has been changed to bullish this week, a GREAT TIME TO BUY.",81,73,2021-08-27 08:59:16," Most great semi stocks are already priced in or overvalued, and we smart experienced apes know that you never buy overvalued stocks because its potential gain is small and its potential loss is too big.

Therefore, we need to buy the stock that is undervalued but eventually goes up to meet its price target later because of its strong fundamentals and future growth (which is MU). And why do we need to pick semi stocks for this? Because Semiconductor business is one of the most potential and profitable business in the whole industry; we simply think that everything is turning to digital and AI systems, and all those devices, platforms, and servers need memory chips. Biden's infrastructure bills and his willingness to support semi industry are also tailwinds of semi stocks.

Ok, so why MU is the most undervalued stock among all semiconductors now?

Because it is ridiculously cheap! 7x forward price to earnings multiple now, and even though it actually have a slowdown in memory chip industry, it is still 10-12x forward earnings which is still ridiculously cheap compared to other semi stocks. (According to Quint Tatro, Joule Financial founder at CNBC).

MU's 52 week high is 96.96, and its current price is 72.77. It showed some high volatility and corrections after its ATH because it went up too fast in short time (52 week low is 43.67). The last large correction made MU's price down from 83 to 68.80 which was 17% down in 4 days. This correction happened because of Morgan Stanley's report that says 'winter is coming' for semis. However, all other institutions and investors, including Goldman Sachs, Bofa, Jim Cramer, think that MU is way undervalued, and its price is at the bottom now. Vanguard Group, Sanders Capital, and State Street, top 5 MU shareholders, added MU positions between August 6 to August 16 . Since many institutions and large investors start to buy MU back, its price went up from 68 to 77, and then it dropped to 73 today due to the red market and some sell offs.

Reasons why this is a great timing to buy MU now

1. The sentiment turned to bullish. It kept going up since it hit its bottom price 68, and yesterday, August 25th, it pumped from 73 to 77 in few minutes, closed at 74, and the current price is 72.77 now. Great buying point before it keeps pumping after this Jackson Hole meeting.
2. Too CHEAP compared to ALL other semis. Here is the picture.

[As you can see, MU is -23.64&#37; from 52 week High on August 25, it has a more discount today since it dropped to 72.77. Ok, then we might doubt about its fundamentals and its future growth. Don't worry, here is why most analysts and institutions think MU is super undervalued and it is time to buy now.](https://preview.redd.it/dlkwd2twtsj71.png?width=1522&format=png&auto=webp&s=320db86cfa01137884d5738472075d85b9f5bc78)

[Its FY1 is 12.13 which is already great, but its FY2 and 3 is 6.36 and 6.34 which is too great compared to others. So, it is a great time to buy it before all those number soar later.](https://preview.redd.it/4o837srxtsj71.png?width=1233&format=png&auto=webp&s=021afd568ab356ba677378e791f117c4bedef258)

Their EPS and Revenue growth are also great too (beating all estimates for over 2 years).

3. Morgan Stanley, aka sneaky bitches, revealed a report 'winter is coming' or whatever, saying that DRAM memory chip price was already at the peak and it is going down now which will lead all DRAM company's profit to go down due to its historical data. However, most institutions and investors still believe that DRAM's demand is still too strong enough to cover that DRAM price drop, because all PCs, Servers, Laptops, smartphones, tablets, robots, cars, and anything that has automated computer system needs 'memory chip'. Semi industry has a bright future, and I think Morgan Stanley's report was just a manipulation in order to short the stock and buying it back at discounted price. This asshole bought SK hynix (2nd largest DRAM company) shares back after its correction in Korea. Its price was 120,000 Won before MS's report, and it dropped to 98,000 after its report and they started buying back from 100,000 now. I still strongly believe that this stock will keep going up before tapering. (I hope the Fed does not mention about tapering at Jackson Hole).

4. RSI number is important because we can know if the stock is overbought or not. The current market sentiment is unstable due to upcoming tapering, interest rates, inflation, national debts, infrastructure, etc. and most overbought stock have a high chance to meet its huge corrections later. Ok, so MU's current monthly RSI is 57. It is still in the middle which is a great number for tech growth stock. For example, Nvidia's monthly RSI is 86, AMD's monthly RSI is 85, AMAT is 75, TSM is 76, Qualcomm is 65, and ASML is 93. RSI does not explain everything, but it helps you to know that MU is pretty undervalued.

5. Most great investors always say 'being simple is the best strategy'. I also believe that. Simply, we will make the money if we buy the GOOD stock in cheap way and sell it in expensive way. And simply, MU, a GOOD stock, is cheap now.

6. Here is a better explanation about MU itself (my first MU DD) that shows why MU is a GOOD stock. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/osbr7k/micron\_will\_eventually\_rally\_5080\_upside\_potential/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/osbr7k/micron_will_eventually_rally_5080_upside_potential/)

There is a high chance that the Fed will not mention about tapering at Jackson Hole meeting because of Delta variant problems and slower than expected economy recovery. If they don't, tech stocks have a higher chance to get pumped for a while, and indeed, undervalued stocks have the highest chance to soar. So I personally strongly believe that few more tailwinds can drive MU price up to 20-30% before its next earnings (Sep 27), and 60-100% in 3-6 months depending on market sentiment.

Its current price targets are: Yahoo avg 115.59, Seeking Alpha avg 111.76, Marketwatch avg 115.85,  
Tip Ranks: 112.64, Marketbeat: 112.07, CNN: 112.50. Total Average PT: 113.40.

It is simple, but actually not easy. Buy it now since it is turning to bullish, and sell the news before it actually tanks again. If the tapering is coming? Buy the PUTs or wait until the price became cheap again with healthy correction. And then we get in the ride again when it starts pumping again. I think that is how you can survive in this stupid unpredictable market. I sometimes use option straddle strategy during this unpredictable market because all you need to do is choosing high volatility stocks (I might use this strategy for MU later since it has a high volatility, and the current market is unpredictable).

My positions: 24 Sep 72c x 7 , 24 Sep 68c x 10, owning 100 shares.

Indeed, this is just my DD, no financial advice.

Thank you guys."

For those who lost their ass on weeklies - this is why I say dont do weeklies on micron. 

Why is it dumping? Partially because of people getting margin called and closing out their weeklies. STOP DOING IT.

 ▪ Expect CY-21 DRAM industry bit demand growth to be somewhat above 20%, with DRAM industry supply below demand; there is currently unmet demand for DRAM due to end market strength and we expect the DRAM market to remain tight into CY-22 

▪ Expect CY-21 NAND industry bit demand growth in the mid 30% range, with NAND supply below demand; we also see the NAND market as tight into CY-22 

▪ Long-term DRAM bit demand growth CAGR of mid-to-high teens 

▪ Long-term NAND bit demand growth CAGR of approximately 30% Micron 

▪ Targeting to align our long-term bit supply growth CAGR with the industry bit demand growth CAGR across DRAM and NAND 

▪ CY-21 DRAM and NAND Micron bit supply growth expected to be below industry demand growth 

▪ Placed orders for multiple EUV tools from ASML as part of long-term agreement 

▪ FY21 Capex revised to somewhat above $9.5 bn; mostly from areas that don’t impact CY21 and CY22 bit growth such as EUV pre-payments, construction spending and other R&D and corporate items 

Now during the call, analysts seemed to really dig in deep into Sanjays comments re purchasers shifting from ""just in time"" models to ""just in case"" models. They think this indicates previous purchases were above actual consumption and intended to raise inventory. As such they expect weakening demand and pricing moving forward. 

I disagree with their fears. Sanjay guides in a way so that he can smash at ER. He has done this for Micron and he has done with Sandisk before they got bought out at WDC. Have a look at previous earnings and whether they beat or not.

[https://www.streetinsider.com/ec\_earnings.php?sort=earning\_date&q=mu](https://www.streetinsider.com/ec_earnings.php?sort=earning_date&q=mu) (Sanjay from Q3 2017)

Sanjay knows markets dont like surprise, so he guides low. Hes also been in Semi industry forever. Hes not an idiot. So when he says guidance is X, I take guidance to be X + extra for the beat. I dont freaking think I need to discount the guidance because purchasers increasing inventory. Sanjay has priced that shit in. 

So thats inventory and guidance. 

What about the sale to Texas Instruments? Thats not linked to RAM or NAND really. Kinda but not really. Thats them giving up on (3dx point) Intel Octane. There was no market for it so keeping the plant was costing them 500 mil a year since it was under-utilised. However they kept all the IP from Octane in case it comes back to life later on. Its basically non volatile RAM which can be used as storage - sounds really cool but  I am guessing its expensive AF so people dont want it yet. Again, selling this plant is basically good for micron. We want higher margins to run a slick operation. 

I dont really like toms hardware but this article explains the sale the best. Other news stories on it say there was a sale but doesnt really tell you much about about the background.

[https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/news/micron-to-sell-3d-xpoint-fab-to-texas-instruments-for-dollar900-million](https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/news/micron-to-sell-3d-xpoint-fab-to-texas-instruments-for-dollar900-million)

What is driving increasing margin? Well Micron is using DUV (deep ultra violet) with computational lithography and multiple masks to achieve smaller resolution on DRAM. Samsung are achieving same resolution with EUV. EUV costs a bunch and ASML are the only supplier. You should probably get into ASML at some point as well WSB but thats a post for another day. As such, Microns margins for latest tech DRAM is way lower than Samsung. SK Hynix is the third player in RAM and they are playing catchup - seem a bit fucked to me personally. Nanya is the 4th player and realllllly small and think they are just screwed. Dont have the money to get into EUV so next few generations, they will be so far behind they just get bought out if any competition regulatory body allows it (at near bankruptcy stage is my guess). 

Now Micron is starting to invest in EUV which is good and they have given themselves a lead time for 2 years which feels about right to me. In 2023 we will see if they are still at cutting edge of RAM vs Samsung who will have a 2 year head start into EUV production. This is the only concern to me. In this time, they will gain the benefit of reduced pricing for EUV tech and additional expertise from ASML who will be helping Micron to achieve results. I am hoping they can transplant their specialist know how from DUV to EUV (that everyone else didnt manage to do at this resolution), but at this stage, my science ability is woefully unable to track it meaningfully.

Lets look at Microns plan for EUV and the interim releases until then.  

[https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/12/01/micron-dram-node-shrink-roadmap/](https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/12/01/micron-dram-node-shrink-roadmap/)

So you can see we are currently at 1 alpha node for 10nm in 2021. We have 1 beta and 1 gamma to go planned (still using DUV) before 1 delta which is when EUV should kick in. Thats a new node every year still using DUV. Thats sweet if it works out. In the interim Micron gets to print money like nobodys business (higher margin from DUV) and continue hiring R&D people with EUV knowledge from Korea and Japan. 

I have a small long position in micron. I dont really care about short term price movements. I expect this to be higher in 3 to 6 months. Thats what I care about. I expect it to be higher in 12 months. Beyond that I want to see how their 1 beta and 1 gamma nodes are coming along with updates as to 1 delta using EUV. 

We are trading at price levels from Jan/Feb this year. We have had 2 great ERs since then. I dont see TAM in RAM or NAND dropping any time soon or pricing (thesis of tacit collusion as to supply/pricing in oligopolies - we arent cyclical market anymore because 3 market players control like 98% of the DRAM production in the world - its why they are not dumping on capex - its intentional). 

this is good price to buy, but dont expect results in a week or even a month. We might trade sideways for a while. Shake out the paper hands before funds buy back in at discount and ramp up for next ER. You cant time the ramp up, you just have to be in the stock at a decent price (like now) and then wait for it to happen."
ob5fjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ob5fjq/mu_earnings_upcoming_my_views/,MU - earnings upcoming - my views,17,20,2021-07-01 04:08:18,"[https://investors.micron.com/events-and-presentations](https://investors.micron.com/events-and-presentations)

in about 30 mins from now

I have a small long position in micron. 

May 25 - At JPMorgan Global Technology, Media, and Communications Conference, Micron announed it expects revenue for the quarter to be at or above the high end of the stated guidance range. This is SOP for Sanjay and nice to hear if you have been in Micron for a little while. 

June 1 - announced volume production of DRAM using Node 1Alpha. This is 14nm but using DUV instead of EUV so its cheaper to make. Samsung and SK Hynix are using EUV for 14nm, but havent seen head to head comparisons yet. 

Thesis - If this Node 1 alpha process is comparable to Samsung/SK Hynix 14nm stuff, it means higher margin for Micron. It means better guidance moving forward obviously as well. 

Samsung's former president is in jail which seems to be screwing their business up a bit. Has been steadily losing market share and margin to SK Hynix and Micron. 

(these are my opinions, no proof etc dont sue me)

""Semi conductors are cyclical"" - yeah but we are deep into tacit collusion now on pricing. We basically going to see ""short supply"" forever. The risk here is not in over supply but in an anti-trust/competition ruling. This is going to be incredibly difficult to find unless someone talks or leaves a smoking gun. These companies arent stupid. Its incredibly easy to enter into tacit collusion because its the reasonable and logical choice but its incredibly difficult to prove. Even if they do prove it, the disgorgement in profits still makes it +EV so it doesnt even matter that much. 

People are reading Microns reluctance to increase capex as an indication of no confidence in future demand. Thats not the way I see it. This is part of the tacit collusion. They basically get to tell their competitors ""hey, we are not increasing capex that much and you probably shouldnt either unless you wanna stop the gravy train"". 

Lets extract from their last Q2 report. "" CY-21 DRAM industry bit demand growth of approximately 20%, with DRAM industry supply to be below demand; DRAM market is currently facing a severe undersupply, causing DRAM prices to increase rapidly ... CY-21 NAND industry bit demand growth in the low-to-mid 30% range, with NAND industry supply exceeding demand; more CapEx cuts are needed to allow for healthy NAND industry profitability...Long-term DRAM industry bit demand growth CAGR of mid-to-high teens"" 

followed by

"" CY-21 DRAM & NAND Micron bit supply growth expected to be below industry demand growth...Long-term DRAM & NAND Micron bit supply growth CAGR in line with industry demand growth CAGR...Across DRAM & NAND we target long-term cost reductions in line with industry""

Make of that what you will. Sure seems like a convenient way to say lets all make money together. At the same time its entirely logical and explainable. 

&#x200B;

Things I want to find out in the call:

\- Is micron doing R&D into EUV for the next generation? Contracts lined up with ASML for EUV plant since ASML has a backlog? Might be super secret stuff but would be nice to know. 

\- guidance for next quarter and next financial year (obviously). I think this is going to be higher than expected due to the Node 1 alpha mass production assuming it is decent. 

\- Is Micron going to continue spending money on R&D and poaching talent? Seems to be working so far imo. 

&#x200B;

My thoughts on price - we see a little pop because the high end of guidance is already priced in despite Sanjay always blowing earnings beyond his pre-announcements. Because thats priced in as well. However Micron sometimes sells off post earnings which is incredibly annoying so I dont think weeklies etc are good. Just buy the stock and hold it. 

Historic PE rations etc are all crap here. We are in a new business model. Its not cyclical anymore."
nwnysp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwnysp/amat_dd_and_why_semiconductor_stocks_are_a_great/,$AMAT DD and why semi-conductor stocks are a great play right now,12,17,2021-06-10 21:42:20,"As usual for me, I took some of my adderall prescription and it drove me to write a DD on my most watched stocks at the moment.

Applied Matterials Inc ($AMAT) is a large-cap stock, and I base my play upon it's high quality and strong momentum; as well as confidence in semi-conductor stocks. AMAT provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display and related industries.

Applied Materials is the leading producer of equipment and materials for producing microchips, TV's (OLED's/LCD's), and solar panels. They also have their services business which offers manufacturing consulting and automation software. They are based in California, but have factories around the world, with Asian customers accounting for 80% of it's revenue.

To summarise:

- Semi-conductor systems make 60% of revenue, this is for equipment used to manufacture semiconductor devices such as microprocessors and memory.

- Applied global services provide a quarter of revenue. This is for integrated solutions to optimise equipment, performance and productivity,

- And the display markets account for 10% of it's revenue. Providing products for manufacturing LCD's and OLED displays.

- It's customers include Apple, HP and Dell.

With the current silicon shortage, I expect the stock to surge further when this shortage slows down.

- AMAT has been stair stepping higher in the recent bull trend, as a leader in one of the stronger industry groups in tech (semiconductors), I believe it among other semi-conductor stocks are a great buy for a long right now.

- AMAT's 5-year return on Capital Employed is 25.1%, which is a strong indicator that it has the power to grow profitably. AMAT's share price has had a 72.1% return relative to the market over the past 12 months.

- Furthermore, it's earnings outlook is improving. Analysts are still raising their earnings estimates for the company. For the year, the stock currently has an earnings estimate of $6.53 per share, up 56.59% from a year ago.

- AMAT is testing the 10 week line on the weekly chart, after declining recently. This has formed a handle, and if you rebound from here to get above the handle, there could be a breakout.

- As Nvidia recently broke out we could see other semiconductor stocks such as TSM, AMAT, LCRX, and ASML following this pattern.

- ASML is also in the buy range after finding support at the 10-week line.

Why semi-conductor stocks are a good play: 
- The Innovator IBD Breakout Oppurtunities Index (BOUT) jumped 152% from March 2020 lows before pulling back in February. This ETF is now integrating leading components manufacturers such as DELL, ZBRA, AMAT, LRCX, UCTT, and TER.

Jim Cramer himself is now looking at AMAT, TSM and AMD.

""Cramer recently said that if investors think chips are truly in short supply and we need capital equipment, then the company they most need is Lam Research (LRCX), other than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)""

""Jim Cramer recently named chip equipment major Applied Materials (AMAT), as one of the stocks that got away.

He called out the bull market in semiconductor equipment. We need to make more chips, he said, and companies like Applied Materials can make that happen.

The semiconductor equipment major reported mixed fiscal-second-quarter earnings and received a number of positive reviews and price-target upgrades from Wall Street analysts.""

Anyway, aside from Cramer there are many other reasons to own semi-conductor stocks.

One of my primary reasons is the growth in data centre demand. This was why I bought NVDA calls at $620, aside from the stock-split. AMD is also bringing out new data-centre GPUs.

- There has been a huge growth in demand for data centre equipment, due to the rise in work-from-home driving data centre's to increase their cloud-storage capacities. This has fuelled demand for data-centre chips from data centre operators.

- The data centre market is expected to grow to $519.34 billion during 2021-2025, driven by the growing clout of cloud services and digitization. Further, increase in adoption of multi-cloud and network upgrade to support 5G is fueling growth.

- New semiconductor manufacturing processes from 10nm, 7nm, to 5nm and 3nm has opened new business avenues.

- 5G deployment is spuring further sector growth.

- VR and AR devices, gaming, wearables and drones, have grown in use due to Coronavirus - hence leading to a increase in usage of online services globablly.

- Improvements in DRAM and NAND pricing are fueling semi-conductor stocks catering to the memory market.

- AMD, and TSM delivered good performance in the first quarter driven by data centre demand.

I think my adderall has worn off now, but I will update with a part 2 later on. I'm going to open a position in TSMC, AMAT, LCRX, and ASML today. I will look at AMD also."

lktzoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lktzoi/tsm_is_it_a_buy_at_138/,TSM - Is it a BUY at $138 ?,120,79,2021-02-16 10:51:37,"$TSM - I am in with a cost average at $102. I first invested in it at  $50 but since sold that position was able to re-enter and stayed with my positions at $76 and $103. With 36 shares total I am excited and hopeful this TSM with continue to rally. It even pays a 1.59% Annual Dividend but comes with a small foreign tax fee, my latest tax fee was $.19.

They have purchased land in Arizona for $89 million to manufacture 5nm chips and they expect production can start in 2024 and the project will continue to 2029 with an estimated cost at $12 billion dollars. With expectations of 4nm and 3nm being manufactured by 2022. The P/E is slightly higher than the average with earnings just shy of the average. So your paying a premium but for the largest semiconductor manufacture with a market cap at $715B you also get an advantage in the market with a respectable stock price history, market exposure and a positive future with increasing ability to manufacture more chips in the upcoming years.

I don't think TSM is far away from hitting the $150 and beyond. [Stockinvest.us](https://Stockinvest.us) has price projections near $200 in the next 3 months. I am not too concerned with the timeline but honestly I wouldn't be surprised if it hit $150 next week. I tend to be a bit bullish on TSM and I see this chip shortage being the catalyst that can give us a strong first quarter. With the chip shortage being fueled by the high demand in the auto industry among all the new smart technology devices.

I don't believe investing in TSM or into any position for just 1 reason or even for somebody else's reasons is wise. It's easy to pull up the graph and see the upward trend but I am trying to focus on need for TSM products and the ways they plan on increasing production.

How and if you choose to invest in TSM is up to you. I am long TSM and I am interested in the following as well. 

ON,MU,ASML,AMAT,LRCX 

I hope this was helpful to someone. I think it would be a good idea to at least give it a second look for those looking for Semiconductor exposure."

ktjfsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ktjfsq/why_market_moveslong/,Why market moves(long),156,62,2021-01-09 12:01:50,"To understand how stocks move, first, you gotta understand the interaction between buyers and sellers. Basically, it's Econ-101 supply and demand. Too much demand? Buyers will have to raise their prices so that sellers sell.

Second, the types of market participants. Active and passive participants.

Passive participants are like, buy buy sell buy sell buy sell buy buy buy sell buy sell sell buy. This is almost completely automated and determined by the weighting of the stock versus the index or the methodology that it is following.

The bots of VOO, for example, don't give a damn if an accounting scandal has happened or if a new breakthrough has been reached. Every day, it will buy and sell stocks indiscriminately, following the algos.

And increasingly, newer assets under management are coming mostly under those passive investment vehicles such as passive ETFs, passive mutual funds etc leading to them having a larger and larger share of the market. (I am coming to active participants later)

Thirdly, you gotta understand hedging. Which is basically an investment position to offset losses. Example, you sell a naked call. You see the stock moving closer to the strike price. You immediately buy shares to ensure that you don't take a loss.

# Ok, now why do individual stocks move?

They move based on events (plain old news, market-related movements etc). Now, let's go back to active participants such as retail investors, hedge funds, fund managers etc.

Suppose, there's a quarterly earnings report coming out for ASML. Almost all active participants have somehow figured from various news reports that the earnings report will be good because of the huge demand for ASML's product.

As a result, an active fund manager takes a big position on that stock. The stock moves a bit. Hedge funds and other firms also take their positions.

A retard post about the company's upcoming good earnings on the internet and all early retard investors quickly get in.

The stock moves up. In the meantime, the passive funds are adjusting their position in the stock, realtime. If it's going up. They are buying more to adjust their position.

Now, don't forget. Those passive ETFs or funds have other semiconductor stocks in their ETFs and shits. Which means, even if only ASMLs quarterly earnings were supposed to be good, other stocks of the same sector will benefit. As there are tons of both active and passive algos that don't trade individual stocks but ETFs and similar stuff due to liquidity reasons or other reasons.

Edit: for clarification, this is not the only type of passive investment ETFs. In fact, some will sell if the stock rises.

This gets even better. Suppose, lots of retail investors are also buying call options of this stock. If the underlying continues to go up, the delta could keep on rising. Suppose it went from 5% to 10% to 20%. This would force the option sellers to keep on buying more and more shares and could lead to gamma explosion where the market makers create a violent feedback loop due to hedging.

It gets more fun than that. Remember the various HFT firms and scalper bots? Well, they know it all too well that some firms are busy at hedging frenzy. They also join in on the feeding frenzy that is this stock.

After said earnings release(or most likely, just before it), most of the active participants like retail traders and hedge funds may well start taking profits. And the stock generally runs up more than the expected in the first place.

This leads to the violent unwinding of the positions that we generally see after the earnings release. Because everything happens in the exact reverse order I just described here. That's why it's a terrible gamble to buy options in hope of a good earnings release or similar news.

It feels euphoric if you are on the right side of the tide and equally depressing if you are on the wrong side of the tide.

The same thing can happen in the opposite direction if a piece of bad news is expected or happens.

Here, earnings release is just one of the events that I described. It could be any event like index inclusion, regulatory shifts, stock splits, analyst upgrade-downgrades, some fund manager or hedge funds buying the stock etc.

Also, don't forget that all this is also affecting other stocks in the same sector/region etc due to them being connected through passive investments and active participants exploiting the passive participants.

A very recent example of this happening would be the stock PLTR. Remember, they signed a contract with FDA for $44M but the stock moved almost $10B or more(I haven't calculated) or about 20%. Two weeks ago maybe, Citron declared short attack and a violent unwinding of positions happened and the stock went down about 15-20% after climbing 10-12% that day. Or the day before that when it climbed 20%+.

Now I have sold calls on PLTR (yeah, I like it that your 12/04, 12/11, 12/18 expired or will expire worthless).

**This is not how all stocks move.**

But a large portion of the stocks that are mentioned here in the sub move this way. This is why it sometimes feels like to you folks as KINDA pump and dump. But whether you retards accept it or not I know you guys are the cream of the crop. While most of you act as if you know nothing, I know very well most of you probably make money.

You guys are like people who watch tech reviews to buy a smartphone.

Ok, I completely went out of topic. Sorry.

**This is not how all stocks move.**

Some boomer stocks like MMM, JBT etc may have low retail interest. In those cases, the stocks are almost absolutely up to the mercy of other active participants, who or which may as well not care that much leaving those stocks to the hands of the algos of passive participants.

But in those whole processes, there's almost no price discovery that's actually working. Passive algos are buying and selling (but mostly creating buying pressure) completely arbitrarily, HFT bots buying and selling because, reasons.

The participants who are using traditional valuation metrics, analyzing the good and bad of stocks are getting outnumbered by all the other participants and generally speaking, the volume of their trades are also declining in the overall market. Think of big participants like Berkshire(which is undoubtedly the most powerful active participant in the market), pension funds, sovereign funds etc, they barely buy or sell any stocks they have if they have entered on the right price.

Sure, I am kinda underselling the influence of big institutional investors, but it is not completely without any merit.

**So you are saying there's no price discovery in the various stocks?**

Absolutely not. Even in the greatly flawed system I described being used by most market participants there's plenty of it happening by newsflashes, sell-side analyst recommendations, retail fomoers etc.

Only the stocks that have heavy institutional ownerships, with a healthy retail interest seems to me to be less volatile(this is my intuition speaking really, so this statement is probably false in the first place) such as MSFT etc and they probably have better price discovery.

**What about those stocks doubling the day they IPO?**

The reason behind that is very simple. Tons of retail investors place Market Orders. This means they are ready to pay whatever the price this thing will go for. In those scenarios, investment banks can hardly control the price of the stock as there's just too much demand to satisfy. In short, it's a feeding frenzy. And this is one of the things that's primarily driven by retail interest.

**What about those SPACs and low-float stocks?**

Well, this again needs no explaining. Too low float, too much interest. Various whales also know this and use this for their benefit. After the merger is complete(or slightly before it) retail investors and whales leave for the next thing in the line. So the stock tanks and the stock price never recovers.

If the company that's being pumped is actually any good, the stock would likely later get the attention it deserves after the sell-off.

I hope all those points are good enough to explain most of the funky behaviour an individual stock would make. I know my explanations are not exhaustive and there are many angles I haven't covered, but it is what it is.

Now, to the MORE IMPORTANT STUFF. Individual stocks also move due to numerous macro reasons. When the entire market is in a euphoric phase, you can throw a dart and that stock would move up. The opposite and the stock would go down.

# Why and how does the market move?

Liquidity. This is probably the most important thing that drives the market as a whole.

Excess liquidity that's circling around will inevitably try to enter into the economy in one way or another. Either through purchasing more assets or any other way.

Now, we all know it pretty well that this trend is being exaggerated by the low-interest-rate environment that's present in the current developed markets. People are being forced to participate in the market in the hunt for return.

Also, almost every investor from every country seems to be more interested to participate in the US stock market, even more than their home markets. And the recent trend of commission-free brokerage services and easy flow of capital has helped to provide even more participation in the stock market than usual.

Options trading is also at historic highs and probably most of you buy call options and put options is probably mostly bought by institutional investors(like it always were). As a whole, this frenzy can move the market very quickly.

Remember, SoftBank bought billions in options on very concentrated tech names? That along with retail call options purchasing mania lead the market to a euphoric state. The S&P 500 has become so heavily influenced by those tech names that if they move, the entire market moves. If they fall, the entire market falls.

But we haven't probably addressed a big elephant in the room. Volatility suppression.

Futures traders, algos, our central bank etc all are participating in the dangerous game of volatility suppression. 

This all can unwind though. And it can unwind fairly quickly.

If we take the case of February or March. If you remember, Mr Ackman was screaming fire, fire, fire(he have had his intentions) but the market was barely paying attention.

But with the lockdowns and everything, suddenly everyone seems to have gotten caught with their pants down.

And you know how quick all the things were. Active investors, retail investors everyone suddenly flocked for put options, VIX etc. A Minsky moment has suddenly come.

Margin calls, longs are burnt left and right, market makers have completely turned their positions etc, you know the usual deal but exactly in the opposite direction.

Suddenly gold, treasuries, cryptos etc whatever are being sold to cover their positions. Institutional investors are suddenly visited by their risk managements and they suddenly become net sellers.

Passive investments vehicles also sell stocks that are being kicked heavily.

Literally, everyone's a seller. No one wants to buy. And the situation doesn't change until the Fed comes in and says, ""Brrrr"".

Liquidity suddenly becomes available in the debt market. Retail investors jump. Buy the dip, they said. Money keeps flowing in from everywhere.

There are many other things that I probably needed to say to complete the story. But it is what it is.

Also, interest rate trumps over everything. Every valuation metrics, pricing schemes are dependent on it. So that's super important.

Let's say suddenly interest rates rise the market will immediately collapse along with your meme stock. Because of two main reasons. Every company is loaded with debt and the risk free return has just increased resulting in more money chasing treasury bonds and other instruments.

# These pieces of information any useful?

Yes and no. As they say, hindsight is always 20/20.

Let me tell you my short story navigating the market this year.

February. News of the virus and everything. I see VIX, S&P, bond market, foreign markets etc and I keep sucking my thumb thinking nothing's going to happen. Being burnt by two trades and market starting to freefall almost. I realize my mistake and change my strategy.

Fed says, ""Brrr"". I fail to change my strategy. Something even worse could be coming. Lol. After almost a week passing I realise my f\*\*\*ing mistake. Again. At least I can say it's not just me.

The information is almost always there. Problem is we(not everyone of course, some of you are much more flexible) fail to act upon it. 

Ok, one more story about an individual stock.

Remember AAPL's third-quarter earnings result? I sold calls before earnings thinking the stock will go down after earnings report.

There was overwhelming evidence that this is not going to be true. And I read almost all of it (WFH and everything). Yet my monkey brain somehow decided to trust the analyst estimates and the overall news cycle surrounding the economy.

AAPL then reported a literal blow away quarterly earnings report.

For me 2020 was a year of reckoning and I learned to remove my directional assumption from the market and to just go with the flow. But I am pretty sure it wouldn't matter, cause when it's time, I just wouldn't remember.

I posted this one before but it got removed by votebots."
