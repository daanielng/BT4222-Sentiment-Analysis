1. The founder of Bridgewater Dalio: the Fed may raise interest rates 4-5 times next year, which will be a sensitive issue

Rui Dalio, founder of the world's largest hedge fund Bridgewater, said in an exclusive interview that the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates 4-5 times next year until it negatively affects the stock market.

Regarding the current inflationary pressure, Dalio pointed out that the U.S. now has two types of inflation: a cyclical inflation that occurs when demand for goods and services exceeds production capacity, and a monetary inflation caused by the over-issuance of money and credit.

For the second type of inflation, he warned that if cash and bond holders were to sell these assets in a big way, the central bank would have to raise interest rates at a faster pace or keep them low by printing money and buying financial assets, and this would exacerbate inflation. This adds difficulty to the Fed's policy making.

Cerence Inc.

CRNC- $78.10

Market cap- $3.01 B 

Cerence Inc., (CRNC $72.52) is the market leading provider of embedded voice-powered assistance and artificial intelligence (AI) software for automotive manufacturers worldwide. CRNC enables drivers to use their voice to control internal features in the car such as using the cars navigation system, infotainment systems, and connect to the outside internet via cloud providers such as Google, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft bringing the ability to use third party external services such as sending a text, making a phone call, making a reservation through Open Table or getting a weather update. This is all through voice activated artificial intelligence capability provided by CRNC.  Car OEMs around the world can use CRNC's platform for both voice activated control of internal systems in the automobile and connecting to outside third party service providers via the cloud. Enabling a true connected car to be realized.  CRNC has around 53% market share of the cars with voice activated internal control systems and around 13-15% market share of cars with connected capabilities.

We feel the street's reaction to CRNC's results and outlook were overly negative and this is a case of a good company with a lower than expected outlook getting taken out to the woodshed and beaten.  The stock dropped over 20% the day the company reported September quarter results and has continued to drop in the week since the report and is down around 33% since reporting Q4FY2021 results on November 22nd.  However, we believe this is an opportunity to Buy the stock at a much lower price point with a move back to the $125 level over the next few quarters as automotive production increases as the supply chain of semiconductors or integrated circuits (ICs) improves.  We believe automotive production is bottoming as we speak and will start to get better in 1-2 quarters. And as this happens we believe CRNC's stock will start to move higher over the next few months and we would be adding to positions at current valuations for a move back up above $125. 

CRNC gets paid several different ways from automotive OEMs with the biggest being licensing revenue for the embedded voice activated software shipped with each new car produced which controls the cars internal systems such as stereo, navigation and control systems of the car.  The company typically gets a one-time up front licensing fee for each car shipped with CRNC's embedded software installed that totals on average $4.00-$5.00 per car (more for premium models and less for entry level cars).  This revenue is recognized in a lump sum when the car ships with CRNC's embedded software installed.  CRNC has around 53-58% market share of cars that ship with some form of embedded control systems (73% of cars have voice activated software and CRNC has 80% share of the 73%). with competition coming from I-Fly Technology in China and a US company called Soundhound.

The company also offers voice activated connectivity solutions allowing CRNC to offer drivers to access outside services via the cloud such as checking the weather, making dinner reservations, searching for a gas station or making a phone call all activated by voice hands free.  CRNC generates revenue when cars are produced using the company's voice activated connectivity solutions versus if the user or driver of the car actually uses the connectivity solutions.  This revenue stream equates to around $1.00-$1.50 per car per year for the length of the contract.  Revenue is received up front for the life of the contract and is amortized over the period of the contract in equal amounts each year generating a large deferred revenue balance and great quarterly predictability as over 80% of revenue each quarter comes from recurring revenue streams.  The competition in this segment is mainly internally produced solutions from the automotive OEMs so we feel more OEMs will outsource this capability in the future to people focused on this market with a broader product line such as CRNC.

In addition, CRNC has around a $2 billion backlog of design wins with key automotive OEMs worldwide for cars that have yet to come into production creating an even more predictable future revenue stream if the cars move into production with the company's embedded voice activated software or its connectivity software solutions.  We would expect this total backlog to take another huge jump higher over the next couple of quarters as one of CRNC's European automotive customers is expected to use CRNC's embedded solutions in a wider swath of its cars and brands generating another order that could be worth more than $100 million. CRNC had two orders in FY2020 that added up to over $230 million worth of orders and backlog from the same European automotive customer and total orders in FY2020 added up to over $835 million again suggesting the company's huge backlog of orders should provide strong revenue visibility and predictable results once automotive production normalizes.

CRNC collects up front licensing revenue when a car is produced using its connectivity solutions versus the user actually using the services.  This is one of the key issues on the September quarter conference call that caused investors to be nervous and the stock to drop over 20% as when this revenue source dropped sequentially many investors took this as a sign CRNC was seeing less usage per car of its connected services which is not the case.  CRNC gets paid if the car is produced using CRNC's connectivity solutions, and not how much each driver actually uses the services, so this revenue source dropped sequentially because of lower auto production levels caused by chip shortages and some one-time spikes in this revenue line item in the June quarter making the sequential comparisons difficult.

Another reason the stock got smacked down after the conference call is investors are now more skeptical with the company's FY2024 revenue target of $600 million given the slow growth environment CRNC is currently facing driven by anemic level of current automotive production.  If growth is projected to be in the 9-16% range for FY2022 to $400-$425 million (which was below the street's initial estimate of $440) this suggests growth must accelerate to 30%+ in FY2023 and FY2024 to hit the longer-term target of $600 million in FY2024.

We believe growth will accelerate for CRNC as overall automotive production improves as IC chip shortages slowly subside during 2022 and into 2023.  Increased levels of total production, increasing market share with key auto OEMs for its core voice activated embedded control software, further penetration into connected services with multiple new and current customers, new connected service offerings and new product introductions for new markets such as ATVs, trucks, and elevators should drive the growth required to hit the $600 million revenue target by FY2024.  Having around a $2 billion backlog and a large deferred revenue balance and 81% of total revenue coming from recurring revenue sources helps with the predictability and visibility into future revenue and EPS growth giving us confidence revenue growth will accelerate. We are convinced auto production is or has bottomed recently and will grind slowly higher over the next few quarters.  As investors see the increase in overall auto production CRNC's stock will start to move higher and when overall production gets back to normalized levels the stock should move back above $125.

Even if the fundamentals are golden, why trade these stocks when the public is just going to keep pushing big tech P/E higher? Microsoft has risen 50% YTD despite sup-par earnings and SITS AT A P / E OF 36.6. Apple keeps rising (30.8 P to E) but can they really keep increasing the prices of their products even higher? Do you guys think that big tech p to e will just keep shooting up despite meh earnings like it has in the past 3 years? Keep in mind Microsoft p to e in 2019 was just 25.5 and Apples was around ONLY 16. What is really interesting is that these P/E were stagnant from 2010 to 2018 but for some reason the market just blew up the price earnings of many companies around the start of 2018. This is Walmart for example. See how P/E was normal for years until suddenly 2018? My theory is that many people in the market are new investors so they don't care about P/E and just dump their money into index funds or companies they think are doing well like Walmart. This is making it harder for investors to properly gage the market for good picks because it doesn't even matter how these companies do, they just go up anyways.

Maybe I don’t understand how a mutual fund was priced but I thought it was a function of its constituents.

I also took a second to look around and googled to try to find out why it crashed so bad on Friday but I could not find anything.

Any help would be appreciated"

The 2008 financial crisis can be summed up as follows: banks believed that giving out loans with poor due diligence to shitty lenders was basically free money.

Then Affirm comes along and says, “Hold my beer”.

Affirm’s business model is simple. They allow you to make online purchases without having to pay upfront. By integrating with e-commerce platforms they make using their service seamless, which is great for their top-line. However, as we learnt from 2008, aggressively giving out loans isn’t free money. It’s a time-bomb.

&#x200B;

**The Data**

Let’s look at the data. A loan is considered delinquent if it is past due by more than 30 days. Here are Affirm’s delinquency rates. Some data is unavailable.

&#x200B;

||Q1 '20|Q2 '20|Q3 '20|Q4 '20|Q1 '21|Q2 '21|Q3 '21|Q4 '21|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Delinquency Rates|\-|3.30%|\-|2.40%|2.50%|4.00%|5.30%|\-|
|Stimulus Cheques|\-|$1200|\-|$600|$1400|\-|\-|\-|

&#x200B;

Delinquency rates went down for Affirm between Q2 of 2020, and Q4 of 2020, and remained somewhat stable in Q1 2021. This was when people lost their jobs. So how were they paying back their loans? Stimulus cheques, of course. Once the cheques stopped Affirm’s share of bad loans started to spike, going from 2.4% to 5.3% in just 6 months.

Note that this number denotes delinquent loans as a % of loans held. It doesn’t refer to the number of shitty loans taken up during the period. Think of it this way: you have 10 apples, but 2 of them are rotten. Your rotten rate is 20%. Next day you get 10 more apples, of which 4 are rotten. Your rotten rate is now 30% (which is only about 50% higher than yesterday, even though you took on 100% more rotten apples today).

So, am I saying that the American economy is going to explode in an orgy of unpaid-for Lululemons bought by people who don't understand what debt is? I was hoping to find a similar trend in delinquency rates for credit card debt, but what I found was surprising:

&#x200B;

||Q1 '20|Q2 '20|Q3 '20|Q4 '20|Q1 '21|Q2 '21|Q3 '21|Q4 '21|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Delinquency Rates (Affirm)|\-|3.30%|\-|2.40%|2.50%|4.00%|5.30%|\-|
|Delinquency Rates (Banks)|2.66%|2.43%|2.02%|2.11%|1.85%|1.58%|1.57%|\-|

&#x200B;

\* Source: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRCCLACBS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRCCLACBS)

In the time that Affirm’s delinquency rates went from 2.4% to 5.3% (an increase of 120%) banks saw their delinquency rates go down from 2.11% to 1.57% (a decrease of 25%). People are paying their personal debts. Just not to Affirm.

Here’s a table that might explain why the delinquency rate went up for Affirm:

&#x200B;

||Q1 '20|Q2 '20|Q3 '20|Q4 '20|Q1 '21|Q2 '21|Q3 '21|Q4 '21|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Delinquency Rates (Affirm)|\-|3.30%|\-|2.40%|2.50%|4.00%|5.30%|\-|
|Credit score > 96|\-|71.04%|\-|74.69%|71.22%|66.20%|62.88%|\-|
|Credit score < 90 / no score|\-|0.26%|\-|0.31%|0.58%|0.66%|0.90%|\-|

&#x200B;

My educated guess: Affirm is taking on riskier loans to grow the top-line, and it’s starting to go south. Stimulus cheques delayed the fall.

My scandalous guess: Affirm is trying to grow the top-line at all costs to keep the share prices inflated, allowing executives and investors to make an exit before their retail shareholders learn to read financial statements.

&#x200B;

||Q1 '20|Q2 '20|Q3 '20|Q4 '20|Q1 '21|Q2 '21|Q3 '21|Q4 '21|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Delinquency Rates (Affirm)|\-|3.30%|\-|2.40%|2.50%|4.00%|5.30%|\-|
|Insider selling|\-|\-|\-|\-|$43m|\-|\-|$101m|
|Stock compensation|$7m|$5m|$6m|$6m|$140m|$135m|$93m|\-|

&#x200B;

Affirm had seen less insider selling than most other companies, with only $43m worth of shares sold in the last year. However, that changed in November 2021. Between 1st November and 1st December (just 30 days), insiders sold $101m worth of shares.

Needless to say the stock compensation shot up 2,300% (Q1 2021) when the trouble started brewing.

&#x200B;

**The Valuation**

Affirm has a ridiculous valuation. Since they don’t make a profit we can’t calculate their PE. The world of investing believes that tech companies can turn off their selling expenses at will, while maintaining their revenues, so the losses are transitory.

Affirm’s revenues for the year end 2021 were $870m. Let us assume their technology costs, selling expenses, and admin expenses were 75% less than actual numbers. Next, let us take a tax rate of 20%. This would give them a profit of $21m for the year.

That’s a PE of 1534. Affirm will have a PE of 1534 if they reduce their overheads by 75%. I don’t think a tech company has ever reduced their overheads by 75%. And this isn't even considering the inherent business risk explained above.

Who is still holding Affirm shares?

&#x200B;

**The Future**

The bulls will tell you Affirm is run by exceptionally talented and honest people who will turn Affirm into the next Microsoft, and every data point here is lying. When has corporate America ever fucked shareholders. Hopium is a hell of a drug.

Here is what I think will happen:

People start to notice the rise in delinquency rates, prompting Affirm to cut down on risky loans. They take a massive hit to their growth rate, and acknowledge the issue. People get flashbacks of 2008. Eye-popping growth rates are the only reason tech companies can trade at such high valuations. With that gone, Affirm’s stock will drop into a bottomless well, and $WISH will seem like a good investment.

&#x200B;

**How to Play This**

The market was already rotating from growth into value stocks as I wrote this, which means Affirm’s downfall could come sooner. However, I like to have a margin of safety and would recommend puts that are 1 or (ideally) 2 earnings away. I wouldn’t shy away from far OTM puts since the stock will drop really far once people truly realize the risk here.

December 2022 puts $30 puts were recently sold for $0.89. Defensive investors can aim for a higher strike price. Analysts have given Affirm a target price of $161. I give Affirm a fair target price of $2.75, if they can cut down their overheads. Needless to say, no one will be hiring me as an analyst anytime soon.

I had my thesis about Affirm in **November 2021**, and bought some puts then. I only decided to write this DD recently. I am planning to load up on more puts.

My position from November:

[Goldman Sachs Group Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US)  strategists said there’s little reason to expect a major retreat in  U.S. stocks in the months ahead, even as the breadth of the rally that  has pushed the S&P 500 index into successive records is getting  increasingly narrow. 

**Just five stocks account for 51% of the U.S.  benchmark’s returns since April,** Goldman’s strategists led by David  Kostin wrote in a note to clients. Those same stocks - [Apple Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US), [Microsoft Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MSFT:US), [Alphabet Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GOOGL:US), [NVIDIA Corp](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/NVDA:US)., and [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US)  \- together account for more than a third of the gauge’s returns this  year and more than a fifth of its total market capitalization, according  to the strategists. 

**The S&P 500 rose to another** [**all-time-high on Friday**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/R3X4IXT0AFB4)**,**  after a swift rebound from a post-Thanksgiving slump triggered by the  spread of the omicron variant. The highest year-over-year U.S. inflation  reading since 1982, and an increasingly hawkish tone from the [Federal Reserve](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/13598Z:US), have not [deterred investors](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-10/dip-buyers-scoring-historic-win-in-stocks-that-defy-bond-warning) from buying the dips. 

The difference between the initial post-pandemic  rebound and the recent gains is that the breadth of the rally has  markedly narrowed, and this has been causing alarm, according to  Goldman. “Following periods of sharply narrowing market breadth –  similar to the recent experience – equities have historically exhibited  weaker-than-average returns and deeper drawdowns,” the strategists  wrote. 

Looking ahead though, there are few  reasons to see why history would repeat itself this time.  **“The macro  environment does not suggest drawdown risk is elevated in the coming  months,” the strategists wrote,** highlighting that earnings and margins  continue to surpass expectations, a low risk of recession, and share  prices already reflecting the likely Fed tightening. 

“Nominal and real rates are expected to rise but  remain low over the coming months, supporting the backdrop for both  valuation and equity demand,” the strategists said, **advising investors  to own stocks with high growth and high margins.**

In any case, I feel very strongly about this play, and wanted to see if y'all agree.

Gitlab, $GTLB, operates off the freemium model where free users are converted to paying customers. In June of this year, less than 1% of its customers actually paid for their services.

&#x200B;

Though revenue has grown year-over-year by by 87%, their actual cash flow declined from -$149 million in fiscal 2020, to -$229 million in fiscal 2021. They are bleeding money, and the IPO was essentially a way to prevent themselves from going bankrupt.

&#x200B;

This could be okay, so long as the company is gaining steady footing in the industry. However, it is competing with the likes of Microsoft's GitHub. Microsoft can afford to offer GitHub's services for much cheaper to capture the market share, and indeed after their acquisition, the price of GitHub's lowest price plan nearly halved, from $9/month to $4/month.

Subscriptions is the ONLY way Gitlab makes money, and their dwindling market share is going to be reflected.

&#x200B;

Next up, how about their valuation?

Uhhh.....**12.5 billion**, at the time of this post.

&#x200B;

Even at a valuation of $8 billion, they would have to triple their current market share, reverse the downward trend in profits, and grow revenue by over 17x.

Furthermore, from f2020-f2021, their R&D costs increased by 79%. In the 6 months ending last July? It only increased 13%. It is hard to innovate and compete with the likes of Microsoft and Oracle when you are spending fractions of what they are on developing new products and attracting customers.

&#x200B;

The stock is wildly overvalued, and I feel strongly that their first earnings call today after hours will bring a hard-about.

Put premiums are sadly through the roof, but if it's a large enough move, ITM should be safe.

&#x200B;

Risks:

I've been wrong on timing before. But I honestly do not see how this could rocket given that they bleed money profusely, and lose market share to boot. The valuation is so ridiculous! But, this is their first earnings call, so it's unknown territory

&#x200B;

TL;DR:

This company is wildly overvalued,  bleeding money, and steadily losing market share to Microsoft's GitHub. The first earnings call today after hours should reflect this.

Put premiums and IV are skyrocketing, to the point where 12/17 strikes might not even be worth it. Nonetheless, ITM should be safe.

YOLO:

12/17 60P for \~$170

12/17 80P for \~$650

&#x200B;

Safe(r):

I was ""forced"" into TDOC because of that, as my shares were transferred to TDOC. Was around 150% up in LVGO, but missed the merger date so was not able to sell my LVGO shares on time. TDOC then picked up a bit of momentum in early 2021, reaching an ATH of 308 in February. Now trading around 92/93, that is a 70% decline in 8 months! I kept on buying the ""dips"" since February, now holding 455 shares at 149$, -35% down (-22.5K$)

Amazing how things could change that much within a year! This is even wild in the K\*R\*Y\*P\*T\*O market.....

And the sad thing is, even if there comes a stellar q4 ER report, the stock may go up 10% or so, no more..... but to break even, I need 53% runup... And there maybe even more desperate souls out there that have bought near ATH that need like 250% runup to break even...

Also strange that the stock is plunging even on those days the covid variant FUD is lifting some covid play stocks like ZM and PLTON. The recent sell off of some growth stock (E.g. NET, SE, ) could be attributed to profit taking as they have rallied pretty hard this year, which is the opposite of TDOC...

I read a recent article from Seeking A\* entitled ""Teladoc: Understanding The Difference Between A Broken Company And A Broken Stock"", that comforted me a bit, sharing the highlights here below:

**TLDR**

**T*****eladoc shareholders had a rough couple of months as shares declined by more than 40% YTD and are down roughly 60% from all-time highs in February.***

***Telehealth has seen rapid uptake during the pandemic and utilization rates continue to be more than 30-times higher than pre-pandemic.***

***McKinsey estimated that telehealth could become a >$250bn annual market opportunity in the US alone.***

***Teladoc has pioneered the telehealth industry and has shown strong operating performance while many competitors are failing to keep up.***

***The big question is if the stock can shake off the negative sentiment as a Covid stock and reverse its downtrend. We believe it can.***

***In our view, investors are currently factoring in too much negativity with Teladoc. We believe that the company's future will be driven by the inevitable adoption of virtual care delivery which will help to eliminate major healthcare resource constraints, especially for physician visits and chronic disease management. Remember that the Telehealth market in the US alone is estimated to be a quarter-trillion dollar opportunity at some point. With the majority of that market coming from virtual physician office visits ($126 billion) and the remaining opportunity being equally distributed from virtual urgent care, near-virtual office visits, virtual home health services, as well as tech-enabled home medication administration, Teladoc seems perfectly positioned to capture a significant share of this market as it continues to build out its multitude of services. We believe Teladoc should be able to address up to 80% of the market opportunity with its services.***

&#x200B;

Article (without figures)

It is important to highlight that the telehealth market is still in its infancy and subject to many barriers like accessibility, quality perception, as well as regulatory and partial reimbursement restrictions. The global telehealth market was valued at 62.5 billion USD in 2020 and forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 26.5% until 2026. North America remains by far the largest market as the US market revenue crossed USD 36.6bn in 2020. The US market is expected to grow at a CAGR of close to 30% until 2026 which would result in a market size of >$150 billion by 2026.

There is no doubt that Teladoc will likely continue to grow its business at a significant pace, albeit at slower rates than during the heights of the pandemic. In our view the return to more reasonable and sustainable growth rates was inevitable. At the same time, management's forecast for >$4bn in revenue by 2024 means the company will at least double its current revenues within 3 years which is a strong sign of confidence. We believe that Teladoc can sustain these growth rates at least until 2026 and may be able to reach between $6.2 and $7.5 bn in revenues by 2026. At a current market cap of 18 billion, shares are starting to look quite attractive for long-term investors.

There is a big difference between a broken company and a broken stock and being able to make returns in a selloff requires understanding the difference between the two. When the market or a particular sector suffers huge losses, investors have an opportunity to buy good companies that have taken an unfair beating at attractive prices. We believe Teladoc (TDOC) provides such an opportunity given its leadership position in a secular growth industry. When speaking about telehealth, the first company that actually comes to mind is Teladoc as it has pioneered the rise of the telehealth market to a large extent, which was further accelerated by the pandemic.

Teladoc shares entered 2020 just above $80 per share. The share price shot higher amidst increased demand for virtual healthcare delivery as the pandemic hit the world. Shares reached an all-time high in the beginning of 2021 around $300. Since the end of February, shares are in a continuous downtrend and are down more than 40% YTD and around 60% since its all-time highs in February, compared to a 25% YTD gain for the S&P 500.

And while the company continued to report strong growth rates, investors seem concerned about the sustainability of the company's growth and path to profitability. Teladoc posted another set of strong topline growth rates in its most recent quarter, while also boosting its full-year revenue guidance. Management also provided a longer-term outlook until 2024 at its most recent investor day calling for >$4bn in revenue, representing a CAGR between 25 to 30%.

But that seemingly isn't enough to please investors and reverse the downtrend. While the outlook anticipates strong sustained growth, the growth rate is far lower compared to last year. In our view, the return to more reasonable and sustainable growth rates was inevitable in light of the re-opening of economies across the globe. Nevertheless, Teladoc's 2024 forecast means the company will continue its strong path of growth (albeit at slower rates) and will at least double its current revenues within 3 years.

We believe that Teladoc can sustain these growth rates at least until 2026 and may be able to reach between $6.2 and $7.5 bn in revenues by 2026. At a current market cap of 18 billion, shares are starting to look quite attractive for long-term investors that may want to participate in this secular growth industry.

This article will look at Teladoc's most recent financial performance, outlook and will put things into context of the current state of telehealth globally. Let's start with the latter.

The Current State of Telehealth

Telehealth is seeing a historically high consumer demand that keeps to be significantly higher than pre-Covid-pandemic levels. While telehealth was rather perceived as a commodity, the pandemic has shown that it became an essential part of our everyday lives. It has become a necessity, an important bridge to allow patients to continue to receive necessary care. Telehealth has enabled to eliminate major healthcare system constraints, e.g., hospital beds and physician visiting hours that were needed for taking care of Covid patients while capacities for regular in-patient visits in chronic or mental care were almost completely eliminated.

On the basis of a recent study by McKinsey, Teladoc estimates that the opportunity for telehealth adoption in the US alone could represent up to $261 billion.

It is important to highlight that this opportunity still needs to be fully realized as the industry is still in its infancy and subject to many barriers like accessibility, quality, as well as regulatory and partial reimbursement restrictions. In 2020 the global telehealth market was valued at $62.45 billion and is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 26.5% until 2026, and North America crossed $36.6 billion in annual spend. Analysts are expecting the US market to grow at a CAGR of close to 30% until 2026 which would result in a market size of >$150 billion by 2026.

With this huge opportunity in mind, where do we stand today?

Overall, there are 3 key enablers that determine the future market growth: 1) consumer demand and acceptance, 2) provider willingness and ability to offer telehealth on a more regular basis, and 3) regulatory changes supporting necessary access and reimbursement.

In terms of consumer demand, a McKinsey report showed that, in April 2020, right after the COVID pandemic hit the world, telehealth utilization was 78 times higher than in February 2020.

Now that the pandemic is having less of an impact as vaccines have become widely available, and lockdown restrictions are being lifted, telehealth use is still at significantly higher levels than pre-pandemic. Telehealth utilization has now stabilized at levels 38X higher vs. pre-pandemic. At the beginning of the pandemic, more than 32% of office and outpatient visits were occurring via telehealth in April 2020. Now utilization levels have largely stabilized with up to 17% of all outpatient/office-based visits being delivered virtually or virtually-enabled.

Despite the relatively higher overall utilization rates compared to pre-pandemic levels, there is still a high level of variation with respect to the point of care and specialties where telehealth is being provided, with mental health services and endocrinology being in the top 3 of service modalities as of February 2021. Similarly, perception of telehealth usage has continuously improved. Around half of the consumers intend to continue to use telehealth going forward, up from 11% prior to COVID-19. This is in line with what Teladoc reported during its most recent Investor Day Presentation.

However, there is still some concern, especially on the consumer side on the quality, safety and accessibility of the technology, the latter being especially true for elderly people. Telehealth care delivery models are likely to adapt to such barriers by means of extending their platform offerings from fully virtual care delivery to offering also hybrid virtual and technology enabled in-person care delivery to really break down such barriers.

On the provider side, McKinsey suggests that more than half (58%) of doctors view telehealth more favorably now than they did before the COVID pandemic. Looking at actual utilization, 84% of doctors are now offering virtual visits. It has become clear, however, that costs of care delivery and reimbursement regulations are important aspects to consider moving forward.

Also, from a regulatory standpoint, things have progressed in favor of making telehealth a permanent care delivery option, enabling access and reimbursement for a range of telehealth services. For example, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have expanded coverage on reimbursable telehealth services in the 2021 physician fee schedule final rule.

Investments in virtual healthcare have skyrocketed lately, with 3 times the level of venture investment in 2020 vs. 2017. Per Rock Health's H1 2021 digital health funding report 10 the total venture capital investment into the digital health space in the first half of 2021 totaled $14.6 billion, nearly twice the investment from 2019 ($7.7 billion).

*Is Telehealth here to stay?*

As we continue to move out of the pandemic into a more normalized healthcare delivery environment, there is no doubt that telehealth will remain an important component of healthcare delivery, supported by improved customer and provider perceptions, regulatory improvements, and a broadening of access to and coverage of services. Further broad-based adoption will require that providers and regulators work closely together to address some of the still imminent barriers, especially integrating virtually enabled services into the day-to-day routine of clinicians to enable hybrid care models.

One last point to note is that telehealth still remains a highly fragmented industry. This creates two important necessities: first, there is a clear need for a better and more holistic value proposition by means of a whole-person care approach where services from multiple disciplines are integrated to provide the best customer experience. From an industry perspective, this means that consolidation is inevitable to achieve this necessary level of integration.

This brings us to the most important conclusion: telehealth will likely be a winner takes most industry and only a few relevant players will be able to scale their services and will take most of the market opportunity. McKinsey estimated that up to $250 billion in annual healthcare spend could be up for grab, with the majority of that market coming from virtual physician office visits ($126 billion) and the remaining opportunity being equally distributed from virtual urgent care ($35bn), near-virtual office visits ($39 bn), and virtual home health services ($35 bn), as well as an additional $12bn in tech-enabled home medication administration.

What does it mean for Teladoc?

With the above in mind, it becomes obvious that Teladoc has positioned itself as the leader to capture the significant market opportunity in virtual care delivery as its services address almost every area of virtual care delivery.

Also in terms of its provider network, Teladoc is already operating at a significant scale with its network of more than 10 thousand care providers and more than 76 Mio members as of Q3 2021. And management sees a long runway of member growth ahead with currently 92 Mio people (\~31% of insured lives in the U.S.) having access to a Teladoc product, and \~63 Mio additional potential customers to grab from existing clients, managed care organizations and Medicare & Medicaid Fee-for-Service lives.

Management also believes that the opportunity across the 92 Mio individuals who currently have access to one of its services constitutes at least a $75bn annual revenue opportunity, with significant upside to $137bn if customers would opt for multi-product adoption across Teladoc's services portfolio.

Below is an illustration on how multi-product adoption by an employer with 10,000 customers may lead to 4.1x higher revenues vs. a single condition product adoption. This is an important aspect to keep in mind as medical conditions do not occur in isolation, and for example, 40% of Americans live with two or more chronic conditions (like diabetes and hypertension) in parallel and would benefit from an integrated care delivery approach. Teladoc's solutions can offer exactly what is needed and can reinforce each other to drive broader engagement across the platform.

And Teladoc is in a leading position to make whole-person virtual care delivery a reality, especially through its Primary360 platform, which functions as the gateway to enabling fully integrated whole-person care delivery. Management estimates that around 80% of the US population could benefit from one of its primary care services under the Primary360 platform, with the total addressable market for managing Diabetes and Hypertension alone representing a $47bn opportunity.

Its ability to penetrate the increasing customer need for virtual care delivery solutions is also reflected in the most recent quarterly numbers. For Q3 2021, Teladoc reported:

Revenue growth of 81% YoY to $522 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $67.4 million, growing by 71% YoY.

Revenue growth was driven by +99% YoY growth in access fees revenue and +18% YoY growth in visit fee revenue. Growth in the US came in at 89% vs. 17% growth for international geographies. The difference between US and international is partly historical but was also impacted by the acquisition of Livongo, which is only available to US customers at the moment.

Total visits for the quarter reached 3.9M at a 37% YoY growth rate, showing an acceleration from around 28% growth in the previous quarter, and driven by a 40% increase in US visits vs. 19% growth for international visits.

U.S. Paid Members gained \~2% YoY in Q3, which is a deceleration from the prior-year growth. However, it is good to see that Paid Members and PMPM (per member per month) fees are continuing to trend upwards in parallel as both are two important metrics that together will drive topline growth moving forward.

Most importantly the percentage of chronic care members enrolled in more than one program has grown 3x year-over-year to 24% in the most recent quarter, while more than 40% of telehealth members have access to multiple products compared to less than 10% in 2017.

Looking at profitability, net loss for Q3 more than doubled from the prior-year quarter to reach $84.3M. The lack of profitability is one of the most frequently raised concerns by investors and deserves a look under the surface. Net loss for Q3 was mainly driven by stock-based compensation (SBC), mostly in relation to the recent Livongo acquisition. Teladoc actually reported positive adjusted EBITDA when excluding SBC (which accounted for 85% of the quarter's net loss) and some other smaller items.

The impact from SBC on profitability is expected to decrease over the coming quarters, and when it does we expect Teladoc to make significant steps towards GAAP profitability.

Irrespective of this Teladoc is already showing its cash-generating potential as the company posted a positive operating cash flow of $111 million over the past 9 months, which increased the overall cash position to $823.8M.

Goss margins remained in line with previous quarters, but adjusted EBITDA margins showed a slight decrease in Q3 vs. prior quarters.

Teladoc also boosted its 2021 revenue outlook to between $2.015 to $2.025 billion, compared to \~$2.0B analyst consensus, indicating a \~85% YoY growth at the midpoint. The company also boosted its guidance for total visits to 14.5 to 14.7 Mio, implying 37% to 39% growth, up from the prior guidance of 13.5 to 14.0 Mio visits.

During its investor day management also provided a longer-term outlook for 2024 and expects to generate in excess of $4bn in revenue in FY 2024, implying between 25-30% compounded annual revenue growth throughout 2024.

In our view, the 2024 forecast is quite impressive as it means the company will at least double its current FY 21 revenues within 3 years, at scale, which is a strong sign of confidence by management.

*So What?*

Now, there are several concerns by investors that keep weighing on the stock despite strong continued growth. Most importantly, investors fear that Teladoc's growth rates cannot be sustained. This is a valid concern which is already visible in many of Teladoc's metrics, including:

Revenue growth, where the growth rate declined to 81% in Q3 from 109% in Q2 2021. And while the revenue outlook for FY 2021 indicates a robust 85% growth rate (vs. 98% YoY growth in 2020), it's probably the 2022 outlook that surprised investors where management provided a preliminary outlook of $2.6bn in FY22 revenue, implying only 28-29% growth vs. FY 2021.

The growth deceleration is also visible in the customer metrics as U.S. Paid Members came in at \~2% YoY growth, a deceleration from 41% growth for FY 2020, and 20% YoY growth in Q1 2021.

There are two additional concerns that weigh on the stock: one is the above-mentioned concern on profitability. On the surface, Teladoc's net loss during the past nine months increased roughly 4-fold compared to the first nine months of 2020 with current 9-month net loss of $(417.8) million compared to $(91.2) million for the first 9 months of 2020. However, as outlined above, most of this is driven by SBC in relation to the Livongo acquisition which should have a declining impact moving forward.

Lastly, there is competition, which is trying to eat away Teladoc's lunch. Competitors like Amwell (AMWL) continue to expand their services which could become a threat to Teladoc in the fight for market share. In addition, big players are also expanding their telehealth capabilities, e.g. insurer Cigna (NYSE:CI) through its acquisition of MDLive, or Amazon (AMZN) who is significantly expanding its Amazon Care ambition. It's important to highlight again that the market is still very fragmented but only a few have achieved to operate at significant scale, including Teladoc. And Teladoc continues to expand its service offerings, including its recently launched mental health service myStrength Complete, which integrates capabilities to deliver comprehensive virtual mental care delivery, which were shown to have the highest penetration rates at the moment (see McKinsey data above).

Teladoc is further expanding in the US but also internationally which is key to maintaining and build out its leadership position:

In Q3, Teladoc has signed new agreements with CVS Health and Centene to on Teladoc's Health's Primary360 platform.

Teladoc was selected as a vendor by Canada Health Infoway for its whole-person care services, which serve approximately 60% of Canada's population.

Announced a strategic partnership with Philips to deliver virtual healthcare solutions in Australia and New Zealand.

Signed an agreement with giant Latin American telecom company Telefonica, which expands the existing partnership to make Teladoc's services available to over 60 million people in Brazil.

Announced a collaboration with Microsoft (MSFT) to integrate Teladoc's solo platform for health systems into Microsoft Teams to streamline clinician workflows into a unified experience.

Not to forget, in midst of the pandemic Teladoc made a key strategic acquisition with Livongo, a leader in the virtual diabetes and chronic disease management space, which gave the company access to key technological properties that are now leveraged within other services, including the recently launched mental health service, myStrength Complete. The Livongo contribution is paying off nicely as member data points continued to increase significantly, showing over 100% YoY growth to 1.99 billion (cumulative).

All of this also contributed to the fact that Teladoc ranked highest among direct-to-consumer providers in the J.D. Power 2021 U.S. Telehealth Satisfaction Study nearly 30 points above the category average, outperforming all other providers. Teladoc is continuing to provide industry-leading quality of services while expanding geographically and from a product-offerings perspective which is key to maintaining its leadership position moving forward."

1. Fed policy: Currently the fed is tapering and has said that if inflation persist they may increase the speed they taper. If you look at history every single time the fed tapered the market corrects (20+%). The same can be said when they Fed announces they are increasing QE, the market reverses a downtrend and continues on a bull run. This has proven to be 100% accurate in the US. The market is forward looking and sees this coming, IMO the market has already topped. Of course the Fed could reverse there decision and decide to continue QE for longer, if this occurs I will cover my short.
2. Stocks under pressure: ARKK ETF and the vast majority of speculative stocks are down 50-70%, these are the first to be hit when we extend to the end of a bull run, and the stock market participants are looking for a safe, cash flowing companies to ride into the end, that is essentially a flight to safety in anticipation of tapering and an increase in the funds rate.
3. Fed announced Taper: On November 3rd the fed announced the taper, since then we've seen stocks get smashed on any miss earnings and just the way the market is reacting to news has drastically changed. Most recent example is the new C19 variant, any potential bad news the market is no longer just brushing off, participants are confused and see the market as being irrational for no reason, where in fact the real reason is because of the TAPER. We will continue to see large draw downs on any negative news.
4. Valuation: The FAANG stocks is holding up this market, as they are seen as the safest and best companies the world. This has pushed there valuations to ALL time highs. MSFT is trading at a 37 PE and 14 PS, not seen since the Dot Com bubble. Normal MSFT or AAPL trade at a PE of 12-18 and that was during the last decade where they had a massive run rate of growth ahead of them.
5. Shift to small cap from large cap?: I have thought about the possibility of a shift away from large cap, allowing them to correct while small cap coming back into favour, keep the market propped up,  however EVERY SINGLE time MSFT has corrected or crashed the market does the same. So unless this is the first time we ever see this happen, It just isn't probable.
6. Forward guidance: AAPLE is only expected to grow at 4% in 2022, and MSFT 15ish%. Demand has been pulled forward and we are going to see a reset in their valuations based on forward looking guidance, currently it is completely unsustainable and they have no way to grow into there valuations.
7. Economic outlook: Inflation is rising which will put pressure on companies margins if they don't have pricing power. On top of this I expect we see a much weaker consumer in 2022/2023. The cost of living is rising significantly in every aspect of people's lives, leaving them with less disposable income to spend on non essentials. Any correction in the stock market or housing market would further pressure consumer confidence making them think twice about going on that vacation or buying a new Macbook etc..
8. China: The Chinese economy is on the brink of collapse, the real estate giants such as Evergrande are barely meeting payments on interest. Evergrande has 300 billion in debt and is selling assets to meet interest obligations. Real estate sales are down 30% in October! The Chinese see the inevitable real estate crash as these giant companies fail, which will cause the economy to collapse and will have a ripple affect on the world. China is the #1 purchaser of commodities from countries around the world, as their economy slows they will purchase less ,which will put pressure on other countries GDP,  we have already seen a massive slow down in China doing just this!
9. Market is currently crashing: The Russel 2000 peaked a couple weeks ago on November 8th and is already down 10%. In nearly ever case small cap lead a crash (not including black swan events) and the S&P follow behind within a matter of weeks. Also; technical analysis on the FAANG stocks all show they were extremely over extended and have peaked, which would be very consistent with the Russell leading the crash and 2 weeks later (now) the FAANG beginning their crash.   Thank you for reading. Please poke holes in this thesis and invest at your own risk.  Don't fight the FED, adapt to their policy.

It is the summer of 2015, orange man is on the rise. I'm twenty years old, working in a hot stuffy Western Digital (HGST) lab. I spend my days putting hard drives and SSDs into servers, running tests on them, collecting data, updating the firmware & replacing the drives. This is the work for dummies like me who couldn't get internships at tech companies.

And now that we've established that I'm retarded (a slow learner), let's continue. I'm coming home every night and reading about investing. I read ""PROFITS GOOD"", ""DIVIDENDS GOOD"", ""TECH BAD,"" ""TECH NO MAKE PROFIT OR PAY DIVIDEND,"" ""TECH IS BUBBLE.""

Okay, simple enough, so I go around telling everyone , ""tech is bubble, amazon has NEVER made profit"". ""People should invest in companies that make profit and pay dividends so dividends can be reinvested.""

So with this stupid thinking, guess what I do??? I put 8K into Ford because it pays dividends and makes profit, unlike Tesla, which is ""total scam"".

REEEeeeeeEEEEEEeeeEEEEEE, FUCK FUCK FUCK.

Three years of my life past and this dog shit car company goes down 30%. But HEY, at least I got dividends the whole way down. Meanwhile FANGS killed it (Amazon up 250%...)

# What I failed to understand

We currently live in an era where access to capital (money) is dirt fucking cheap (i.e. low interest rates). If we look at a chart for the interest rates on corporate debt, we see that we've been in a secular decline since the 1980s. Hence, year after year, access to capital is getting cheaper and cheaper.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8sm2zhuwmn281.png?width=2356&format=png&auto=webp&s=22290983179194c6325db318f955dd39b5aafddf

So in an era of cheap capital, the big dick move is to reinvest all revenue back into the company and expand aggressively as possible. Company over spends one year? Who gives a fuck, we're growing revenues at 10, 20, 30% year over year. The interest rates on the debt is nothing compared to the revenue growth.

This is why growth stocks have absolutely crushed it since 2008. Old boomers will cry all day about the importance of ""profits"" but what they fail to realize is the times have changed. They grew up in an era where capital was becoming more and more scarce as interest rates marched higher and higher. When capital is scarce, profits and the accumulation of capital is everything.

""BUT WHAT ABOUT COMPANIES THAT MAKE FAT PROFITS, AND HAVE HIGH REVENUE GROWTH??""

Those make my pp extra hard (i.e. apple, google, microsoft). The important aspect to me however is they continue to have high revenue growth. I'd take revenue growth over profits any fucking day of the week.

In my opinion some of the greatest value investors of this decade will be investors that find companies where the market is greatly misunderstanding the companies future revenue growth. A recent example of this is Asana, where it was growing revenue at 80% per year, however the market cap was only 4 billion at IPO.

However, I'm still retarded so I don't listen to my own advice. Only bought $4,000 worth and no calls 🤦‍♂️

&#x200B;

I think Matterport is going to be huge in the coming months… and here's why:

&#x200B;

To reach as many people as possible, every e-commerce company wants to distribute their fulfillment network as much as possible. The downside of this distribution is that the engineering and construction teams must travel to get accurate site measurements (as-designed - NEVER - matches the as-built... or the building just doesn't have blueprints/CAD available). This type of situation makes Matterport an indispensable tool; reducing engineer travel and speeding up the whole design process. Matterport has a network of contractors with their 3D scanning equipment across the country, and can easily get an accurate 3D and 2D model of the site built. As more e-commerce startups happen, and formerly closed business spaces begin to re-open, Matterport will be the go-to for accurate space information.

&#x200B;

Facebook already has a contract with Matterport for AI research. As Meta continues to grow and tries to get ""digitized"" workplaces, I'm sure Matterport will be the company scanning every corporate facility for ingestion.  Apple, Google, Microsoft, and many others are also trying to compete with Meta in the digital workspace realm, and they will also need 3D scans of workplaces, so this will be ripe for opportunity. The possibilities here are limitless.

&#x200B;

I've been keeping an eye on the housing market, and I would estimate that around 30% of houses I'm seeing have an accompanying Matterport. As foreclosures start to happen and the technology continues to gain popularity, this will only drive more adoption."

BlackBerry is set to have a parabolic run over the next few weeks/months with many upcoming catalysts! Below is my analysis of why I think the stock is going higher.

Buying BlackBerry now is similar to buying $AMD at $2.00 in 2014 when SU BAE stepped in as CEO and took the stock to the moon! I believe this is a very similar opportunity right now! 🤫

**My fellow APES** 🐵 **just remember that DIAMONDS** 💎 **are made under PRESSURE** 🖐

Good Luck and let's hope that PAPA CHEN makes it rain TENDIES!  🐔 💦

\-------------------------

**Background - The turn around story of the SLEEPING GIANT**  💪

Under the leadership of CEO John Chen, BlackBerry has spent the past 8 years pivoting from hardware smartphones to the future: (1) IoT Internet of Things (2) Automotive/EV and (3) Cyber Security.

All three of these areas are growth opportunities and BlackBerry has strategically partnered with many large tech companies including: Amazon, Microsoft and Qualcomm.

The market value of **BlackBerry is CRIMINALLY UNDERVALUED** **at \~$6 Billion** compared to their competitors such as $CRWD at $53 Billion, $PANW at $54 Billion and $ZS at $48 Billion to name a few.

The transformation of the business can be summarized in the slide below. Mickensy Consulting has estimated that the pool of reoccurring revenue from the IoT and connected car will grow exponentially over the next 10 years, which is VERY GOOD for BlackBerry's new business model!

**Patent Sale/Settlement/Partnership Announcement**  💰

There is been lots of speculation and rumors over the past few month from various sources, ranging from Facebook $FB being the sole purchaser for cash up front and/or a partnership deal, to a group of parties. The range of the deal is said to be worth $1 Billion to $2 Billion.

On the last conference call, CEO John Chen said that there is about an ""80% probability that the deal closes by Q4"". This date is November 2021, which is next week. However, they could also be waiting to release it during their next earnings call on December 21st, 2021.

**QNX, IoT (Internet of Things), Amazon IVY and the connected car ecosystem**  👍

QNX real-time OS is installed in 195M cars today, out of 1.4B cars in total on the road worldwide. QNX enables many different software pieces to run in a car, so acts as a kind of central control unit. QNX is becoming the predominant OS for connected cars, since it´s installed in so many cars. Whilst today $BB licenses QNX to OEMs on a per-unit royalty basis, QNX is effectively set up (through Blackberry Ivy, in partnership with $AMZN) to be the foundation of the data value chain for the auto industry, which McKinsey estimates will be quite big, specially for a company ($BB) with a market cap of $6 Billion today. I think this will extend to other verticals over the next decade.

In addition to the North American and Japanese automakers, BlackBerry QNX also have partnerships with Chinese EV's such as $XPEV and $BIDU (who plans to make EV's in the future).

**CES 2022 BB will be demonstrating both cyber and IoT with key partners**  👏

BlackBerry has started testing their BETA version of IVY with Amazon this fall and are looking to showcase more features and capabilities with key partners at the CES in early 2022.

**On the last conference call, BlackBerry announced that they hired John Giamatteo from McAfee to lead BlackBerry's cyber security business unit**  👌

John's executive experience and connections should be BlackBerry generate sales in their current verticals and new market opportunities down the road, for both enterprise and consumer.

**BlackBerry continues to win Awards and is issued/granted new patents every month**  😎

Most recently, SE Labs  independently-owned and run testing company that assesses security products and services ranked BlackBerry as #1 in New Endpoint system security.

Quote: ”2021 has been the first year we have tested this product with BlackBerry publicly. When judging for our annual awards it is hard to ignore when a new, significant vendor enters our tests and performs so well from the start,"" said Simon Edwards, CEO SE Labs. Blackberry has demonstrated excellent performance in our 'real-world' testing, and the product is well regarded by both our expert panel of judges and users of the product. We would like to congratulate BlackBerry on achieving the award for best new endpoint.""

**Institutional Funds are loading up BIGLY**  👀 🔍

Over the past months, big institutions have been increasing their position. Today for example, Morgan Stanley's 13F filing showed that they alone increased their $BB holdings by +51%!

Do they have insider info about the patent sale and/or other news? Could a Price Target increase be coming soon now that they  have loaded up on shares?

**Technical Analysis**  📈  🚀 🍋

The weekly chart is a tight equilibrium pattern looking to break out on the bullish catalyst(s). Price target $30+ by early next year. Some UOA (Unusual Options Activity) also showed up today too.

So far:

* This analysis inspired legendary /u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT to [invest $5.7 million](https://www.reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/qfkjdf/my_erection_has_been_going_for_longer_than_72/) into the company (not sure if he pulled out or not).

TDOC just had an Analyst day this week. It seems like if they had huge customers to reveal they would've revealed it during this time. Are they saving it for later?

What I am trying to understand is the relationship between the brand names in the industry and the investor community for that industry in the market. For example, Apple, it has a strong following in the social media channels and usually positive sentiments on the social media channels about the stock results in a price increase. Today's chart - 

[Sentiment increase --\> Price Increase](https://preview.redd.it/p0vfs32wkg081.png?width=1002&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c6524b36b7ed90e313f4d50f3d38439e72c4bb4)

What you would notice in this chart is that at around 9 AM today the bullish sentiments for APPL started growing on the social channel and this was followed by a price increase a couple of hours later. I also noticed the news about them accelerating their autonomous car, so that contributed to the social chatter on these channels as well. I saw this trend usually in industries where there are established brand names, such as Automotive (TSLA, RIVN), Entertainment (AMC, GME) and Tech. Media (MSFT, FB etc.) 

But at the same time, industries such as Marijuana, Psychedelics etc. do not really follow this trend. As I try to understand why? one reason that I could think of is that these industries do not have a strong established incumbent and hence do not really have a strong social following. Which further leads me to think that these industries are just scratching the surface of their potential market cap. Another reason that comes to mind is the percentage of the shares that are held by institutions vs individuals. So, for companies and industries where we do not see a price movement following an uptick on social media, would it be safe to assume that most investors are institutions and not individuals. 

How do you all perceive the social media sentiments and their relation to the stock market for growing industry vs an establish industry? Sorry if the conclusions that I have drawn are very basic and not thorough, but I would appreciate a perspective or some direction to learn more."

Tables of stocks found below.  My diamond hands are so rough on my fleshy...forearms. I can't type anymore.

# Observations/Assumptions

Before  you jump down my throat, these are simplified observations/assumptions,  not internationally agreed upon mandates from heaven. Okay, now you can  jump down my throat.

* Companies  with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a  sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies  missing one or more of those attributes.
* For most people it is impossible to time the market
* Stock prices have all available information priced into them.
* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.
* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)
* [Index  fund returns, such as the S&P 500, are now predominately determined  by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)
* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).
* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 (yes, simplified)
* During times of volatility, companies that had poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.
* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.
* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:
   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp)  even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have had  losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing in  that same set of stocks in the same proportions.
   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don’t want to support.
   * Due  to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the  index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when Tesla  was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on 11/16/2020,  forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up the price,  which had already been driven up by people buying the stock knowing it  was then going to get added to the index forcing more people to buy the  stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular, that’s because it is.

# Hypothesis

Using  industry benchmarking against the best of the best of the best  companies in each industry in order to purchase only the best companies  in equal measure should provide a well-diversified portfolio that over  the long term should be able to beat the S&P 500.

# Experiment 2020

750  largest US stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry  (Industry details available further down the post). Stocks were given a  score based on their relative percentage compared to the industry index.  For example, each companies’ average ROE of the last 4 years was  compared to this index value with the following type of breakdown:

* ROE < Index ROE = Poor = 1
* ROE > Index ROE = Moderate = 2
* ROE > 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3

For  example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was  10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,  they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they would  receive a moderate rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would receive a  great rating.

This was done for all of the metrics below:

* ROE
* Revenue Growth %
* EBITDA %
* FCF %

The  relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there  was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth  only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be  decreased to 125% for a better distribution.

Any stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.

[ROE Example](https://preview.redd.it/t7l27u9tu6081.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f904309edb170cc8679189ea62f7bbe057646a3d)

ROE Example

That left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.

This  left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the  company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently  in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them  being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire? Has  WSB said it's a buy? Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason  that I want to exclude them?

That left 26 across 7 sectors.

[Industries 2020 Experiment Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/3gurx91wu6081.png?width=366&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e37aa1afdb655721fc83dff4e75867923e48cc1)

**2020 Industry Breakdown**

These  26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and  September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total  purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.

2020 Experiment Results July, August, and September 2020 purchases to 11/16/2021

* **S&P 500** total return reinvested dividends: **49.09%**
* **My 26 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **61.53%**

Can we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.

# Experiment 2021

2,850  tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.  The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:

* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company
* Profit Margin – shows how effective the business is at making money
* Operating Margin – shows how much money the company earns on its revenue
* FCF Margin – shows how efficient a company is with their cash
* EBITDA Margin – shows a companies’ operating profitability
* ROE – shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money
* ROA – shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits
* ROIC – shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns
* Debt/Equity Ratio – shows the financial stability of a company

More  metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to  determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to  median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of  the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:

·  3 stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over  the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry is  then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that benchmark.

Each  stock was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the  metrics and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite  score out of 27, from 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the  metrics. The scores are based on how much better they are then the  average. I measured them against the benchmark using the same  methodology as previously performed: Poor < 100%, Good < 150%,  Great > 150%. Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the  particular metric to find a useful distribution.

I  also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst TICKER THAT SHALL NOT BE NAMED (evidently a stock that cannot be named because I was banned the first time I posted this) with a score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9 categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn’t match the original  input (congratulations on your reading comprehension), this is primarily  due to mergers/acquisitions or the stock being taken private. Another  stock was acquired during the analysis, changing the max number yet  again.

Here is an example showing Aerospace & Defense scoring:

[Aerospace & Defense scoring](https://preview.redd.it/5r8i1qb0v6081.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=947be14d943204b8211c0933e9c1f1a41d4a1986)

Here is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the company’s most recent year):

[Growth Scoring](https://preview.redd.it/a2nq8c1av6081.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1f79a62b587bf6f1530f5beefda1b174b5d7d43)

Here is an example of the visualizations for the data:

[Data Visualization Example](https://preview.redd.it/5d41vcvdv6081.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=26567d730e1d668ccef856a18497fab38345577b)

I  applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at  the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock  that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a  high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.

Next,  I read the description of \~300 stocks and looked through their  financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off  their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly  leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that  Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns  Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them (how could you not?), no  there are not great synergies between the sectors of the business, yes,  they are aware of this. I also eliminated industries I wasn’t interested  in reviewing, such as REITS due to the need to look at different  metrics like FFO, Oil and Gas because it’s oil and gas, etc. These  activities eliminated \~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I’d  need to build a separate model.

I  then looked at each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made  the cut. Are all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are  the profit margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt  situation, did WSB say it's a buy, etc. Who deserves to be on this list?  This eliminated \~75.

We were down  to 84 stocks at this point. I then looked at each company's investor  presentation, annual report, etc. to better understand what the company  does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was not nearly as thorough on  this portion this year compared to last year just due to the substantial  increase in companies, 26 vs 84. My hourly wage at McDonald was going  to be better than my returns from the analysis if I took too long. I  only eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83  companies across 31 industries. Breakdown below:

[Industry Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/0bmcwyuiv6081.png?width=390&format=png&auto=webp&s=0df395664265ef942ff736c889108711216e76ed)

I then purchased all of these in equal proportion in April, May, and July of 2021.

2021 Experiment Results April, May, and July 2021 purchases to 11/16/2021:

* **S&P 500** total return including reinvested dividends: **11.93%**
* **My 2021 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **14.26%**

# Industry Classification

* For Experiment 2020, the Sector was used to determine how companies should be compared.
   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.
   * This  seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each other  that aren’t really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE below.
* For Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.
   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.
   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).
   * I  ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further. Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less than 10  stocks. I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical issues dealing  with averages/medians that were negative. There were also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they could be combined such  as biotech and pharmaceutical.

# Notes

I  partnered up for both the 2020 and 2021 experiments. This was critical  for both expanding my initial idea, brainstorming methods to build the  model, and reviewing the work done for errors. This was a team effort,  and I by no means deserve all the credit or hate.

All returns are showing reinvested dividends in the total return.

I've removed the positions and just show the summary but all in all, I'm down $83,5K YTD on options and up $440K on stocks (using margin have had an impact on my stocks).

GOEV Calls 6 months out, TEAMS Calls 3 months out and QQQ Puts 6 months out was my most retarded option play where I lost around $240K in total. GME weeklies, DOCN Leaps, MSFT leaps, and Hubspot leaps were my best play where I gained around $130K in total,

I'm also a retard for not checking this earlier. It's a slap in the face and I'm contemplating whether I should give it up completely and just go stocks in the future."

Before last earning and in few prior days to this I have seen $ZM pop op on my radar. Both times it came from no where with a thought ""Zoom is still a thing?"". So I did little DD on it. 

We all know that ZOOM is another virus baby and before that not a soul cared about their existence. For past months it have been down trading and being in the industry where meeting and calls are very common I am yet to see any large corporate use ZOOM. Teams have been a standard in engineering field where I work. Cut to the chase here is what statistics have to say. 

&#x200B;

1. According to ZOOM website traffic, it have picked up slightly after last yearnings, and now down trading again after a minor recovery. My bet it is due to College and High School students in some places still needing to use it and starting school in August. Now it is dropping again because of breaks and more in person schooling start being available across states. (My uni uses teams)

[Source 1 for ZOOM.us traffic. ](https://preview.redd.it/hnv4crt873z71.png?width=2227&format=png&auto=webp&s=20ea9b67258483eae02da73e83a94187d2c335f9)

   2. This can also be see from a second source. 

&#x200B;

[Source 2 for ZOOM.us traffic](https://preview.redd.it/1zr9bh0t73z71.png?width=1942&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2bb23641e62397baeb4ddd33cbf123f6097bf45)

   3. Another aspect I looked at was the trending rank of the app in the app store. In the USA it is on down trend the most, followed by UK. 

[ZOOM app rank](https://preview.redd.it/l6n21ks383z71.png?width=2120&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2bda9a23a457eb7dcb1fb8bc143b389dd06f515)

4. Google statistic showed over all down trend. This chart was based on search, words, and news. As we can see it is been going down hill ever since we started going back to normal.  

[Google trends on ZOOM](https://preview.redd.it/y9z8qwti83z71.png?width=1539&format=png&auto=webp&s=a20eb2d3d93ef1dac1d0ea5cdf21b0e4ca82c24b)

5. Their website have also had a down turn of organic searches ever since June. 

&#x200B;

[Zoom website organic searches ](https://preview.redd.it/wv5a1kt493z71.png?width=2137&format=png&auto=webp&s=564552cbdcaf3fa2080f90169779491b3ea3aa44)

&#x200B;

Zoom works with corporations and makes money of the contract with large corporate America. Many of those use Teams and have already opened their offices therefore people work in person. Their expectation of growing is just not there and Teams being a Microsoft product that will come with Office 365 subscription there is little for ZOOM to hold ground with. 

Base on data and the fact I am yet to see anyone use zoom, or even speak about it, I believe it will flow on next earnings and puts will print.

Position: $230 Puts that expire on 11/26 and $220 Puts expire on 12/03

Today, I decided to finally sell all of them, take my profit and equally YOLO it along with 4/5 of my savings. I randomly selected these three tech giants: Microsoft, Nvidia and Meta. One, because I know a lot about them and two, because I personally cannot see them significantly drop in value in the long term.

# [Stock futures inch higher after sell-off induced by hot inflation data](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures inched higher in early morning trading on Thursday following a tech-driven sell-off on Wall Street.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose about 40 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures added 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.7%.
*****
> Disney shares fell more than 5% in premarket trading after the media giant missed on the top and bottom lines of its quarterly results. Disney+ subscribers also came in short of estimates.
*****
> The major averages dipped on Wednesday after a hot inflation report pushed up bond yields. The rise in yields especially pressured growth pockets of the market.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 240 points. The S&P 500 fell 0.8%. The Nasdaq Composite was the relative underperformer, dipping 1.7% as Facebook-parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet all closed lower.
*****
> The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 dropped 1.6% on Wednesday.
*****
> Fresh economic data released Wednesday showed persistent inflation. The consumer price index, which tracks a basket of products ranging from gasoline and health care to groceries and rents, rose 6.2% in October from a year ago, hitting its highest level in three decades. On a monthly basis, the CPI increased 0.9% against the 0.6% estimate.
*****
> “Inflation remains stubbornly high, to the surprise of many that expected prices to come back to earth sooner,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial. “The truth is you can’t shut down a $20 trillion economy and not feel some bumps as it restarts, but we are hopeful the supply chain issues will resolve over the coming quarters and inflation should calm down as well.”
*****
> Following the CPI data, traders moved up their expectations for when the first Fed rate hike would occur. The Fed funds futures market now sees greater odds of the central bank’s first full rate hike coming in July 2022.

[Look at the shares float](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BBBY), its sitting at 100M. If you don't know what that means, consider it the free floating stocks available that are being held by people and can be traded at any moment. Meaning can be bought and sold anytime. Now, here's the important part: [A few days ago they announced an absolute fuckton of money to be spent on buying back their own stock.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-02/bed-bath-beyond-soars-on-share-buybacks-plans-for-marketplace) 400M worth.

With a market cap of 2.18B, that's  0.4/2.18 = 18% of their whole market cap. THAT IS INSANE. If your tits aren't already perked up from hearing this consider the sharp reduction in shares float. $400M tendies / $21.64 share price = 18.5M shares. Taking this off of shares float is, similarly, an 18% concentration of stock we'll see. If you're still confused I'ma need you to add another wrinkle right now in that peewee brain because what this means is that there will be less sellers and more buyers as more shares are kept with the big boi company itself.

Normally this doesn't mean much. AMD is doing a buyback program along with MSFT and several others. So what makes this different?

a) the sheer investment/market cap ratio. AMD for example is $4B investment/ 180B market cap = 2%. thats dogshit.

and more importantly

b) the fact that they want to complete this buyback program by the end of February. The short duration of it is the most critical aspect of this because that means this upward trajectory is going to be aggressive as fuck! And it means it can be calculated.

TLDR reasons to buy in:

1. an enormous amount of capital thrown at itself increasing market cap by 18%
2. a sharp concentration of stock since float will be reduced by 18%
3. execs are showing how big their balls are with their confidence in our face because they're strongly suggesting they think the company will keep growing.
4. bitch will moon by February

So whats the play? We're going with the May 20th, 2022 Calls at the $23 strike. I look forward to seeing your posts of thicc gains."

qq3ju0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qq3ju0/virgin_galactic_the_ultimate_growth_stock/,Virgin Galactic - The Ultimate Growth Stock,13,36,2021-11-09 21:21:32,"**Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) is the world’s first, and only, publicly-traded human spaceflight company.** It was founded by Sir Richard Branson as part of the Virgin Group conglomerate empire in 2004. So why is this stock so exciting? Here’s a brief overview.

# WHAT DO THEY DO?

Virgin Galactic operate in commercial **sub-orbital tourism and scientific research,** and have successfully done so on numerous occasions, most notably the inaugural flight with Sir Richard Branson in July 2021 - becoming **the first company in history to take a private citizen into space.** The company is currently in the late stages of its test flight program and expects to commence commercial operations in 2022Q4, largely due to pandemic-induced delays and test program precautions.

The company uses a **unique method of flight into space,** with a plane-like spacecraft being attached to the underside of a twin-fuselage mothership. This allows for a familiar and comfortable takeoff before the spaceship is released at 50,000ft, ignites its engine and ascends into a vertical climb at three times the speed of sound (2,500mph, Mach 3). At apogee the spacecraft then raises its booms in order to orientate and stabilise it for the descent, much like a shuttlecock, before simply gliding back to the runway. In the case of a flight abortion, the unique hybrid rocket motor is able to be shut down and the craft simply glides back in the same manner - making it an extremely safe launch system when compared to the parachutes and irreversible ignitions of every other company.

The customer will be given a **multi-day experience**, with astronaut training, preparatory flights onboard the mothership, accommodation, exclusive astronaut attire by Under Armour amongst other undisclosed activities being briefly outlined, in addition to **the company’s announcement of the development of an Astronaut Campus** during 2021Q2’s ER to accommodate tourists and their friends/families. Furthermore, in February 2021 **announced the recruitment of legendary Disney imagineer Joe Rohde to oversee this** as the strategic advisor, designing the customer experience and drawing upon over four decades of experience. This follows the **recruitment of ex-President and Managing Director of Disney Michael Colglazier as CEO,** to oversee the transition to commercial operations, replacing ex-CEO of ten years **George Whitesides (formerly NASA chief of staff) who will now oversee high-speed mobility and orbital spaceflight programs.**Other management and board members include figures from **Lockheed Martin, Warner Bros., DARPA, Boeing, Facebook, Twitter, Virgin, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Air France, and KLM.**

Following the trend of other space companies, the company does not hold direct patents on its technology but instead an exclusive license from Mojave Aerospace Ventures *(formed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and Burt Rutan of Scaled Composites),* the winners of the 2004 Ansari X Prize. Virgin Group and Scaled Composites subsequently formed The Spaceship Company with 70/30% respective ownership, and this became wholly owned by Virgin Group after Scaled’s acquisition by Northrop Grumman in 2012. TheSpaceshipCompany was absorbed into Virgin Galactic in 2020, making the company **vertically integrated in the design, manufacturing and use of its vehicles and propulsion systems.**

In its seventeen-year history, the company has received more than its fair share of criticism due to a number of setbacks. In 2014 the venture was faced with the crash of the first craft, VSS Enterprise, during its fourth powered test flight - resulting in the death of its co-pilot. **The company was wrongly criticised at the time** for distancing themselves from the incident by referring to the pilots as Scaled Composites employees, but the resultant investigation concluded that the cause of the crash was due to said co-pilot unlocking the craft’s aforementioned boom section prematurely, causing it to break up in mid-air during rocket burn while travelling beyond the speed of sound. Furthermore, the FAA concluded that Scaled Composites/Northrop Grumman did not create an adequate fail-safe system in addition to citations of inadequate design safeguards, poor training of inexperienced pilots and oversight failures by the FAA. As a result, VSS Unity was rolled out in early 2016 and featured the relative fail-safe enhancements, though accompanied by a significant delay to the test programme.

VSS Unity itself has faced some minor setbacks in the last couple of years, such as an ignition abortion in late 2020 due to electromagnetic interference in the on-board computer systems, which has since been resolved. This **additional demonstration of safety was well received by investors, and the stock proceeded to climb to all-time highs** following the incident in anticipation of the following flight. VSS Unity has since gone on to essentially complete the test flight programme, culminating in Sir Richard Branson’s notable flight to demonstrate the private astronaut experience, and will be in regular commercial service after the ongoing planned maintenance period. The company had intended for its first full-revenue flight with Italian Air Force specialists to take place in October 2021, but this was rescheduled in favour of maintenance aimed at significantly decreasing flight turnaround times from 8 weeks in order to meet demand while also ensuring the relevant components of  both the craft and the mothership remain well within the desired margins of safety. **The company have repeatedly stated that no detectable faults appear present on either VSS Unity or VMS Eve, and these improvements are simply diagnostic and precautionary; being geared towards longevity.** Despite being a full-revenue flight, the company is treating the Italian Air Force flight as part of the test programme and will consequently demonstrate the professional astronaut and private research experience publically. **While the flight has been moved from the beginning to the end of the maintenance cycle, the overall post-pandemic schedule is on track.**  
The company had also received significant and unjust criticism due to an FAA investigation into the inaugural flight due to a deviation in the flight path taking the ship out of its restricted airspace, totalling one and a half minutes during descent, which was safely corrected. There was also controversy from a news article in The New Yorker criticising the company's safety record after it was falsely reported that a warning light was ignored by the pilots. The same journalist also released a book, 'Test Gods' shortly prior to the article's publication, and both heavily rely on disgruntled ex-test pilot lead Mark Stucky - who was released for undisclosed reasons. **The resultant investigation subsequently increased the airspace afforded to the company, and the trajectory is deemed safe and viable flight profile.**

In March 2021 the **company also rolled out the successor to SpaceshipTwo, Spaceship III - VSS Imagine.** Commencement of manufacturing for at least one other SS3, VSS Inspire, has been disclosed *(with 85% of the components being fabricated),* and previous earnings calls outline a desire to **expand the fleet to five ships over the next three years.** However, the company has since released plans for a successor to Spaceship III, the Delta Class, alongside a new mothership; **providing increased cabin capacity and altitude.** This new design is aimed at **scalability and mass production in order to combat manufacturing and operational costs and timeframes** due to the current designs being largely hand fabricated, and they continue to seek further strategic partnerships to aid this transition. The company aims for a flight turnaround of one week for Delta Class ships, and is currently in the concept design phase - exploring tooling, supply chain and fabrication. To facilitate this, **the company is also investing in a new Design & Collaboration Centre as well as pursuing an undisclosed strategic partnership for the creation of next-generation motherships, in addition to exploring ship storage facilities in preparation for mass-production.**  
VSS Imagine is currently in ground testing with glide and powered testing to commence upon the fulfilment of the aforementioned maintenance period from mid-2022, before transitioning to commercial service in 2023Q1 for research payloads prior to pivoting to tourists in 2023Q2/3. The intent for VSS Inspire’s completion is to be confirmed, though the company has stated that the focus is on a timely transition to significant scale and resources may potentially be redirected.

There is perhaps **room for the adoption of satellite launches using the WhiteKnight aircraft,** as had been outlined in initial concepts for both Scaled Composites Tier programmes and Virgin’s original business plan, though ultimately operations were spun-off in 2017 to safeguard the company, and the new company, Virgin Orbit, is expected to IPO via reverse merger (NASDAQ:NGCA). Virgin Orbit instead utilise a modified Boeing 747 carrying the LauncherOne rocket rather than the White Knight airframe. While it is likely that Virgin Galactic will continue to focus on commercial human spaceflight, the door remains open.

In the long term, the company has outlined plans for **point-to-point hypersonic travel,**detailed further below.

# BACKERS AND CONSUMERS

Unsurprisingly, the largest backer of Virgin Galactic is Virgin Group. Other investors into the then private company include **Aabar Investments (the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi), whose investment secured regional rights to launch future Virgin flights from the UAE’s capital.** An significant indirect investment comes from **the government of New Mexico through the creation of Spaceport America**, of which Virgin Galactic is the anchor tenant, having also transferred 60% of their personnel there in 2019. In October 2019 the company went public via reverse merger through **ex-Facebook Senior Executive Chamath Palihapitiya’s Social Capital** and has since received strong institutional and retail backing.

As previously mentioned, the company seeks to form strategic partnerships and has done so with a number of companies. In late 2016 the company along with its parent announced its **collaboration with Boom Technology to aid in the design, manufacturing and testing of a new supersonic craft, ‘Overture’, a net-zero carbon emissions airframe** which would fly at around Mach 2 with vastly improved fuel economy, operating costs and aerodynamics than Concorde. Boom is currently entering the test phase of prototyping and both companies anticipate the craft to be **operational by 2029.**Virgin Galactic holds **purchase options on the first ten units, providing the first mover advantage,** and this precedes an order by United Airlines for 15 airframes and options for an additional 35 by some considerable timeframe. Overture is **expected to rollout in 2025**before test flights commence in 2026. Aviation analysts **Boyd Group International predict that if the production plane meets expectations the global demand will be at least 1,300 airframes** compared to just 14 Concordes which were ever in service. The precise structure of this agreement is unclear, but it presents an opportunity for a significant revenue boost from a portion of manufacturing sales and commercial use.

Further relating to Virgin Galactic’s hypersonic aspirations, **the company announced a memorandum of understanding in mid-2020 with Rolls Royce** relating to the creation of new propulsion methods for commercial aircraft, fostering relationships between the two companies. This accompanied the simultaneous announcement that **The Spaceship Company had completed its review of a hypersonic aircraft along with receiving FAA authorisation,** meaning both the company and the agency are currently designing an adequate testing/certification framework for the Mach 3+ aircraft.

Notable relationships include **Boeing, whose investment arm bought $20M of stock after the company went public**, reportedly to align and foster larger relationships between the companies in the future. **Under Armour also manufacture astronaut attire and the materials for the spaceship’s seating,** and the company also **collaborates with Land Rover on STEM programmes as well as providing vehicles for operational use.**The company has also fostered **relations with NASA for astronaut training and research payloads** as part of the Flight Opportunities programme.

The company targets high net worth individuals and aspires to expand into multiple spaceports around the world, each with unique customer experiences. **Present opportunities include the aforementioned deal with the United Arab Emirates, alongside the continuation of talks initiated in 2019 with the Italian government** and the opportunity for **potential future agreements at initial planned locations in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Japan.**

# FINANCIALS & VALUATION

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that **the commercial space sector will reach 5% of GDP by 2040, totalling around $1.5T**. Additionally, in 2018 Bain & Company show that **spending trends favour luxury experiences, outpacing the broader segment growth by 7% with a YOY compounding growth rate of 10%**. Using figures from the Credit Suisse Research Institute, Virgin Galactic estimated in 2019Q4 that they will initially serve 0.1% of individuals with a $10M+ net worth (a market of around 2.5M individuals compounding 6% YOY; a few thousand customers), making them an **elite luxury experience with significant room to expand - let alone repeat business.** The company has also demonstrated its **highly selective customer process** for funnelling its expressions of interest into its Future Astronaut cohort through the time-limited 'One Small Step' initiative, then again adopting paid-up members into its Spacefarer community. This ensures that demand remains strong and manageable, and the company expects tickets to be released in tranches of 1000.

The company has steadily held reservations from their spacefarer/future astronaut communities, **having confirmed at least 700 sales as of September 2021 with a view to close the first tranche of 1000 ticket sales by the holidays.** Currently tickets cost $450,000 *(up from an initial price of $250,000 pre-Branson flight),* and the company collects a $150K deposit, $25K of which is non-refundable. This is merely a fraction of the $28M Blue Origin recently charged for a single suborbital flight ticket, and they are presently the only competition - though a vastly different experience. Both SpaceshipTwo and Spaceship III have a capacity of six passengers, at an estimated launch cost of around $250,000 due to hybrid rocket motor replacement - **generating around $2.5M in profit per full-capacity flight.** After re-opening initial registrations for the second tranche of ticket sales, **the company received over 60,000 expressions of interest.**  
The company also functions in both **private and government research sectors**, with payloads costing $600,000 per seat-equivalent. **This would generate around $3.5M in profit per research-only flight.** Indeed, these margins are what initially drove Chamath Palihapitya to focus on the company and also invest an $100M in his own cash, citing that they were unheard of outside of the technology sector. The company aims to generate **$1B annually per spaceport** from roughly 400 spaceflights divided between around 10 ships.

The company is currently pre-commercial operations, and as such is virtually pre-revenue which makes traditional valuation methods problematic. However, the company has roughl**y $1B on hand in cash and equivalents in order to successfully transition to commercial operations and scale**, and also has yet to collect revenue from sales beyond deposits. This makes an accurate valuation particularly difficult from a revenue standpoint, but fundamentally the company is strong in its balance sheet and maintains a huge financial runway to transition into a global entity, while the outlook remains incredibly bright in its technology development, vertical integration, expansion plans and consumer demand.

In my opinion this stock has been wrongly beaten down over the last year, and given the scope of the company I believe it to be massively undervalued. It is is a first-mover with an entirely unique product and a proven brand identity in an industry they are creating essentially single-handedly, and therefore I believe that in the next decade and beyond the stock is poised to be the market’s biggest growth story. Furthermore, considering their assets alone in terms of cash/equivalents, IP, assets, personnel and outlook I believe bear-case this is $25-30 stock in the current market. **Current analyst average estimates place this stock at around $32, with $18 on the low side and $55 on the up for the near term. The stock currently trades at $19.**  
Once commercial operations begin, I believe that a reasonable multiple in current market conditions can place this stock comfortably into a new channel between $50-$75 within twelve months, and once the company can execute on its aspiration for operating a fully-fledged spaceport generating $1B annually this stock will be $300 by 2030 (a multiple of around 90), and possibly significantly higher depending on expansion into other locations, the development of hypersonic point-to-point flight operations, and the potential to license and leverage its IP into the broader aerospace sector. Also, given the scope of the ever unfolding commercial space industry I believe that beyond 2030 this stock could ascend essentially without limit as the company continues to grow and expand into new markets.

**So what do you think about NYSE:SPCE? It would be interesting to know your thoughts!**"

/1. INTC is the only real US chip manufacturer that can reasonably compete with Korean Samsung and Taiwanese TSMC (-100 credit score for acknowledging Taiwan). It is getting lots of literal boat load of cash(probs something like $50B equivalent) from the government that is positive for the shareholders, while maintaining the buybacks and dividends.
Yes, TSMC and others are also hedging and gonna start making some chips in USA but realistically the gubment will give most of the cash to INTC.

/2. US gubment is in a cold war with China, this means it's also a technological warfare. This means supercomputers, missile, Starlink chips(private company) etc and Intel is likely going to be one of the prime suppliers of this boom in tech investment.

/3. TSMC and Samsung are pretty much bottlenecked. Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Mediatech, Broadcom, various carmakers, electronics manufacturers etc and not to mention Intel themselves are a big buyer. Specifically, Intel and Apple has bought out all capacity of TSMC 3nm(equivalent to Intel's 5 nm probs, I forgot). This means there is an enormous demand that is not being fulfilled and Intel launching their foundry services and already signing deals with Qualcomm, Amazon is a big deal.

For reference, TSMC's market cap is bigger than 3 Intel (yes, that's a unit I invented). In 2024-2025, you might even see Apple, NVIDIA and the likes fabricating their chips from Intel just to give a big F U to TSMC (who is currently slightly overcharging if the rumours are to be believed).

/4. Intel is launching a GPU. The GPU market is also in a huge bottleneck due to higher demand from gamers and corn miners. Everyone expects that they are likely to sell their GPUs very easily. Think about this for a sec. Intel is just about to become one of the players in this huge GPU market.
Which would also make way for their server GPUs and AIs and the likes.

/5. Think 10-15 years from now. Your fridge, doorbell, light, heating system and every ducking thing will have some chips and Intel is likely to remain a dominant player in this market. I think this will be bigger than the current entire semi market as it is. IOT is just getting started.

/6. Intel is one of the forerunner player in AI techs like autonomous vehicles through their various investments(Mobil eye for one) and will likely remain so. I don't know how big this will be in 10 years, but it's likely that Intel will be one of the bigger players in the market like Google (through Waymo), Tesla and NVIDIA.

/7. Intel also recently launched their big little architecture, where it has already became competitively better than AMD especially in gaming with low power consumption and huge power. Not to mention being very power efficient most of the time for using its efficiency cores most of the time. Not that it matters that much, seeing the gamer Steam reports, very few people actually play on the latest of the latest gen. But, that's also something that's worth noting at least. 

However, the vast majority of pc sales is in just your average boomer laptops and desktops. And they have a good lead there.

*Tips for those wanting to build a high end new pc. Wait for Intel's lineup to be available broadly, high end pc gamers will dump their last gen AMD chips for the Intel one in the second hand market, causing a flooding of cheap AMD CPUs, buy one of them. Source: Did this once.*

/8. One worrying factor is in the server market. Everyone seems to be launching their own server chips and AMD is very competitive and eating away market share. But Intel's management seems to be guiding us towards the right path. If their predictions prove to be right, they are on the right track.

/9. Intel announced that they will launch Angstrom scale CPUs in the future, that's good I guess. They are also working in RISC-V and other CPU architectures.

/10. Pat has an approval rating of 96% in Glassdoor and the employees would recommend others to work in Intel 89% of the time. This is a huge ass jump for both scores from the Bob Swan era. Go to Wayback Machine, you will see. This means a noticeable change has taken place within this huge organisation in such a short time.

/11. Intel stock always seem to have price support at around $50. And it's near that range right now.

/12. Most analysts are bullish on the stock. Comparatively cheap stock in this clown market. Wanna buy a $5.48B gravity powered truck company anyone?

/13. Intel actually has one of the highest talented employee pull who can be expected to deliver. Contrary to popular belief.

**Bear Cases**

/1. This is a boomer stock according to reddit's circejerk. So, it's difficult to convince people that it is actually expected to grow around 11% CAGR just by the current demand circumstances alone by management's conservative estimates for the next few years. This is mega bearish. If the market doesn't care about a stock, no matter what the management do, the stock will not perform.

/2. Intel has repeatedly failed to prove that their foundry division's predictions are reliable. If they went fabless like AMD, it would have probably rocketed already. But a big part of the cheapness of the stock comes from the unreliability of their foundry division. Yes, the management has finally started getting serious about their foundry, but one cannot ignore their past failures.

/3. Government contracts and the likes are not completely free money like some of you believe, delays in delivery and contract fulfillment could make what is essentially a free money glitch to a costly mistake and a billion dollar loss with a brink of an eye. The terms are generally very strict, so Intel has to deliver.

/4. Investments are going to be a lot and semiconductor industry being cyclical means, if Intel fails to deliver, its market share will be eaten away and lose billions in potential profit.

/5. Stock seems to be largely rangebound like Microsoft was for 15 years.

For the last 2 weeks I have traded NVDA every trading day. Converting my small $800 investment into $22,000 within these said 2 weeks.

NVDA Price action always follows the same pattern from what I have noticed. We open high and its either push higher or come crashing back down only to recover later during power hour or the following day.

For the last 3 trading days NVDA has had some amazing price movements. Giving me the ability to turn 800 into 22 thousand. At one point reaching $42k but as a true autist I did not sell.

This stock has given us some amazing returns YOY. For tomorrow we can expect NVDA to break to new ATH (if it is able to break through 314). We can see a very bullish case of 314, 317, 320, 338. I am not saying this will happen tomorrow or the next day. All I am saying is if we break through tomorrow we can make some sweet tendies.

**TL:DR. Bandwidth is drastically undervalued compared to other tech on the market, when comparing the revenue growth. They are value the same as they were pre-pandemic, but have since acquired a company to go global, and revenues have grown about 100% since back then. short interest is 17%, it is low float and low volume. a turn around could blast this company to space, just like it did at the start of the pandemic, when it ran from high $70s to $196🚀 🚀🚀 🚀**

Alright you nerds, let's talk about a little known company called [Bandwidth Inc.](https://www.bandwidth.com/) ($BAND), and one of the most undervalued tech plays on the market.

**Who they are and what they do :**

Bandwidth is a CPaaS company, Communications Platform as a Service. They are a B2B company that provide APIs to enterprise customers, that allow them to integrate phone calls and text messaging into software and apps. Ever call into a Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or WebEx meeting on your phone? That is Bandwidth. Ever make a call through Google Voice? That is Bandwidth. Basically any apps or software that have native calling or texting built into will use Bandwidth or a competitor like Twilio.

**Some other examples of how the products and services work:**

* Service/Call center software, would use Bandwidth APIs to built the calling into the software, or if you are texting with a support center.
* 2 factor authentication texts
* making a call from you Amazon Alexa or Google Home
* Alert texts for things like Open Table, WaitMe, or Lyft
* Advanced Emergency/911 services, that allow for more accurate location mapping when people call from big office buildings. they can see what floor and where on the floor the call is coming from.

**Let's look at some bullish shit going on with them:**

&#x200B;

Some technical info:

Band is sitting at the lower bound of a multi-year trend, after having huge growth over the past year and a half, and expanding internationally. It is sitting at a fairly oversold level on the RSI, and right at a huge column support area. It stands to reason that we will see a bounce up from here, at least to the next supply zone in the $115-120, but could trend back up as high as the upper trend line in the $160-170 area. 🚀 🚀🚀 🚀

**Short interest is also sitting at 17%.** Not a huge amount, but with such low float and low volume, this bad boy can easily be blown sky high.

So why id BAND valued so low? My theories are that:

* They are somewhat miscategorized. The price clearly tracks with telecom infrastructure, which is somewhat justified, in that they have a nationwide network. But not justified, because they are being compared to cash dinosaurs, and not the high growth software they are providing.

* Because they are low float and low volume, when ETFs and such sell that sector, they get shoved around more that usual.
* I think there is a fundamental misunderstanding in the market of the company, what they do, and what the potential is. I believe this incorrect categorization will change over time, and the stock is being sold at bargain barrel prices until then.

**Positions**: Currently 1150 shares. Options could be played, but the volume is low, so spreads are a bit wide. Also, it is hard to say how long a it will take for the market to realize it is missing out. Selling puts is probably free money. OTM Leaps or debit spreads could work.

**Edit**. Forgot to mention that earnings are at the end of the day today. This could be where the big uppies get underway."

There has been a noticeable amount of INTC posts but non of these delve into their technical shortfalls compared to their competitors AMD NVDA TSM ARM etc

I wrote this many years ago https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/

and the gap in technology is even bigger in AMD's favor.  Since 2016 I've been super bullish on AMD at $1.80, cloud computing stocks MSFT AMZN, energy stocks like TSLA etc. 

If you've ever been in a datacenter it consumes a ton of energy and why I think the future of computing is AMD NVDA TSM ARM MSFT AMZN  and energy efficiency stocks.  

INTC lacks this and is falling way behind in tech and design, still far behind and I literally called it years ago almost on the dot.   

Other users have noticed this too

https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qkihov/intc_cluster_buy_by_510_directors_and_ceo/hiwxuit/

My post pointing out that since 2016 AMD NVDA TSM have been superior in design efficiency and stock price was promptly deleted on that sub.  I reminded them that since 2016 AMD price has increased close to 6800%, NVDA 3400%, TSM 500%, cloud computing has taken off and MSFT is up 600% AMZN 500%.

Intel is gone up maybe 30% in the biggest stock run and semiconductor/cloud computing run in 5-6 years.  Abysmal compared to every semi stock.

So be weary of INTC suggestions.  Not saying you can't make money it is up 30% in 5-6 years but there are way better investments and the opportunity costs of missing out better tech like AMD NVDA TSM MSFT AMZN etc."

Or, I will walk away with lower profits if Tesla crashes before any of the next steps shared below.

Here is my current short position: **Step 1:**  


https://preview.redd.it/i1z93h9xffw71.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47b828402fbf3b681459a963182519ea7729ae87

✅ **Step 1/Position Started:**   
Current Average: $1,070.14  
Current Cost Basis: -$200,117.03

✅ **Step 2**  
Short at: $1,200\~  
Amount: $200K\~   
Shares to buy: 166\~  
New Cost Basis: $400,117.03\~  
New Average: $1,131.20\~

✅ **Step 3:**  
Short at: $1,500\~  
Amount: $400K\~  
Shares to buy: 266\~  
New Cost Basis: $800,117.03\~  
New Average: $1,289.68\~

✅ **Step 4/Optional:**  
Short at: $1,700\~  
Amount: $200K\~  
Shares to buy: 117\~  
New Cost Basis: $1,000,117.03\~  
New Average: $1,354.91\~

I plan to cash out after a -30% drop, maybe ill aim for a 50% drop which means Tesla would be either at $949.44 for a -30%. Or, $677.45 for the -50%. This leaves Tesla with room to run from its current position of $1,100 a 23% gain to the final breakeven point or, 54% to the final optional step.   


**Worst Case:**   
Tesla runs up from my even price of $1,354.91 to $2,100 a $2.1 Trillion Market Cap. I'll take a half a million dollar loss which I can afford all day, any day. Won't kill me. (-50%).  


✍️**Note:**  
If Tesla doubles from its current price, it will be worth more than Apple and Microsoft by $1 Trillion Dollars.  I strongly believe the ROI for new buyers is dramatically decreasing. In other words, the Greater Fool is running low/near the end. There is too much risk, too many emotions, and greed flowing around. Be fearful when others are greedy. In this case, ill profit from their beyond delusional greed. Or, Tesla is currently at peak levels and I don't even get to the next steps. Still a win.

# [Dow futures edge higher a day after hitting another record](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/26/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock index futures nudged higher during early morning trading on Wednesday after the Dow and S&P closed at record highs as earnings season continues.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 33 points. S&P 500 futures were off flat while Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 20 points.
*****
> During regular trading Tuesday, the Dow advanced roughly 15 points to end the day at an all-time high. It was the 30-stock benchmark’s third straight day of gains and fifth positive session in the last six. Earlier in the session the Dow had jumped about 150 points to also hit a record intraday high.
*****
> The S&P gained 0.18% for its ninth positive session in the last ten, and also hit both a record intraday and closing high. It was the benchmark index’s 70th intraday high of 2021, and 57th record closing of the year.
*****
> The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.06% for its third positive session in four. Facebook weighed on the tech-heavy index, with shares of the social media company dipping 3.9%.
*****
> Microsoft and Alphabet were among the headline reports Tuesday after the market closed, with both topping revenue expectations. Microsoft shares rose 2.3% in premarket trading.
*****
> Texas Instruments shares tumbled 4% premarket after the company missed revenue estimates while Visa fell 2.5% despite beating on the top and bottom lines. Enphase Energy leaped 12.7% after reporting record revenue in face of supply chain headwinds.
*****
> Coca-Cola rose 2.6% premarket after the company posted a beat on the top and bottom lines and raised its outlook, saying the business was getting stronger particularly in areas where the Covid recovery has been the best.
*****
> “This earnings season has been about pricing momentum and whether consumers are able to handle surging costs,” noted Ed Moya, senior analyst at Oanda. “So far it seems the consumer can handle it,” he added.
*****
> So far roughly 30% of the S&P 500 has reported earnings. Of the names that have posted quarterly updates, 82% have topped earnings expectations, while 80% have exceeded revenue estimates. Strong results have been key to pushing the major averages to new highs.
*****
> “We see signs that there could be more gains to come in the final two months of the year,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial. “Seasonal tailwinds, improving market internals, and clear signs of a peak in the Delta variant all provide potential fuel for equities heading into year-end, and we maintain our overweight equities recommendation as a result.”
*****
> Robinhood shares were getting slammed, down 11% the day after the trading app reported revenue well below expectations primarily due to weakness in trading.
*****
> A busy earnings week continues on Wednesday with Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Bristol-Myers, Boeing, General Motors and Harley-Davidson among the names on deck before the market opens. Ford, eBay and Yum China will provide quarterly updates after the market closes.
*****
> On the economic front, U.S. durable goods order data will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET.

I wrote a scraper to hit URLs like [amazon.com/affirm](https://amazon.com/affirm) for thousands of companies in the NASDAQ. Over the last few weeks, I've noticed a handful of pages newly popping up on Teladoc's website:

[https://www.teladoc.com/google/](https://www.teladoc.com/google/)

[https://www.teladoc.com/apple/](https://www.teladoc.com/apple/)

[https://www.teladoc.com/microsoft/](https://www.teladoc.com/microsoft/)

You can see that none of these pages existed before on Wayback Machine: [https://web.archive.org/web/20210901000000\*/teladoc.com/google](https://web.archive.org/web/20210901000000*/teladoc.com/google)

I'm not sure what it means but it looks like they are actively growing their Expert Medical Opinion service, but nothing has been written about it online yet.

Next I made this post on Blind, an anonymous forum for employees at different companies to ask questions. It looks like none of the companies offer Teladoc to their employees yet (though Google offers LiveHealth): [https://www.teamblind.com/post/Do-Apple-Google-or-Microsoft-offer-telemedicine-as-a-benefit-zFHf0sdG](https://www.teamblind.com/post/Do-Apple-Google-or-Microsoft-offer-telemedicine-as-a-benefit-zFHf0sdG) so I'm imagining the partnerships are still underway.

They're reporting earnings on Oct. 27th. I could see these partnerships being announced either around then or in the following weeks if that's what's going on. In the meantime I've bought $TDOC 155c 1/21: [https://imgur.com/a/NaViyX5](https://imgur.com/a/NaViyX5)"

What's poppin' bull gang, hope you’re all doing well! Our free money glitch remained unpatched for another update, allowing many of us to pull clean double baggers across the board. God bless $SNAP. With all of big tech set to report this week, it could prove to be more lucrative than the last. We’ve got a large variety of trades we can make this week ranging from educated gambles, to good old fashioned theta plays. We’ve even have a couple of opportunities to sprinkle in some collateral plays if we wish! Let’s get into it!

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Jetblue is inefficiently priced.** Historically Jetblue moves roughly **4%** post earnings (inline with all the other American airlines),  yet this quarter, the options are pricing in a move of roughly **10%**. If we sell straddles or strangles, we can collect this extremely inflated premium with very little risk on our end. I looked into the entire sector as a whole since I planned on trading it last week, and I came across nothing that would’ve fundamentally caused this spike in volatility in airlines, or Jetblue specifically. The odds are awesome on this trade, and I plan or robbing some gamblers next week. For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)

&nbsp;

- **Twitter is inefficiently priced. Avoid it.** Historical move of **6.5%**, priced move of **11%** - on paper, this trade gives us insane edge, but I’m still not touching it, as we saw what happened with $SNAP on Thursday. Although Twitter dropped 5% as the market tried to price $AAPL’s privacy policy in, I don’t feel like taking on additional risk because the fundamentals have shifted right before its’ earnings. Normally I would take this trade 10/10 times simply from a pure numbers standpoint, but I’m not as confident anymore because of the added volatility created by $SNAP. 

&nbsp;

- **Oil stocks tend to experience Post Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD).** PEAD is the phenomenon where a stocks price will drift in the direction of an earnings surprise for several weeks following an earnings announcement. If a stock beats, it will continue to grind up for weeks following the ER report, and vice versa if it misses. This is especially true among oil stocks - check the charts if you don’t believe me. The best way to play oil this quarter would be to capitalize on this effect, and do **monthly** call or put debit spreads based on the results that come out Friday. To those curious, standard weekly options provide no edge at the time of writing, so it’s best not to gamble this time round.

&nbsp;

- **Collateral Plays are your friend!** If you’re bullish on big tech, look to long $QQQ this week to alter your risk exposure and bag some safer gains. If you’re bearish on oil, look to short $XLE instead of any of the individual companies for an added safety net. If you think $AMD is gonna knock it out of the park, look to play $NVDA or $SOXL instead. There’s lot’s of opportunities for collateral plays this week, and I’ve just barely scratched the surface. If you wish to learn more about collateral plays, refer to [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

&nbsp;

#Summary and Conclusion

We've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly!  If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you’d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**"
qf2z9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qf2z9b/intel_is_not_comparable_to_socalled_value_traps/,"Intel is not comparable to so-called ""value traps""",78,89,2021-10-25 06:37:20,"I believe that the climate surrounding the discussion of Intel stock has caused it to enter the realm of hyperbolic discounting.  One claim I hear over and over again is that it is a ""value trap"" such as AT&T or IBM.  Luckily, we retail investors have data and the internet to be able to fact check such claims.

To do this, I used data from gurufocus and macrotrends. I plotted two graphs, one representing the PE at the end of each year, the other was the ROIC-WACC.  I chose ROIC-WACC (%),  because ROIC is one of the most important determinations of whether a company is doing better than an average index.  The results were surprising.  First, there is no similar comparison to be made of AT&T vs Intel nor IBM.  AT&T has an average ROIC-WACC of 1.2, IBM 6.9, Intel 10.7, Apple 17.4, and Microsoft 18.4.  A company with an average ROIC-WACC of 1.2 is not a value play.

The average 10 year ROICs were AT&T 5.4, IBM 13, Intel 17.8, Apple 25.6, and Microsoft 26.1. Intel's ROIC is well above the S&P average of 7.2 and yet the average PE is 27.6 vs Intel at a PE of 11.  I chose Microsoft and Apple for a comparison, because these two stocks were also thought to be a dying stock in the past.  However, often times there is a difference between a narrative being told and the data. ROIC-WACC was strong for these companies, and naturally they have done quite well, despite the news surrounding their demise.  Note that Intel now has a PE less than IBM and AT&T now.  While future ROIC is difficult to predict, Intel still has a good running ROIC, and with current interest rates, now is the best time for more capital investment because it allows WACC to be kept lower.

This is big news because it shows the power of Blackberry QNX and QNX Hypervisor. The Real Time Operating System enables quick development of ADAS functions because it's already ASIL D Safety and Security Certified, something Linux/Msft/IoS/Android can't achieve. The QNX out of box comes with useful software features for car companies to use like camera feed, lidar feed, etc. The first Xpeng car with Auto-pilot is coming in first half 2023(launches in later 2022). 

Blackberry is already in 24/25 top EV cars. Analyst that work for Candian banks have tried to knock down the stock price for 8 years claiming it's going bankrupt or whatever. I believe they don't understand what the future is and how Blackberry plays a critical role in enabling it. Connected future and cities require high security and safety and that's what blackberry provides.

The Real Time Operating System enables quick development of ADAS functions because it's already ASIL D Safety and Security Certified, something Linux/Msft/IoS/Android can't achieve. The QNX out of box comes with useful software features for car companies to use like camera feed, lidar feed, etc. The first Xpeng car with Auto-pilot is coming in first half 2023(launches in later 2022). 

Blackberry is already in 24/25 top EV cars. Analyst that work for Candian banks have tried to knock down the stock price for 8 years claiming it's going bankrupt or whatever. I believe they don't understand what the future is and how Blackberry plays a critical role in enabling it. Connected future and cities require high security and safety and that's what blackberry provides.

>  
> As the central processing unit for the vehicle’s autonomous driving function, the IPU-03 meets the automotive industry’s most stringent requirements. On the software side, QNX OS for Safety is an AUTOSAR-compliant real-time operating system (RTOS) containing safety components running on the MCU. On the hardware front, backup redundancy design methodology has been adopted. The IPU-03 fulfills ISO 26262 Functional Safety ASIL Level D and forms the backbone for Xpeng’s intelligent driving system. In addition, the NVIDIA Xavier platform has a computing capacity of up to 30 trillion operations per second (TOPS), making it capable of processing massive data input from the vehicle’s various sensors, including radars, cameras, lidar and ultrasonic systems, in real time and running algorithms such as perception, positioning, planning, and control without delay.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 25th, 2021.

# **Big Tech earnings in the week ahead could test stocks’ recent rally - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/22/earnings-alphabet-apple-results-could-test-stocks-recent-rally.html)**
*****
> An earnings avalanche is coming in the week ahead that could put the stock market’s recent gains to the test.
*****
> Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon — the biggest of big cap tech — are among the 30% of the S&P 500 companies reporting. A third of the Dow also releases results, including Caterpillar, Coca-Cola, Merck, Boeing and McDonald’s.
*****
> “Next week is the real test,” RBC head of U.S. equity strategy Lori Calvasina said. “We’re getting a little bit in every sector.”
*****
> Of the companies that have already reported, nearly 84% beat estimates. Earnings are so far expected to be up 34.8% over last year, based on actual reports and estimates, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
*****
> “The tug-of-war in good versus bad earnings reports has landed in favor of the market with the S&P hitting an all-time high [Thursday]. That may run into difficulty next week,” National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said. “We may finally be seeing some cracks in the earnings season.”
*****
> The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average notched fresh records this week, and the indexes have solid gains for the week. The S&P 500 gained 1.6% to 4,544, while the Dow ended the week up 1.1% at 35,677, the first record close since Aug. 16. Some strategists view the return to those highs as a signal the market is on track for a year-end rally.
*****
> The Nasdaq Composite was also 1.3% higher for the week, but it was down 0.8% on Friday as tech stocks declined.
*****
> “I think we’re going to learn a lot from this reporting season,” Calvasina said. “So far, so good. Better than feared, with no change to underlying demand. Companies are still managing through for the most part. Investors are punishing companies that aren’t, but they’re not punishing the whole market. The market seems very rational right now.”
*****
> For instance, Intel shares were pummeled, falling more than 11.6% on Friday, after the company’s sales missed expectations. Intel warned an industry-wide component shortage hurt its PC chip business. But other semiconductor stocks did not get pulled down in the decline. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF was down about 0.8%.
*****
> But Snap sent an industry-wide warning Thursday when its quarterly revenues missed expectations. The company reported that Apple’s privacy changes introduced earlier this year affected its advertising business. The company also said that advertisers were holding back due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages.
*****
> Facebook’s earnings on Monday will be closely watched for any similar comments, as will reports from Alphabet and Twitter Tuesday. The three stocks fell Friday as Snap plunged 26.6%. Facebook lost more than 5%.
*****
> “Facebook has been the more broken name. It had the Instagram problem. It had the kid problem. It’s had a hard time going up post-earnings. It will be interesting to see if all these problems are priced in or does it go even lower,” T3Live.com chief strategic officer Scott Redler said.
*****
> Redler said the Snap news was a big surprise, since traders viewed social media as immune to supply chain problems. Even though social media was under pressure as a whole Friday, he said stocks have been able to diverge within sectors recently.
*****
> “Tesla was able to make a new high, and Netflix is at an all-time high. Every group has winners and losers, but overall the participation is better than it’s been in a while. Five stocks aren’t driving the S&P to the all-time highs,” he said. “It’s a bunch of stocks in every sector.”
*****
> Traders are now watching the Russell 2000, since a breakout in small caps would be a positive for the overall market, he said. Redler trades the the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) which closed slightly lower at $227.41 Friday. “If the IWM gets above the $230 to $234 area, it could be a signal for more risk on at the end of the year,” he said.
*****
> Redler said the market could be challenged in the coming week. “You just had a big 10-day move up. You would think there will be some digestion,” he said. “I don’t want to chase the market here. It feels like we could rest a little bit next week. If it could digest here, and we could get some individual stock movement, that would be healthier than the pain trade, which is straight up.”
*****
> There are a few important economic reports in the week ahead, including durable goods Wednesday; third-quarter GDP Thursday and personal consumption expenditures Friday. Friday’s data includes the PCE deflator, the preferred inflation gauge watched by the Federal Reserve.
*****
> # Higher interest rates
> The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield continued to edge higher in the past week, touching 1.70% before falling to 1.64% Friday. Market pros are watching to see if the yield will reach 1.74%, the closing high from March, and whether it will begin to worry stock investors. The 10-year yield hit this year’s intraday high of 1.776% on March 30.
*****
> “I would say over the next week or two, it’s possible we test it, but I would be a little surprised at this stage if it sustainably breaks through,” NatWest Markets’ John Briggs said. He noted that yields have been moving higher, as investors now anticipate the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates next year and as the market anticipates more inflation.
*****
> “I get a sense that people are more interested in buying here rather than selling,” he said. Bond yields move inversely to price. It could be a busy week in the market, as investors adjust for the end of the month
*****
> Briggs notes the front end, or the 2-year note yield, has moved faster than the longer end. He said that reflects the market’s increased expectation for rate hikes next year, with two hikes expected by the market in the second half of the year.

> # 9 Charts We Are Watching

> Here are a handful charts that caught our attention recently.

> Yesterday was the 34-year anniversary of the Crash of ’87. To this day market pundits still don’t quite agree on what caused the crash. As only Art Cashin can scribe, here were some of the worries at the time that lead to the more than 20% one-day crash on Black Monday: a historically overbought market (the S&P 500 Index was up more than 40% for the year in August); worries over a currency war with Germany; a historic storm in London that closed markets the Friday before the crash, concentrated selling on the New York Stock Exchange; First Lady Nancy Reagan possibly being admitted to the hospital with breast cancer; and even potential worries over engaging with Iran. At the end of the day, stocks up more than 40% for the year in August was likely much of the trigger, as that is a very stretched rubber band.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> The S&P 500 finally pulled back 5% a few weeks ago, after not doing so for nearly a year. But remember, the great majority of the stocks in the S&P 500 have already corrected at least 10%, with many down even more. This rolling correction has done a number on overall investor confidence though. According to the Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey, managers were the least bullish they’ve been since October 2020 and cash levels hit the highest level in 12 months. “It might be cliché to say, but many managers moved to cash on the 5% pullback, leaving plenty of cash on the sidelines to eventually push stocks higher again,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, historically the S&P 500 forms a major low near the end of October and has a nice rally to end most years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Blog-chart-3-10.20.21.png?ssl=1))**

> Building on the late October period, remember that the last few days of October and first few of November are historically one of the most bullish periods of the year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/blog-chart-4-10.20.21.png?ssl=1))**

> A post-election year tends to see stocks bottom a tad earlier in late September. So far, this year is following this template nicely.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**

> November is quietly one of the best months of the year. In fact, it is the best month since 1950 and over the past decade. The past 20 years it is the second best month and in post-election years it ranks second as well. “No matter how you slice it, November is known for turkeys, but maybe it should be known for bulls as well,” exclaimed Ryan Detrick.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-6.png?ssl=1))**

> The S&P 500 is less than half a percent away from its first new high since September 2. Remember, it has made a new high every single month so far this year. Should it make another new high in October it could remain on target to join 2014 as the only year to have a new high every single month.

> (Trivia stat – The S&P 500 peaked on September 2 in 2020 before a near 10% correction over the following weeks. This year it also peaked on September 2, but it is looking like 5% may be the most we’ll see to the downside this time.)

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.1.21-blog-chart-7.png?ssl=1))**

> Speaking of new all-time highs, the S&P 500 has made 54 so far this year, one of the most ever. The record of 78 appears to be safe, but with a late year rally this year could go down as the second most ever.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-7.png?ssl=1))**

> As we noted at the start of the month, stocks have historically done quite well in October during an odd numbered year—years without an election around the corner and no pre-election jitters. Well, 2021 is following suit once again, as the S&P 500 is already up nearly 5% for the month, which would be the best month of October for the index since 2015.

> # An Impressive 2021 So Far, But Flows Are Slowing

> Yesterday the Investment Company Institute updated weekly fund flow numbers for the US mutual fund and ETF industry. As shown in the chart below, total mutual fund flows were positive this year but compared to the performance of ETFs, the inflows have been only modest at best. ETFs have logged more than $700bn in inflows, and while mutual funds avoided a fourth straight net outflow, their $66bn in inflows wasn’t that impressive. Across mutual funds and ETFs, bonds have been the massive winner this year, with more than $500bn in inflows. Equity funds record outflows over time as a mechanical result of equity retirements, but this year inflows have been the largest since 2014 with more than $210bn in buying across mutual funds and ETFs. About a quarter of total equity fund inflows so far this year have been dedicated to funds buying the domestic stock market. That’s the best year for domestic equity fund flows since 2014, and breaks a string of five consecutive years of outflows, though net flows have been stable for months now.

> # Late October Is the To Time Buy Stocks

> As it is written in the 2021 Stock Trader’s Almanac on October 21 on page 97, late October is the time to buy depressed stocks, especially techs and small caps. In the chart here taken from page 112 of the 2021 Almanac we divide daily data for the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks by the Russell 1000 index of the largest stocks since July 1, 1979, and then compress into a one-year seasonal pattern from July to June. When the graph is descending large caps are outperforming small caps; when the graph is rising, small caps are moving up faster than large caps. This year has been rather typical.

> You will remember the November 2020 was a month for the record books for the Russell 2000. And then R2K topped out in March 2021 and has been lagging the big cap indexes since spring. Over the past couple of days the R2K appears to be perking up right on schedule. We just released a new small/mi-cap stock basket to subscribers in order to take advantage of the “Best Months” of the year (November through April/June) for stocks on the heels of our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal.

> # Road and Rail Soar Above Air Freight

> One major economic trend of the past several months has been supply chain constraints including logistics issues. Now in the throes of earnings season, earnings of companies related to supply chains and logistics (whether that be people or parcels) are beginning to roll in with four such names reporting in the past day alone: Kansas City Southern (KSU), United Airlines (UAL), Marten Transport (MRTN), and Knight-Swift Transportation (KNX). In the table below, we show all the S&P 1500 Transportation Industry stocks that have reported since late September. Most of these stocks have beaten estimates on the top and bottom line with a few exceptions. While it is the one furthest in the rearview now, FedEx (FDX) was perhaps the worst of these missing EPS estimates and lowering guidance. KNX, on the other hand, reported a triple play this morning; one of the first companies to do so thus far in earnings season.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102021-TRAN-Earn-1.png))**

> Two more transportation names, CSX (CSX) and Landstar System (LSTR), are also set to report earnings after the closing bell today, and over a dozen other names will follow up in the next week alone. These names could potentially be interesting areas to look for anecdotes regarding broader supply chain issues pressuring the economy, but turning to the stock price reactions, Saia (SAIA) has averaged the largest single-day gain on earnings averaging a 2.5% move across its 60 past earnings reports. Old Dominion (ODFL), Echo Global Logistics (ECHO), Hub Group (HUBG), and XPO Logistics (XPO) are the only others that have averaged greater than 1% gains in reaction to earnings. C.H. Robinson (CHRW) and Avis Budget (CAR), on the other hand, have historically averaged the worst reactions to earnings of this industry.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102021-TRAN-Earn.png))**

> While there are still plenty of companies within the industry left to report providing plenty of catalysts for moves, since the closing low on September 30th, the transports have seen solid performance with an 8.79% gain through today. That move has not only lifted the industry above its 50 and 200-DMAs but it has also broken the downtrend that has been in place since the spring. Currently, the group is still down 6.1% from its 52-week high.

> # 1-Year After 7-Month Winning Streak–S&P 500 Gains 6.37%

> Going back to 1950, S&P 500 has enjoyed 15 streaks of consecutive monthly gains lasting 7 or months. The most recent streak came to an end with September’s full-month decline. The longest consecutive monthly winning streak lasted 11 months and occurred twice, from September 1953 to July 1954 and from March 1958 to January 1959. S&P 500’s average gain during these monthly winning streaks has been a solid 25.86%. The smallest gain was 9.09% ending March 1993 while the largest was a whopping 53.53% ending in April 1983. When past streaks ended, S&P 500 performance following tended to be mixed and rather tepid compared to its performance during the winning streak. The month after the streak ends, 3-month, 6-month and 1-year after performance appears in the table above.

> # Sentiment Surge

> Over the past couple of weeks, the S&P 500 has reversed higher, and the index is now only a few basis points away from the September 2nd closing high. With the rally, sentiment has taken a sharp turn towards optimism. The AAII reading on bullish sentiment rose for a second week in a row, climbing 9 percentage points to 46.9%. That is the highest reading on bullish sentiment since the week of July 1.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-Bull.png))**

> While this week's increase was large, it comes on top of a double-digit rise last week. In total, bullish sentiment has climbed 21.4 percentage points in the past two weeks alone. That is the first time since November of last year that bullish sentiment has risen by at least 20 percentage points in two weeks. Going through the history of the survey, there have only been 17 other periods in which there were similar moves without another occurrence in at least six months. Overall, these instances have consistently seen the S&P 500 move higher in the following weeks and months with larger than normal average and median gains. That is except for one year out in which performance has been slightly worse than the norm.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-20-pp-1.png))**

> With the big jump in bullish sentiment recently, bearish sentiment has pulled back to 27.8%. That is the lowest reading since September 9th and the third week in a row in which bearish sentiment has moved lower.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-Bear.png))**

> With inverse moves to bullish and bearish sentiment, the bull-bear spread stayed in positive territory for the second week in a row as bulls outnumber bears by the widest margin since the first week of July.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

> Big gains to bulls also borrowed heavily from neutral sentiment as that reading fell from 30.3% to 25.4%. Similar to bearish sentiment, that is the lowest reading since early last month.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-Neutral.png))**

> As for some other readings on sentiment, the NAAIM Exposure index measuring investment managers' exposure to US equities has also made a significant move higher this week. Readings in this index range from -200 to 200 where (-)200 would indicate responding managers are leveraged long (short), (-)100 would be fully invested long (short), and a reading of zero would be market neutral. At the end of last month, the reading fell to a low of 55 which was the weakest level since May. While the past two weeks only saw modest improvements, this week there was a surge all the way up to 98. The 33.6 point increase ranks as the fifth-largest week over week moves on record in the index dating back to 2006.

I am drunk and the wife sent me to the couch tonight so why not dabble in some random dd and speculate earnings on AMD  with some hosers like myself.  I am gonna add my 2 cents on AMD. Please keep in mind that I again am not an expert and I have lost money in the best bull
market in history. I am degenerate who has been playing weekly’s on AMD so please let me know your thoughts. I am bullish on AMD. Since last week I gave it an 8% run up till earrings that was on the 12th opened at $104, and we have passed $113 already. Predictions are that AMD will run till earnings dip and then run again. My reasons are as follows. 
1.) TSLA earnings on 10/20, AMD chips are used in production of Model S and Model X, TSLA’s record number of sales in China  is a good indicator, musk tweets about AMD being good to work with on 09/21. I think Elon fucks. Sales of those two models are important as shit could that be another market share for AMD? 
2.) APPL cucked INTC today with their new chip. 
3.)Still waiting more info on the XILINX deal, 4.)TSM beat expectations
5.)INTC earnings on 10/21 expecting another move on AMD in anticipation of their earnings regardless of the results.
6.)Also need to consider the recent partnerships with Microsoft and Google.

Has it all been priced in? I am not sure we have ran over 8% since last week and had a major pop from the new graphics card. I am no expert and I don’t have enough time to dive into the rabbit hole of semi conductors. This is just speculation and not a reliable source of information but I feel like there are plenty more gains to be had."
qar6j5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qar6j5/hedging_against_a_market_crash_2008_all_over_again/,"Hedging against a Market Crash, 2008' all over again",500,362,2021-10-19 01:14:17,"Hey everyone,

I did put a lot of research into the current situation for quite some time and finally build a portfolio I am 100% behind long-term. However, the more I learned, the more sure I am that we will experience a market crash rather soon, than late.

I am not here to debate whether or not you think this is true, but the situation for this thought game is that we might see a crash similar in numbers, **not principle** like 2008' all over again. In general, during times of high inflation, most businesses will not come out well. The earnings will go up, but they need to put more money into their own business to even stay in the same place. A hedge for this are companies that can easily scale their business without needing money flow. I am looking at you Facebook, who can place 10% more ads, Adobe who can increase their product price without fear of losing customers, Apple, Microsoft...

The theory behind this discussion would assume that GameStop is a good hedge, I even heard that from the high ups in a very big, German bank, which is incredibly weird since they were against it months ago and did not even want to talk about it in the first place. This assumes that the crash is happening because of said theory I explained below in short. It does not mean that a high percentage of the entire portfolio should persist of them, but a chunk just in case might be a very good idea. The market is more complex than many think.

Another hedge and long term hold can not be mentioned in this sub, but you might guess what it is. Sadly, we cant debate this here. Has to do with weird blocks and tokens, latter of which might change the whole gaming industry and I am thankfully in the position where I can take constant profits from it in percentages that sound absolutely insane.

So, in case of this **theoretical** scenario, I would like to get everyone's opinion on this. I want to be clear, I value every single opinion and would love the most input possible. In case of no crash, my investments should grow steadily, but in case of a crash due to named circumstance, they would skyrocket. Again, this is purely theoretical, I do not want to discuss whether or not it is happening, but what you would do in case it will happen in the near future.

&#x200B;

**TLDR: How would you hedge against a potential market crash ala 2008' (similar in numbers, not principle) due to Evergrande + GameStop and the overall market situation?**

*I will add the theory behind GameStop again, even though most of you might know this already.*

*The theory: Most part of the stock is traded in Dark Pools and some shorting Hedge Funds are telling us that they closed their position, which is mathematically impossible. Do the research yourself. What I think is happening, is that all the shorts are actually synthetic and not real shares. There is tons and tons of proof of it, too much to even deny at this point. They exercise and sell deep ITM calls in order to get the FTDs. So basically, they are passing them from one to another, to another.*  
***The endless cycle:***  
*Person 1: Exercise deep ITM calls > Person 2: Sells deep ITM calls > Person 3: Sells shares > Person 4: met his FTD > Person 5: Exercise deep ITM calls  > Person 6: Sells deep ITM calls > …*

***Explanation for Golden Retriever:***  
*Think of it like this, a good analogy; You get a credit card with 10.000$ on it, max it out and have to repay the debt next month. However, you have endless credit cards, so you can get another credit card and ""pay"" the 10.000$ with that. The debt is still there, its just getting passed. You can do that forever. Now you need more money, so you do this all over again and keep digging the grave deeper and deeper. In this theory, multiple times the float and continuing. In order to stop that, you have to lock the float entirely, which is why everyone is currently directly registering their shares.* ***IF*** *this is true, I do not have to explain the potential outcome. There is simply too much proof.*

*Computershare confirmed this.*  
*Quote from their Twitter: ""Shares held directly on the books of US companies through a transfer agent are not held at DTCC. As such, shares are not available to be loaned for any means within the security markets. Computershare is a registered transfer agent, therefore does not lend shares in any capacity.""*

*Cheers, have a nice week everyone!*"

q88wss,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q88wss/upwk_the_gig_sector_is_booming_and_its_not_going/,$UPWK - The Gig Sector is booming and it's not going to change,32,26,2021-10-15 05:24:20,"In recent years there has been a paradigm shift in the workforce domain.

This was extremely accelerated during the COVID pandemic.

I’m talking about the freelance industry or the so called Gig sector.

A 2019 study by Mastercard estimated that the global gig economy generates $204 billion in gross volume. In the United States, it has been predicted that by 2027, the country may have more “giggers” than non-gig workers.

According to a 2020 report from Intuit, 25-30 percent of the U.S. workforce is uncertain, and more than 80 percent of large corporations plan to substantially increase their use of a flexible workforce in the coming years.

Furthermore, according to a survey published on Bloomberg, more than 1,000 hiring managers implies that 40.7 million Americans expect to be working remotely by 2026. That’s 4.5 million more than in a previous poll in the third quarter of 2020 -- and about 21 million above pre-pandemic levels!

Study from Wharton conducted during this ‘work from home’ huge experiment forced by the pandemic, showed that across the economy, productivity has actually remained stable during the pandemic, with productivity even increasing in many companies.

# People simply don’t want to return to work, the reasons are:

1. The federal government added $600 more per week to unemployment benefits already provided by the states. Even as states have worked to cut benefits, the wages received are still comparable to ones at a regular job.
2. Inflation rate is higher than the Wages growth rate – reduced motivation to return to work
3. People are worried about returning to a more rigid work schedule.
4. Some people have truly thrived with the newfound flexibility of working remotely.
5. People are worried that microaggressions at work will worsen your mental health.
6. People are simply still worried about getting exposed to COVID-19.

**For many, the pandemic has been a wake-up call that revealed how much we actually neglected our self-care before now. Now, many of us have gotten a taste of better balance and aren’t ready to give it up. We want our freedom – we want to be freelancers.**

# Currently there are two public traded Gig companies: Upwork (UPWK) and Fivver (FVRR).

Here are a comparison table between the two:

|**Company**|**market cap**|**P/S**|**EV/S**|**Revenue**|**Revenue Grow**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Upwork**|6.89|15.5|15.63|440.7|41.90%|
|**Fivver**|6.35|23.51|24.97|251.81|59.70%|

It’s true that Fivver is growing at faster rate than Upwork, but it just can’t justify the financial ratios difference between them. **Fivver, simply put, is much more expensive than Upwork**.

Don’t get me wrong, Fivver is a great company but it still mainly focuses on End user / small projects, while Upwork is primarily about mid/large scale projects, which is what this paradigm shift is all about.

**Upwork** has collaborations with major Fortune 500 companies including Microsoft, Samsung and Zoom, as more commercial giants turning to online freelancing platforms to find knowledge workers.

So what do you think? Upwork to the moon and beyond?"

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/14/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-thursday-oct-14.html)

*****

> # 1. Stock futures rise after S&P 500, Nasdaq broke 3-day losing streaks

> * Dow futures gained nearly 300 points Thursday as investors consider a flood of strong bank and health-care-related earnings as well as upcoming data on wholesale inflation and jobless claims. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to around 1.53%, one day after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting revealed a “gradual tapering process” of bond purchases could begin by mid-November. U.S. oil prices continued to power higher, jumping to more than $81 per barrel. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Wednesday broke three-session losing streaks. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for a fourth straight session.

*****

> # 2. Data on wholesale inflation, jobless claims out before the bell

> * The government is set to issue two key economics reports at 8:30 a.m. ET: the September producer price index and initial jobless claims. Economists expect first-time filings for unemployment benefits to drop to 318,000 for the week ended Oct. 9. Headline PPI and core PPI, which excludes the food and energy sectors, are expected to remain high, Thursday’s wholesale inflation comes after Wednesday’s elevated consumer inflation data. With price pressures mounting, the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment next year will be 5.9%, the biggest boost in about 40 years.

*****

> # 3. Banks, health-related companies see shares rise on strong results

> * The pace of earnings season accelerated Thursday, with slew of banks reporting quarterly results before the bell and their shares moving higher in premarket trading.
> * Bank of America was first up, saying third-quarter earnings and revenue beat estimates on strong advisory and asset management results.
> * Morgan Stanley beat estimates with quarterly earnings and revenue on record investment banking and asset management results.
> * Wells Fargo posted a jump in profit in the third quarter, boosted by a release of credit loss reserves. Revenue beat estimates.
> * Citigroup’s quarterly profit and revenue beat expectations on strong trading results.
> * Dow stocks UnitedHealth and Walgreens Boots Alliance also reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue. Those stocks jumped in the premarket.
> * Walgreens administered twice as many Covid vaccines as expected.
> * UnitedHealth raised its full-year outlook.

*****

> # 4. FDA vaccine panel gets ready to consider Moderna, J&J boosters

> * The FDA’s vaccine advisory group meets Thursday to consider a booster for Moderna’s two-shot Covid regimen. FDA scientists on Tuesday declined to take a stance it. The agency’s panel then meets Friday to consider a booster for Johnson & Johnson’s one-dose vaccine and mix-and-match vaccine data. A highly anticipated NIH study, released Wednesday, suggests J&J recipients are better off getting a booster from Pfizer or Moderna. Also on Wednesday, the FDA said data provided by J&J suggests recipients may benefit from an additional dose. A booster of Pfizer’s two-shot vaccine was approved for certain groups of people last month.

*****

> # 5. Foreclosures surge as Covid mortgage bailouts expire

> * Foreclosures are starting to jump as government and private sector programs designed to help homeowners deal with the economic fallout of the Covid pandemic have begun to expire. Mortgage lenders began the foreclosure process on 25,209 properties in the third quarter, a 32% increase from the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, it’s a 67% rise from the third quarter of 2020, according to Attom, a mortgage data firm. States with the largest number of new foreclosures were California, Texas, Florida, New York and Illinois.

q7qmwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q7qmwn/ionq_quantum_computers_are_already_here/,IONq & Quantum Computers are already here,188,83,2021-10-14 10:41:36,"IONq is the first of many world changing quantum computer companies. Rigetti uses traditional superconducting quantum arrays that translate a little easier to conventional computers. The huge downside is the need for extreme cooling. Rigetti uses multi layers where the innermost layer is 100x colder than outerspace. Xanadu uses photonic systems that are great, and run at room temp but they need lots of additional hardware to work and will be difficult to scale down. Microsoft is working on topological arrays which would provide utility benefits but it hasn't been proven yet and they had to retract one of their papers on it. The point is that there are various methods to how you can create and manipulate qubits, the foundation for quantum computing.

IONq uses trapped ions, from a single atom of ytterbium. Technically a rare metal but it's not rare. Then they manipulate the ions using lasers to create the qubits on the array. Sh*t is bleeding edge and I understand .005% of it but I read everything I can find. It can run at room temp and be easily scaled. Basically IONq doesn't need all the extra resources to create and manipulate their qubits, so the cost and energy requirements are down. This also allows for upscaling arrays on existing hardware. Like they can turn a 16 qubit system into a 64 qubit system eventually using the same stuff  they just have to reduce the expected errors that come with quantum computing.

IONq got starting investment money from Amazon, Alphabet, Bill Gates, Samsung, Lockheed Martin, Hyundai, goldman sachs and more. They used that money to prove the tech works and are currently operating with Amazon Braket as their most powerful hardware supplier. Currently IONq has the most powerful trapped ion quantum computer in business operation at 32 qubits. The next closest comp is 16 qubits. And you can have 9 qubit, 11 qubits computers, it doesn't need to be doubled evenly like ram for instance. The CEO, Peter Chapman attended MIT when he was only 16 and was the technical director for Amazon prime before he founded IONq.


Remember when you see qubit numbers in the future and from other companies, what that really means.

Quantum computing is based on ""physical qubits"" and ""digital"" simulated qubits. Conventional computers use bits.

No matter what method you use, ions, photonic, superconducting, etc, You can't have a fully isolated qubit because then you couldn't interact with it to manipulate and tell it what to do. To get around this, modern quantum computing is based on running ""leaking"" environments with varying fidelity and trackable errors. We use the say 93% that is still functional to simulate more isolated qubits, and use those to simulate even more isolated qubits, in deeper layers until we have a fully isolated qubit we can error correct. 

Eventually we need 1 million qubit machines to simulate 10k error corrected machines. IONq just demonstrated how they can scale up to a million at a recent presentation. Eventually a QPU could really lead to some radically advancements in financial predictions, cybersecurity and encryption, biotech discovery, simulation modeling and on and on.

They merged with $600m , $350m of which is pipe investment that is locked up for 6 months from now. Ran to $12 before merger, tanked to $10 at merger, tanked to $7.30 during spy correction and tech sell off. It was mostly shorts based on volume. They have tiny revenue because they are just getting started but that doesn't matter imo. They had that white house presentation to show off and IONq is the only pure quantum computer company on the market so far, with rigetti ipo'ing in a few months.

The pipe investment unlocks in 5 1/2 months and that could be the only negative event coming up. I'll decide what I do with my shares, closer to the date, either hold or sell then compound my gains to hold, maybe for life. It's bleeding edge tech and to try to simplify it more, instead of linear binary data, 1s and 0s. The data can be 1 and 0 at the same time in any ratio, in any direction. It's a bigger technological leap than people understand.

Thanks for your time!

AAPL - You’ll continue buying the same crap we put out, so why innovate?

ADBE - Let your creativity loose. Just pay us a subscription price to do so.

AMZN - We’re not satisfied with world domination. Space is next.

BRK.B - Because you’re too poor to afford BRK.A.

How does GameStop justify it's valuation of over $10B in market cap, while threats to it's core business accelerate? Console manufacturers are moving to digital delivery instead of physical games (38% of GME revenue). Meanwhile physical consoles, which make up over 49% of GME revenue, is only sold on 4 year cycles--and sold at all competing retailers.

Create a GME coin that consoles can mine, while powered on and connected to the internet. Users then spend GME Coins online to buy games, in-game items, and cosmetics--competing with Free to Play (F2P) market while supporting game publishers. GME sells the mining processing power to host games and CDNs, turning GME into a technology company.

**Context**

You are tasked with drafting the turnaround strategy for GameStop, an online and brick-and-mortar retail store specializing in console games and accessories. The chairman for the board, Ryan Cohen, began his turnaround of the business in 2020, aiming to make GameStop the “Amazon of Gaming”. Recent “Meme Stock” speculation of the company's stock has driven the price of shares from $15 to as high as $483 in less than a year. As of September 20, 2021 the stock now trades at $189 per share.

**Assumptions**

GameStop has full alignment with Microsoft (Xbox) and Sony (Playstation) to build the “next generation” of gaming. In the wake of the Epic vs. Apple lawsuit, Microsoft and Sony have determined that retailers such as GameStop are necessary and, for fear of antitrust regulations, have committed to a strong collaboration with GameStop. You have counterparts at both companies working to launch this new product offering. Ryan Cohen is interested in a serious turnaround strategy, to help justify the recent $10 Billion Dollar valuation by share price.

**Challenges to the GameStop business model**

During the Covid-19 pandemic, online retailers, digital game platforms, and online services grew the most due to the “stay at home” nature of pandemic restrictions. These companies saw increased revenue, online users, and engagement ([source](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stay-at-home-stocks-have-been-crushed-here-are-ones-that-could-still-win-long-term-51621036411)). GameStop’s second quarter earnings of $1.18 Billion dollars of sales, yet reported an operating loss of $.76 per share. GameStop revenue came from 49.7% Hardware and Accessories (Consoles, controllers, adapters, etc), 38.9% Software (used and new video games), and 11.4% Collectibles (figurines, magazines, etc).

https://preview.redd.it/gvp45w5h5eq71.png?width=994&format=png&auto=webp&s=80a189cc248d650230faa1e85252dd4d1892ac01

The major consoles that contributed to GameStops revenue were the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series One. In the recent Epic vs. Apple lawsuit, when asked how much margin Microsoft makes on the Xbox consoles, the head of Xbox business development stated, “We don’t; we sell the consoles at a loss”. This is because the console market is a “hardware subsidy model, where game companies sell the consoles at a loss to attract new customers. Profits are then generated from game sales and online service subscriptions ([source](https://www.news18.com/news/tech/microsoft-sells-xbox-consoles-for-a-loss-but-the-xbox-gaming-business-makes-money-3715331.html)).

Each major game console manufacturer creates new consoles every four years on average, which creates growth challenges to GameStop in interim years between releases. An additional challenge to GameStop’s future revenue is that each manufacturer operates online digital stores for instant purchasing of games, which is quicker to play than even Amazon can ship. It is estimated that around 50% of console and PC game sales are now being made through an online purchase. Adding insult to injury, both Microsoft and Playstation offer consoles without digital disc drives, requiring digital purchases to operate.

**Analysis**

GameStops customers are increasingly purchasing digital copies of games directly from Microsoft, Playstation, or Nintendo, instead of physical copies from brick and mortar stores. It’s estimated that 50% of sales are now digital, and growing.

1. GameStop could work with publishers directly to offer subscription models for new games, exclusive content, or digital expansions, fronting the development costs by capitalizing their market share.
2. GameStop could try to become the “Amazon of Gaming” by increasing their fulfillment and logistics chains to deliver physical copies of games and hardware quicker to customers, competing for market share of fixed price products.
3. GameStop could broaden their hardware offerings to include Gaming PC’s, laptops, and other hardware accessories, transitioning into more of a Best Buy ($29 Billion Valuation).
4. GameStop could utilize their 4,000+ Brick and Mortar stores to perform services such as computer repair, and specialty services.
5. Leverage GameStop’s brand halo to create experiential events focused around their favorite games with exclusive “drops” and releases.

SWOT Matrix (Figure 1) and Porters 5 Forces (Figure 2), show that there are increasing threats to the GameStop retailer business model, not only from traditional competitors (Best Buy, Walmart), but also from online retailers such as Amazon and direct-to-consumer marketplaces (Xbox, Playstation, Nintendo Stores). The PEST analysis (Figure 4) shows that marketplaces have a unique sensitivity in today's legal atmosphere that can be utilized to negotiate with Console Manufacturers. Marketing Mix (Figure 5) shows that GameStop does not have a unique marketing position or product offering to leverage. Amazon fuels it’s growth from nascent businesses by utilizing it’s profits from Cloud (AWS) while operating at scale to decrease costs while increasing selection. Amazon even created its own last mile delivery and transport hubs to reduce costs and compete with FedEx and UPS. It’s not feasible for GameStop to do so.

https://preview.redd.it/ao50evpe6eq71.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=578b562722fbbb7379be64c25ae2c2685bc8c457

In analyzing the current market, positioning of GameStop, and threats to the business, GameStop’s future is not certain. GameStop risks following in [RadioShack](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/081315/5-reasons-why-radioshack-went-out-business.asp) or Circuit City’s footsteps.

**Recommendation**

GameStop should continue to leverage its sales of Console hardware, accessories, physical games, and used games/trade-ins for the near term. Instead of redeveloping their supply, logistics, and fulfillment chains to maximize delivery speed, GameStop should leverage it’s existing relationships with manufacturers and game publishers to receive inventory of releases early, and ship with promised delivery with UPS/Fedex. This allows low cost shipping options to be utilized without expensive logistic routes. Fervent fans can still receive their games or consoles on Day 1, but without the upfront [CAPEX costs](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/24/walmart-launches-delivery-business-to-connect-other-local-retailers-with-consumers.html) to GameStop.

Ultimately, Judo Strategy (Figure 6) suggests GameStop must find ways to use their opponents' weight and strength against them, rather than emulating what their competitors are already doing well. Drastic steps need to be taken to compete against existing and future incumbents. To increase high-value engagements with GameStop that correlate to retention (eg “Stickiness”), GameStop should create a digital wallet that allows customers to collect “coins” that they can spend to purchase new games, cosmetics, or in-game purchases.

Utilizing GameStops close relationship with Microsoft and Sony, GameStop should create a console app that performs hosting functions (mining) while connected to the internet. Porters 5 forces (Figure 2) shows that these consoles have expensive GPUs that can perform significant processing functions for centralized servers. [Many server farms today](https://www.businessinsider.com/take-a-look-inside-an-underground-crypto-farm-busted-by-ukraine-police-2021-7) mine cryptocurrencies with consoles due to these strong GPUs.

https://preview.redd.it/h6vrukth6eq71.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf918fc5d54a68f15a009e9df526842e63b9032e

GameStop customers can then load this application and earn coins for every hour of hosting functions they perform for the collective platform. The hosting services could enable decentralized hosting of online video games and GameStops own e-commerce website. If a customer leaves the app on, performing hosting functions for the decentralized server for one hour, they would earn 1 credit. A new video game release may cost 1,000 credits, in-game cosmetics 500 credits. Credits could also be purchased directly from GameStop instead of mining. This would enable game publishers to create additional mirrors of their games online to prevent ever [increasing DDOS hacks](https://www.pcgamer.com/apex-legends-hacked-to-protest-titanfalls-server-situation/) which cost publishers millions while frustrating customers. This JUDO strategy allows GameStop to shift and compete in a whole new way, while the industry cuts out middlemen with Free-To-Play, digital downloads, and in-app purchases.

**Measuring Success**

Each customer's wallet would be tied to their GameStop account. This customer data would be aggregated to identify unique users. Aged GameStop accounts could be renewed and tied to new wallets. Mining/hosting, spending coins, purchasing coins, and browsing the coin marketplace would be high value engagements (HVEs). As the gaming industry shifts completely to digital games, which could occur as soon as four years from now, GameStop can leverage this hosting strategy to grow revenue directly for game publishers, while competing with “Free to Play” games. This enables game publishers to continue to create high budget games, without charging exorbitant prices to customers ([which data shows customers are resistant to pay](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/18/free-to-play-games-rule-the-entertainment-world-with-88-billion-in-revenue/)).

**Implementation**

You would work with the new Sr. Platform Manager of Xbox and Playstation (see assumptions section above), to select three pilot game publishers for this launch. They may include Epic Games (Apex Legends) and Activision (Call of Duty), among others.

The initial MVP would comprise the following headcount:

1. Two Engineers (Xbox and Playstation App Development)
2. Four Engineers (Mining/Hosting experts with Content Delivery Network Experience)
3. One Engineer (Ledger system to calculate payouts, spending, etc)
4. Three Engineers (Flex, QA)
5. Four Game Advocates (Work directly with the pilot Game publishers)
6. One Marketing Specialists (Work directly with PR for news release on launch day)
7. One Engineer (Coin Spending Storefront)

After MVP development, the idea could be iterated on to improve hosting utilization and even sell spare hosting to the general web hosting marketplace. This would include cloud content delivery networks similar to Cloud Flare ($38 Billion Valuation).

# Who is CrowdStrike?

CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity company that provides endpoint and workload protection solutions via its Falcon cloud-based platform. The firm is referred to as the ""Salesforce of Security"" by the CEO. Crowdstrike has benefited from the ‘work from home' trend, which has resulted in an increase in endpoint devices and burden on the cloud, making endpoint protection critical. It competes in a highly competitive market, but it has excelled by focusing on continual client acquisition and innovation. CrowdStrike has produced outstanding results and is well-positioned to develop in the market because of its great technology.

CrowdStrike is a bet on the rising need for cloud-based cybersecurity solutions. The company is a global leader in endpoint security solutions, with a growing market share. The capacity of the firm to enroll major clients, cross-sell solutions, develop new product offerings, and grow its worldwide penetration is critical to its success.

CrowdStrike was formed in 2011 by **George Kurtz, Dmitri Alperovitch, and Gregg Marston** with the goal of developing a cloud computing security solution. They proposed the idea to Warburg Pincus, a private equity firm, and received $25 million in investment. George is still the company's CEO, although Gregg resigned in 2015 and Dmitri departed in early 2020 to create a non-profit group.

**George Kurtz** is the company's founder, president, and CEO. He was Chief Technical Officer of McAfee before starting CrowdStrike. George previously established Foundstone, a security firm that was eventually bought by McAfee in 2004. He has previously held key positions in the cybersecurity area at Ernst & Young and PriceWaterhouseCooper. He graduated from Seton Hall University with a Science in Accounting. As of April 2020, George owned 22.4 percent of the firm.

In February 2020, **Michael Sentonas** was appointed Chief Technical officer of the business. He was formerly the company's Vice President of Technology Strategy. Prior to joining CrowdStrike, he served as McAfee's Chief Technology Officer – Security Connected and Chief Technology and Strategy Officer. He graduated from Edith Cowan University with a bachelor's degree in computer science (Australia).

Colin Black joined the business in 2015 and then became Chief Operating Officer in 2017. Prior to joining CrowdStrike, he was Chief investing officer of Kratos Defense and Security Solutions, Inc. and Cymer & Mindspeed Technologies, Inc. He graduated from the University of Glasgow with a Science in Electronics Engineering. As of April 2020, all executive officers and directors collectively owned 11% of the firm.

# CrowdStrike's Endpoint Security, IT Operations and Intelligence

https://preview.redd.it/pv8ukm37e5q71.png?width=2224&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c3569c88020b752483bdfe2a6a14bae7c881570

Falcon Prevent, Falcon Insights, Falcon Device Control, and Falcon Firewall Management are all modules in this category. These modules aid in the protection against malware and fileless assaults, as well as the real-time visibility and investigation of occurrences at client endpoints and devices. Customers may also use solutions to design, implement, and manage firewall rules and policies.

Falcon OverWatch, Falcon Discover, Falcon Complete, and Falcon Spotlight are modules that handle this section. They assist clients with detecting threats, identifying rogue apps and systems, detecting real-time vulnerability across many endpoints without scanning, and combining endpoint security with repair and response capabilities. In addition, the firm offers application licensing management, Amazon Web Services expenditure analysis, and asset inventory solutions.

Falcon X, Falcon Search Engine, and Falcon Sandbox are among the modules available in this market. These modules aid in the automation of threat analysis, the real-time search for malware, malware analysis, and threat research and reporting.

# How does CrowdStrike make money?

Customers are paid monthly fees based on the number of endpoints and cloud modules they utilize while utilizing CrowdStrike's Falcon platform. Customers are invoiced in advance on an annual or multi-year basis, and the agreements typically last one to three years. Subscription-based revenue accounts for over 92 percent of the company's revenue, providing great revenue predictability. Professional services, which include malware analysis, incident response, forensic, proactive, and other services, account for the remaining 8%. These are non-recurring and are billed on an hourly or fixed rate basis. The company's professional services segment assists it in cross-selling its subscription-based products.

CrowdStrike paid $96 million for Preempt Security in September 2020. Preempt is a Zero Trust and restricted access technology supplier that can identify and prevent attacks in real-time based on identification, behavior, and risk. This purchase would enhance the company's Zero Trust capabilities, which aid in identification and verification, enabling access to only authenticated users. Following the completion of the integration with Preempt, the firm intends to launch a new module on the Falcon platform. The United States accounts for 73% of the company's sales, Europe, Middle-East and Africa account for 14%, Asia Pacific accounts for 8%, and other areas account for the remaining 5%.

To identify and avoid potential dangers, the firm employs Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning. As more data is available to train AI, the value proposition of the products increases with increased adoption and user base. Over time, this results in a more efficient and effective platform. Furthermore, because of the platform's cloud-native architecture, security solutions may be installed fast on an endpoint in less than 30 seconds, offering prompt deployment and protection.

According to the company's presentation, CrowdStrike has a total addressable market of $26.9 billion, which is anticipated to increase at a CAGR of 9% to $31.9 billion by 2022. The business endpoint security industry is worth $8.1 billion. The firm has a market penetration rate of less than 3%, leaving plenty of potential for expansion. The launch of new cloud modules would increase the size of the addressable market.

# Current development of the Company

[WOW](https://preview.redd.it/idf5ink2b5q71.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2c76a6199907b7f0edb2effce33784e67157f8b)

CrowdStrike produced a significant topline performance as well as a bottom-line improvement in Q2 2021. It has benefited from the continuous work-from-home trend and COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates, which have resulted in increasing workloads on the cloud and a bigger number of endpoints in an enterprise, necessitating the need for enhanced endpoint security. In fact, the business established a program to assist customers in onboarding new remote employees without jeopardizing security.

Overall, it added 969 clients during the quarter, bringing the total number of consumers to 7,230, a 91 percent rise year on year. In Q2 2021, sales were $199 million, up 84 percent year on year, while subscription revenue increased by 89 percent. The subscription was $791M in Q2 2021, up 87 percent year on year. This significant growth was driven by increased client acquisition throughout the quarter, as well as the sale of additional endpoints and modules to existing customers. During the quarter, 33 percent of subscription income came from new clients, while 32 percent came from the sale of additional endpoints and modules to existing customers.

# CrowdStrike's Competitors

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h6ck865he5q71.png?width=1393&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9bcad8ee9eef4f09e36fa3ac61fb2e15afe92fe

CrowdStrike works in a cutthroat business with a fast-changing technical environment. It competes with VMware Carbon Black, Trend Micro, Fortinet, McAfee Endpoint Security, Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection, Avast Advanced Endpoint Protection, and other endpoint solution providers. It also competes with antivirus solution providers such as McAfee, Kaspersky, Microsoft, and others, as well as network security companies such as Palo Alto Networks and FireEye.

Despite this competitive market, the company's excellent cloud-based technology has consistently generated significant revenue growth and client acquisition. According to research, it was able to quadruple its market share in the corporate endpoint category, while the market share of the other top three competitors decreased between 2018 and 2019.

CrowdStrike was the first to identify and handle the growing security demands of the cloud age, thus it benefited from being an early entrant in the area. Furthermore, its AI-powered and machine learning-enabled solutions continue to improve in terms of threat identification and breach detection, making the solutions more effective over time. At the moment, it records 3 trillion endpoint-related events every week in real-time.

# CrowdStrike's Weaknesses

CrowdStrike's top-line growth is amazing, but the company is still unprofitable under GAAP. Its net loss increased in fiscal 2020, decreased in fiscal 2021, then almost tripled year over year to $142.4 million in the first half of 2022. This growing deficit may be ascribed to the firm's recent acquisition of Humio, a cloud-based data logging company, its high stock-based compensation expenditures (which devoured 20% of its sales in the first half of the year), and escalating R&D and marketing expenses.

CrowdStrike's reliance on stock incentives has increased the number of outstanding shares since its IPO, and continuous dilution may keep its values from dropping. On the plus side, CrowdStrike's non-GAAP earnings, which remove stock-based compensation and other one-time expenditures, continue to improve. It reached non-GAAP profitability in fiscal 2021 and aims to raise non-GAAP net income by 64 percent to 86 percent this year.

Magnet Forensics has been recognized as one of the fastest growing companies in Canada by Canadian Business’s Growth 500 List in 2016, 2017 and 2019. They completed their IPO on the Toronto stock exchange earlier this year and used some of the proceeds to acquire DME forensics, a leading video and multimedia evidence company.

Digital Forensics Analysis is one of the fastest growing fields of technology and Magnet forensics has partnered with several law enforcement agencies world wide.

Magnet Forensics is associated with many previous Research in Motion employees (The original Blackberry) [https://www.magnetforensics.com/our-team/](https://www.magnetforensics.com/our-team/)

Major factors that are augmenting the growth of the market include the rising incidences of cybercrime, the huge growth of WFH (Work From Home) and the extensive usage of IoT devices. 

Contributing factors for share price increase are a small float and a large percentage of institutional ownership. Pretty much any positive news or positive guidance will result in the share price rising. 

Here are some of the highlights from their most recent earnings. (Source Yahoo Finance)

* Revenue of $16.5 million, an increase of 42% compared to $11.6 million, primarily due to a $2.3 million increase in term license revenue and a $2.7 million increase in software maintenance and support revenue as a result of growth within the Company’s customer base, partially offset by a decrease in perpetual license revenue. The transition to a greater proportion of term license revenue compared to perpetual license revenue is part of the Company’s strategy to increase term license contracts. Total Recurring Revenue(1) was $13.3 million, representing 81% of total revenue.
* Annual Recurring Revenue(2) grew to $49.6 million, an increase of 48% compared to $33.5 million.
* **Gross Margin was 94%, compared to 95%, consistent with the prior period.**
* Net Income was $1.6 million, a decrease of $1.3 million compared to $2.9 million. The change is primarily due to the benefit of $1.5 million in assistance received under certain government programs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior period as well as an increase in general and administrative expenses related to the IPO in 2021, which were partially offset by increased gross profit.
* Adjusted EBITDA1 was $4.4 million, unchanged from the prior period.
* Cash of $108.8 million, compared to $21.2 million as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $87.6 million, as a result of the net proceeds from its initial public offering (""IPO"") during the quarter.
* The Company’s approach of consistent and rapid innovation supported multiple software releases during the quarter, including version 5.0 of its flagship Magnet AXIOM product for public safety continued, the launch of its Magnet Digital Investigation Suite and new releases of its Magnet AXIOM Cyber for private enterprises.
* The Company announced a collaboration with London’s Metropolitan Police and Microsoft Azure to transform how police agencies investigate crimes with relevant digital evidence from smartphones and computers with the adoption of Magnet REVIEW. Users will be able to leverage REVIEW’s analytical tools to identify and report on critical evidence in a timely manner. REVIEW allows investigators to collaborate with technical personnel in the digital forensic lab and other units remotely, in a secure fashion, while maintaining the forensic integrity of the evidence.
* The Company won new customers across each of its public safety and private enterprise markets, including Europe, Asia, and North America.
* The Company expanded its accounts with key public and private sector customers that drove increased revenue as customers expanded their adoption of the Company’s software solutions.

This opportunity is like buying $AMD sub $2 before SU BAE took the stock to $100!  😍

\--------------

**Earning Results: (Beat on top line + Beat on the bottom line + Raised Guidance)**

BlackBerry revenue of $175M beat consensus by $11M, with Cybersecurity beating by $3M, IoT beating by another $3M and Licensing beating by $5M.  Shares have been up 8-10% after hours.  I personally can't remember the last time BlackBerry had a revenue beat.

**Customer wins:**

1. Top 10 automotive OEM chose BlackBerry Protect & Optics, after going head-to-head against CrowdStrike
2. Fortune 100 financial firm chose BlackBerry Protect & Optics, displacing Microsoft Defender
3. Australian Gov chose BlackBerry Protect & Optics, displacing Trend Micro and Symantec Norton Life Lock

**Patent Sale Date:**

John Chen on the conference call said price has been decided and 80% chance the rest gets closed/announced before the end of this quarter (before year end)

What’s interesting is that he said he’s got other buyers lined up and that the current company (or companies) had exclusive negotiating rights

With billions being thrown around in this space, he’s going to get a VERY good price for his IP (Intellectual Property)/licensing

This is awesome!

**IVY + Amazon (IoT and the Connected Car):**

IVY Beta will be available October 2021 which is much sooner than expected and will have embedded battery efficiency and Payment platform Apps

**PAPA Chen delivering on QNX software in 24/25 of the leading OEM EV car companies (lol i'm assuming the last one is Telsa? partnership incoming?):**

So we will see if the mods even allow this.I thought to myself the other day about “apex” companies. These are the companies that are far and away the leading companies in their space.   


For example:  
Social Media:   
Facebook  
Online Shopping (and cloud..): Amazon  
Search: Google  
Smartphones: Apple  
EV cars: Tesla

You get the idea. But what I was moderately surprised at was the **lack of social media** **marketing** company. When a company is scheduling things to advertise on Instagram, responding to your whining on Twitter, or answering customer queries via Whatsapp, what are they using? **If you’re a top company, they’re using Sprinklr.**

Go look for yourself. What’s Amazon’s Twitter using? What’s Google’s Twitter using? What’s ESPN (Disney) using?  


Other examples of companies that use Sprinklr (as of Q2):  
Netflix  
Microsoft  
Twitter  
Amazon

Google  
The Marines (yep, it’s been government-certified)  
TSA  
Accenture

Deloitte  
McDonalds (tendies)

If you work at a big company, you’ll recognize there are a lot of disparate tools being used in a similar function. Social Media management is no different. At its simplest, Sprinklr allows companies to organize content across platforms, easily respond to customers through different channels, and analyze the outcomes. This is exceedingly valuable to companies in order to manage their social media (helping with marketing efficiency, customer service outcomes, social listening, etc.)

There are also much deeper integrations here as well, but we will start with that. Now, how much do you think a company would be worth, given that the majority of the Fortune 100 uses their services? What if I told you they had 74+ customers generating over $1M each on a yearly basis? What if I said they had about 1000 other customers, with average subscription revenue (yearly) of $350K each?

Well, whatever you had in your head - the current market cap of Sprinklr is roughly $4.3BN. By EoY, they’re expecting (their prediction from Q2 earnings) to generate \~$415M in revenue (22% growth YoY).

However, I believe it’s generally undervalued for a variety of reasons.

1. They are recognizing revenue from subscriptions (90% of their revenue) as it happens, not when the deals are signed. I believe their estimates to be really low. Consider that there are 74 customers with at least $1M in yearly subscription revenue, and they themselves have stated they have 1000 customers with an average yearly value of $350K (as of June 23).Well, if you just took the average value X 1000 customers, + $74M, you’re already at $424M revenue. And no doubt, there are more customers signed since June, and no doubt some of the 74 “big” customers are spending much more than $1M annually. They also have the opportunity to upsell their current customers. **TL;DR** they’re clearly going to be way ahead of their projected earnings and will continually revise earnings skyward.
2. This is a really sticky industry. The companies that put the amount of work to migrate to use Sprinklr aren’t going to change to a different provider easily (and frankly, a single competitor doesn’t really exist). Retention is likely to be extremely high.
3. Sprinklr is **really early**. The fact that they have the majority of the biggest companies on the planet signed bodes well for their future. They have now stated they’re targeting the next biggest 30000 companies, and their sales pipeline/staff has started to ramp up (paused all of last year). I would expect many more companies to be signed here; additionally, I expect additional products to be released that can be upsold to existing customers (live chat analysis, liter-research platforms - they just announced something like this called Modern Research Lite - etc.)

Anyway, I could say a lot more, but by this point I either have your interest or not. A few things to conclude with -

1. Look at companies in an adjacent space to them. Qualtrics (survey + experience management company) - $23BN. Zendesk (mainly customer support/comms) - $14.5BN. Liveperson (a stock that literally just does chat on a website) - $4.7BN. Take any comp you want - probably undervalued.
2. Sprinklr does have a competitor called **Sprout Social**. Sprout is awesome too, and much more targeted at small companies. I’m invested in Sprout as well; they’ve been on a rocketship recently ($7.3BN cap with $132M in yearly rev). However, I like Sprinklr over Sprout for a variety of reasons.. But the main one? **Trust what the top companies on Earth are using**. And I will take their judgment on this one. There’s probably room for both to succeed, but Sprout is much more narrow in my mind.
3. All wall street analyst PTs are above current price, with the lowest at $21 and the highest at $29.
4. There is basically **zero** ETF ownership of this, which is absurd as Sprout has **60** ETFS that contain it. I would be shocked if ETFs didn’t start picking this up, which will likely lead to a quick upswing in price because the amount of outstanding shares is quite low (high amount of institutional shares held, but can’t be sold).
   1. This has led to volatility recently (5-7% up and down days), but it doesn’t seem to be reflected in options pricing as IV is \~60-70%. Options not a bad idea.

TL;DR Sprinklr is undervalued. Massive opportunity. I think it could be the “Salesforce of Social Media Management”. Position = 2600 shares and 38 Feb 20 calls.

&#x200B;

From page 12 of BB transcript [here](https://www.blackberry.com/content/dam/bbcomv4/blackberry-com/en/company/investors/financial-reports/2022/q1y2022/BlackBerry-Limited-Q1-Fiscal-Year-2022-Results-conference-call-transcript-FINAL.pdf) read the bold text below. 

""

 John Chen Yeah, that’s a good question. So, our Spark platform is composed of UEM and UES. And UEM is very strategic to us because it is our gateway to a lot of our major customers who are completely relying on us on security. So, our strategy is to continue to expand our footprint in the regulated industry. And where the market is more price-sensitive in the non-regulated industries, we ***want to make sure that our UES platform, which is our endpoint security platform, connects to run on one of the largest install bases outside of regulated – i.e. Microsoft Intune. So, this is why we’re excited about having the Intune connector released by the end of August, I believe yes, at the end of August.***

$IRNT rose based on a few important things. The company itself, Super 8-K Redemption, Option Chain activity, CTB%, and Short Interest, as well as the traction it attracted.

**The company**: They're a Cyber Security Solutions enterprise. Their investment partners are Kleiner Perkins, CS Capital, and ForgePoint Capital. ([here](https://www.ironnet.com/company/about)) Their partners are Microsoft, AWS, CROWDSTRIKE, DomainTools, NUTANIX, Cortex XSoar, Paloalto, IBM Radar, Splunk, Splunk Soar, and SWIMLANE.

**Quick Summary for this quarter**:

* Solutions provider for cyber attacks, IronNet Cybersecurity (NYSE:IRNT)FQ2 revenue jumped 23% to $6.1M, subscription revenue grew to $5.8M vs. $5.3M last year.
* Annual Recurring Revenue (or ARR): $24.1M vs. $19.5M prior.
* Customer Count: 51 compared to 22 last year.
* Operating loss of $17M compared to $14.2M.
* Net loss: $17.2M compared to $14.3M.
* Cash and cash equivalents: $14.1M.
* **Outlook**: “Our cloud-based subscription revenue -- which grew to 60% of product revenue in the first half of the year, a 65% year-over-year growth rate -- is a strong proof point for the business and underscores the fully recurring aspect of our financial model. Our cloud focus coupled with the large deal formation that we are seeing reflects IronNet’s ease of deployment and increasing market recognition, which keeps us on pace to double ARR in the third quarter and meet our growth objectives for the full year.” said James Gerber, CFO.
* **FY Guidance**: Revenue of $43M-45M; ARR of $75M as of end of the fiscal year.
* The stock has a market cap of $1.64B and has seen a jump in price of \~19% over the last five trading days.
* Recent bullish rating on the stock by contributor who writes, 'IronNet Is Extremely Undervalued At $20'
* Previously (Sept. 14): IronNet misses on revenue
* Shares jump \~14% during pre-market hours.

**The Public Float**:

Regarding the [Super 8-K](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-263381/), this has reduced the float to anywhere between 1.3M to 6M. Additional, [8-K](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-272930/) before Super 8-K filing for those who like to read these.

It's looking like the float is realistically between 2.7M - 3.5M. Extremely low and the reason why it moves so easily. Looks like on Friday the shorts and MM won that battle. SI% actually increased on Friday and every Call Above $30.00 was OTM and was definitely mostly written by MM's.

Here's the **Option Chain** for October 15th:

[Option Activity for Oct. 15th](https://preview.redd.it/7vo75izu3jo71.png?width=884&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bcdbf55d6840ea2e839d1a5412046c0e83fa15f)

**Short Interest & CTB%**:

Short Interest was at 58% of the float before Friday, and the shorts have actually increased on Friday. Also, I can't access Ortex but I saw a video today of someone looking it up and saw the increase. Anyone with access to confirm on Monday would be great. Don't forget to use the shares amount shorted and divide by the current float.

The CTB% is above 500% this is from iborrowdesk. I know some will debate data etc, but even if you cut that in half thats still outrageous.

[IBorrowDesk](https://preview.redd.it/nl2z9cjx3jo71.png?width=518&format=png&auto=webp&s=c482c55c65282bd5a7d19c17e4b481c2a535e5e8)

When the weeks start and more data is published this will need to be monitored.

**Technicals**:

First off, the Fibonacci Retracement (5 day, 5 Min):

[Fibonacci Retracement \(5 Day, 5 Min\)](https://preview.redd.it/lohhsia40ko71.jpg?width=1834&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f530524a5595f76e317f2269c4389aa437a7d6d)

You can also see my entry position with the green arrow. If this picture is too blurry, the support/resistances are $19.24, $27.11, $33.29, $37.63, $41.97, $47.34, and $56.06.

Started the line with the lowest point before September 14th. These are levels to check throughout the week and especially Monday and Tuesday. We're looking to support at $33.39. If we can maintain support above $27.11 and support strong resistance that'll be positive, if we break $27.11, the next resistance line is $19.24. This is were things can get weary as this can be a sign of a negative trend. Good thing is this company seems rock solid, and is being evaluated at <$20.00. But keep this in mind.

Looking to see if a Cup and Handle will form:

[Cup and Handle Example](https://preview.redd.it/gbv44fw24jo71.png?width=834&format=png&auto=webp&s=823caf5853fd090c12099c1893b43b063a39ff2c)

MACD:

RSI:

[RSI: \(Close,5\) - $45.32, Oversold @ below $30.00, Overbought above $70.15, per RSI, 5 Day.](https://preview.redd.it/v5i8gug74jo71.png?width=1883&format=png&auto=webp&s=d97db747278fb821a8b671afe84cea202e05894e)

This is also a stock that is trending heavily, so, technicals can't be completely relied on. Only next week will determine that.

**Google Trends**:

&#x200B;

[7 Day Trend, Friday is still highly trending, the flat line is beacause of the weekend.](https://preview.redd.it/ad2upoca4jo71.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfa2a677644ee0e7d378f8a4af5bcc01aad9cb79)

&#x200B;

[30 Day Trend](https://preview.redd.it/dcjxb0cc4jo71.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=d00ba95bfb1c9aa6e79a0eb1c3c33bea0a41a9d0)

With this stock closing at $30, if we test support we can very much expect bullish sentiments. If over the next few days support isn't being tested, then supports become resistance.

This stock is highly shorted, has a very large ITM Option Activity, very small float, and a high CTB%.

I think there's a lot that can come out of this stock, but also if the interest isn't there then probably not. Thing about this stock though is retail owns and can own the float until any PIPE lock ups expire.

That's something else that will be important to follow are the SEC filings for the lock ups.

Overall, this seems to be a solid company with a lot of growth up ahead.

""Its annual recurring revenue also noted a year-over-year growth in the recent quarter to **$24.1 million**. For the full financial year, IronNet now forecasts $75 million of ARR on up to $45 million in revenue."" As of 3 days ago.

I'm not a professional trader what's so ever, I ordered Wendy's for supper. I have no idea where this could go, it really depends on a variety of factors but it's worth watching going into next week and October.

For anyone such as myself who likes Palantir, Snowflake and other data/AI companies, C3.ai is in a great position to be bought right now.

The company is [led by Thomas Siebel](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quickerbettertech/2020/11/19/on-crm-tom-siebel-is-back-and-hes-working-with-microsoft/?sh=5859683d341f), and while he is kind of older and approaching retirement age, you cannot overlook him. He is the man who invented CRM’s, which are the software such as Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics that drive most major corporations.

What he is doing with this company is creating usable AI for companies, which he likes to repeatedly call “turnkey solutions”. Essentially this means AI programs that simpleton operators in big companies can use without any serious coding or programming.

Basically, C3.ai is doing what Palantir does, but their focus is making plug and play programs, instead of relying heavily on forward deployed engineers.

Of course, what really matters here is are these empty promises and big dreams, or does the software actually work?

Well the contracts and partnerships they have developed would certainly suggest that their software friggen works.

They aren’t doing this work alone, they are partnered with many serious players:

# 

# CRM’s:

To make AI tools that are usable with CRM’s such as Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics, they have officially partnered with **Microsoft and Adobe**. Microsoft went a step further and purchased some shares during the IPO last summer.

Note, through their partnership with Microsoft, they are not competing with Salesforce, they are working with Salesforce.

And this software is not in development, it just became available.

*Partnership source:* [*https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/26/c3-ai-microsoft-and-adobe-combine-forces-to-re-invent-crm-with-ai/*](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/26/c3-ai-microsoft-and-adobe-combine-forces-to-re-invent-crm-with-ai/)*Launch source:* [*https://c3.ai/c3-ai-announces-general-availability-of-c3-ai-crm/*](https://c3.ai/c3-ai-announces-general-availability-of-c3-ai-crm/)

# 

# Energy:

To make AI tools that are usable in oil and gas, they partnered with **Baker Hughes**, and that software has been adopted by other oil and gas companies such as **Shell** and MEG. And obviously it works, because after their initial trial, Shell went ahead and renewed their commitment with them for 5 years.

*5 year renewal source:* [*https://ir.c3.ai/news/news-details/2021/C3-AI-and-Shell-Extend-Strategic-Collaboration-to-Reshape-Global-Energy-and-Resource-Industries-with-Enterprise-AI/default.aspx*](https://ir.c3.ai/news/news-details/2021/C3-AI-and-Shell-Extend-Strategic-Collaboration-to-Reshape-Global-Energy-and-Resource-Industries-with-Enterprise-AI/default.aspx)

# 

# National Defense:

To make national defense tools, they are working with both the **US Air Force**, and the **Missile Defense Agency**, to create AI tools used for diagnostics on aircraft, and ballistics for a missile defense system.

Note, the Missile Defense Agency has the ambitious goal of creating an advanced system that would protect USA from airborne missile attacks. Basically, they are trying to create an iron dome comparable to what Israel is using to defend itself from Palestinian terrorists.

*MDA source:* [*https://c3.ai/c3-ai-to-enable-ambitious-sustainability-and-energy-efficiency-goals-with-aluminium-beverage-packaging-category-leader/*](https://c3.ai/c3-ai-to-enable-ambitious-sustainability-and-energy-efficiency-goals-with-aluminium-beverage-packaging-category-leader/)

&#x200B;

# Autonomous Packaging:

Now today, they just announced that they have expanded into technology that will obviously be useful in ALL retail. They just signed a deal to help develop autonomous packaging with one of the largest aluminum packaging companies in the world, **Ball Corporation, who does $12B** in annual revenue at 60 international locations.

*Ball Corporation source:* [*https://c3.ai/c3-ai-to-enable-ambitious-sustainability-and-energy-efficiency-goals-with-aluminium-beverage-packaging-category-leader/*](https://c3.ai/c3-ai-to-enable-ambitious-sustainability-and-energy-efficiency-goals-with-aluminium-beverage-packaging-category-leader/)

&#x200B;

# Cloud Computing:

C3.ai’s products are now being carried by both **Google Cloud and Snowflake**. Both of those companies are offering C3.ai’s products to their customers to work with their platforms, and both of those companies have an incentive to help sell the product. Google Cloud’s CEO has done a TV interview with C3, stating that they intend to use Google Clouds 2000 person sales team to get people using C3 on google servers.

*Google source:* [*https://c3.ai/google-cloud-and-c3-ai-create-industry-first-alliance-to-accelerate-enterprise-ai/*](https://c3.ai/google-cloud-and-c3-ai-create-industry-first-alliance-to-accelerate-enterprise-ai/)

*Snowflake source:* [*https://c3.ai/c3-ai-and-snowflake-partner-to-deliver-next-generation-enterprise-ai-applications-at-scale/*](https://c3.ai/c3-ai-and-snowflake-partner-to-deliver-next-generation-enterprise-ai-applications-at-scale/)

&#x200B;

So the question is this if these companies and organizations see value in C3’s software, why the hell is it valued so much lower than Palantir and Snowflake:

* Microsoft
* Google
* Adobe
* Shell
* Baker Hughes
* US Air Force
* Missile Defense Agency

&#x200B;

**Some key fundamental facts:**

* The stock is down 75% from it’s meme mania highs, and looks like it has technically bottomed out.
* They have $1B of cash on hand, with like a $37M burn rate. They have LOTS of runway.
* They are actually “structurally profitable” meaning they have a large margin on their cost of goods sold, but their loss is directly attributable to the money being spent on marketing and sales, which the CEO rightly defends as a smart investment.
* YOY revenue is up 29% in the last quarter.
* They operate in the large customer space like Palantir, and their enterprise AI customers grew 85% to 98 in the last quarter. With the recent announcements, they are likely over 100 now.

# TLDR: If you like Palantir, you should probably be interested in C3.ai as well."

2. AI Enabled CRM, if you look at the market cap of UiPath Inc at 29B then C3 AI is going to grab market share from this company. 

3. Tom Siebel yesterday discussed his huge commission based sales team:

12,000 people selling for me at Baker Hughes into oil and gas. At FIS, I have thousands of people selling with me into the financial services and banking market. I sell with Microsoft across a wide range of markets. Now most significantly, is the announcement that we made not too many weeks ago with Google Cloud. 

4. C3AI INC: This is soon going to be a buyout target as they gain more market share of the industry. 

5. Industry growth is 35%+ per year. Oil for example is 1.7%. According to Facts and Factors market research report, the Global Artificial Intelligence Market size & share revenue is expected to grow from USD 29.86 Billion in 2020 to reach USD 299.64 Billion by 2026, at 35.6% annual CAGR growth during forecast period of 2021-2026

6. Average target price is 55% above todays current price. The average for stocks on the market right now is 15-20% for the year with $AI having a high price target of $122 and a low $45 which give 15-1 risk vs reward. 10% risk to 150% reward. I like them odds, In for $2500 shares on this one."

**Part 1. Technically Anal**

So this past week saw a considerable breakout of the $9 resistance wall and a concomitant FOMOing into the ticker with FD's destined to Lambo or Burn. Well those FDs are either now ash or in a giant gasoline-soaked pyre, but let's have a look at the charts to see if any of the poor bastards holding 9/17 $17 calls can be saved.

First, a general look at the important lines:

[So many lines, so much value](https://preview.redd.it/cnrsj3ehy2n71.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=c95d5beb400d7024a6196736106457fd6c843879)

The most important level on here is the one I've labeled ""Launch #1"", though at this point the ""#1"" is looking smidgen unnecessary. First established on the gap-down on Oct. 6 of last year, it provided resistance on three occasions afterward (yellow arrows for the simpletons), with the last ending in a massive breakout to all-time highs.

The $9.08 line is the second most important line on the chart, in my possibly chromosome-deficient opinion. First established on Mar. 15 of this year after the bounce from all-time lows, it provided some level of resistance immediately afterward, but in the post *squeeze-that-wasn't-a-squeeze* world of the past few months it has become the ultimate resistance, a titanic, 700-foot wall of ice and sorrow towering over the pitiable bag holders huddling beneath its monstrously cold heights. Before this week, there were three prior attempts so surmount the Wall, all ending failure.

Of next and most immediate importance is the $8 mark. I have it as $7.94 as there is a small case for its origin story beginning on Mar. 25 of this year. However, like the $9 mark, its true importance has been found recently, and ***cannot be overstated***: This line, however pitiful, represents a **higher low** and thus holding that line is of critical importance for the prospects of any near-term upward action.

The orange downtrend line was the last of the downtrend lines, and crossing it resulted in the most recent attempt at the Wall of $9.

The green line is **the bottom**, a place of green pastures and buxom women, where the burdens of your bags will vanish away . . . because you've passed from this world and its worries.

&#x200B;

Next is a chart looking at the $11.13 mark:

[Fibonacci, because Italian people](https://preview.redd.it/86tdxc76z2n71.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=05b1f1e37ef85a53788c7100bddb17f9d64889a2)

As shown, the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of $11.13 is shaping up to be a very important line. Indeed, it is soon to over shadow the $11.80 breakout line in that regard. On the dump following the June push, the ticker found support at $11.16 on Jun. 21, and subsequently it opened and dumped down from that level on a Jul. 6 (yellow arrows for simpletons). And just this week we saw the ticker reach up to **exactly** $11.13, before getting summarily thrown back off the top of the Wall. At this point, I think a breakout of $11.13 probably results in a significant push up. But we're getting well ahead of ourselves with that.

&#x200B;

Being a TA wunderkind, I've turned my head to just the right angle and found a sliver of hope for the hopeless Men of the Watch:

[Two girls & a cup: can't possibly fail](https://preview.redd.it/ary603egz2n71.png?width=1842&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4e5b5f27b60656be73760dee5251e0e1d79e6b8)

The good news is it looks like a cup & handle formation. The bad news is that *usually* a cup & handle is a pause in an uptrend. Here, however, you have a downtrend into the cup (the giant pink arrow for the simpletons). This is a great example of Cbass's First Law of TA: You can always find a chart & indicator combination to tell you what you want to hear. So, let's just call this a positive, because we have little else.

&#x200B;

Looking at 1hr chart, let's see if we can find some more copium:

[I see Higher Lows from my house!](https://preview.redd.it/dyaiz8hnz2n71.png?width=1842&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f6ec421727eeedc62a68c18d33c86a25cd03e9d)

After the post earnings dump, CLOV briefly had a breakdown below the $8 support before rallying back up to test the $9 Wall, repeatedly. In that time, it found itself in a new channel between $8.40 and $8.60, thus establishing $8.40 as a **new, higher low**. This, as much as the Great YOLO Brigade of Labor Day Weekend, was the cause of the breakout on Tuesday. Basically, the chart was screaming that a breakout was incoming, YOLO brigade be damned.

The copium for next week is whether or not another higher low can be put in at $8.60. Like any good Man of the Bag Watch I have to hope it can, because if I try to leave, my portfolio gets hunted down and beheaded.

The worse and therefore more likely scenario is a breakdown all the way back to $8, undoing several weeks worth of upward progress. The absolute worst case is a *true* failure of $8 and a return to all-time lows. This would be a dagger in the heart, and unless someone knows a Red Woman, we're fucked.

[Winning, winning so fuckin' hard right now](https://preview.redd.it/8zf0arxvz2n71.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55ff09023716e9894e0f4fd672ec56fa1d4808de)

**Part 2. Dynamically-expanding Dildos** (^(for maximum gapping))

In true Clovtard fashion, my knowledge of this company prior to purchasing shares was ""it does some techy stuff with healthcare."" Which, it turns out, is basically all you need to know. This company is one of those that seems complex and super high-tech, but in reality is more basic bitch than your average Instagram thot. That being said, it might still work out for them... after all, do you see some of these basic bitches that blow up on Instagram? Living proof that ***literally anything*** is possible.

But just in case someone cares (and to keep the Clovtards from reeing in the comments), here's a look at the company underlying the CLOV:

&#x200B;

\----------------------------

***Business Model***

* **TL;DR: they sell insurance to old people & process payment claims from doctors**

Clover sell two products:

1. Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, which are just insurance plans for people on Medicare that include extra services along with the Medicare stuff, and
2. Direct Contracting (DC) plans, which are one of several alternative payment models recently put forth by CMS (the people that run Medicare)

The important difference between these is that Medicare Advantage is an insurance plan where the ***patient*** is Clover's customer and Direct Contracting is where the ***doctor*** is Clover's customer. With the latter, Clover is acting as, essentially, a *payment processor* for the doctor's Medicare patients. This allows Clover to get a sweet slice of that government largess. On the doctors' side of it, they deal with Clover instead of CMS. Supposedly the whole scheme (and this is one of five put forth by CMS in 2020) is supposed to save the government money (>!it won't!<). I don't give a fuck about that part; all I care about here is whether Clover can grow their slice of the pie.

This Direct Contracting scheme was a ***major selling point*** for Chamath when they went public (more on that below), and for good reason. Clover only needs to manage a single relationship (with the doctor) to grab up dozens, or potentially hundreds, of patients. This DC scheme should be (*on paper at least)* far more efficient than Clover's original business model, which was just managing MA plans.

&#x200B;

\----------------------------

***Growth***

* **TL;DR: they can** ***potentially*** \~**25x their customer base** (^(but probably much, much less))

So other than **""the squeeze""**, why would anyone ***genuinely*** believe this company is going to have some astronomical valuation that would give them a stock price on par with the likes of United Healthcare? Simple: growth.

Right now Clover only services MA and DC contracts in a small number of counties: 108 in 8 states. They are expected to nearly double with an additional 101 counties by the end of the year, bringing the total to 209 in 9 states. Since there are 3,000 some odd counties in the United States, there is (*on paper*) a lot of room to expand here. **This is good**.

As of their latest earnings report, they had 128,591 ""lives under management."" (I think that is a creepy as fuck way of putting it, but I *guess* it's industry standard....) Of those, 66,566 were MA customers and the remaining 62,025 were *indirect* patients, i.e., the Medicare patients of doctors in a DC agreement with Clover. The total of \~129,000 was a year-over-year increase of 126.3%. **This is also good**.

&#x200B;

* **Math time!**

In their best counties, Clover has upward of 25% market share (at least this is their *claim*); that is, they have a quarter of the MA patients signed up with them. But to assume they can do that everywhere would be absurd. To keep this ultra simple, let's just assume that their current percentage as of the last earnings report is representative of what they can do. So that is 128,591 ""lives"" across 108 counties which comes to an **average of 1,190 ""lives"" per county**.  (Obviously, not all counties are the same size, but let's just use this average for simplicity's sake.) So we have:

**1,190 x 3000 = 3.57 million ""lives""**

**3,570,000 / 128,591 = 27.8**

So, ***theoretically***, Clover could achieve **27.8x growth** in customers, and ***presumably*** a similar growth in revenue. (We'll get to profitability, or lack there of, below.) Looking deeper at this number, one thing going for it is that the number of old people is steadily increasing. But on the other hand, competition is a thing, and big thing in this space. To assume that Clover is going to have 3.5 million customers in 10 years, or even 20, is pretty wild.....

Chamath claimed Clover was the ""easiest ten bagger"" he'd ever seen (or some shit like that). So, even going with that number, they would end up with 1.3 million ""lives"" in ten years. Even this seems pretty high to me. They went from 0 to 62,025 DC patients this year, but it is ***always easier to grow when you're small***. Scaling is an issue for all businesses.

&#x200B;

\----------------------------

***Profitability***

* **TL;DR: they'll make no profit for a long ass time** (^(if ever))

As for actually making money, well Clover doesn't do that. Yes, they had a 140% increase in revenue, which is good, but their expenses are rising ***faster*** than revenue. Accordingly, they missed on earnings by -0.52, or **378% downside surprise**. In typical corporate fashion, their forward guidance is full of claims of improvement on cost management just around the corner.

There is, to be fair here, a legitimate reason for some of the cost increases in the form of covid expenses. Essentially, some old people needed extra care, while others *delayed* care until it looked safe which caused a massive spike in trips to the doctor. And when you're old and you let shit slide, it gets a lot worse and a lot more expensive.

Furthermore, their basic strategy involves eating losses when they take on new ""lives under management,"" with the idea that they'll make it back, and more, further down the road with that same patient though the efficiencies of their ""A.I."", Clover Assistant.

Taking them at their word that this works (and will continue to do so at larger scales) then it is obvious they will being eating losses for years to come. Allegedly, they'll turn a profit in 2023, but I wouldn't hold my breath on that. However, just growing their ""lives under management"" number might be enough to hold up the stock price.

It might **not** be enough, however, to keep the lights on. If they can't at least slow the bleeding, share issuances could be lurking down the road (queue the pump & dump conspiracies).

&#x200B;

\----------------------------

***Competition***

* **TL;DR: they have to take market share from better companies**

As noted above, the biggest hurdle in front of Clover is **competition**. Despite the ""tech start-up"" narrative surrounding Clover, the reality is that they are marching into the teeth of well-entrenched healthcare companies.

The likes of United Healthcare and Humana aren't going to take lightly to little ol' Clov rolling up in their shit. With about 10 million patients between them, UH and Humana are monsters in the Medicare space and with that comes the ability to undercut the competition. Furthermore, all these big players also have their own ***magic AI machine-learning gizmos*** that do ***magic AI things***. And they already have access to more data than Clover on account of their massive patient base.

This doesn't mean they can just snuff Clover out of existence, but taking away market share from established players is a far different gambit than expanding into a new market. And it gets harder the bigger you get.

&#x200B;

\----------------------------

***Shaddy Shit***

* **TL;DR: Chamath is a shaddy af, and so is the CEO**

This whole shabang was rolled out in typical Chamath fashion. Back in October of 2020, in his pitch for Clover, he claimed they **""already""** had 200,000 lives under management in their **Direct Contracting program** (i.e., not including the MA patients). Except that was bullshit of the Chamath-degree. At the time he claimed this, Clover ***hadn't even started*** its DC program (it had only just been accepted into the program).

As their latest earning report notes, they don't expect to get anymore ""lives"" in their DC program until Jan. 2022. (This is due to Medicare enrollment period rules). So, rather than ""already"" having 200,000 for 2021, Clover will instead end the year with the \~62,000 that they have right now. ***Chamath at his finest, ladies and gentlemen.***

Clover's top guy, Vivek, is also well-known for being shaddy. Though, in his case, I don't actually care as much. Back in the day, this guy ran three hospitals in NJ that were noteworthy for having the highest fees of any hospitals in America. Shaddy, but shaddy in the ***ruthless capitalism direction***. He gets a pass from Cbass *for this*. He is also alleged to have pilfered a company he ran back in the day. This doesn't get a pass, because it could negatively affect my bottom line.

Clover is the subject of two ***related*** investigations, one from DoJ and the other from the SEC. The DoJ one is about shaddy business practices; something about kickbacks. I also don't give much of a fuck about this. The SEC investigation is about the fact that the DoJ investigation was not disclosed during the SPAC merger. All this will probably amount to some fines, if anything at all.

On scale of 0 to Enron, I'll give Clover a 1.5. Doesn't look that bad to me.

&#x200B;

\----------------------------

***Technology***

* **TL;DR: they have a magic AI app that's designed to maximize** **~~health~~** ***profits*** (^(maybe))

The last thing to mention is the Great Green Hope: the **Clover Assistant**. This is the ""tech"" in Clover and the reason dipshits are using #TelsaHealth. What is it? Well, basically a data input and analysis program. More basically: *Microsoft Excel with fancy buttons*.

Clover Assistant is used by the doctors (and many MA patients use it, too) to coordinate and recommend stuff. The Great Hope here is that doctors love using this thing so much that they'll sign onto a DC agreement with Clover, allowing Clover to process their Medicare payment claims in exchange for access to the ""**app**"".

So is it going to work? Well, it is ***starting*** to: Clover went from 0 to 62,000 patients via this scheme this year. It's a country fucking mile from what Chamath claimed, but ain't nothing. And given the potential for expansion into the rest of the US, and you have the receipt for a pretty damn good return on capital. But then again, it is just an ""app"".

To be clear, I don't hate the *idea* of Clover Assistant. Conceptually, I actually like it. The Clover Assistant basically helps doctors make sure their patients are getting the ""right care"" by compiling data and presenting it in an easy to use fashion. This is presented as an opportunity to ""improve outcomes"" and ""save costs"" and ""help the under-served."" But I don't give a rat's ass about any of that.

Which brings me to the Hindenburg report, and the part about it that I ***like***. The report claims that Clover is using the Assistant to direct doctors toward medical recommendations that would result in profits for Clover (rather than the best medical outcome), and that they are incentivizing the doctors with increased payments for these outcomes. ***I love this.*** Now, Clover vehemently denies this is the case, but I (not so) secretly hope they're lying here, because this is ***exactly*** what I imagine when I think of applying Big Data-A.I. and Machine Learning to healthcare.

People have ***blind faith*** in machines, particularly ones that they've been told are ""**A.I. powered**"" and involve ""**machine learning**"". Thus, you can use the concept of ""A.I."" to persuade patients to just accept whatever the computer tells them. Machine learning is then used program the Clover Assistant to ***maximize profits***, which should involve providing the minimum care required to keep the patient alive as long as possible. (Medicare pays a set amount to Clover and they get to keep the extra if the patients don't use up all the funds).

The only way I could see to improve on this diabolical scheme would be if they ground up the corpses of their newly deceased patients, turned them into food and fed them to the rest of their **""lives under management.""** I'm lookin' for every penny here, kids, ***every single penny***.

**Part 3. A Conspiracy of Idiocy**

Typical of any stock ticker that gathers a cultish following, the Clovidiots are as well-known for their conspiracy theories as they are for their options expiring worthless. Now, most of these are the run-of-mill shit you get with any ticker: the Hedgies, reeee! You would think that this is the first time some of these people had ever bought a stock... oh, wait.

&#x200B;

\----------------------------

***Hedgies!!!***

* **TL;DR: it's the stock market, deal with it**

So, do the ""Hedge Funds"" manipulate the stock price? Well, sure, why not. They definitely shorted it, and then managed to cover those short sales with little appreciable rise in the stock. Back in June, CLOV was at something like a 48% shorted. Now the it's 15% and I believe it got as low as 7% before this week's run up. While going from 48% to 7% short with no appreciable rise in the stock price looks impossible, it's definitely not when you considered that a large percentage of the float has been in institutional hands this whole time. Stock goes up a little, they sell and back down she goes, welcome to a regular day on the stock market.

Is this some grand conspiracy of fat cats in a room smoking cigars as they plan out how to stick it to those pesky Reddit kids? ***I doubt it***, but if it makes you feel better, whatever.

I, personally, would worry less about the ""Hedge Funds"" and more about the Market Makers, as they're the ones selling you the options, and if they buy up the stock beforehand, they can sell out for a profit while simultaneous vaporizing those call options you bought from them. In fact, I'm pretty sure this is the game.

Can anything be done about it? Well, no, not really. At least, not unless retail buys up a larger percentage of the float. However, with each false run up, I wonder if that exact process is taking place, i.e., more bagholders are being newly minted, and each, not wanting to take an L and just move on with his life, decides to become a ""diamond handed ape."" Only time will reveal the truth of this.

&#x200B;

\----------------------------

***Us vs. the World***

* **TL;DR: everyone thinks this way, deal with it**

The second great conspiracy of CLOV is that the whole of the internet is out to get it. This is proffered with the full knowledge that GME-Anon and Popcorn ***both believe the same thing about their own stock.*** Both also believe that CLOV is, ***in and of itself***, a conspiracy to distract from their pet stock. But GME-Anon ***also believes*** that Popcorn is an engineered distraction. And all three are ***also*** convinced that the Mods are out to get them, ***specifically***.

This is, of course, perfectly normal behavior. That might seem shocking to some of you, but the next time you're watching football with a die hard fan (or whatever lame-ass europoor sport you watch), look for their reactions whenever the slightest thing doesn't go their way:

* *""These fucking refs are terrible! They're totally biased against my team! They've got it out for us! I'm going to write an angry letter to the league!""*

Sound familiar? It should, because if you look around with open eyes, you'll find this exact behavioral pattern repeated at infinitum across every conceivable human endeavor.

Do people hate CLOV and the masses of idiots holding it? Sure, and I don't blame them. You guys can be pretty fucking annoying. That does not, however, equate to a grand conspiracy of suppression. The fact that your copy-pasta DD got nixed just like everyone else's lazy dogshit copy-pasta is not you being singled out. It's you not understanding the rules and adapting your behavior to play within them. But hey, maybe it's easier to just blame the Mods.

**Part 4. Rise now, a Man of the Bag Watch**

Having taken a brief tour of Castle Black and had a bit of a feel for what it's like to be a venerable Man of the Clov Bag Watch, most of you are probably thinking: *Okay, how the fuck do I get out this chickenshit operation?*

Well, you are probably still hoping for **moon**. In that regard, I've some bad news for you: ***there will be no squeeze.***

There will absolutely not be a **short squeeze**. At 15% short, there is zero chance of this happening. *""But, bruh, the* ***real*** *short number is like 420% bruh.""* Bullshit. Just straight bullshit.

There is also not going to be a **gamma squeeze.** Not anytime soon, and likely never. In order to get a gamma squeeze you need options that are going to be delta-hedged. But why delta-hedge options that are going to be Thanos-snapped out of existence by expiry?

A while back, it looked like there could be a **mixed squeeze** (short covering + gamma hedging), but that's all in the past now. Down the road from now, could it still happen? Yeah, sure, and I could end up raw-dogging a Victoria's Secret model on the hood of my new lambo. All kinds of crazy things are ***possible***, but that doesn't make them ***likely***.

And honestly, what the fuck is wrong with a good ol' grind up? Squeezes are fun, I get it. You get to see your money double, triple, 5x, 10x, all in the space of a day or two. You get to see those option YOLO's gain a thousand of percent in minutes. But you still make money on a grind up. A fuckload of it.

I'm not sure I buy into this whole notion of a ""squeeze"" being the **Holy Grail of the Stock Market**. It's starting to sound like the Bears and their perpetual claims that they're going to make ***all the money*** on the coming collapse, all while lighting round after round of SPY puts on fire. The Squeeze Fanatics are doing the same thing, but with call options on meme stocks.

But, hey, what do I know? I'm just peon in this operation, a pitifully small cog in the great meat grinder we call the stock market. For now the chart tells me there's still **hope of up**, and so my bag watch continues. When the chart dies and there is no more good to be said of the company, then I will initiate my Bagholder Optimization Formula and there my watch will end. Until then, I man my post.

# **Markets brace for hot consumer inflation report in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/10/markets-brace-for-hot-consumer-inflation-report-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Investors are paying close attention to any reading on inflation these days, and the consumer price index will be the big one to watch in the coming week.
*****
> The latest snapshot of the economy comes just a week before the Federal Reserve’s important September meeting. At that meeting, the Fed is expected to discuss more details about its plan to taper down its bond buying program, or quantitative easing.
*****
> Market professionals say a hotter inflation reading could speed up the Fed’s plans to slow the $120 billion a month in bond purchases. The paring back of its asset purchase program would be the Fed’s first major step away from the easy policy it put in place to combat the pandemic.
*****
> The consumer price index is expected Tuesday, and there is retail sales data is released Thursday. They are expected to show consumer prices jumped at a 5.3% annual pace in August, according to the consensus estimate from FactSet, while the consumer continued to pull back from the high spending levels of earlier in the year.
*****
> # Hot CPI
> “If the CPI is hotter than expected, it could make the difference between a September announcement for tapering or waiting to November,” Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said.
*****
> Economists expect CPI to rise at a 0.4% pace month over month. The report comes after August’s producer price index — which was released Friday — showed a jump of 8.3% year over year, due in part to supply chain constraints.
*****

*****
> The Fed’s formal announcement about tapering its bond-buying program, also called QE, is widely expected in November or December. Many of those who had expected a September announcement pushed back their time frame to later in the year after August’s employment report showed just 235,000 jobs added, about 500,000 less than expected.
*****
> “Certainly the trend has been for the inflation number to come in above expectations. I think if that happens again, it will feed the narrative that high inflation is going to stick. Obviously, it’s an issue for the bond market if it’s viewed at all as accelerating the timing of the QE tapering, and or accelerating the timing of the first rate hike,” CIBC Private Wealth U.S. chief investment officer David Donabedian said. That would be a negative for stocks.
*****
> “If markets have an inflation mutiny here and there’s volatility as a result, they could move it up to September,” Donabedian said of the Fed’s taper announcement. “But I think there’s kind of a one in four likelihood in my view.”
*****
> # Stagflation?
> That combination of higher inflation and slower spending, particularly after August’s weaker jobs report, has spurred talk about the threat of stagflation. Those worries have also increased as economists ratchet back growth forecasts for the third quarter to a still high level just above 5%, from above 6%.
*****
> “I’m more about the ‘flation’ side of it than the ‘stag.’ I think the economy is going to perform fine right through next year,” Donabedian said. He said the slowdown in consumer spending after stimulus checks had boosted retail sales earlier in the year is not surprising and may be just a “short-term warning.”
*****
> “We had this explosive growth in retail sales early in the year as a direct result of stimulus payments and vaccines coming and a burst of consumer optimism. It’s really settled down now,” he said. “There was an enormous amount of liquidity and saving and they spent what they spent out of that extra amount of savings and you’re going through a bit of a retracement here, which is why you’re seeing economists mark down their third quarter estimates. Consumer fundamentals are pretty good.”
*****
> Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said he expects the CPI report to show that inflation is peaking, just as the Fed has said. But he says the slowing trend is not just an issue for consumer spending. It is also showing up in business spending and housing.
*****
> “With where labor markets are, August was a bit of an egg. But growth in employment has been solid on average, very robust over the course of the year,” he said. “Even though employment disappointed in August, hours and and earnings were still pretty good. There’s income there for consumers to spend. We’re looking at this as a short-term hiccup.”
*****
> Gapen said third-quarter economic growth may be somewhat slower than expected. However, he said some of the lost growth could show up in the fourth quarter.
*****
> “It has some characteristics of stagflation, but true stagflation is rising unemployment and rising inflation. We don’t have that,” he said. “These are bottlenecks that are kind of constraining the pace of the recovery and lead to higher inflation. Demand isn’t the problem right now. Supply is. The unemployment rate is still coming down and employment is improving. It has the whiff but I wouldn’t call it stagflation.”

*****
> Donabedian expects higher prices and shortages to continue into next year, as supply chains keep getting disrupted. Some companies, including PPG and General Electric, have already commented on how they see issues with supplies stretching into 2022. Donabedian expects to see more warnings ahead of the third-quarter earnings season.
*****
> Stocks were lower this week, with the S&P 500 losing 1.7% to 4,458. The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield has held above 1.3% and was at 1.33% on Friday.
*****
> A number of strategists expect to see the stock market pullback during the typically choppy September and October period. Some say the Fed’s September meeting could be a catalyst, especially if the central bank sounds particularly hawkish.
*****
https://i.imgur.com/IP5Vq9T.png
*****
> “We’re up over 30% in 2019, over 18% last year and over 21% in the first months of this year,” Donabedian said. “These are unsustainable rates or return. ...Our takeaway is it’s going to get tougher from here. Valuations are somewhat extended and this whole incredibly supportive policy framework is going to get a little less friendly.”
*****
> # Now watch Congress
> Donabedian said it will be important to watch discussions in Congress as it begins to put details around the infrastructure spending and what type of tax increases will be proposed to pay for it.
*****
> “They’re going to start to fill in the blanks on where the money is going to be spent and what taxes and tax rates are going to be written into the legislation,” he said. “It’s the overall corporate tax rate, it’s the tax on foreign earned income, capital gains rates and dividend tax rate. These are big investor related issues.”
*****
> He said the market has been ignoring the tax issue. “Those sort of issues went quiet over the summer but it’s back full bore over the next two weeks. It will get a lot of attention.”
*****
> The tax decisions could have big implications for corporate earnings, which have been a big driver of the stock market’s gains. “One very direct way that could go wrong is if you get a large set of tax increases that go into effect in 2022. That’s a direct hair cut,” he said.

> # Beige Book Decelerates As Delta Impact Widens

> Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve updated its twice-quarterly qualitative assessment of the economy based on conversations with business contacts across the twelve regional districts. For each Beige Book release, we apply a natural language processing algorithm to assess the relative frequency of positive versus negative words, giving us a quantitative comparison of Beige Books over time. As shown in the chart below, our index of Beige Book activity has fallen from record levels recorded back in June to elevated but much more modest levels in September. That's consistent with the Fed's description of ""moderate"" growth thanks to the impact of the Delta variant.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/091021-Beige.png))**

> In the second chart below, we show the relationship between GDP growth and our Beige Book Index from above. As shown, the current reading of our index equates to GDP growth of a bit less than 4% YoY. But keep in mind that extreme base effects are still driving wild YoY GDP readings. With that in mind, the Beige Book Index appears to be showing above-trend but decelerating growth, when accounting for base effects of the extremely low GDP reading from Q2 of 2020.

> # Most Heavily Shorted Stocks

> Over the course of 2021, we have seen some aggressive short squeezes, resulting in turmoil for certain financial institutions and millions in profits for some retail traders. The ""reddit army"" has gone after multiple stocks, most notably Game Stop (GME) and AMC (AMC). Let's dive into the 25 companies in the Russell 3,000 currently with the highest short interest as a percentage of float. Of these 25 companies, only 8 have experienced positive returns in 2021, and 6 have seen their share price half. Since GameStop peaked in late January, 20 of the companies on this list have lost value, and 9 have seen their equity trade down by 50%. Since AMC's peak in early June, 7 companies have seen price appreciation, and zero have seen their value decrease by 50%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/Russell-3000-Highest-SIPF.png))**

> The average short interest as a percentage of float for the entirety of the Russell 3,000 is 3.46%, but certain sectors have much higher proportional short interest than others. Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, and Real Estate have the highest, while Utilities, Financials, and Consumer Staples have the lowest. High levels of short interest is a sign of negative investor sentiment, but certain sectors will consistently have higher figures due to the riskiness of their business models.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/R3000-Sector-Short-interest.png))**

> To dive deeper, let's look at the average short interest in each industry. Retail, Pharma & Biotech, and Consumer Services have the highest levels, while Banks, Tech Hardware, and Utilities have the lowest levels. The average short interest in the retailing industry is more than three times higher than that of banks for companies in the Russell 3,000.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/Industry-avg-SIPF-Russell-3000.png))**

> Although there are many exceptions to the rule, in 2021 equities with higher short interest have generally underperformed the remainder of the Russell 3,000. The average return for equities with short interest between zero and ten percent were higher than that of equities with 33%+ short interest.

> To support this, let's undergo a decile analysis. The stocks in the top 20% in terms of short interest have significantly underperformed the rest of the Russell 3,000 since GME hit its highs. While the equities in the bottom 20% of short interest have averaged a 22.23% return since January 27th (GameStop's top), the top 20% of most heavily shorted stocks have declined by 1.40% on average.

> # Largest 25 Stocks in the S&P 500, Now vs 20 Years Ago

> Yesterday, we took a look at the makeup of the S&P 500's largest 25 companies in 2021 and compared it to that of 10 years ago. Today, we will be extending the study to 2001, twenty years ago right before the 9/11 attacks. On the day before 9/11, the sectors with the largest number of components in the top 25 in terms of market cap were Consumer Staples, Health Care, Technology, Financials, and Communication Services. While all of these sectors still hold a spot in the current top 25 list, the makeup has shifted substantially. Energy and Industrials, which each accounted for 8% of the top 25 companies in 2001, now have zero representation in today's list. Consumer Staples also reduced its count from five to two.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/sector-breakdown-top-25-stocks-now-vs-2001-v2.png))**

> Only four companies that made up the list of top 25 names in September 2001 remain on the list today. Those four companies are Microsoft (MSFT), J&J (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Pfizer (PFE). The average return of these four equities, excluding dividends, is 221.81% with a median of 129.58%. While the turnover of this list has been high over the last 20 years, every member of this list is still in operation today, but two have been undergone mergers (Time Warner & Royal Dutch Petroleum). Interestingly enough, the members of this list have approximately the same proportionate makeup of the S&P 500, with only a 1.89% increase in the weightings of the top 25 stocks now relative to September 2001.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/2001-vs-2021-biggest-comps-SP500.png))**

> The US economy today is far different than it was in 2001. As it has changed, some companies have adapted and experienced massive growth, while others have been left in the dust. Apart from the two companies that are no longer independently publicly traded, the average return of the 25 largest companies from 2001 is 92.94% with a median return of 49.08%. Over that same period, the S&P 500 has returned 310.61%.

> # September Seasonal Pattern: Weakness After Mid-Month

> September is the final month of the third quarter and historically it is essentially tied with August as worst month of the year. Since 1950, September is ranked last for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have fared slightly better, but historical average performance is still negative. Over the last 21 years, September has generally opened tepidly with mixed performance depending on index with Russell 2000 often rising the most through mid-month. However after mid-month, any gains have tended to fade quickly and turn into losses by month’s end. Sizable losses in 2001, 2002, 2008 and 2011 weigh heavily on average performance.

> # September quarterly option expiration week: S&P 500 up 13 of last 18

> September’s option expiration week is up 59.0% of the time for S&P 500 since 1982. DJIA and NASDAQ have slightly weaker track records with gains 53.8% of the time and 56.4% of the time respectively. However, the week has suffered several sizable losses. The worst loss followed the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. In the last eighteen years, S&P 500 and NASDAQ are tied for best record during September’s option expiration week, up thirteen times. Friday had been firm with all three indices advancing every year 2004 to 2011, but S&P 500 has been down eight of the last nine since.

> # What Could Happen The Rest of the Year to Stocks and Bonds?

> This week in the latest LPL Market Signals podcast, Ryan Detrick and Lawrence Gillum discussed global central bank policy, recently weakening economic data, and where stocks and bonds could go the remainder of this year.

> In today’s blog we will focus on their discussion on stocks and bonds.

> The S&P 500 Index was up more than 20% by the end of August for the first time since 1997 and it has made a new high every single month this year so far (9 for 9). Incredibly, it made 53 new highs before August was over, the most ever. Any way you slice it, this year is historic for the bulls.

> The catch (and there’s always a catch) is the S&P 500 hasn’t pulled back 5% all year, with the last 5% pullback last October. Not to mention September is the worst month for stocks the past 10 years, 20 years, and since 1950.

> But history says that great starts to a year tend to see continued strength the final four months. “Looking at the previous top 10 starts to a year ever, the final four months have gained eight times,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “So should we see any seasonal weakness, we’d use it as an opportunity to buy before likely continued strength.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 2021 ranks as the 6th best start to a year ever. The previous top 10 best starts to a year averaged a return of 4.0% the rest of the year, with a very solid median return 5.4%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.8.21-Blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

> Turning to bonds, we continue to expect higher yields due to the growth and inflation outlook, with a target of 1.75% on the 10-year treasury yield by year end. This of course could pressure bonds, as they trade inversely with yields.

> From a portfolio point of view, we would keep overall interest rate sensitivity muted and favor mortgage-backed securities and short- to intermediate-maturity investment grade corporates. As a result of our higher rates call, we suggest being underweight longer maturity high grade corporates or long-term treasuries, which are more sensitive to rising rates. So sum it up, taking a more of a defensive posture as it relates to interest rate sensitivity makes a lot of sense the remainder of 2021.

> Also, the potential this week for a European Central Bank (ECB) announcement on tapering could push European yields higher, which in turn could push U.S. yields higher as well.

plb2ye,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/plb2ye/microvision_booth_tour_at_iaa_2021_munich_meeting/,MicroVision Booth Tour at IAA 2021 Munich - Meeting MVIS CEO Sumit Sharma,1303,348,2021-09-10 09:22:22,"I travelled specifically from Vancouver, BC, Canada to Munich, Germany to meet the MVIS CEO and to see their new Lidar in person...

The IAA has been open for the last 4 days, but I hadn’t been able to properly experience the MicroVision booth until now. I didn’t want to distract Sumit Sharma, Dr. Luce, and the other 3 MVIS staff who attended from their B2B (business to business) goals. However, today was the first day that the general public were allowed to enter the conference halls, and Dave Allen from IR gave us the green light to go visit the booth.

When I arrived at the booth with /u/MusicMaleficent5870, Sumit and Dr. Luce were nowhere in sight. We nevertheless decided to go in and speak to the MVIS staff. I personally spoke with Jonathan C (who I believe is the Director of Digital Engineering, thx Linkedin stalking). Jonathan walked me through the booth while MM5870 kept the other two MVIS staff members occupied. I introduced myself as a moderator of the mvis reddit and handed him my gag card..

&#x200B;

[ gag business card ](https://preview.redd.it/2zfx6lvzukm71.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8d919fd1ec5803c6f78d7c5c186b60c299b19b9)

# Live Lidar Demo

An important note Jonathan mentioned was that two A-Samples were actively scanning the booth. One directly above the live demo screens (that sits on the *in*famous block of wood which I couldn’t see even at a relative far distance), and one directly across from that in the back right hand corner.

The point of having two Lidars actively scanning is to showcase MicroVision’s proprietary active scan lock architecture which allows the A-Sample to actively block out 99% of outside interference (as communicated to shareholders on multiple occasions in past earnings calls). As per past earnings calls the active scan lock architecture is based on proprietary technologies proven in their applications used in the Hololens 2.

In short, the Active Scan lock synchronizes the “send” and “receiving” side of the Gen 5 MEMS just as the Hololens 2 displays are sync’d for the left and right eyes to prevent ocular discomfort (Sumit used a word I didn't recognize to describe that if the left eye and right eye images dont line up you get discomfort. I don’t have education or background in this so could barely keep up). Each Lidar sensor is encoded its own laser signals and excludes interference even from similar identical units.

For example that if you were stuck in an intersection with 20 cars, each with their own set of short-range lidar (SRL), mid-range lidar (MRL), and long-range lidar (LRL). The IR light pollution and interference will overwhelm other sensors that do not have this feature that MicroVision owns IP for.

&#x200B;

[ The second A-Sample live scanning acting as \\""interference\\"" above the television which is showing the 1.8M Long Range Point Cloud. ](https://preview.redd.it/ien6mkf1vkm71.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8cb12842300f04b56ebe7c9fd7577c29351b7307)

It was explained to me that there is a filter on the live lidar demo. The filter removes the reflection of the floor for aesthetic reasons. They said that if they kept the floor in the final image, you would have been overwhelmed by extra data, but by removing them, the live stream data can be more easily interpreted. Additionally, there are indoor Class 1 EU regs that I believe are in play which made MVIS sandbag their sensor a bit (if anyone was noticing it isn’t as sharp). Sumit says once all testing and certification is done there shouldn’t be any issues seen specifically in the demo booth unit.

This is also a phenomenon you will notice in future Lidar demos, because the lidar sensor acts similar to the human eye does when it sees a mirage. There is a critical angle after which, the light seems to bounce to infinity. Therefore, the sensor will not return images of the road surface (due to it being a planar surface). All content which is 3 dimensional continues to be detected until the full range as advertised.

# Elvis has Entered the Booth

During the middle of conversation with Jonathan, I noticed Sumit and Dr Luce exiting from a meeting room behind the booth with an unidentified gentleman. They had obviously finished a meeting, and one of the helpers came out to return the A-Sample and the Gen 5 mems mirror back into the display (they were not there when we arrived).

Sumit walked over, I introduced myself as “Jay” and he replied “Jay, nice to finally meet you, I’ve been waiting for you all day!” We arrived approximately 45 minutes before closing and I had been with Jonathan for approximately 15 minutes. Additionally, I had told Dave Allen I’d try to swing by later in the afternoon, so I expect Sumit knew we were coming to visit eventually.

Sumit then whisked /u/MusicMaleficent5870 and I away toward the live lidar demo to start our proper tour.

# The MicroVision A-Sample

Sumit asked us what our backgrounds were to get a grasp of our level of technical knowledge. Suffice it to say, we communicated that it was low lol. One of the biggest things Sumit wanted us to walk away with was the story he was trying to convey to investors. The specific story for investors to recognizing the true value of MicroVision’s IP. The other story he’s trying to convey is the inevitability for customers (from my interpretation of his explanation).

To give you an example, he spoke briefly about the Hololens 2 and Microsoft. Microsoft spent *years* trying to improve the display of the Hololens 2. It got to the point where they finally realized Microsoft could not achieve it alone (even with a group of ex-MVIS engineers on their engineer team – this is my addition for color). Alex Kipman himself mentions this in one of his talks in Zurich/digital streams in 2020. Microsoft eventually had to approach MicroVision to get the job done because of MicroVision’s proprietary technology that they’ve built in the past couple of decades. He also believes that **they would have never won that $22 Billion Dollar contract without them** (which I agree with. The Hololens 1 was head-to-head with Magic Leap which ate the dust after the Hololens 2 was released).

&#x200B;

[ Microsoft's \\""$22 Billion Dollar Contract\\"" ](https://preview.redd.it/5s1r48a5vkm71.jpg?width=934&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cdaec6c00acd3bc87406771b920045079ea5bb43)

This story of inevitability is what customers are starting to realize. If you want the best technology that solves your problems rather than creating further problems, you need to use MicroVision technology and IP (their family jewels). Their custom ASICs (which is available in a digital form) is one of the biggest advantages over competitors in the L2 and L2++ field like Tesla and Mobileye with their Camera only Neural Networks.

Sumit started to go down the rabbit hole into how Neural Networks work. He wouldn’t trust the safety of that technology with his family, and that we wouldn’t either if we read the disclaimers and fine print for cars who use these systems. This also aligns with Mobileye’s current plan in developing a secondary independent Radar + Lidar system to ensure there are true redundant safety systems for maximum passenger safety.

There is a joke Sumit likes to share from the Silicon Valley Episode “Hot Dog, Not Hot Dog” which helped us understand where he was coming from about Neural Networks.

# The Family Jewels

Sumit believes that the ADAS market is going to go “gangbusters” sooner rather than later. See the bidding war currently happening between Magna and Qualcomm over Veoneer (who IAA placed side by side in the conference with Veoneer squished in the middle).

MicroVision has a lot of key advantages with their proprietary custom ASICs. The way Sumit explained it to us was it comes down to basic math and physics. They can do things with edge computing faster and quicker than anyone else with their Family Jewels. **It comes from their custom OS that is built in their chips.** While Microvision is building their ADAS Lidar Sensors from an established foundation and decade’s worth of tech and IP, their friends Luminar are spending billions just to be able to do the same thing with no guarantee that they can do it better or quicker than how MVIS is doing it.

Lastly, one of the key praises that potential customers have been commenting on the A-Sample is how **slim in profile the A-Sample is** (Apologies for the photo, I should probably take it lower down).

I plan to publish an album of photos sometime this week which compares the other lidars on display with MVIS’ A-Sample using the “cassette of truth” which I have been photographing to give an idea of the size of all the Lidar sensors. From my observation, MVIS is best in class from a profile aspect, all other lidar sensors are much taller in comparison.

# The Lidar Product Suite

Sumit Sharma wants to generate more revenue. While the Hololens 2 currently does not produce enough volume for the time being,  **he believes that will change soon** with the new Lidar Product family.

Sumit also shared that they were getting a lot of requests for small NREs (non-recurring engineering) about, “hey we already have a product for short-range Lidar for the time being, can you make something for mid-range only, or maybe long-range only?”.  There was enough interest that it made sense for MicroVision perspective to produce the A-Sample which would be identical to their Dynamic View Lidar (DVL) hardware wise, but with limited features the customer require now to help generate that revenue.

Their Dynamic View Lidar is meant to be their premium/flagship lidar offering. Sumit also touched on the use case of the 905nm lasers which have a standard and secure supply chain unlike the 1550nm lasers which are either custom made or non-standard supply chains utilizing exotic materials (which Velodyne does a great job of explaining in this article: [https://velodynelidar.com/blog/guide-to-lidar-wavelengths/](https://velodynelidar.com/blog/guide-to-lidar-wavelengths/)).

Not only do the lasers help MVIS scale, but with the launch of MicroVision’s fifth-generation MEMS to a 200-millimeter wafer silicon they control the whole process. They own their IP, and nobody else does. This gives them the ability to manufacture it the way they want. More control for MicroVision means more stability for customers.

# True Value

I was honestly surprised how in tune Sumit was to investors. He is also very aware of trader activity, but that is out of his hands. He’s here to get true value for MVIS long investors and the multiplier/upside is massive in his eyes.

I came away from the 30minute discussion in awe to be honest. There was so much content packed into that meeting, and Sumit was exuding nothing but confidence. If there are any German investors in Munich, make sure you go visit the booth, it’s an excellent opportunity to share in the excitement and bullishness Sumit is currently feeling.

GLTALs, it's 3:30am and i'm going to bed.

TLDR - I travelled from Vancouver to Munich to meet the CEO of MVIS and to see their new Lidar product to compete against the other companies. I am bullish."

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pd45fl/mvis\_bet/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pd45fl/mvis_bet/)

For those too lazy to click, Microvision (MVIS) offers the best in class lidar solution for both ADAS and eventually autonomous driving, addressing SWAP-C (size, weight, power, cost), and Tier 1 / OEM requirements.

All other lidar companies at present have major hang ups with SWAP-C, eg: Luminar is based on SW-IR 1550nm which uses exotic and costly raw materials (InGaAs) for both laser generation and reading signal, this is why Luminar acquired OptoGration to help bring cost down, unfortunately for them they're still several orders of magnitude over materials used for 905nm which Microvision uses.

There's flash based systems, spinning buckets, etc, the point is Microvision figured it all out, this is what they've been doing for the last 20 years (laser beam steering), they make the light engines for the Microsoft Hololens 2 and IVAS units, they're not some shit based SPAC with a twenty year old CEO issuing insane shares to himself. I will say though, Microvision has had POOR revenues for essentially forever, they're just now getting royalties from their work with Hololens and IVAS finally, they're turning over a new leaf and that is what makes this a good opportunity and BET, the market believes they're overvalued right now, once they sign one partnership for lidar the market will correct.

Which brings us to today, the IAA Mobility show in Germany is currently taking place and for the first time Microvision is publicly showing their family of lidar units and specs. The cat is getting out of the bag and coincidentally the whole general market AND lidar sector has taken a big shit, so right now is a great entry point. For those that bought weeklies, we're probably toast.

Here's video of live footages taken from various lidar booths during IAA: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsrp3QQ-Abg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsrp3QQ-Abg) (notice the difference in resolution between people standing / walking)

Unless there's a big upswing in volume for the entire lidar sector very soon I would not buy weeklies but either get shares or buy cheaper OTM LEAPs.

Another thing to note, the company doesn't talk about it's augmented reality (AR) / near eye display (NED) vertical anymore, despite Microsoft just getting awarded a $20bn contract for IVAS and MVIS receiving royalties, the CEO on the last few ECs has mentioned automotive lidar as their primary focus. Interestingly Drew Markham was added on as general counsel several months ago and her experience is in M&A and transferring of IP. I'm speculating that the AR vertical is currently in the works of being sold off to Microsoft.

I'll add comments later for other tidbits of DD, I should get back to work right now.

Website for reference [https://www.microvision.com/](https://www.microvision.com/)

MVIS has many uses for it's technology but the two main verticals are Automotive Lidar & AR/VR.

**Automotive Lidar -** Microvision just completed what they claim (with good reason) is their ""Best in Class"" Long Range Lidar unit. It is an actual product that they are track testing and showing off at the IAA Mobility Conference in Germany. Look at the live demo they have up vs. our competitors:

* Luminars Lidar Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/c8v23x](https://streamable.com/c8v23x)

* Microvision Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/paywxe](https://streamable.com/paywxe)

As you can see by the point cloud and refresh rate MVIS sure looks best in class. MVIS is currently on the path of scaling for production and looking for partners.

Market Size - The global lidar market size is projected to reach **$6.77 Billion by 2026** and virtually every car company is investing/looking to utilize Lidar in the future for assisted and automated driving. It could be in every new vehicle. Luminar (LAZR) the inferior product as you can easily see by the videos above IPO'd last year with a market cap of $8.1 Billion.

**AR/VR** \- Microvision produces the MEMS Laser Beam Scanning display engine found in the Microsoft Hololens 2. It was confirmed through a tear down before and just officially via MVIS's last ASM. Also, since Microsoft produces the IVAS (rugged Hololens 2 for military use) it is highly speculated that MVIS is the engine inside that also.

Market Size - According to a comprehensive research report by Market Research Future (MRFR), “Global AR and VR Market information By Technology, By Component, By Device Type and Vertical - Forecast till 2027” the market to reach **USD 766 billion by 2025.** Also, Microsoft just won an army contract this year **worth up to $21.9 Billion.**

Google the Hololens 2 or IVAS units to see all the cool futuristic shit they can do. I'm not gonna spoon feed you everything.

**Stock Info**

Current Market Cap = $2.24 Billion

52 Week High = $28

52 Week Low = $1.38

Estimated Short Interest = 29.75m or 18.29% of FF

Q2 2021 shares held by institutions: **42,174,027 (25.7%)**

**Summary**

Since Sumit Sharma took over as CEO he continues to deliver on his promise to increase shareholder value. The company is open for a buyout, strategic alternative, or going it alone with it's amazing technology. Whatever will be the best route to **INCREASE SHAREHOLDER VALUE**. At it's current share price we are way **UNDERVALUED.** There is more DD out there on the technologies, different verticals, and how we are at an inflection point for these things to pop. Go look at the MVIS subreddit and the meta thread there of DD I can't link.

**Edit -** Thanks for all the internet points you POS I'm gonna take a screenshot and hang this on my fridge. Seriously though this was just a quick bullish summary I put together, there's way more going on if you're interested all the info is on the line and with some in the comments."

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Walgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play & income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone’s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.

**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**

Below are the 6 main reasons we’re bullish on WBA.

&#x200B;

**1)** **WBA is a Dow component.**

Walgreens stock ($WBA) is a Dow component. As one of only 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the oldest and most historically-followed U.S. market index dating back to the late 1800s), WBA is now considered one of the select large-cap companies which (together) accurately represent the overall market.

Though WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only \~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.

WBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a “virtuous cycle”, where the stock price increases --> WBA weighting increases --> more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --> the stock price increases --> the positive cycle repeats.

In short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.

&#x200B;

**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**

Walgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA’s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.

&#x200B;

**3)** **4% Dividend**

A 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market’s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.

Its further possible that WBA’s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the ""Dividend Aristocrats"", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.

&#x200B;

**4)** **Attractive Valuations**

WBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.

Why is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn’t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.

How do we know it’s cheap? Why is the stock a “buy”? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Procter & Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).

In other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.

&#x200B;

**5)** **Improving Business**

Walgreens’ business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.

With most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA’s bullish cycle. 

We will look at the upcoming year’s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA’s progress and performance.

&#x200B;

**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**

The cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.

Walgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.

There is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it’s been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.

A takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.

Additionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.

Warren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called “Haven”) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).

It seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher."

Why I believe the U.S. stock market and U.S. Dollar will fall.,1161,938,2021-09-06 23:55:23,"This journey began for me with a random conversation. I was at a grocery store on my break from work and while I was looking at different Greek yogurts, I overheard a man say something I couldn’t believe. I turned around and said “Sir… I’m sorry, what did you just say?” He introduced himself as the owner of the grocery store (locally owned in St.Pete/Clearwater FL area) the gentlemen proceeded to tell me that **last year he paid around $4,000 for a crate of food…he said one year later, that same EXACT CRATE IS NOW $14,000.** This conversation was just 3 weeks ago. 

So…when I got into my car I had an idea. I wonder what the U.S. Dollar index is trading at…I’m sure it’s bloody red (I assumed) what I saw literally made my jaw drop. I’m not joking…**at that time the U.S. dollar happened to be at a 9 month high.** I couldn’t fucking believe it. At that moment I knew…we had fucked up. https://imgur.com/a/tBVu4f1

After already doing mini DD on why the U.S. dollar might fall just days before (just watching random videos on YouTube about Dr. Burry and stock shit) 

I immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation. Which was call options in $TBT. An ETF with 2x inverse exposure on 20+ U.S Treasury bonds. In simple terms, this is a bet on hyperinflation. **I believe that the Federal Reserve WILL BE FORCED to raise rates (as that is their main tool in their toolkit to fight inflation) faster than ANYONE is anticipating. Which in turn would collapse bond prices.** Making the calls print. I currently have a small position right now.

Now this brings me to the U.S. stock market. I sold all my stocks 2 days ago. I have long exposure in only one position currently. A $50/$80 call debit spread in VIAC. Simply put, if I’m wrong and the market just keeps going, then the $350 I paid for spread will generate nearly $3,000 if VIAC is over $80 on expiration, which is in 2 years.

                  Technical Analysis

Let me start with my TA first…which is alarming. https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX 

**This was yesterday, Friday, September 3.**

Here is one from Thursday, September 2.

**$SPY is at a critical resistance level…I mean…it literally is hitting the fucking roof here**… and with everything going on in the world…you want more?!?? Sorry to burst your bubble…but how was that even theoretically feasible? It’s impossible in my opinion. 

Let me explain why…

              Updated GDP Forecasts

**Am I literally the only one who saw on Thursday that Morgan Stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter GDP expectations??? Let me fill you in on a little secret…THEY CUT THEIR FUCKING ESTIMATES BY MORE THAN HALF!!!!!**

For fuck sakes people, **THIS IS HUGE!!** This is a quote from a brand new article literally posted 45 minutes ago from the Washington Post! 

**“The team at Morgan Stanley led by chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to 2.9% from 6.5%.”**

**Gross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the United States. So…yeah we’re fucked. Which in turn has an impact on some companie’s future earnings… and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations now…** 

             Wall Street‘s High Expectations

So far, 88% of S and P 500 companies have beaten earnings per share estimates for the second quarter of 2021, according to data provider FactSet.

The strong results put the S and P 500 on track to be the best quarter for beats since FactSet started tracking the data in 2008. 😳 So…. What happens if the economy literally comes to a stand still? Which in my opinion is slowly happening and what will happen. You could have a slow correction based on this alone, just on companies missing earnings….which I guarantee that will happen… it’s going to be an earnings miss galore.

Simply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.

When gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.

**So investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio.**

This ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.

Get it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this  https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ 

I like this one better compared to the DOW 30. 
https://imgur.com/a/cvYyXsB

The lumber/gold ratio **HAS PLUMMETED** in the last 2 months…literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Remember…play defense)

Side note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But…gold was up big this week as well…and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.

                Consumer Confidence

**In simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption.**

So…for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.

**They reported 125.10 on the index for the month of July. Boy…were they in for a surprise. The month of August has a consensus estimate of 123.0, the number was 113.9….a very surprising miss. I wasn’t surprised at all to be honest with you.**


                      Conclusion

**Let me be clear…I believe Jerome Powell with his magical money printer and rising inflation will be the reason the market falls, also the fact that the government is just handing out free money to every single person with excess stimulus, it’s going to collapse our financial system possibly…also with all the over leveraging you have the perfect brew of a shit storm. Also with rising delta concerns, the new variant “Mu” and mass evictions will soon begin…**

**Since the start of 2013  the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs.**

No big deal right?

**I mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and on…. But you get the point by now…let’s not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, I’m sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. Don’t get me started on the mass evictions as well…and the FED has been buying MORTGAGE BACKED Securities… The very financial instrument the collapse of economy in 2008.**

Now…**my positions.** Take this into consideration… I’m 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios. I may or may not have just got out of prison 9 months ago after completing a 5 year prison sentence. So…**Not financial advice.** 

**Short term Tendies:** sold 4 different Call options on SPY via call credit spreads. 
$455/$456 9/15 exp- 2 sold
$456/457 9/13 exp- 2 sold

Bought 3 $10 puts in $BFI 9/17 exp 

**Long term Tendies:**

One $13 call option in $HIBS (this security blew up 200%-300% in the span of days during the covid crash)
It basically shorts TSLA and other ridiculous growth stocks… I looked at their top 10 holdings and like seven out of 10 of them are at all time highs lol. 

2 calls in $TECS $5 strike price. 1/21/22 exp. This is a 3x bear inverse of tech stocks. It’s holdings are like AAPL and MSFT. I want to short stocks that are trading at all time highs. Because when this house of cards finally crumbles they will fall the hardest. **There WILL BE MARGIN CALLS.** You can bet on that. 

1 call option in $TBT exp 1/20/23 (hyperinflation bet/Fed raising rates quicker)

One $50/$80 call debit spread in $VIAC 
Exp. 1/22/23 (long exposure to act as my hedge if by some divine miracle I’m wrong) 

**My last position:**

**$2,500 in Cash.**

Simply put…**cash is a position.** People seem to forget that. And I will simply buy the dip in my favorite companies… my choice of extremely cheap shares. Trust me… I already have my shopping list ready. 

Good luck out there guys. **Timing this is almost impossible**…but my timeline is within 6 months we will experience at least a 15% correction if not a full blown apocalyptic market crash. It’s hard to really assess the damage on how bad it will be. And for those who refuse to take the needle out of their arms, enjoy getting margin called and losing all of your money!

**The company PLTR has positioned themselves for what they call a “Black swan event”by purchasing $50 million in solid gold bars.Not gold ETFs. Solid gold bars…Let me remind you that they deal with information.**

I’m not saying you should sell all of your stocks like me, I’m saying that maybe it’s time to scale back a bit on the margin, move some money into cash and maybe sell some of those positions that are up big. Don’t forget **Sleepy Joe is going to raise long term capital gains tax, possibly very soon, from like 20% to as high as 43.4% if you make over $1mil**…another bearish catalyst for the market. I literally could go on and on guys….It’s pretty obvious at this point, we’ll at least to me…but what do I know? I just got out of prison last December. 🤔

TLDR: Just read the bold shit…

But at the same time, we have investors like Warren Buffet who still swear by a low-cost index fund and recommends it over his own Berkshire Hathaway stock! So, in this week’s issue, we analyze both sides of the argument and see if we \[1\] should be worried about the index fund bubble!

**The Problem**

The argument against the index fund is a logical one. The basic premise is that index funds affect the price discovery of stocks in the market. If a stock is bid up just based on the presence in an index and not by analyzing the underlying asset, then it can lead to a bubble-like scenario where you are buying more and more just because the asset prices are going up.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/a04wyrgmpvl71.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=1693f22d16deb337345e5accb8f360de959707a7)

If you look at the above chart, you could see that in the first 4 months of 2021, a fund inflow of more than $20 Billion occurred just to the Vanguard 500 index fund. There are arguments stating that in the US, index funds make up [more than 50% of the fund market.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/) (This exponential growth is not a surprising one given my last analysis showed that passive funds have summarily beaten active funds over the last 2 decades)

If you think about this, more than half of the money that is flowing into the market is now just buying stocks that are on an index without doing any underlying stock analysis. The problem becomes that companies get more and more investment just because they are big and not because of their future growth prospects. So the question becomes

**Is the index fund affecting the integrity of the stock market?**

The problem with the fund inflow statistics is that stock price is not decided solely based on fund inflow but majorly by trading.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/cjlyt4unpvl71.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=67be6be3b3604712dd017a823da8aee69116019e)

If you look at this [study done by Vanguard](https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/ISGBEL.pdf) \[2,3\], it destroys the price discovery argument. It shows that only 5% of the overall trading volume is captured by index funds. The rest of 95% of trading is made by active traders, pension funds, and institutional investors who do individual stock analyses.

Adding to this, even if the index funds become large enough to create significant price distortions, it’s something that the active fund managers can benefit from as it would give them more opportunities to short overvalued companies and create outsized returns. The fact that it’s not happening right now shows that we are not anywhere near a situation where the index fund is big enough to fundamentally alter the market\[4\].

Now that we know that index funds are not causing any price distortions, one has to wonder

**why there is a sudden rise in concerns regarding an index fund bubble over the past 2-3 years?**

I believe that this issue is being brought up by institutions and active fund managers as there is a drastic shift from active to passive management over the last few years.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/pq1b3fbppvl71.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=699fc8dd9d5f2dee76f47e6f02763c8b352084b6)

The above chart from Morningstar showcases that active funds on average lost more than $150B every year over the 2014-18 period and this trend is only becoming worse for the active funds. This trend is also replicated worldwide with more than $300B is pulled out of active funds and $500B is pushed into index funds every year (as of 2016).

Finally, as of 2019, for the first time, more money is being pushed into passive than active funds! All of this must be ringing alarm bells across active funds as their income is directly dependent on the total asset under management.

**Alternatives to index funds**

While researching this topic, I came across some genuine concerns about index funds. The most important of them being that you might not be as diversified as you expect investing in an index fund.

As of Aug 2021, the top 5 tech stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN & FB) account for more than 23% of the S&P500! While this worked out great for the overall index over that last decade given the tech rally, any long-term downturn for tech stocks will significantly affect your portfolio.

There are two alternatives that I found to the regular market cap based index fund allocation

[Equal-weighted index funds](https://www.lynalden.com/equal-weighted-index-funds/): Equal-weighted index fund allocates your capital equally across the stocks in the given index. For Eg. in S&P500 index, all the 500 companies would get an equal proportion of your index. This will avoid your portfolio becoming concentrated on a few highly overvalued stocks!

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ikn5px2rpvl71.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff145127fe86a728e0ebd0663d8566341163aa3a)

[Reverse weighted index funds:](https://www.etftrends.com/smart-beta-channel/an-etf-that-beats-sp-500-by-turning-it-upside-down/) This one is for the more adventurous, where the investments are made by turning S&P500 upside down on its head! The smallest companies on the list get the largest share of investment! Even though this reduces your exposure to large tech stocks and blue-chip companies (which get a lot of attention and is possibly overvalued), your investments will be concentrated on smaller companies that are inherently volatile and can produce outsized returns! Even though this strategy has beaten the traditional index returns, you still have to consider that this type of fund was introduced [just two years ago](https://www.barrons.com/articles/sp-500-index-fund-reverse-weighting-51557430544).

**Conclusion**

I believe that the index fund bubble narrative is over-blown and is being predominantly driven active fund managers who are trying to stop losing their business to the passive funds every year. All the data from our research shows that we are nowhere near a situation where index funds can alter the price discovery in any significant way!

While the index fund bubble might be getting undeserved attention, it's always a good thing to check if you are comfortable with the current skewness of your portfolio towards tech stocks. After all, the tech rally over the last decade has undoubtedly benefitted all our portfolios, but we should also be ready for when the party inevitably comes to a close!

Until next week :)

**Footnotes**

\[1\] This is the first time in an analysis where I cannot claim to be unbiased as a substantial portion of my portfolio (>90%) is tied up in an index fund. So take all the arguments with a grain of salt!

\[2\] *Setting the record straight: Truths about indexing* is an excellent study done by Vanguard in 2018 where they review the rationale for indexing’s efficacy, quantify the benefits of indexing to investors, clarify the definition of indexing, and explore the validity of claims that indexing has an adverse impact on the capital markets.

\[3\] This study also showcases that ETF trading (creation/redemption mechanism of exchange-traded funds (ETFs)) has minimal impact on the underlying securities as only 6% of the trading is involved in primary market trading with the rest being in the secondary market.

\[4\] This is also known as the Grossman-Stigliztz paradox:- There would be a point where indexing would become big enough to affect price discovery, then active managers would be able to profit off that, and more and more people would move to the active funds. Finally, in an efficient market, an equilibrium point would be reached where neither party (index funds or active fund managers) would be able to beat each other."

Phones, TVs, tablets, Keyboards, Key fobs, cars... ETC

Many things in this world require semi conductors! Its only a thriving technological world. I am a salesperson at a Large FCA Store (Stellantis) Dealership in the midwest, and we are sitting on less vehicles today for sale in September, 2021 than we had in July, 2021.

**Ram trucks factories are shut down right now. Ford trucks are 6 months out. If you want to order a new Cadillac Escalade, expect your new Cadillac to be manufactured next Summer!**

With rising demand in Electronics TSMC says has begun construction at its Arizona chip factory site. **June 1** (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW) (TSMC) has started construction at a site in Arizona where it plans to spend $12 billion to build a computer chip factory, its chief executive said on Tuesday.

[https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3146266/arizona-group-courts-taiwanese-chip-companies-new-agreement-following](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3146266/arizona-group-courts-taiwanese-chip-companies-new-agreement-following)

&#x200B;

I think we may see a rise in Semi Conductors in the years to come. Everything that requires a button in your car, fire stick remote controller, xbox controller, keyboard etc... requires a semi conductor.

The problem with the vehicle shortage is that the vehicle manufactures planned to schedule less chips in February 2021 for the vehicles of 2021 sales. They thought they would sell less vehicles this year because of the Covid, however, earlier this year, things opened and mask came off.  The car manufactures decided to instead order the same amount of chips as they usually do yearly, but the orders were already booked for other manufactures that needed chips. This is why you dont see a shortage in Smart phones, and computers, or TVS. The chip factories are producing chips for them first now before they can produce for car manufactures. It isn't because of a covid factory shut down...

This gives me reason to believe that demand will only increase for Semi Conductors and since TSM holds the most market in this area and they can generally control pricing.

This shows that the demand of current electrical devices int he world is actually far greater than we expected!

Today i bought 100 calls, (2 days after earnings) purchase and am expecting more long term purchased investments into this company. I expect better than expected earnings, because last week, a representative said that we can expect order tightness of conductors to follow into next year.

IF you look at the earnings chart, each quarter they have gone closer to matching expected earnings, and this next earnings should either be the same or better than expected.

The producer of conference-room products and office headsets is recovering after a merger. And its stock is inexpensive. 
By Eric J. Savitz 

This should be a magical moment for Plantronics, the producer of conference-room products and office headsets, better known as Poly. 

With a gradual return to the office, there is expected to be a surge in ""hybrid meetings"" -- mixing in-person and virtual participants. Poly CEO Dave Shull estimates that there are about 50 million conference rooms globally, and that 10% or less are equipped for videoconferencing. That is a huge potential opportunity for Poly (ticker: POLY) and its competitors. 

Shares of Poly, meanwhile, have been driven down to bargain-basement levels by the fallout from an ill-fated merger three years ago. At a recent $32, the stock now trades for about 0.7 times anticipated revenue for the March 2023 fiscal year, and just under eight times projected profits for the same period. 

In comparison, Logitech International (LOGI), which has an overlapping set of products, trades for about 3.2 times revenue and 22 times projected profits for the same period. 

At such deeply discounted levels, investors willing to be patient could reap rich rewards as a turnaround gets underway at Poly."

This honestly leads us to wonder when the next ATH will be, when will $AAPL hit 155, 160? $AAPL reached ATH recently near $151\~ range and seems to be consolidating for now.

While looking at open interests on AAPL options today, I noticed a whopping volume of 210k for 9/17 150c volume. Are the hedgies or MM's blasting $AAPL up to new ATH soon?  Yes even though $AAPL's trading average is 70\~80M shares per day, an influx of 150 ITM calls will create 21M more shares that need to be covered. (Not including the other weeklies 150c's) That's 1/3\~1/4 of the daily average. I strongly believe that if there is a major push to $150 on $AAPL, $AAPL can finally retest ATH.

The bad, company has been around for 20 some years and poor revenue each year making most call it an overvalued shit stock, but I figure if the DOD is paying Microsoft $20bn for a military version of the Hololens (IVAS) then their tech must be good, which should translate over to their automotive lidar. If you then compare their market cap vs other speculative lidar companies market caps then they start to seem undervalued, having the NED technology is just an added bonus.

Anyhow this post was less of a DD as others have gone to much greater extents explaining the value of this company and their tech, my main reason posting is to share my bet in the open then come mid Sept we can all see it play out for better or for worse.

Oh almost forgot, MVIS will be at a mobility conference in Germany Sept 7-12 where they'll publicly demo their lidar units for the first time, claiming best in class, addressing SWAP-C and OEM / Tier 1 needs.

Oh one more, MVIS couldn't acknowledge MSFT as being their customer until the last EC when it was announced due to NDA. Why the sudden change? Well if the NED vertical was in the process of being sold off to MSFT then trying to hide it doesn't really matter anymore. Drew Markham joined MVIS 3 months ago as general counsel with decades of M&A experience. I expect the vertical sold and nice one time dividend coming within the next 3-6 months.

Dominated by mommies! Over 71% of their user base is Female and maintains a competitive edge among its competitors with 454 MILLION monthly active users. This might be the only chance you get to be THIS close to hot single moms in your AREA!! So sit down, pop a breath mint because your breath stinks, and enjoy the DD. 

Is Pinterest even popular? Why don’t you start asking MOMS! Pinterest is where all Mommies gather! They can spend all their time visually searching countless ideas related to fashion, cooking, decor, art, dream cars / houses, even new wedding ideas for her 3rd try at marriage. One concept that has worked for Pinterest is bringing a positive mindset to social media. In other words, it’s a safe place from those drunk 1 AM snaps or those 3 AM lonely DM attempts. Besides PINS being an online oasis from negativity on social networks, it also allows users to shop, pretend they’re creative, and feel inspired daily.

Why PINS ad revenue is superb. Pinterest’s primary source of revenue is from promotional ad pins that hide in plain sight. These ads are blended in when users search the site for ideas. These promotional ads are tailored specifically to the things you search for. The ads look the same as the pins / images you browse so it is very easy to click on the ads without thinking (mommy brain) and even purchase the product (with your husbands credit card) All this helped PINS generate that whooping $1.6 billion revenue they made for 2020. Women be shopping so it’s not surprising Pinterest has become the go to social media site for impulse shopping and mindless ad viewing.

Now, can Pinterest bounce? boobs. Currently at a share price of $56 ish and peaking in the $90 range, slow American user growth has caused the price to tumble recently. Yet, their financials and international user growth continues to grow and is quite impressive! The positives for PINS are the main reasons why Microsoft thought they were worth it and wanted to acquire them for $51 billion, Cathie Wood (the stock market’s #1 mommy) holds a $9M position in her fund, and the collaboration with Shopify. Pinterest has built a strong platform that can continue to win in the social media category.

Pinterest is used when moms want to spend their money; planning a wedding, trip, party, or other stay at home mom interests. This makes the app a prime place for advertisers to market. Advertisers get an excellent ROI when they convert users to customers which keeps them coming back to advertise on the platform. 

In conclusion, I think the recent pullback in price makes PINS a Mommy Makeout Play! I believe in the power of all moms to keep the growth of Pinterest very strong LONG TERM! Including but not limited to, stay at home moms, single moms, hot moms, soccer moms, and even your mom."

Just last week I learned how to read, write and do math so sorry for possible mistakes. Nevertheless, I believe Avepoint (AVPT) will fly again and I think it has a 50% upside potential over the next year. This is not a stupid pump n dump play and I would really hope not to see idiots gambling on AVPT and then blaming ""short ladder attacks"" if it goes down.

Every ticker after ""deSPACKing"" has suffered. Lucid went down from 56 to 21, PTRA from 28 back to its NAV price of 10, BARK from 18.5 to 7.31. Avepoint (AVPT) from 16.5 to below 9.66 as of writing.

Avepoint has been in business for 20 years and is the largest independent software vendor of SaaS solutions to migrate, manage and protect data in Microsoft 365. It has offices in the US, Canada, Australia, South Africa, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, Japan, Singapore, and China.

2 weeks ago Avepoint reported their Q2 earnings. They managed to beat the estimates once again:

· Total Revenue of $45.3 million, up 38% year-over-year

· SaaS Revenue of $20.6 million, up 76% year-over-year

· Non-GAAP Operating Income of $3.3 million;

You would expect a stock price to go up when it beats earnings, especially, if it trades below its former net asset value (NAV). Well unfortunately (or fortunately, if you are trying to accumulate) the stock went South together with all the other de-spac companies after their mergers.

They expect further growth for the Q3: total revenues between $51.5 and $53.5 million and annual 2021 revenues of about $200 million. That means they are trading at just 8.8 P/S of 2021 with an annual growth of 38%. And if we project at least a 30% until 2025, that would mean their revenues would reach $571 million. Given that they are a SAAS company, that sounds excellent and way better than industry average.

Given that their business is based on a long term relationship with Microsoft, as Azure is growing, AvePoint will continue to grow as well. Therefore, Avepoint should be considered a long term investment. It’s market capitalization of less than 2 billion does bring volatility, however, the future outlook is green.

There are 5 analyst [ratings](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=AVPT) and all of them are a ""BUY"". They have an average price target of $15 per share and the highest price target was given by Goldman Sachs ($17).

Unlike PLTR, where insiders have been selling heavily, AVPT CEO just last week purchased additionally $936k worth of shares himself. That shows strong conviction in the company and that he believes the shares are undervalued.

˝Intel said Monday it had landed a U.S. Department of Defense pact for an undisclosed sum to manufacture advanced microchips through its contract-manufacturing unit for the first phase of a broader program.˝

First phase of a broader program...

Finally somebody figured out that having most of microchips being produced on an island that China has a hard on for isn't the best idea.  

As part of governments ˝made in America˝ program Intel will invest in new factories in Arizona and expand existing capacity. 

On Taiwan they screwed over Apple and AMD and booked most of TSMC's 3nm capacity for the next year.

In Q1 2022 they will also release their new gpus. Rumors say that Intel's top of the range gpu is on par with Nvidia's 3070. 

If they manage to pull that one of and flood the market with a decent number of graphic cards - they will be flying to the moon just based on that one.  

Plus generally speaking they are swimming in cash.

Yeah I know this post is a bit gay and requires reading one linked article but I just had to post some fucking alternative to endless stream of posts about fucking BABA - a company that can be fucking delisted with one snap of Xi's fingers.

Everybody is talking about how cheap $160 BABA is and I'm just here facepalming at endless stream of people basically giving away their money to Xi.

- New IPO (Dec 2020).
- Seeking to disrupt a huge market ($4.2 trillion).
- They have the best tech in the space, with a 9 year lead in lending AI/ML (very good moat).
- Exceptional leadership, with founders being high level Google execs who left to start the company.
- Incredible financial results reported in their Q2'2021, growing +10x as much as the likes of TSLA.
- No fear of regulation as they have a ""No Action"" letter from US government body.
- Still at the very tip of their growth journey, having only 4% market share of the unsecured personal loan space = massive growth runway.

I've also made a video about this review, if like me you're more of a visual learner, and can get over my monotonous voice feel free to watch my video on [Why You Should Own Upstart](http://youtube.com/watch?v=rartz8VcWjw).

# Intro

I've been heavily reading up on [Upstart](https://www.upstart.com/) for the last few months, and I believe we're looking at a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here (despite being up [362.37%](https://www.google.com/search?q=upst&rlz=1C5CHFA_enGB885GB885&oq=upst) since IPO already). From everything I've read about the technology, leadership and market and competition, I think we're looking at a future tech behemoth currently hiding in plain sight. 

I've compiled my notes in the report below, if you need the *executive degen TLDR*, or prefer visual notes you can head straight to the bottom.

# Company History

Borrowing & lending is a practice as old as time. Our economies are based on borrowing be it at government level, institutional level, or even at the individual level. Whats mind-blowing is that borrowing and lending remained largely the same for the last [5000 years](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9780230554511_1). The problem Upstart set out to solve is the question of how to quantify the borrower's risk of defaulting. In simple terms, there are a lot of ""[good borrowers""](https://www.upstart.com/about#credit-limits-2) out there, but lenders generally have a hard time identifying them using current systems which are [old and dated](https://www.fico.com/25years/). So just like shopping (AMZN, SHOP..etc), EV (TSLA) and consumer tech (AAPL),  consumer lending, a [$4.2 trillion market](https://www.notion.so/361e12bb766a4ad0bd38ffbd2ce37169), was due a massive tech disruption (UPST).

Key dates:

- Founded in 2012
- [Pivoted](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2014/05/23/why-upstart-abandoned-education-crowdfunding-to.html) from its initial niche (crowdfunding loans) to the larger [$84b](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomtaulli/2021/08/13/upstart-can-ai-kill-the-fico-score/) market of personal loans in 2014.
- Entered the auto-lending market in [2020](https://www.upstart.com/blog/introducing-ai-enabled-auto-loans?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_LfWzrC0S2PevMQ6xYcT2HwpIxXCbBEE0HeX9COT3a78-1629740458-0-gqNtZGzNAyWjcnBszQ-R)
- [IPOed](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/upstart-prices-ipo-at-20-for-market-cap-of-1-45-billion-11608092379) late 2020

# Leadership

The story of Upstart is quite unusual. The company was founded by three people with diverse backgrounds expertises, and even generations. Dave Girouard was the [former head of Google Enterprise](https://venturebeat.com/2012/03/16/googles-president-of-enterprise-dave-girouard-is-leaving-to-launch-his-own-startup/), and before that he was an executive at Apple. His co-founders are Anna Counselman, the former [manager of Online Sales & Operations](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2013/12/06/silicon-valley-40-under-40-anna.html) at Google and Paul Gu, a university student who dropped out of the computer science program at Yale to start the company (also a [Thiel Fellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiel_Fellowship)). For a founding story, its unusual for three people to come together and decide to build a company on the spot. But 9 years later, they are still at the helm of a profitable and disruptive company. 

# Upstart's Business

Upstart's business caters to two distinct segments: [Individuals](https://www.upstart.com/personal-loans) and [banks](https://www.upstart.com/for-banks).

Their offerings to individuals consist of a variety of personal loan products, examples of these include:

- Credit card and Debt consolidation loans
- Home improvement loans
- Medical loans
- Wedding loans
- and Moving loans

For banks, Upstart offers its AI technology as a way for banks to improve their archaic lending processes. This is kind of genius because instead of competing with banks, Upstart [partners with them and complements their services](https://vimeo.com/489878274). Studies completed with several  US banks suggested that Upstart’s model [could approve almost three times](https://www.upstart.com/about?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_52250deb9dc2f9889c94cd45e31c286d7522a9f8-1629210053-0-gqNtZGzNAuKjcnBszQvO#results-to-date)  the number of borrows at the same loss rate as traditional models, as well as make a reduction of 75% in defaults at the same approval rate, this is unprecedented in the lending business.

## The Problem

At the moment, [90% of the top lenders in the United States use FICO scoring](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-fico-score/) to assess credit-worthiness, this is a scoring system first developed in 1989 which is comprised of five components:

- Payment history
- Amount owed
- Length of credit history
- How many times someone has applied for new credit
- The variety of credit products you currently have

## The Solution

This old scoring system prevents many people from getting loans at a reasonable rate. By comparison, Upstart leverages [1600 different data points](https://vimeo.com/492637158) [fast forward to 05:35]  that have been trained on more than 10 million repayment events to reach decision within seconds. This machine learning model continues to get more effective as it processes more repayment data [!!]

And this is Upstart's competitive edge. Their AI and machine learning models facilitate *better* borrower selection and provides both *higher* approval rates as well as *lower* interest rates for customers. The numbers here are staggering: tested Upstart models were found to approve [26% more borrowers than traditional models whilst yielding 10% lower average APRs for approved loans](https://www.upstart.com/about?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_cDRNu2tNRiO1uogDDmRKdDE3YeeO2hfOn4Xr6m5gmrU-1629741551-0-gqNtZGzNAuWjcnBszQzR#results-to-date). This expands access to prime credit, which is great for customers (but its also great for banks as they would approve almost **twice** as many borrowers with fewer defaults). This is a [win win](https://leadersinlending.sounder.fm/episode/hybridized-banking-system-jeff-keltner?page=2) [start at 03:00] situation for both lenders and customers seeking credit, absolutely mind-blowing!

Upstart's AI also increases automation throughout the lending process for banks and institutional buyers. To illustrate this point they recently reported that [71% of their loans were instantly approved and fully automated](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) -[page. 4] - with no need for document uploads, calls or waiting! 

Upstart is using state-of-the-art AI technology to disrupt:

- [$84B unsecured personal loan market](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) [p.6] (already working product, ~4% of the market).
- $635B auto-loans market [also p.6] (just acquired Prodigy, a leader in this space).
- $4.2T US consumer credit market [also p.6]

## How Upstart makes money

From page 101 of Upstart's [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1647639/000119312520313385/d867925ds1a.htm):

> Upstart’s revenues are primarily earned in the form of three separate usage-based fees, which can be either dollar or percentage based depending on the contractual arrangement. We charge our bank partners a referral fee of 3% to 4% of the loan principal amount each time we refer a borrower who obtains a loan. Separately, we charge bank partners a platform fee of approximately 2% of loan value each time they originate a loan using our platform. These fees are contracted for and charged separately, although they are generally combined for accounting purposes as they usually represent a single performance obligation. We do not charge the borrowers on our platform any referral, platform or other similar fees for our loan matching services.

> We also charge the holder of the loan (either a bank or institutional investor) an ongoing 0.5% to 1% annualized servicing fee based on the outstanding principal over the lifetime of the loan for ongoing servicing of the loan. Taken together, these fees represented 98% of our revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. In addition, we earn a small portion of our revenue from interest income and our securitization activities.

## The Competition

Another point that makes the case for Upstart's future growth is just how far ahead they are from the competition. As an example the scoring methodology used by Goldman Sachs, the underwriting partner of Apple responsible for Apple Card, has been the subject of much public scrutiny and criticism in a number of recent high profile cases. One example being the case of David Hansson the creator of Ruby on Rails who in late 2019 received [20x the credit limit of his wife despite sharing the same financial ability](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/14/how-the-law-got-it-wrong-with-apple-card/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE57fF0YBl-DFkXQ2li8zbbzDR75qwiW-PyKPzfrssfgJSecSj9o_GV8iZ5SNYQlRythx0XAAqN5CTuqpV6sAoDun3fsn4ohmiBUHrqN6ooT-_fgbOIcVN4wr9C4fQrbE26BqXrhl6ttnT1xTpUKj2GUkFzf4dKoCaNFGjiOSL1t). Another more recent example is when the CEO of Cloudflare, Mathew Prince [applied for an Apple card and received credit limit of only $4500](https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1426552810896871435?s=20) at a rate of 21.99% APR, [despite being worth $4.2 billion](https://www.forbes.com/profile/matthew-prince/#:~:text=REAL%20TIME%20NET%20WORTH&text=Matthew%20Prince%2C%20CEO%20of%20Cloudflare,Microsoft%2C%20Baidu%20and%20Qualcomm%20Ventures.)!

These examples may appear trivial, and they are.. after all we are discussing billionaires being denied credit, but they are high-profile examples of the competition's inferior AI offerings. Besides, the questions and concerns around lending and borrowing in the age of artificial intelligence are very much real, and touch upon very important questions about access and fairness, an aspect of Upstart's offering that is quite compelling. [Listen to Jeff Keltner](https://leadersinlending.sounder.fm/episode/digital-lending-sam-sidhu?page=3) [47:20], Upstart's head of Business development touching on Upstart's effectiveness as a fair lender:

# Financials

To better understand how the business of Upstart is doing, lets take a look at their [most recent earnings report of the second quarter of 2021 published just about a week ago on August 10](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347), I will preface this by saying that its one of the best earning reports I've ever read! 

- **Revenue:** In the 2nd quarter of 2021 Upstart reported revenue of **$194 million**, this is an increase of - get this-  **1,018%** from the second quarter of 2020 [!!!]. I can not stress how impressive this is, even by growth stocks standards, you simply dont see numbers like this everyday!

    To illustrate just how out of this world Upstart's revenue growth is, lets look at revenue growth reported by other more popular degen-type growth stocks for the same quarter: 

    - **[Tesla reported revenue](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/ZBOUYO_TSLA_Q2_2021_Update_DJCVNJ.pdf?xseo=&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22q2_2021.pdf%22) of** $11.69 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of **98%**.
    - **[SoFi reported revenue](https://s27.q4cdn.com/749715820/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/SoFi-Earnings-report_FINAL_081221_4.pdf) of** $231.3 million, representing a year-over-year increase of **101%**
    - **[Shopify's reported revenue](https://s27.q4cdn.com/572064924/files/doc_presentations/2021/07/Shopify-Investor-Deck-Q2-2021.pdf) of** $1.12 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 57%
    - **[Palantir reported revenue](https://investors.palantir.com/files/Palantir%20Q2%202021%20Business%20Update.pdf) of** $376 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 49%
    - **[Fiverr reported revenue](https://s23.q4cdn.com/749308338/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2_2021-Fiverr-Shareholder-Letter_FINAL.pdf) of** $75.3 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 60%
    - **[Etsy reported revenue](https://s22.q4cdn.com/941741262/files/doc_presentations/2021/08/[FINAL-NAP]-Etsy-2Q-2021-Earnings-Presentation-V2.pdf) of** $529 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 23%

    ...etc etc, I can go on. 

    Even if you account for this improvement being partly due to COVID, looking at the results sequentially you still see an improvement of 60% from $121 million in the first quarter of 2021 to $194 million in the second quarter. No matter how you look at it this is an incredible result.

- Transaction Volume Growth was up **69%**

    Upstart's bank partners originated 286,864 loans, totaling $2.80 billion, this is up 1,605% from the same quarter of the prior year. Conversion on rate requests was 24% in the second quarter of 2021, up from 9% in the same quarter of the prior year.

- **Income from Operations:** Income from operations was $36.3 million, up from ($11.4) million the prior year.
- **Contribution Profit:** Contribution profit was $96.7 million, up **2,171**% from in the second quarter of 2020, with a contribution margin of 52% compared to a 32% contribution margin in the second quarter of 2020.
- **Adjusted EBITDA**. Adjusted EBITDA was $59.5 million, up from ($3.1) million in the same quarter prior year.

In terms of financial outlook for 2021, Upstart expects:

- **Revenue of approximately $750 million (they have essentially raised guidance by $150 million since their previous report guided for $600 million)**
- **Contribution Margin of approximately 45% (vs prior guidance of 42%)**
- **Adjusted EBITDA Margin of approximately 17% (vs prior guidance of 10%)**

***Sirs, do you get it?***

I cant overstate how incredible these results are. As I was listening to the earnings conference call, I caught an amusing moment when the Director of Equity Research for Bank of America could not help but address the fact that he has never seen a four-digit growth figure reported in his career.. [have a listen yourself](https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/gn5dbj7b) [35:40]. 

What the bank of America analyst correctly pointed out was that Upstart managed to achieve such incredible levels of growth at a time when the personal loan market across the United States was actually down.

# Risks:

- In terms of risks to investing in Upstart, one of the main issues facing the company is business concentration. Cross River Bank is Upstart’s most significant partner, [with fees received from the bank accounting for 60% of revenue](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1edgjPy-jXuIhvLSFLkuvTMXxMDt_Kq0R/view) [p.9]. Having a single customer generating such a big portion of your revenue is a serious risk for any business. The good news is that Cross River’s concentration of Upstart’s business has come down meaningfully over the last year from 79% to the current 60%. The hope is that, increased Upstart partnership with other banks will diversify its funding base and thus reduce concentration risk.
- Another risk is increased [regulations](https://gfycat.com/coldcanineeyas-nate-dogg-regulator-warren-g) or legal scrutiny that can stop or restrict Upstart's AI models. This is obviously a real risk, particularly given how new AI lending is. The good news is that Upstart received a [no-action letter](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-issues-no-action-letter-facilitate-use-artificial-intelligence-pricing-and-underwriting-loans/) from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that essentially guarantees no supervisory or enforcement action against Upstart for the next few years.

## Future

- In terms of Upstart's future plans for expansion, the company plans to target the $635 billion Auto lending market. [They've already expanded to 47 states](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) (up from 33 states last quarter), thus having access to more than 95% of the US population. They've also increased their dealership footprint by 24% sequentially this quarter.

    But their biggest move in the auto lending space has to be the [acquisition of Prodigy Software](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2021-03-17/upstart-to-acquire-prodigy-software-a-leading-automotive-retail-software-provider) which is a leader in the automotive retail software space. Paul Gu, the co-founder of Upstart describes **Prodigy as the"" Shopify for car dealerships""** .

    Through acquisition of Prodigy Upstart was able to generate vehicle sales of over $1 billion this quarter, another very impressive result. They also already have five bank partners signed up for auto lending on their platform.

- Recently, Upstart filled a newly created [General Manager of Mortgage position](https://twitter.com/saxena_puru/status/1426859770833637380). This signals early stages of offering a mortgage product which would mean entry to a massive $2.5 trillion dollar category.

To conclude this section on the future of Upstart, I will leave you with [a short clip](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1697077/8693359-investing-in-ai-episode-10-dave-girouard-from-upstart?client_source=twitter_card&player_type=full_screen) of Upstart's CEO discussing how the company is setting out to be the biggest player in AI lending in the world. My main takeaway from this interview was just how early we are to the Upstart story [23:45].

# Putting my money where my mouth is

In short, [YES](https://streamable.com/73pefs). I am a mere mortal so no over the top yolos. I mainly invest in growth stocks and have recently been adding to my Upstart position like crazy, taking it from 11% to around 30% of my portfolio. 

# Conclusion

Upstart reminds me so much of Shopify at the beginning of its growth-spurt, in the sense that it is a future giant hiding in plain sight. Do your own due diligence on the company before making any investments, but after many many hours of consuming every bit of data I can get on the company, I believe it will a massive success over the next 5 years, and we will all look back and wonder why we didnt invest enough.

This is a once-in-a-life-time opportunity imho.

If you've read all of that I salute you friend!"

It’s got Peter Thiel (ROTH IRA gang) and Karp at the helm, two really smart and patriotic guys, who know what they’re doing. The IBM partnership was huge in expanding the private sector growth, adding almost 3000 to the sales team. There’s an ever growing log of government contracts meaning they have steady revenue.

Palantir’s retail investors are also a class of their own and Karp recognizes this as noted in one of his recent interviews. This I think is huge in cultivating an investor base that will buy, hold, and believe for years to come. It’s currently my largest holding and I only expect to be that way for the foreseeable 5-10 years. I have no intention of letting a single share go no matter how long boomers keeps it down.

Every other day there’s news of a new or renewed contract. One day it will be too much to ignore. Wall Street has either been too lazy to understand the company or, if they have done the research, they’re too stupid to act on it. At least Cathie Woods knows what she sees, currently owning over $872M of it...This is going to be her next Tesla call.

Constantly, being bashed by analysts but being scooped up by the same banks? Come on now, once these jamokes are done loading the boat and the upgrades come out its game over.

Karp and Thiel added over $57m in gold and they are pro digital currencies so that's a plus. No debt and \~2.4B cash on hand.

They are aiming to be Skynet...make of that what you will.

On the TA side of things, it's forming higher bases but bases none the less. The longer the base the longer the explosion to the upside. Once this gets hot the lid is coming off and this is gonna blow.

This is the options chain for the calls expiring this week.  3200 was clearly a significant number, and AMZN closed at 3199.95.  That's fucking hilarious.  Someone clearly wanted it below that number.

&#x200B;

The daily chart makes it pretty obvious that it's bottomed out.   3180 has been a crucial level many times in the past.  This level is also the point of control, which is where most of the volume has occurred in recent history.  These high volume areas are institutional buying.

&#x200B;

We probably should have corrected more this week, at least to the 50 day moving average for SPY.  That would've been healthy, and it seemed like it tried to every day.  If you made money this week, well done, because I definitely got trapped.  Microsoft just kept popping, along with the rest of big tech except for AMZN.  The fact that every dip was bought up like nothing(especially Monday, what the fuck was that shit) means were probably going higher.  But big tech, the linchpin of the financial world right now, is stretched pretty thin with the exception of AMZN.  I think MSFT cools off next week, and AMZN pumps to keep us painfully churning here.

Position: 8/27 3215c

I'll gladly take a 30 day ban if I'm wrong, but I want a flair if I'm right.   Also, I'm not saying its going to run back to all time highs.  I'm saying it'll bounce from the selling pressure being exhausted for the time being.  Looking for a bounce to 3350 in the short term.  After that, no clue.  It'll probably continue its downtrend."

p7pqpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p7pqpp/all_in_paysafe/,ALL IN PAYSAFE,128,62,2021-08-20 06:58:27,"I saw alot of DD on Paysafe that got me interested on Paysafe. Just to share my alternate DD, not on projections but valuations. How is Paysafe so much undervalued compared to other spacs. Bill Foley took paysafe public at a valuation of 9B with 4B debt. This valuation was conservative as Paysafe did not have any growth in 2020 due to Covid.

2B of the money was used to pay the debt which means investors got a good deal at $10 with market cap at 7B. Which means either Bill Foley paid 2 billion more or blackstone received 2 billion less. Either way, investors got a 2B discount. Fast forward to now, the market cap is at 6 billion with revised upwards guidance for the year at 1.55b compared to 1.5b, with 23% growth excluding divested business. This is impressive as in just over a year, they grew from 0 growth to 23% growth and increasing their operating income margins from 10+% to over 30%, helping them to their first ever net positive income quarter.

However, as we know shorts attacked it just as any SPACS. What separates it from other SPACS was the valuation initially at 9B was already undervalued unlike many clean energy SPACS which has lofty valuation and unrealistic projections. Paysafe was projected base on 0 growth in 2020, and a mere 10% annual growth.

Furthermore, given many recent fintech acquisition such as square acquiring of afterpay is upwards of 20x revenue. FB and Paypal have both indicate they see the digital wallet segment as a game changer, whereby Paysafe is already a established player in the segment for 10 years and is still further growing due to igaming. Microvision being a rumored acquisition for microsoft sustain its p/s ratio at over 800. In comparision, Paysafe p/s ratio is now under 4. I can assure you NONE of the SPACS out there has a p/s ratio under 10, with POSITIVE NET INCOME. 

The last confirmation that their stock is undervalued is management decision to acquire pagoefectivo and paysafety in an all cash deal as compared to recent acquisitions made by draftkings and square using solely stocks.

So why such a steep drop. It was up 10% premarket initially due to earnings beat. Look what I found. AGAIN SHORTS ARE COMING. Short interest is at 5% at 17M already reported at JULY 30TH with around 50% short volume daily. IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY BY NOW. DAILY volume on average is 4m which means any squeeze would require shorts 4 days to cover. THEY HAVE TO BUY AT LEAST 4 DAYS WORTH OF THE ENTIRE FLOAT TO COVER, JUST LIKE ANY OTHER SHORT SQUEEZES. 17m more shares already floating around. Share price would rocket further if shorts are forced to cover. PLUS many in the wsb community have already entered prior and are diamond handling now.

I am sure everyone have seen different analysis all putting its target price from 15 upwards to 45. USING BELOW EXAMPLE, THEY HAVE GROWTH, VALUATIONS, FINANCIALS TO BACK THE SQUEEZE WHERE NO INSTI WILL EXIT. Those who would, would have already exited. This is the best short squeeze play around in my opinion as shorts blindly attack it cause its a SPAC. 

Looking at a larger basket of comps with a collective growth rate of \~12.5% (not far from Paysafe’s minimum 10.6% projection) here are valuations based on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign among others:

Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09

EV/Rev ratio : $83.91

EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

After eliminating outliers with highest multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75

EV/Rev ratio : $44.64

EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average :$46.52

Notes:

1. Unlike Paysafe, around half of these competitors report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.
2. Used low end of Paysafe's projections and factored in debt and high-end of potential dilution.
3. As noted Paysafe’s 10.6% rev growth projection excludes planned inorganic M&A growth and projected 55% CAGR iGaming growth, which constitutes a third of their revenue.
4. The above comps were taken during a sector-wide pull-back and do not reflect recent fintech gains since Jamie Dimon’s ""enormous competitive threats"" comment.

This is not any financial advice, but I am just a nerd that all in on Paysafe at 8.2. Only when we unite, we become stronger and earn from short sellers.

Btw, Grasso tweeted and hes still holding for his 45 pt too.

# History of Nokia

If you've seen any of the recent Nokia posts over the last few months, a common comment you will see is: ""Nokia?!? That stock has been trading sideways for years!""

While yes that is true, it is important to understand why. Let's take a look.

**2000-2013**

Nokia dominated the mobile phone market during this time due to a quality handset. NOK traded in the $50s during the Dotcom bubble and in $30s before the housing crash. However, they never recovered after 2008 due to struggling to keep up in software as the mobile phone market started to shift to smart phones.

**2013-2019**

When Nokia realized that trying to stay in the phone space was a losing battle they sold their phone division to Microsoft in 2013. For the next 3 years, Nokia was a large company in disarray.

This did not get much better in 2016 when they acquired Alcatel-Lucent and decided to focus on networks. The merger did not go as smoothly as planned and over the next 5 years Nokia started ""trading sideways"" due to a bearish sentiment.

Some investors stuck around through all of this due to a dividend being paid out, but that was suspended in 2019 so Nokia could focus on developing its 5G mobile networks. This dropped the share price down to $3.50.

**2020-Present**

In March 2020, sentiment started to change somewhat bullish as they announced Pekka Lundmark would be taking over as CEO. Pekka worked for Nokia for a decade in the 90s and most notably served as Fortum's, a Finnish state-owned energy company, CEO from 2015 to 2020.

The bullish sentiment was shorted lived due to the pandemic crash dropping the share price to $2.42. It started to pick back up over the summer when it was announced that Pekka would take over a month earlier than planned.

This was followed by rumors that there was a chance Nokia could win Verizon's $6 billion 5G deal. Hype around this brought Nokia's price above $5 for the first time since they suspended their dividend in October 2019. But in September, it was announced that Samsung won the Verizon deal and NOK fell down to $3.78. It fell even further to $3.37 in October when the rest of the market saw a down swing.

Then it climbed back up to the low $4s, had a crazy January hitting $9.79 for about 10 seconds during to the meme stock frenzy, and has since returned to the high $3s low $4s after the Q4 earnings call.

**Pekka's Tenure**

Pekka has been in charge for 11 months during a global pandemic, but he has been able to make some progress it appears. Much of this information can be found in the Nokia 2020 Annual Report.

* He trimmed their employee size by 11,000.
* He improved their free cash flow to $2.6 billion.
* Even with the decrease in revenue he nearly doubled their operating profit (page 82).
* He drastically reduced their net deferred tax balance (page 175).
* He created four distinct business groups with plans for these groups to be shared in more detail during during Capital Markets Day on 3/18.
* He replaced Nokia's CFO, CTO, and CMO (CFO happened before he took over)
* It appears he issued new shares to leadership.
* Pekka has a stake in the company (page 67 of annual report) with a long term goal to ""Focus on increase in share price and restoration of the dividend"".
   * "" In addition, Mr. Lundmark received an award of EUR 1.3 million of restricted shares on joining to buy out the awards he forfeited on leaving his previous employer. Mr. Lundmark was invited to join the co-investment based long-term incentive arrangement (eLTI) targeted to engage senior leaders with the long-term nature of our business and share price, and purchased EUR 2.6 million of Nokia shares against which he was given a matching award of EUR 5.2 million of Nokia 2020 performance shares. This investment by Mr. Lundmark aligns him with shareholders from the start and is a sign of his commitment and engagement with the company. Delivery of actual Nokia shares would take place in 2023 subject to performance conditions""

# Bullish

Here is a list of 28 deals and partnerships Nokia has established since December 2020. Some of these deals are not massive, but they span across 6 continents.

**Largescale Network**

* 5 year Multi Billion Dollar T Mobile Deal
* 7 year Belgium deal
* Deutsche Telekom in Germany
* France's Mainland 5G Network
* 5G Network in Austria
* Telecom Italia
* Cibicom ISP in Denmark
* Polkomtel Phone Provider in Poland
* Telenor Group in Thailand
* Ooredoo in Algeria
* 5G Network in Philippines
* Tele2 in Sweden, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia
* Ecuador
* Vodafone in Australia
* Saudi Arabia
* Singapore

**Private 5G Deals**

* San Diego Gas &amp;amp; Electric Private Network
* Port of Seattle
* Japanese Companies Conexio, Hitachi Kokusai, Nippon Steel, Omron and Sharp
* WEG Motor Manufacturer in Brazil
* Elisa in Finland
* Optus Stadium in Australia

**Partnerships**

* Google Cloud
* EU's Hexa-X 6G Project
* Brazil's Telecommunications R&amp;amp;D Center
* AT&amp;amp;T tests to deploy virtualized and open RAN
* Patents deal with Samsung
* LG Uplus trial in South Korea
*Bell Labs

**5G is the Future**

The confusing nature of 5G could be holding back the market's valuation of Nokia. 

* Nokia is currently trading at a market cap of $22-23 billion even with a 2020 revenue of $24 billion.
* A letter that Pekka recently published gives a decent explanation of what 5G is.
   * In it, he admits ""\[5G\] is exciting, but it can seem a bit abstract."" But then goes on to describe some real world examples that really helps explain it.
   * ""Our partners saw unanticipated breakdowns and production line defects drop by 30% after installing smart video sensors in our manufacturing deployments. In the logistics sector, deploying augmented reality devices cut machine monitoring costs by half. In ports, remote-controlled cranes doubled productivity and eliminated staff injuries: an incredible 100% drop.""
* This seems to suggest that there may be more uses for 5G worldwide than cellular networks.
* Nokia released a study stating that 5G could have an $8 trillion impact on global GDP by 2030.
* Nokia and Ericcson may have a duopoly on 5G with Huawei and ZTE being banned in many countries. This trend may continue.
* Some analysts have predicted massive (&amp;gt;1,000%) growth in the 5G market over the next 5 years.

**Upcoming Events/Rumors**

* **Capital Markets Day (3/18/21)**
   * This is when we will get some true guidance on the future of the company. Not only will they lay out the strategic business plans for their 4 business segments as I mentioned above, but it should be when they make announcements toward potential a Dividend Reinstatement, Share Buyback, and future R&amp;amp;D decisions.
* **Annual General Meeting (4/8/21)**
   * Not sure what they plan to cover during this, but I would assume it will act as a follow up to Capital Markets Day
* **Dividend Reinstatement**
   * Most signs point to Nokia investing in R&amp;amp;D for a while, but based on Pekka's compensation package it should be back by 2023 at the latest.
* **Share Buyback**
   * Nokia did buy back 1.25 billion shares in 2015-16 and 1 billion shares in 2016-17. So the rumors they plan to do this again could be true. They can purchase up to a total of 550 million shares both this year and next year. 550 million because it correlates to 10% of the companies total outstanding shares.

# Bearish (Risks/Cons)

* The meme stock frenzy has a long-lasting impact on the opinion of this stock.
* The dividend is not reinstated for another 3+ years.
* Pekka does not have what it takes. Nokia is a sinking ship and cannot be turned around.
* FCF is used solely for R&amp;amp;D and no shares are bought back over the next three years. The float does turn out to be too big to move significantly.
* Nokia may not be undervalued and their revenue streams may continue to decline due to network share loses and pricing erosion.
* Pekka has been very serious over the last two earning calls and things are going to get much worse/challenging before they get better.
* With a new US administration in place, the trend of banning Huawei and ZTE that they started is lifted. These two competitors then undercut Nokia pricing.
* 5G is no where near as big of an industry as the experts predict. Covid continues to slow the rollout of 5G well past 2030.
* 5G is too confusing and never gets the buy in from today's investors.

Cowan Upgrades

Cowen Upgrades $NOK Citing Execution From New Ceo

Cowen adds its praise for quarterly results, upgrading the stock to Outperform.

From here, the demand environment looks to be ""very favorable,"" the firm says.

""What has changed is NOK's improving execution; we think upward trajectory is now clear and we expect meaningful incremental improvement from here, which while helping drive incremental revenue growth should especially help margin structure, and thereby EPS and cash flow,"" analyst Paul Silverstein says.

Meanwhile, Silverstein says CEO Pekka Lundmark is following the playbook of Borje Ekholm's dramatic turn-around of Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC); he's only one year in at Nokia and ""we think it is a safe assessment that further meaningful progress and attending upside lies ahead.""

Cowen has raised its target on Nokia to $8 from $5, now implying 31.6% upside.

Calls are also DIRT cheap, I think there is incredible growth over the long run AND the short term.

1. Recent Martech IPO
2. SaaS business model, 121 NRR
3. Small cap stock ($2.9 B) growing 40-50%
4. Attractive multiple valuation vs. competition with lots of opportunity to double
5. Leader in space with pricing power
6. No options sadly but maybe someone can ask?

**Introduction**

Semrush is a SaaS-based marketing tool that enables users to get detailed insights about their SEO, SEM, Social Media, Content, Display advertising. They are a leader in the space and have gotten many awards for their product offerings. They offer a number of subscriptions ranging from $99/month (annual price) to $375/month with add-ons such as additional seats or additional features that cost $50-200/month.

As someone who practices SEO and is very familiar with the space and their competition, I can definitely say SEM Rush is best in class and offers a robust suite of products that are incredibly beneficial for optimizing SEO & SEM. What's amazing about their product is that it's significantly cheaper than competitor offerings. Their average deal size is around $2,100/year which is ridiculous given how much value they provide their users. They have increased their pricing earlier this year and in the Q2 earnings call, they noted that churn was stable so far (still TBD of course).

Also, SEM Rush benefits from being a leader in the search space that continues to grow exponentially per Google and Microsoft's earnings calls. Their social media marketing solutions will also be helpful given the growth of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, etc.

**Product Leadership vs. Competition**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/khes87bhr5h71.png?width=1851&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e504cfe54d5887b9d4df2d69cc3276784e9bd2c

Per their Q2 earnings slide, this is where they see themselves vs. their competition. Of course, they are biased, but the awards they've earned, plus the recognition they've received confirms at least some of this promotional content. In addition, as someone who has used a number of the products listed in the above screenshot, SEM Rush is definitely a leader for sure in the space relative to its competition.

Other notable competitors in the space are:

\-BrightEdge  
\-Conductor  
\-Botify  
\-DeepCrawl

The reason I bring them up is that the above solutions are considered ""Enterprise SEO"" or ""Enterprise marketing"" solutions and thus have a starting package of $1,000+/month (i.e. 5-figure contracts), given SEM Rush's core offering, I think SEM Rush can continue to position themselves as a cost-efficient leader in the space and to investors, given where competition's pricing is at, SEM Rush will have some pricing power. I would say their closest competitor that offers similar product offerings at a reasonable price is Ahrefs and from what I'm reading, they are growing quickly too.

**Financials**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iusju9eyr5h71.png?width=590&format=png&auto=webp&s=032fdb5fb454584ea96b09e8e0df25e43743ff1d

As you can see this is a high-growth company that COVID has definitely helped accelerate too. They've accelerated revenue sequentially and their YoY revenue growth accelerated from 35% in 2020 to 45%+ in 2021. Moreover, their sequential guidance, assuming if they can beat and raise like they did last year, means that revenue could very well grow 50%+ this year and if they can continue to grow 8%+ sequentially, we should see a 35%+ growth year in FY 2022 on some already impressive growth figures.

**Gross Margin**

Gross Margins for the business have increased steadily from 2018 to present:

2018: 72.2  
2019: 75.5  
2020: 76.0  
Q2 '2021: 77.3

So this company has the potential to be very profitable with its continued margin expansion. Per their long-term targets, they hope to get GM to around 80%, so that's another 2%+. That's pretty impressive, even in the SaaS space.

**Operating Margins**

Their non-GAAP operating margins has continued to improve, where they started Q1'20 at -6% and the FY 2020 at -3.7%. In Q1 '21, they improved operating margins to 5.3% and in Q2 '21, they had operating margins of 1.2%. So they are definitely improving in this area esp. vs. last year which demonstrates their operating leverage and ability to achieve profitability. Moreover, their long-term operating margin target is 20%+.

**Net Revenue Retention**

As with any software company, net revenue retention is incredibly important since it helps fuel top-line revenue growth since existing customers are buying more (""land and expand"") and you continue to generate new business.

Their NRR in 2019 was 120%, in 2020 it was 114% largely due to COVID's impact in Q2 when everything was shut down and companies were getting lean. In Q1 '21 it was 116% and in Q2 '21 it was 121%. It seems that per the earnings call, management will continue to grow that figure with additional product offerings and add-ons.

Here's a graph from their S-1 about their existing cohorts:

**Customers**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r94iuwikr5h71.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5113b4f93f5490975b3f5979a88e16db42a40dee

They continue to grow their customer base at a decent clip, with Q2 '21 customers totaling over 76k customers this was a 29% increase YoY and 5.6% sequentially. This is definitely impressive growth and as long as they continue to ""land and expand"" it should continue to contribute to their revenue growth. In the earnings call, management noted that 10k+ ARR customers grew 50%, so they are definitely seeing some up-market momentum.

**Valuation**

As of yesterday's close, SEM Rush had a EV/S multiple of 16.06 this compares to other martech solutions such as Hubspot ($HUBS) with an EV/S of 28.3 and Sprout Social ($SPT) with an EV/S of 34.7. It appears SEM Rush is growing faster than both of these companies and thus is ripe for some multiple expansion if they can continue to grow their revenue at the rates we've seen recently. I personally think the market is still in a ""wait and see"" mode since this is a new IPO and has only had 2 earnings releases so far. If they beat and raise next quarter, I would expect some material multiple expansion, similar to what we saw with Asana ($ASAN) where it took them 3 earnings reports to grow from an EV/S of mid-20s to 50+ (I don't expect SEM Rush to attain a 50+ multiple, just saying that there is definitely an opportunity for multiple expansion as long as they demonstrate their ability to impress the market).

**Final Remarks**

I think SEM Rush is an attractive small-cap ($2.9 B market cap) with a large and expanding TAM ($20 B per their S-1) thanks to the likes of tech behemoths Google/Microsoft/Facebook. They continue to innovate with strong product offerings that provide tremendous value to marketers all around the world at a fair price.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Today, investors in UK-based electric vehicle (EV) startup Arrival (NASDAQ:ARVL) are seeing some pretty steep declines. In fact, shares of ARVL stock are currently down approximately 7% at the time of writing. Today’s price action seems to indicate investors are presently looking elsewhere for growth.

Source: BigPixel Photo / Shutterstock.com
However, there are a few catalysts long-term investors in this early stage EV company will like. Various catalysts saw shares of this de-SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) surge from its SPAC initial public offering (IPO) level of $10 to as high as $37 earlier this year on intense momentum among SPAC stocks. However, like many of Arrival’s de-SPAC peers, recent price action has not been favorable of late.

In fact, Arrival has lost more than two-thirds of its market value from its peak. Investors placing their bets on the EV sector appear to be focusing in on the bigger, more established players today. Accordingly, Arrival remains a high-risk, high-reward bet in the world of EV stocks.

That said, let’s dive into two key catalysts that could position ARVL stock for a nice run.

Two Catalysts Are the Key for Investors in ARVL Stock
Investors in ARVL stock are making a bet that this early stage EV company can hit its production targets. Today, executives told investors that the company is on track to begin production of its EV bus and van in 2022.

This is big news, as investors price in the timing of cash flows into their models. Any early stage EV company carries some level of execution risk. Investors betting on ARVL stock are essentially betting on the management team to do what they say they’re going to do. Indeed, this not only means on the production end of the equation but on the demand side as well. Investors are expecting updates on the company’s fulfillment plans for its key van order with UPS (NYSE:UPS). This order is expected to bring in more than $1 billion in revenue for Arrival.

Secondly, investors looking at ARVL stock will have to consider a key announcement the company made last week. Last Thursday, the company announced plans to partner with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on developing a cloud-based data platform for EV fleets. Given Microsoft’s backing for this project, many investors have begun to get excited about the technology angle with ARVL stock.

However, again, this comes back to execution. Investors seem to be waiting for tangible results on these projects before jumping aboard. Accordingly, it appears ARVL stock is one that’s likely to be volatile for some time, as investors price in these catalysts alongside operational risk.

So let me begin with some TA or as I like to call it SA (Stonk Astrology) 

[$AAPL 1 day 2 year chart](https://preview.redd.it/7xofx6igqog71.png?width=2306&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fbdf6d7840b1e2f3c51c6ed2a0910dbd8bdc6a8)

&#x200B;

 What am I looking at? You might be asking and that's a decent question. So let me explain first starting with the 1 day/ 2 year chart. This chart I'm using to show that Apple tends to have its run ups preceding earnings. On that note if you have ever been wondering why you always get IV crushed at earnings its because Apple is so reliably profitable and has grown so consistently throughout its life span that Wall Street tends to price in that Apple will meet or exceed expectations well before they actually announce. This tends to be the pattern for most of the mega cap stocks that are highly globalized and have monopolistic tendencies. (think: MSFT AMZN GOOGL probably). 

 This second graph is the more important one as it actually shows actionable data. If you direct your goldfish-like attention to the 1 hour 30 day chart you can take a look at some things that I have laid out. 

1.)  The orange lines: they form a triangle if you didn't notice that than you definitely shouldn't be trading stocks, but if you have gotten far enough to identify a triangle than you can probably handle the idea of a breakout. As these triangles form they general lead to a breakout from the triangle formation and on to higher, highs or lower, lows. that's it, not that hard to understand

2.) Purple Lines: Just a trace of the prices to better visualize the patterns forming 

3.) Blue Lines: Simple moving avg I set my 3 moving avgs. to 20, 50, and 200, When the cross or spread out  they can help identify downturns or breakouts respesctively. 

4.) Red Lines: this is a fib retracement which uses the fib. sequence to help identify support and resistance levels between the highs and lows of and stock and beyond. The fib. retractions are the most difficult to explain because simply put I literally have no idea why prices using fib. levels as support and resistance. That being said, my research indicated to me that no one else could really explain it either, whether or not prices actually act this way or since everyone uses fib sequences that we cause price to act that way. Either way I have found these work really well when Identifying support and resistance. 

 Studies: I'm just going to clump these into to the same category but these are the charts that you seen on the bottom first one is volume, second one is the ATR which is relative volatility, and MACD which helps indicate refeversals and RSI which helps identify overbought and oversold conditions 

 The trade: so what this chart is telling me is that $AAPL has been consolidating for some months and could break out to new highs. What I am going to do is buy the oct 15 $155 call or the sept 17 $155 call if you are feeling confident like me. Something important I forgot to mention above is that $AAPL's implied volatility is not only historically low but also below the historical one year avg. What this means is that not only will your call option increase in value due to the run up in price but the run up IV that is likely to happen will compound your gains. Why is this likely to happen simply the law of averages? 

&#x200B;

[$AAPL IV vs. historical IV ](https://preview.redd.it/n03w9whpzog71.png?width=1914&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2505c6046090849e450eb4a84371f36fcad1235)

 Couple of notes: first I am not a financial advisor just a dude with a hobby, second obviously TA is a good look into what has happened historically it doesn't guarantee that it will happen. That being said, if this TA begins to bring down I would look at the $143.50 level as confirmation and as for confirmation on the upside you should look for the previous high of $150. To make this trade successful you might want to consider staggering your buys instead of the traditional balls deep all at once. For an example I have already entered this trade with 10 shares at an avg. of $147 and a sep. 17 $155 call at the same price. I plan to buy more 155 calls for both sept and oct. as the price drifts up to $150 if all goes to plan I am looking at a pt of around $160 

TLDR: I thing this is the begining of the apples run up before q3 earnings sep 17 $155 calls 

Positions: 10 Shares at 147.50 1 Sept. 17 155 call"

""Nautilus raised a $76 million Series B round raised last year led by Vulcan Capital, the multi-billion-dollar holding company created by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Bezos Expeditions, the VC arm of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, also invested, along with Perceptive Advisors, Andreessen Horowitz, Madrona Venture Group, and others."" [from [this article](https://www.geekwire.com/2021/jeff-bezos-backed-startup-nautilus-biotechnology-set-go-public-via-spac-900m-valuation/amp/)]

Today trading was halted at least twice as shares spiked from $7.50 to around $11.50. Avg volume has been 180k and today was 28 Million! This was due to [this CNBC report](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/08/05/amazon-invested-millions-in-nautilus-biotechnology.html) that dropped today, some calling it a pump and dump, as shares quickly dropped under $9 once trading resumed. 


Goldman Sachs initiated [coverage](https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=18765251) yesterday with a neutral rating and $10 target. 


Also, mid-July, ""With a Buy rating, Jefferies initiated coverage on Nautilus Biotechnology Inc (NASDAQ:NAUT). The price target seems to have been set at $13.00 for Nautilus Biotechnology.""


Earnings are expected on August 10th. 


*So What Is It?*

From the cnbc article: ""Nautilus has built a prototype for a device that can measure the human proteome, a set of proteins in the body that, unlike the genome, is constantly changing based on food consumption and other factors.
Companies such as Thermo Fisher Scientific produce mass spectrometers, but those devices can be expensive and and only yield a small percentage of proteins from a drop of blood, Sujal Patel, co-founder and CEO of Nautilus, said in an interview. The company wants to become capable of measuring more than 95% of the proteome.
Organizations could use the system for drug discovery, as well as clinical diagnostics and precision medicine. In 2020 Roche-owned Genentech agreed to use Nautilus' system, and the companies plan to publish their research findings. Nautilus expects its first revenue in 2022 and is targeting a long-term operating margin of 25% to 30%. Patel, formerly co-founder CEO of data-storage hardware company Isilon, which EMC acquired in 2010 for $2.3 billion, said Nautilus will sell its instruments along and provide cloud-based software.""


The article continues with some of its uses. 


Personally, I've been tracking this company since last year, and was excited to finally be able to invest in them. I've lost about $1,000 in expired options, there's very little volume on average. I was hoping for a jump once they went public but oh well. I sold all my shares today for a profit at $11.50 (phew, those bags were getting heavy lol), then bought another hundred about an hour later at $8.75. I'll begin accumulating again. 


This is definitely a long term speculative play, but I think this is exactly the kind of ""disruptor tech"" that growth investors get excited for, and with their first earnings report next week on 8/10, the shares are looking pretty inexpensive at the moment. 


Good luck out there!

**Share buybacks** 

In February 2020, the Company's Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to **$600 million** of the Company’s outstanding shares of Class A common stock. In February 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional **$1 billion** of the Company's outstanding shares of Class A common stock. The Company completed the February 2020 stock repurchase program of up to $600 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021.  During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired 18.6 million shares of its Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $431.9 million. This includes $200.0 million in repurchases of 8.6 million shares of our Class A common stock in conjunction with the issuance of the Notes, which was outside of our stock repurchase program. 

Per the 2nd Quarter earnings conference call, they still have **$820 million dollars remaining to repurchase shares.**

**The elephant in the room**

Apple, Microsoft, and Google. People always bring them up so I figured id talk about it before one of you dumb fucks comments ""wHaT abOuT GoOglE Drrrrr."" 

They don't go after the same markets, Dropbox really goes after small to medium size businesses. This is their bread and butter. The other three fuckers go after larger size businesses. The cloud market is massive, there's room for all of them, especially when you consider that they have different client makeups. 

&#x200B;

**Last point**

If you haven't used Dropbox in a few years....you should. The products they are currently providing are fantastic. They have really focused on improving their services and it shows. 

&#x200B;

oyhfnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oyhfnb/get_rich_fastly_fsly_dd/,Get Rich Fast(ly) - $FSLY DD,16,35,2021-08-05 21:22:17,"Before I begin, it should be noted that I don't have a position in FSLY, but tomorrow I'm planning entering.  I'm primarily looking at shares (I've been fucked too many times with options...), but might also buy some longer DTE options as well as FDs.

# Part 0: Short Squeeze

This isn't the main reason I'm buying, but the short interest on $FSLY is definitely worth noting and is high enough to trigger a squeeze.  We're looking at about 20% short interest [\[1\]](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/fsly).  

# Part 1: Company Profile and Market Overview

Fastly is a cloud computing company.  One of their main services is a CDN, which is basically how you're able to load up anime titties 10 minutes before you go to sleep.  Additionally, they have some cybersecurity operations as well, coming from a subsidiary they acquired in August 2020 for about $700M (cash + stock).

Before getting into their numbers, I'd like to talk about their most recent earnings shitshow.  At time of writing, the stock is down almost 20% after some bad forward guidance.  For the full year of 2020 Fastly called for an adjusted loss of -$0.65 to -$0.57 EPS and revenue of $340 to 350m. This is against an original analyst expectation of -$0.43 on $382m in revenue.  The main reason for this is that FSLY had an outage that lasted for about an hour and affected companies like Reddit, NYT, and Twitch, among others.  Keep in mind that Fastly reported this issue on June 8, yet from the week June 7 to June 14, the stock rally about 13%.  Rather bizarre, as you'd think this would have tanked the stock then.  What I take from this is that initially the market underestimated the impact of the outage and is now overestimating it.  Overall, the outage is a valid cause for concern, and you should take into account whether or not you trust FSLY to fix its shit going forward.

Now lets get down to the fundamentals.  FSLY has show solid revenue growth, of \~40% since 2017.  Even though that should drop to 20% this year, that still represents solid growth.  Additionally, if you think that the outage was a one-off event, then presumably we can expect to go back to that juicy 40% annual revenue growth.  It's also worth drawing attention to FSLY's total asset growth which has gone up 10x from 2017 to 2020.

With respect to Cloud Computing, I'm sure most of us know that this is an industry that's going to generate a lot of wealth.  The industry has a CAGR of \~18% over the next several years.  Additionally, the market is already estimated anywhere from $200-300b (as of this year).  Most big tech companies have spent huge amounts of money on their cloud computing efforts (see Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc.).

# Part 2: Analysts are (were?) bullish

The average price target of FSLY is around $52, representing \~50% upside from the current price of $35 [\[2\]](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/FSLY/research-ratings).  Now, it should be noted that price targets may not have baked in the bad guidance and outage, but it should also be noted that historically FSLY has traded well above $50.

Honestly, I don't really pay to much attention too much attention to analysts, but it's nice confirmation bias.

First, apologies for typos/incoherence.  This was written at 4 AM, and I'm retarded.

Second, do you own DD; as stated above, I'm retarded."

What’s poppin’ bull-gang, Flux here with an options exit strategy “guide”. I wanted to make this writeup because more often than not, I see people making fundamentally sound trades, only to have their gains vanish due to having poor exit strategy. They either get too greedy and hold on for way too long, or they exit way too early and miss out on an insane runup and want to die for a couple of days afterwards. There’s two parts to each trade - an entry and an exit - and if you’re caught skimping on either end, you’re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. Although this part of trading isn’t glamourous, it’s absolutely vital to your overall success as a trader, so it’s crucial that you learn and study these concepts sooner rather than later. With all that being said, let’s get into it.

#Types of Exits

There’s three types of exits that I tend to use when I conduct my trades, each useful in their own right. I’ll give a quick summary of them all, before providing an in depth analysis and examples of each.

&nbsp;

- **Fundamental Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding the change of a company’s fundamentals. These exits usually take place before the fundamental changes since you’re not going to be able to react to the changes in real time and you’ll end up getting front run by algos. Examples of this include taking an exit during an earnings runup or rundown, taking exits before company related news events, or taking an exit before any market-wide news events.

&nbsp;

- **Technical Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. Once I see a pattern or indicator pass a certain threshold, I know it’s likely time to exit my position. Some examples of technical exits may include exits taken around support and resistance levels, exits taken during gap fills, exits taken based off of technical patterns, and exits taken during the absence of any concrete patterns or indicators.

&nbsp;

- **Psychologic Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding market psychology. This is the simplest of the three categories, and is often used in tandem with the other strategies to provide yourself with the best exit possible. Some strategies include exiting around whole numbers, screenshot theory, and individual gain theory. More on these later.

&nbsp;

Obviously there are going to be a handful of strategies and categories which I’ve missed, but the ones I outlined above are likely going to be the ones which are most common to us retail traders.

#Fundamental Exits

**Fundamental exits revolve around one key idea - Sell the news.** More often than not, the results of a given news event are already baked into a stock's price well before the news event is confirmed or actually takes place. As a result, the price of a stock will almost always DROP even if this news is “confirmed”, because it was already priced in. This can be observed anywhere from earnings runups to product launches to fundamental news events. You may be wondering why this drop even happens in the first place - if the news is baked into a stock's price, shouldn’t it stay flat when the news is confirmed? Hint : Trading Algorithms.

&nbsp;

Algorithms, or algos for short, are always behind the inevitable tanking of a stock's price post news event. It’s quite easy to see why once you understand how these algorithms work. An algo can read through an entire earnings report / news transcript / whatever and fire off a corresponding trade in a fraction of a nanosecond, meaning that they’re at a huge advantage since they **have the ability to sell the news after the news event hits.** This means that algos don’t have to prematurely exit their position until they confirm that the underlying security was priced properly. If the underlying was priced to perfection, the algo takes its profits once the news confirms it (very common behavior among algos - take profits once there are no longer any catalysts in play), thereby causing the stock to tank. If the instrument wasn’t priced properly, and there is a huge upside beat, the algo just stays in the trade and reaps the rewards, exiting at a later date instead. This concept is pretty difficult to wrap your head around initially, so let's go through an example.

&nbsp;

**In our hypothetical example, let’s say $AAPL has just reported earnings.** 

&nbsp;

**Scenario 1 : $AAPL is priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and confirms that $AAPL was indeed priced properly. The algo then takes its profits (as per common algo behavior), and dumps the position as a result of the priced in ER. Many other algos do the same as well, and the stock price “tanks”, resulting in a gap down the following day, and many left holding the bag, even on a seemingly good ER. Welcome to “priced in”.

&nbsp;

**Scenario 2 : $AAPL is NOT priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and concludes that $AAPL was NOT priced properly. There was a huge upside beat. Instead of selling, the algo stays in the position because it knows that the underlying is undervalued based on the new news, and rides the wave up, exiting the position at a later date. $AAPL was not priced properly, and as a result, the news wasn’t priced in.

&nbsp;

In both cases, the algos win - they either escape with their profits, or ride the wave up for even more gains. **Us humans cannot act as quickly as an algo, and thus we’ll always be at a disadvantage when it comes to fundamental exits. We always have to exit our positions prior to news catalysts to avoid getting front run.** News events are almost ALWAYS priced in. We can’t sell the news AFTER the news drops because we cant digest and react to the news fast enough. We can’t front run the algorithms, so we need to sell BEFORE any fundamental news catalysts, otherwise we run the risk of holding the bag. If there’s one thing I want you all to take away from this article, it's that you should **always sell the news.**

&nbsp;

# Exiting Around Earnings

This is a very simple concept once we understand the mechanisms outlined above. If you’re in a trade, always look to close it out before earnings (unless you wanna get rug pulled, in which case go ahead, I'm not your daddy). If the news is priced in (which it probably is), you’ll get front run by algos and they’ll steal your profits. Do not gamble on the “priced-in“ news being wrong. You’ll lose that bet 9/10 times. Please note that even if earnings is a beat, that “beat” can still be priced in. Please, exit your trades before earnings, or you run the risk of getting blown out due to your own ignorance.

&nbsp;

# Exiting Around Product Launches

This is similar to the concept we outlined above. In this hypothetical example, let’s say $AAPL announces that they’re going to reveal a new line of products in August. If that’s the case, get ready to exit your position before the event. Every August $AAPL showcases their new iPhones for the year, therefore even though they haven’t explicitly said they’re going to reveal iPhones, the market is gonna price the event as if iPhones are going to be revealed. Once they reveal that their new products are in fact iPhones, the price will tank, because it was priced in, and algos followed the exact behavior outlined earlier. The only instance in which the price wouldn’t tank would be if they announced that they’re releasing a teleportation device or something. Believe it or not, the odds of that happening are astronomically low, so you’re better off just selling before the reveal instead. Unless $AAPL comes out with something totally unexpected, the price will drop.

&nbsp;

# Exiting Around Fundamental News Events

This pertains to market moving news as a whole, like an FOMC speech or some macroeconomic event. If you know that JPow is gonna speak on Wednesday, it’s probably best to exit your position before that since you’ve honestly got no idea what’s gonna happen as a byproduct of it. The entire market could take a shit or could fly green, nobody knows. Since we’re traders, not gamblers, it’s in our best interest to exit our positions or hedge in order to shield our gains. Fundamental news events are often crapshoots, and are the leading cause of solid gains getting unjustly erased in an instant.

&nbsp;

---

#Technical Exits

Technical exits pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. In order to have the ability to do a technical exit, you must have a basic understanding of technical charts, patterns, and indicators. The entire field of technical analysis is easy to understand, but hard to master, so even if you don’t have much experience in the area, I’ll do my best to explain it all in a way which is friendly towards newer traders.

&nbsp;

---

#Exiting Around Support and Resistance

This is often one of the easiest exits to perform, as it’s fairly straightforward to identify on a chart. **Whenever you start to approach an area which you’ve deemed as a key level of support or resistance, consider exiting your trade.** If the price has bounced off of that particular level five times in the past, it’ll likely hold true for the 6th time unless something has fundamentally changed about the company or the markets. As a result, you know that you should exit your trade as you approach the level, as it likely won’t keep going in the same direction once we get to that point. 

&nbsp;

An awesome example of this would be the [$CLF chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/9/9ymcqFZF.png) As we can tell, CLF trades in a nice ascending channel. In this case, we can use our trendlines to easily identify when to exit our trades in order to capture the maximum amount of our gains, saving us massive headaches. Once we get near any of the yellow trendlines, we should consider taking an exit since we’re likely going to bounce off of it. Another great example of similar price movement can be found in [$AMD’s chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/l/LzNxfKpr.png) It trades off of supports and resistances very consistently, allowing us to bag consistent gains. However, unlike CLF, AMD often has breakouts to the upside or downside, making it trickier to trade in the event of a breakout.

&nbsp;

You may be wondering if there’s any way you can capture the EXTRA gains in the event that the support or resistance levels don’t hold. Although I don’t recommend doing it too often, a well placed stop-loss can help protect your gains in the event that we reject off of a support or resistance, while simultaneously KEEPING you in the trade if we break through the support or resistance. Obviously, you’ll need some experience trading to know exactly where to place your stop, and it’s going to vary from ticker to ticker based on IV and the type of security or derivative you’re trading. A well placed stop-loss can help magnify your returns while also preventing you from giving up any gains you’ve already locked in. Be wary, too tight of a stop could take you out of a trade entirely before a run, but too loose of a stop could cause you to give up too much of your unrealized gains. It’s a fine line to play, and that only comes with experience.

&nbsp;

Another way you could play breakouts is by using a two stepped approach. First, you take your exit once you approach a given level of support or resistance to lock in your gains. You then set an alert within your broker slightly higher than that given level. If your alert gets tripped, you know that there’s been a breakout, and you’re clear to re-enter the trade to then capture any extra gains that may occur once it starts to run. If I run this strategy, I make sure to set my stop under the newly broken support or resistance in order to preserve my capital in the event of a false breakout. In the end, this method is much safer, but it requires you to sit at your computer twiddling your thumbs waiting for a breakout, so I personally don’t prefer it.

&nbsp;

# Exiting Around Gaps

Before we get into how to trade gaps, we need to understand what gaps are, and why they occur. [**Gaps are areas on a chart where the price of a stock moves sharply without any trades being placed.**](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/asVEHysx.png) Usually this happens as a result of a positive or negative catalyst affecting a stock outside of regular trading hours, resulting in a respective gap up or down the following day. A “gap” refers to a gap in the stock's price as a result of no trades being conducted within that range. Gaps are created because of low volume (technically no volume), and as a result, are prone to getting “filled” very quickly. Once we are within the price range of a gap, it’s very common that we will get sucked through the area with prices strongly trending towards the opposite side of the gap as a byproduct of the lack of volume.

&nbsp;

When trading gaps, we need to recognize two important levels, and understand how price will act around them. **The very last trade that took place before the gap was created will be a very heavy level of resistance, and the very first trade that takes place after a gap will also be a very heavy level of resistance.** As a result, we will be very prone to rejecting off of these levels, so we want to fully exit our trade around these levels, no exceptions. Once we’re past the initial resistance, we can look to re-enter the trade to capture the rest of our profits.

&nbsp;

Understanding all of that, gap trades are relatively simple. First, we ride our trade up to our first level of resistance (the beginning of the gap, aka the price that the first trade was conducted at), and then take our exit to lock in our profits. Afterwards, we set an alert slightly above the resistance, so we get notified once we’re past the resistance and are in the gap. Since we know there’s no trading volume within the gap, there’s a good chance we will get sucked through to the other side, meaning we should look to re-enter the trade as quickly as possible and then ride it to the opposite end of the gap (the end of the gap aka the price that the last trade was conducted at before the gap was created). Once we get to the opposite end of the gap, we fully exit the trade, because we know that 99% of the time we will reject off of this next heavy level of resistance. Gaps have a very rigid structure, and trade very similar to a breakout play. Enter a trade, exit at first resistance. Re-enter the trade after we break resistance, exit once we’re at the second resistance.

&nbsp;

#Clear Skies and Falling Knives

A clear skies situation refers to when a stock is on a tear and has recently carved out new all time highs - think [$AMZN’s recent run to $3750,](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/6/6E9FplY9.png) or [$CRSR’s initial run to $50.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/e/EHxx1rVZ.png) A falling knife is the flipside of that, and refers to when a stock is essentially in freefall - like $NKLA when people found out Trevor Milton is a rat, or $WKHS when they lost the government contracts. In both situations, it can be extremely difficult to know when you should exit your trade since we don’t have any technical levels to go off of, and as a result, we don’t know when to anticipate a bounce. Even if we did have a general idea of where it was going to bounce, the market often over reacts, resulting in us blowing past our initial mark before starting our initial recovery.

&nbsp;

**The simplest way to play these situations is with a trailing stop.** Trailing stops were invented for situations like these, and they’re honestly one of the most effective yet under-utilized tools. Set the stop, and it’ll trail the stock as it moves. When a stock is carving out new highs, or plunging to new lows, a properly set trailing stop will let you get as close to maximum profits as possible while still allowing you to stay in the trade if we experience some turbulence along the way. If your trailing stop is set properly, you shouldn’t get stopped out of the trade from natural market movements, and will only be forced out once we’ve found a new high or low. I’m not going to teach you how to properly set trailing stops as that’s beyond the scope of this article, but it’s something I may write about in the future given that enough people are interested.

&nbsp;

**Alternatively, if you want to abuse basic human psychology, you could also look to exit your position around whole numbers.** Humans are weird creatures, in the sense that we like “whole” things - stock prices are no exception. You better believe there’s going to be buyers or sellers setting up shop at nice, round numbers. Think $20, $50, $100, etc. If a stock is making a miracle run from $10, and is approaching $20, you better believe there’s going to be a large number of people looking to take profits at the $20 mark, and as a result, you should look to exit the position around there. Again, this isn’t a 100% concrete theory, and sometimes these levels won’t hold at all, but it’s still something to keep in mind. More on this later.

&nbsp;

#Technical Caveats

**Please note, that these technical exits won’t hold true given that a company's underlying fundamentals have changed. A stock's technical charts and indicators are only to be used as a summary of a company's fundamentals.** Technicals summarize the price action which is driven by the underlying fundamentals. If the fundamentals of a company change, the technical indicators and charts will also change, thereby making our old technical charts void. This is an extremely important concept that most traders and investors do not fully understand. Technicals summarize fundamentals.

&nbsp;

If $MSFT announces that they’re coming out with a time machine, don’t expect the stock's price to bounce off of the nearest overhead resistance, as that level is now void. $MSFT has fundamentally changed as a company, and as a result, the technicals will also need to change to reflect that. The same is true to the downside. If $MCD announces that they’ve been grinding up humans and putting them into their hamburgers, don’t expect the nearest level of support to hold - it’s void. The stock will plunge into free fall until $MCD is properly priced given it’s new fundamentals. Only then can we look to start re-establishing our technicals.

&nbsp;

**Technicals are only to be used as a summary of a company’s current fundamentals.**

&nbsp;

#Psychological Exits

Psychological exits consist of concepts and rules derived from how humans think and react to certain events. They are more conceptual in nature, and will vary from person to person. They aren’t necessarily as concrete as the other types of exits due to their ambiguous nature. Everyone will apply these exits differently, and as a result I can’t give you a consistent set of rules for each one. I can just explain the general concepts and provide different contexts regarding when to apply them. The rest is up to you!

&nbsp;

---

#Screenshot Theory

This is a very simple concept that I actually adopted from Wall Street Bets of all places - **If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell.** If you’re taking screenshots of your unrealized profits to flex on your friends, or random internet people, it’s probably time to sell out of that position. The only reason you feel the need to flex your gains is because it’s a life altering amount of money. I don’t care what the fundamentals, or technicals say at that point. Cash out of the casino, and realize those gains. If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell.

&nbsp;

# Individual Gain Theory

This concept refers to when you’re trading with money that you cannot afford to lose, and you come in on somewhat of a win. Profit or loss, this money is going to fundamentally alter your life (for better or worse) because you were put in a position where you had to “trade” money which you also needed elsewhere. If you’re ever in a situation where you’re forced to trade to make some extra dough, take those profits asap. A loss is often going to make your life a hell of a lot worse than a win will.

&nbsp;

# Exiting Around Whole Numbers

Humans are weird creatures - we like “whole” or “round” stuff, numbers being no exception. How often do you catch yourself submitting a buy order for 20$, or a sell order for $50. Unless you’re cognizant of it, you’re not going to think to yourself “imma buy $CLF at 21.83”. There’s a good chance you’re gonna round it up to $22, or down to $20, etc. The same goes for literally EVERYONE else. Just keep in mind that depending on the direction you’re trading, there’s often going to be buyers / sellers at whole numbers. $10, $20, $25, $30, etc. No number is safe. Look to time your exits before or after these numbers, as they may prove to be mini points of resistance. You’ll often see sellers step in at whole numbers on the way up, and buyers step in at whole numbers on the way down. Use this to your advantage.

&nbsp;

---

# Emotional Exits

This concept applies to two key emotions - Euphoria and Hope. **The instant you start feeling euphoric about a trade and it’s potential gains, step away from the trade.** You’re not going to be thinking clearly enough to make an optimal trade or exit. There’s a very high chance you’re going to continue to chase the victory. If the victory starts slipping away from you, you're likely going to stay in the trade hoping that it goes back up to the previous high that you didn’t sell at. In situations like this, by staying in the trade, you’ll almost always hold your position well past the top, and will be prone to “diamond hands-ing” your profits into the ground, ultimately coming up with a loss on a fundamentally sound trade. 

&nbsp;

You need to be conscious of the fact that you’re euphoric, and that this trade went awesome, and exit the position intelligently. Once you start feeling euphoria, and consequently hope, there’s no going back. You’re not trading on fundamentals, and you’re not trading on technicals either. You’re simply not trading rationally. In situations like this, it’s best to take a step back and exit the trade before you make a boneheaded move and end up giving your gains away. Emotions cloud judgement, and as traders, that’s the last thing we want. Sell out of a position once you start feeling intense emotion.

&nbsp;

#Conclusion

All in all, options trading is a difficult game with many moving parts - If you're caught skimping on your exits, you’re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. This aspect of trading is less glamorous and often overlooked, but is absolutely vital to your success as a trader. I hope this writeup was informative and useful to you all! **If you want some more in depth explanations of each concept, alongside some detailed examples, refer to my Options Trading Exit Strategies video, which you can find [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDKNRF_BZqQ)** If you have any questions, feel free to drop em below and I'll do my best to help you out!

Instead of gloating about how I was right about Homebuilders, by making a gloat post... I decided to be constructive by writing my greatest work yet. 

Everyone has heard about Corsair, and how great its products and growth are, but I don’t care about the product line when it comes to earnings plays. I care about numbers, the street cares about numbers, and the numbers to note down here are 27.5, 29.95, and 35. But we’ll get to the why, later. 

Earnings plays are not necessarily as esoteric as people think. In fact, the efficient market hypothesis is such that you can figure out whether a stock will go up or down, and even get your own estimate of earnings per share that is or can be relatively accurate to do so. 

The Process Is Simple:

* Identify a fundamentally strong company that has lagged its peers for no reason (Vet this) in terms of its current price to earnings ratio, its analyst future price to earnings ratio relative to its sector, or even (especially) historically. 
* Identify whether it has a bright future ahead of itself. The reason for this is that the efficient market hypothesis operates under the assumptions that markets are forward looking. I identified this with home builders generally, and with CCS and M/I homes respectively. 
* Identify the true earnings per share of the company for the upcoming quarter, because with these kinds of companies, analysts are usually wrong. Don’t bullshit yourself with pie in the sky fantasy. Go as far out as a year with your estimates, or at least FYE. That way you can also analyze whether a company will raise guidance, or even if the CEO and the executive team are playing the earnings beat game where they intentionally under promise and over deliver. 

1. Understand that if a company has good earnings, but lowers guidance the stock will tank, so it’s important to note that you need to project future earnings per share for the full year.
2. The way you can figure out what the “true” EPS will be in a company for the quarter and the year (Which, by the way, is the lynchpin of this strategy) is a process that takes hours of work. That’s the price you must pay for a high batting average: 

* You need to first read the latest earnings of the company you are investing in. This can be done at their investor relations website, or by finding their quarterly or annual on EDGAR. Follow that up by sitting down and listening to their earnings call, or by reading the earnings call transcript to add color.

1.  Follow that up by looking at sector peers who have reported for the latest quarter, where your stock has not yet reported earnings. Read their earnings release and delve deeper by looking at their Q’s/K (depending on what time of the year it is). Then listen in on their earnings call. Don’t forget to look at sector peers in foreign markets because they have different disclosure rules. For example, the Hong Kong Exchange lets/has companies issue early warning profit alerts before earnings. 
2. · Have you done your sector research? Make sure you have. Including sector numbers/economic data. If they aren’t what the market likes, question if there’s a reason why. For example, CCS/M/I home and other home builders haven’t been selling homes until they’ve been mostly constructed and have been metering (or effectively) metering their home sales. This is because they wanted to get fixed costs before they sell their home as opposed to getting a home pre-ordered and having to deal with highly variable prices in commodities. In short, home builders wanted better visibility on their margins. So, the new home sales data for this month didn’t look “great,” but if you know what’s going on, you know that it was a head fake. 
3. · Compare the current P/E to your company’s peers, and then compare the future P/E? Is it woefully undervalued for no good reason (I’m talking a material impact here)? Is the projected analyst earnings expectations for the quarter and year just too low?

*  Doing this will allow you to make a more accurate projection of your specific company’s earnings, and forward earnings. Even then your expectations can be blown, even though they’re higher than analysts, as occurred to me with home builders I was in.
* What is the market sentiment towards your stock? If it’s been red the last week, month, three months? Then that means there is a strong negative sentiment (But it doesn’t need to be red for all three, you just must recognize the sentiment). If that’s the case, and you’ve paired this with everything else, the stock will go up. So long as you identify that there will be a beat, raise, or bullish earnings call or a combination. 
*  Be mindful of any obstacles such as the bear case (If only to do like a persuasive argument where you acknowledge the argument then counter it). 
* In certain cases, hedge, by limiting your downside and protecting a large portion of your upside. This can be paired with trimming on a as-needed basis when you are up.
* The process will take you a significant portion of time running in the hours. This Corsair play took me 5-7 Hours of Research, and I’m not counting most of my Razer research hours in this. It can be tedious, but it’s the price to pay for a high batting average. I’m lucky that I love doing this stuff. 

**How I Discovered The Play**

They way that I am going to describe this DD is by weaving the story of how I came to discover this play in bullet point format. 

* The story starts a month and a half ago with a Singaporean-American company listed in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. I was incredibly bullish on what Razer’s first half earnings would be, because I was seeing them buy back their stock in real time every single day. Hong Kong has different disclosure rules, requiring a next day disclosure if the company did a buyback the previous day with how much shares had been bought, how much they had retired, and how much they had bought back so far but not retired. They also require a monthly issuance of equity. I had been seeing them buying their stock back every, single, day. So, I knew the first half for Razer would be gangbusters. But another disclosure requirement is the inside information profit alert that the exchange requires them to do before earnings.
* Looking through it I noticed a few things: [https://doc.irasia.com/listco/hk/razer/announcement/a210714.pdf](https://doc.irasia.com/listco/hk/razer/announcement/a210714.pdf) 

1. There was higher than expected revenue growth (Though I must remember that Q1 is included in the profit alert since the earnings are for H1 and H2.
2. The operating margin was higher because of a higher gross margin product mix, as well as organic improvement of hardware margins. They had spoken of doing it in their investor presentation for their annual report in 2020. It can be found here: [https://investor.razer.com/pdf/pre210324.pdf](https://investor.razer.com/pdf/pre210324.pdf) (Page 47)
3. I expect something similar for Corsair where the higher gross margin products are a larger product of their revenue mix. 
4. There was also continued improvement in operating expenses management, which I expect for Corsair as well. 

* That’s not enough color for me, so I move on to Logitech which has reported earnings. They beat earnings expectations, but they did not beat Q1 EPS sequentially. Part of it is expected, in that the area is seasonal, with Q3 and Q4 having the best numbers, but something tells me that’s not why. You see, Logitech has a lot of segments, of which only gaming is one of them, and I expect their non-gamer peripheral segment (etcetera) has decreased etcetera. I wager that the gaming segment revenue increased sequentially. I must look at their earnings to figure that out and compare their recent quarter to their last quarter.

1.  First I look at the earnings release for last quarter, which can be found here: [Quarterly Factsheet F4Q21.xlsx (q4cdn.com)](https://s1.q4cdn.com/104539020/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/Logitech-F4Q21-Quarterly-Factsheet.pdf). It shows me that gaming revenue is 323M. 
2.  I then look at the latest earnings release here: [https://s1.q4cdn.com/104539020/files/doc\_financials/2022/q1/Logitech-F1Q22-Quarterly-Factsheet.pdf](https://s1.q4cdn.com/104539020/files/doc_financials/2022/q1/Logitech-F1Q22-Quarterly-Factsheet.pdf). I can see that gaming revenue stands at 336M. 
3. That equates to a 4.02% sales increase.

*  However, by looking at the fabled Q instead of just the fact sheet itself, I know that gaming doesn’t represent video cameras for streaming (or streaming accessories), nor the microphone segment for streaming. 

1. On Page 8 of the latest earnings found here: [0001032975-21-000034 (d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net)](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001032975/d1c28ef6-b9ef-4a9a-974e-f23b941b1689.pdf), you can find the definition of gaming.
2.  “Our gaming category comprises gaming mice, keyboards, headsets, gamepads, steering wheels, simulation controllers, console gaming headsets, console gaming controllers, and stream labs services.
3.  What it doesn’t say is streaming webcams, streaming accessories, or microphones. 
4.  This means I must go to the web cam section to find sequential gains, as well as audio and wearables section. This is to get a complete picture. 

*  PC Webcams decelerated from 145 to 110 in terms of revenues. That’s a decrease of 31.8%. However, that’s because of the WFH trends fading, because as the segment states: “our PC Webcams category comprises PC-based webcams targeted primarily at consumers, including streaming cameras.” Furthermore, they say that the 81% increase over a twelve-month period in terms of sales was partly because of organizations adopting remote or hybrid work environments.  

1. · I expect the gaming (and higher margin) portion of the webcam side to have increased. However, looking at their earnings transcript will give me some color. 
2. o “While webcam growth has started to moderate after more than tripled in last year, sales still grew 73% in the quarter, and we have regained some of the share we lost last year due to supply shortages.” 
3. § That’s interesting. The gaming peripheral and streaming segment is hyper fragmented, and so I suppose Corsair has been eating market share. I’m expecting the majors to continue doing so.
4. · “Yeah, I mean the streaming business has just been a really strong grower underneath these numbers has really kind of lives in different places in the -- in our different categories. But generally speaking, if you look at blue microphones over the past year, it's really just grown tremendously. And we think the long term there is very, very strong. And Streamlabs is also super exciting and it's beating all the expectations we had for in terms of growth, and we're very optimistic ahead, and we're learning so much from our service businesses, it's a pure service play.”
5. o Alright, I got that color on the product mix. I’m thinking that the streaming portion for webcams has continued to grow sequentially. Ergo sales have increased from Q4 to Q1.  
6. o Corsair seems to be in the entire ecosystem, while Logitech is not: [Elgato Gaming and 45 more pages - Personal - Microsoft​ Edge (gyazo.com)](https://gyazo.com/102f33504555d33bff5c7bed013ce6ee)\-> [https://gyazo.com/ca119fd050f2adb41c5c882ca1c738ed-](https://gyazo.com/ca119fd050f2adb41c5c882ca1c738ed-)\> [Blue and 49 more pages - Personal - Microsoft​ Edge (gyazo.com)](https://gyazo.com/77c0e5277ae29824d8e7a173ed47daa1) 

*  130 to 117, but a similar story regarding the consumer side dragging down the gamer side for audio and wearables. Hopefully there will be more color in the earnings call transcript. The NPD has been quite clear that Streaming as a segment is going to grow at a strong pace for the next few years. 

1. Yeah, I mean the streaming business has just been a really strong grower underneath these numbers has really kind of lives in different places in the -- in our different categories. But generally speaking, if you look at blue microphones over the past year, it's really just grown tremendously. And we think the long term there is very, very strong. And Streamlabs is also super exciting and it's beating all the expectations we had for in terms of growth, and we're very optimistic ahead, and we're learning so much from our service businesses, it's a pure service play.”
2.  Well, that sounds bullish for the streaming side of the audio’s (microphones). Guess that means my thesis regarding this is correct. 

* Now, I move on to Corsair. I’m just going to ignore looking at best sellers lists for pc component parts, because I must take some chill and I think it’s strong anyway. I know that the graphics card shortage for high end graphics cards is leading to sales increases in pre-built pcs. Ergo, Origin will do well sequentially.  

1. Going to focus instead on what I think earnings will be for Q2 and FYE. I’m going to use this, and if I need to go to the Q I will: [fd9a3204-b129-4add-8f27-d92f22f17169 (corsair.com)](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/fd9a3204-b129-4add-8f27-d92f22f17169) 
2. They raised adjusted operating income to be in the range of 235M to 255M from 205M to 220M. Let’s figure out how to get the net income from that, at the top range.
3. This is going to be more complicated than I initially thought since the Operating Income on a GAAP basis is 67.289M, and there are some one-time items I can strip out to adjust it. **For some reason Robinhood displays the Adjusted, Non-GAAP EPS of .57. Therefore, my number might be lower, but will be higher on an Adjusted non-GAAP EPS basis. The GAAP EPS is .47.** 
4. Non-deferred IPO and secondary offering costs=1.03M
5. Acquisition-related and integration-related costs=.208M
6. Change in fair value of contingent consideration for business acquisition=.072M
7. That gives us something to start with, and the new tally is 68.6M in **GAAP income after stripping out what I believe to be one-time expenses.** 
8. As a percentage of net revenue that is now 12.95% from 12.7%. The adjusted operating income as a percentage of revenue is 15.2%. 
9. Taking that operating income, and deducting interest expense of 7.39M, and then deducting the effective tax rate of 22% gives you 46.723M as your Net income. (Page 7)
10. Corsair has debt at $294.3 million after debt repayment of 28M, and they intend to extinguish 100M by the end of the year. The interest payments, as can be seen In Q1 can be material. I expect EPS growth as more and more debt is repaid, and the interest no longer has to be paid. 
11. “We were able to convert our strong financial performance in the first quarter into an opportunity to further strengthen our balance sheet. We reduced debt by an additional $28 million with outstanding principal now at $299 million and net debt at $177.3 million. We did this while growing quickly and leaving sufficient resources to help us grow further. We continue to evaluate growth opportunities while still expecting to further reduce our existing debt in 2021,” said Michael G. Potter, Chief Financial Officer of Corsair
12. I expect that they will outpace the 100M goal they set for by the end of the year, due to stronger revenues, free cash flow, and net income. 
13. No, I refuse to check out the loan terms even though I could. This is already 2451 words. 

* Okay, now let’s go with future projections, okay? I’m expecting 5-8% in sales growth. I don’t expect it to be 1/1 as I expect there to be a higher product mix relative to other quarters (Thank you Razer). Therefore, I probably expect 6-8% sales growth, but 7-10% in revenue growth. I’m basing this off my review of Logitech and Razer. That would mean net revenues of 582.36M. 

1. The operating income, therefore, should be 12.9% of that, but I am expecting better. Because of operating expense management primarily, but also because of a higher margin mix. Since I went topline on revenue growth sequentially, I’ll be somewhat conservative and say that I believe there will be a 100 BPS increase. So, 13.9% will be the operating income percentage of net revenue.
2.  That would give operating income of 80.95M 
3. Then I am going to deduct interest, by copy pasting the last quarter’s interest expense minus what interest is saved. As I’m too lazy to dig for it, my assumption will be 4% interest rate on the debt extinguished, which means 280K in interest saved this quarter (And 1.12M over a full year). The new interest expense tally for the quarter is 4.666M. That would turn the net income into 76.284M.
4. Other Expense, net line I’ll just say will remain neutral which means the net income will turn into 73.86M in net income.
5. Effective tax rate of 22% means 57.61M in actual net income free and clear, and then divide that by 92.19M shares outstanding **means basic EPS of .6249 for Q2 2021.** 
6. **IMPORTANT ALERT SO READ THIS:** For some reason MarketWatch and Robinhood report the adjusted EPS which is non-GAAP, and they do so for the analyst estimates as well. I’m just going to give you that number so you don’t have to do the calculations, and I can save time: **EPS under adjusted net income is .738 EPS.** 
7. **As the adjusted net income EPS is what is going to be reported, and what has been reported, I’m just going to go with that.** The Price to earnings growth sequentially would be a 27.24% increase. 
8. Analyst estimates of a FY EPS of 1.76 are way too low and would value the company with a forward p/e of 16.59 if matched. However, they will be easily surpassed as the first quarter had a EPS of .47 on a GAAP basis and .58 on its reported non GAAP basis. 
9. Q3 and Q4 are seasonally the best time for these stocks (especially Q3), and I don’t see how those changes. They’re going to have even stronger quarters sequentially.
10.  My EPS estimate on a GAAP basis for the full year is roughly 1.95-2.05, but roughly at or within a cent difference of 2. 
11. My EPS estimate of the adjusted GAP basis (Which is what is reported on brokerages, and finance sites), would have me estimating a FY EPS 2.15-2.55.
12. Every 28M of debt extinguished, means that 12-month future earnings are boosted by .012. You can divide that by 4 as that EPS is divided over a full year. There will be a snowball effect, and you will start feeling it this quarter, though it will be slight. This estimate is assuming 4% interest on every dollar.
13. This all means a beat and raise, and a bullish earnings call, or a combination of the three. 

* Corsair’s trailing P/E after earnings will be 12.14. 

1. Logitech’s current P/E ratio is 17.17
2. Turtle Beach is 10.49 
3. Razer had turned a net profit of .8M last year, and so the P/E ratio is astronomical, the forward P/E for FY 2021 will be more reasonable.

* Corsair’s forward P/E for FY 2021 according to analysts who expect 1.76 is 16.55. 

1. Turtle Beach’s is almost 22
2. Razer is 22 (under my model).
3. Logitech’s is 19.07. 

* My estimate for forward P/E:

1. GAAP Basis (The non-reported one): 14.57 (2 EPS)
2. Adjusted Basis (The reported one): 12.69 (2.3 EPS) 

* There is strong negative sentiment because the street doesn’t think the gaming boom in sales can sustain itself, but I think that’s wrong, and I believe I’ve done the research to prove that is so.

1. The street, if you see the share price, is expecting complete catastrophe. A miss of epic proportions if you look at the charts. The short interest is higher than it should be because short sellers think Eagle Tree will unload at any time, but that’s not what is going on. Eagle Tree is a rational player in the market, and I do not think they will sell past 35.75, plus whatever value they assign the raised guidance. My guess is that their new sell point will be 37.5-40. 
2. My reasoning for that is if you look here, you can see when they sold, and how much they sold: [CRSR | Corsair Gaming Inc. Profile | MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/crsr/company-profile?mod=mw_quote_tab)
3. Aside from the IPO, they only sold once. Eight months later. When the company was pumped to over 40 dollars. They ended up selling all the way down to 35, and then stopped. 35 was their stopping point. 
4. They didn’t sell until the stock price had moved up 105-140% in the span of 8 months. They are rational actors, and they acted in that manner because they believed that at those price points, they were taking money from you and putting it in their pockets. They haven’t sold below 35 before earnings because they believe that that would be the equivalent of taking money from their pockets and giving it to you.
5. The executive team selling is because of RSU’s recently. If you know about RSU’s you know that you are taxed the full value of the stock now it is issued at the market price, and that is your cost basis even if you don’t sell. So, most people just usually buy them, and immediately sell them to pay the taxes and keep the rest as cash to diversify.

**My Strategy**

· I had bought 6 27.5 Calls and Sold 6 35 calls. I added another pair today to make that 7 for each. These are August 20 Calls, and my debit spread means my cost basis is like 29.95. At the time I bought them yesterday, to break even it would have had to go up 1.6% by August 20.

· The Delta was .70, versus .20, and Gamma favored me for the first dollar. Thus, the first dollar gain in the share price would have netted me 250% margin roughly.

· Margin expansion would be there because of the extrinsic vs. intrinsic effect, thus the IV crush would be less for the 27.5’s than the 35’s.

· Theta burn is lower on my 27.5 calls as opposed to the 35’s due to the same reason (though I don’t need to do that).

· I understand an opportunity could come that makes Eagle Tree rationalize selling at prices they don’t think is suitable for them, so I’ve protected the possibility. Corsair reports pre-market on Tuesday, which means they only have today and Monday to sell before earnings come out. 

· Market sentiment is so low, that anything positive is primed to ligjt a fuse in the company’s earnings, and I expect a 3-7% raise, and an outside chance of a 10% raise in the share price on earnings. At minimum, I expect there to be parity between Logitech’s future P/E and Corsairs. 

· Even if it stays flat, I have a week and a half after earnings to see it go up the equivalent of 1.6% (It’s roughly 2% now, but you get the idea). 

· There is intrinsic value unless it goes down below 27.5. Which means if it ends above 27.5 but below my cost basis, I can exercise those calls, and become a theta beta by wheeling it for September 17’s at a price of 27.5, 30, or 32.5 and get past break even and into positive territory as the extra two weeks of theta will outweigh my losses. 

· The chances of it going below 27.5 are… Slim to be honest. 

· I can either sell on earnings runup or keep them and see if there is a pop for the next few days. I will likely hedge my gains by trimming on a -as-needed basis.

Why is this a big deal??? 

Well we saw the same thing happen with a lot of tech stocks including Microsoft dropped 3% in after hours (although it has since recovered) and with the Chinese markets continuing to get hammered, inflation on the run, and a lot of uncertainty about more lock downs, will we see a larger scale correction over the next quarter? 

One argument for this is that companies that still have high demand can’t fill their demand due to chip shortages. 

TSLA for example predicted they could only fill 35000 out of a 80000 demand for their newest model due to these shortages and AAPL also cited this as a factor to slower growth in their earnings call today. 

Now I’m probably gonna get smashed on my Apple calls tomorrow at open so imma cry myself to sleep and hopefully read some of you guys’ thoughts on this matter."

Well given the current evaluations on American/Canadian tickers currently I think this is a mistake. 

You have companies like AAPL and MSFT trading at absurd multiples. So maybe be a bear you might ask? Well bears have gotten crushed all year long so I would argue it's to early to be a bear. So what the hell are you supposed to do? You can't buy, you can't sell and you just did three lines of cocaine and want to gamble. 

The answer: Chinese stocks, the Chinese stock market has recently corrected and seems to have found support at these levels. I think Chinese stocks are where one can find value currently. The TA looks good and if the numbers aren't cooked to oblivian you might even find some good long term value in BABA and other Chinese big cap stocks. 

So ya the summery is if you wanted to buy Chinese stocks in the last 2 months you will had a hard time finding value up until now. I think over the next day or two these stocks find a bounce to indicate a move higher. Just make sure the company you bought has been recently investigated for Fraud as these companies are probably less likely to try and cook the books in the short term with regulators breathing down their necks. 

This entire post is just confirmation Bias for me buying WISH today. Good luck my drug enthuised gamblers."

You bet — this is just as much making billionaires kiss SAMR (State Administration for Market Regulation)'s ring as it is ensuring a fair market. This includes breaking up (Tencent's music licenses) fining (2.7 billion on BABA) or investigating (DIDI for breaching Chinese data laws) these publicly listed champions.

But US analysts are getting Chinese antitrust and capital markets activity all wrong. This is good news for the long term viability of China's internet industry, just like the DOJ antitrust hit on Microsoft (*US v Microsoft Corp*, 1998 Netscape case) in the 90's was good for the long-term viability of the nascent internet industry then.

Short term good for these individual companies? Who knows, Microsoft kept going way up after the 1998 investigation up until the dotcom bubble burst, and then it went sideways after it was ordered to change its practices in the 2001 settlement.

Long term? Either individually or as a part of a Chinese internet ETF, the giants' losses are the rivals' gains.

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Pinterest is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $PINS has had an average post earnings move of **14%**. The options this week are pricing in a move of *roughly 6%* on both sides of the chain, which is likely going to shrink significantly going into earnings as theta eats away at the contracts. Even though I’m extremely bullish on $PINS, this trade could honestly move either way, so I’m personally opting to play a straddle like I did with $SNAP last week. Given that we get a historically average move, we’ll be making some money on this trade. Keep in mind, this trade *is* riskier than the one we played on $SNAP, since the average historical move is smaller. Don’t over leverage yourself, and don’t be afraid to turn the straddle into a reverse iron butterfly to reduce your cost basis on the trade.

&nbsp;

- **Over the past 24 earnings seasons, Shopify has gone up nearly 75% of the time!** The odds on this trade are phenomenal, and we have quite a few options for how we want to play it.  If you want to gamble directionally, call debit spreads would be your best bet from a risk to reward standpoint. Alternatively, we can also join theta-gang for this play by selling ATM put credit spreads allowing us to net some extremely nice premiums. If you want an even safer spread, $MSFT also has a similar win-rate (~65%) while having a historically smaller move, allowing you to defend your capital in the event that the trade goes against you. Since both $SHOP and $MSFT report on different days, we can look to make this play twice to ensure we’re not overleveraged on any given day.

&nbsp;

- **Counterintuitively, $XLE is NOT a good [collateral play](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays) this week!** $XLE actually has a *higher* IV than both $XOM and $CVS, so if you wanted to play oil earnings, you’d actually be better off rolling the dice on the individual companies. I’m not sure why this is the case here. Either the MMs are catching onto my bullshit (unlikely), or there’s some nuances to trading oil that I’m not aware of.  I’m sure there’s an arbitrage play you could make regarding the individual price and IV differences proportional to the ETF holdings, but I don’t have time to crunch the numbers nor do I think I’d have enough capital to abuse it. Regardless, I just wanted to bring this to everyone’s attention since this is one of the rare cases where the collateral play puts us at a disadvantage.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I haven’t had much time to review any extra trades given that I’ve been extremely busy this weekend. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.

#Summary and Conclusion

We’ve got another fun week of earnings ahead of us! I personally tend to avoid playing FAANG stocks in general, so my analysis was concentrated elsewhere. If you see any appealing plays, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment! If you want access to more trading tools, or have any specific questions or observations you’d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links within the spreadsheet or on my profile. **Happy Trading! :)**"

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 1. Meme Status**

I've stated [elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oib6l8/the_state_of_the_meme_a_ta_of_all_your_favorite/) the definition of 'Meme Stock' I use, but in short it is thus:

Meme-DDs get made & price goes up-->Options Wizards buy options & **Thing** happens-->idiots FOMO in at terrible prices, then diamond hand-->diamond hands result in higher-low-->repeat for next leg up.

Basically, there are two kinds of plays around here: True Memes and P&Ds. The True Memes have two distinguishing features: 1) the involvement of the Options Wizards who buy all those options forcing the MMs to hedge and causing the **Thing**, and 2) after the retracement, the price action stabilizes at a **higher-low**.

Obviously, this could all just be me seeing bunnies in every cloud. I'm naught but a simple man with his intentions writ clear upon his trucker hat, so take what you will from my ramblings. However, when comparing the likes of GME, AMC, BB and BBBY with things like RKT, CRSR, WISH, WOOF, etc, it appears there are some tickers that have the follow through after the initial push and those are what I'm calling the True Memes.

So, is CLOV a True Meme? Answer: **it's hanging on by a worn thread**.

It remains my contention that a higher-low is a requirement for the 'follow through' on these plays. After all, if the ticker returns back to its pre-meme price (which for many of these is the all-time low), or worse, goes even lower, what then did the 'diamond handing' accomplish? Answer: jack shit. Think of it this way: if a bunch of people flood into the stock and buy up enough of the float, supply and demand dictate that the price *should* stabilize at a higher-low. Yes, the stock market is full of fuckery and it's not as simple as all that, but if the price just slides back to the low, the simple conclusion is: there are not as many of you as you think there are.

Also, going back down to the pre-meme low, or worse, is about as demoralizing as it can get. Many so-called 'apes' are going to say 'fuck it, I was had' and dump their shares for a loss. Further, it is going to severally damage the image of the play, making it look like 'nothing more than another P&D.'

Of course, I could be proven wrong here. CLOV could fall down and put in a new all-time low before shooting the moon. Who cares if you're wrong as long as you still make money.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 2. Cum-tastic Charts**

First, the daily chart with Cbass's patented horizontal lines:

[Clov-tastic](https://preview.redd.it/2p48jy2j27d71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b6072e7598b01fd3df17d33b2a42a28dd6ea97f)

My theory regarding the True Memes was not merely a higher-low, but that the higher-low should ***specifically*** be around the breakout level of the previous move. We are way the fuck under that, so I'm just gonna toss that one out the window because it both makes me wrong and fills me with regret. So I've just applied Cbass's Second Law of TA: When you're wrong, just move the lines until you're right again.

Last week, the ticker found some support at $8. Which is technically a 'higher-low', with the all-time low being $6.31. That's $1.69 higher. ***Impressive***. It was actually an obvious place to stabilize (for a few days). I mean, everyone and their mother knows the 92.5% Fibonacci retracement level is like, *totally* the real level and super-duper important.

Next up, I've prepared two charts in accordance with Cbass's First Law of TA: You can always find a chart & indicator combination to tell you what you want to hear.

[Sexy wedge breakout that totally means something](https://preview.redd.it/7l37izwj57d71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=81806c9a7a1da78f165d2caad87c6c85459b1073)

As you can see here, I found the **hidden** downward wedge that we've already broken out of, and therefore the next logical stop is $100/share. ***This is how TA is done***. I've seen some posts by some fucking rank amateurs that I'm pretty sure were referring to me when they claimed that there were people posting 'tons of shitty TA.' Bruh, you wish you had these skills. Cbass don't need no fuckin' Bollinger bands, Keltner somethings, so-called 'moving averages' or any of that fancy bullshit. I *could* do it all with horizontal lines, but look here, I figured out how to draw *other kinds of lines*.

Here's another example of my superior line-skills:

[Look at 'em skills and burn with jealousy](https://preview.redd.it/mstskgyi77d71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b988d3bf2c072f6e219e4dd7b95547e1bdd5ab4)

Here you can see we were in a downward channel from the beginning of the month and we're now not in ***that*** downward channel. Which means we **can't possibly** go down anymore. Again: $100/share imminent. Furthermore, the upper channel has clearly turned from resistance into support. Bruh, it just do get more bullish than this.

Except if I do this:

[Drawing a sad-face downtrend line](https://preview.redd.it/flgwlice77d71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=59d666de69e1bb228c5511f701266f7eb2a068a2)

Here, I just found a different line that maintains the bearish case. In this world, when the price gets back up to the red dashed line, it will be promptly rejected to $0. But I own this stock and this outcome doesn't make me any money, so for ***reasons*** this chart is wrong and we definitely do not exist in this version of reality.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 3. Donkey Dicks**

Now, I've never done DD on anything until *after* I bought it. Thus, in keeping with tradition I've taken a cursory glance at the underlying company of this wunderkind of a ticker after finding myself down 40%. In short, it's ***basically shit.***

Someone right now is screaming Cathie Woodisms at their screen, like: **disruptor, innovator, AI, machine learning, tech, growth, next-gen**, etc. Dude, these guys sell insurance to old people. Worse, they only sell one kind of insurance: Medicare Advantage. Will they make money in the future? Yeah, sure. But there is no fucking universe where this narrow category of business is going to command a premium like Tesla or whatever the fuck Cathie is pumping these days. You can fantasize about the whole of the human species paying endless subscription fees for the privilege of being driven around in a self-driving Tesla that smells like someone had sex in the back seat. You're high, but it is *technically* possible. Clover Healthcare has a subset of the elderly in one country as their maximum consumer base. And the government has their hand in the mix.

""But they're saving the government money with their ***software platform***!"" 1) The government doesn't actually give a fuck about saving money. If the past two years taught you nothing else, I hope this at least got through. 2) Calling a computer program a 'software platform' doesn't make it anything more than a program where you input information. Is it really that much more than a fancy version of Microsoft Excel? I doubt it, but maybe if they gamify the button clicking they can get people hooked with the dopamine effect. It just looks like advertising to me; kind of like when the term computer program got replaced with 'app' in order to make it sound like something more than just a program running on your phone. Whatever, before I ever get old enough to be on Medicare Advantage, I'm going out in a blaze of hookers and coke so I'll never get the chance to click those buttons.

CLOV gets compared to a lot of the mainline insurers, e.g., United Health Care (UNH). UNH has a market cap *literally* 100x CLOV, and yet people are like ""CLOV totally ***deserves*** to be valued like UNH."" UNH has an income of $14.5**B**. CLOV is at -$55**M**. Even sitting at a market cap of $395**B**, UNH is only running a p/e of 27.6, with a forward p/e 19.4. They are a massive company that offers all varieties of insurance and they are making fucking bank, thus their stock is steadily climbing to the moon. You can point at the 80/20 rule and make the case that it is responsible for the spiraling cost of health care in America and I'll nod my head and agree, but that does not mean CLOV is riding into this dusty town to save the day. They are in too narrow a category to have an appreciable effect on overall costs, in my opinion--assuming they have any effect at all.

""But Clover is growing at ***double digits***!"" It's easy to grow double digits when you start with no customers. After 2023, I believe the estimate is 5-7% per year. It's not terrible, but it's not going to take you to the moon. If CLOV is able to expand out into the general insurance market and take away market share from the big boys, then okay, there's some case for the crazy valuations people are throwing around. But I've as much chance of snorting lines off the titties of a Victoria's Secret model while raw-dogging her on the hood of a brand new lambo parked on my yacht... anchored off the pristine white sand beaches of my new private island.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 4. The Short-Term Gamble**

So, given that the TA on CLOV is a crap shoot (as all TA is) and the underlying company is less than amazing, why the fuck would anyone in their right mind buy this ticker. Simple: **gambling**. That is what CLOV was, is, and all it ever will be: a gamble. And *you came here gamble,* because this is the fucking casino. That's why I bought it. I was wrong about an immediate turn around after the first launch and so now I'm stuck sucking pond scum. Such is life.

Is the short-term gamble over? No, not yet. As the charts show, CLOV is bottoming out, which means the next direction ***should*** be up. Obviously, because it's gambling, down is possible, but nobody came here to hear that. Furthermore, CLOV remains one of the top tickers sentiment-wise. A lot of eyes balls has the potential to materialize that sudden move upward that everyone is pretending they're not here for. On top of that, the SI remains high. I think the importance of SI is way overblown, but most people think otherwise and that belief alone will drive retail toward the ticker. Finally, it looks like the Options Wizards took one shot at this thing (I don't know this for certain), and there is a chance they will come back around to it if things start moving up. Thus, there remains the potential for a second massive launch.

So let's assume someone is looking at this and thinking, ""Okay, based on the charts I might take a stab at this."" The next question is: Get in now, or wait for $7? This is impossible to answer, of course, but if you are like me, then if you buy now, it will drop to $7 because the stock market exists to fuck with you, ***specifically***. By the same rule, if you wait, then it will take off without you and you'll FOMO in at $25. Pick your poison.

Of course, my theory of these plays states a breakdown back to lows ends the play. If it does happen, I will obviously just revise my theory so that I'm still not wrong--because I do TA how it's supposed to be done.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 5. The Long-Term Gamble**

Long-term, CLOV is still just a gamble. The delusional idiots will tell you this is a 'can't fail' investment. All investments can fail, including this one. People like the 'fall-back' position: i.e., I gambled on the short-term jump and lost, but that's okay because long-term this is a 100% winner. This is how you get ~~delusional bagholders~~ *a cult*.

At the current price level, is CLOV a good long-term gamble? It's the definition of mediocre. Will it be at $500 in ten years, 'because that's where UNH is now'? Not unless JPow initiates hyperinflation, in which case that new fleshlight you've got on your Amazon wishlist is going to be a $1000--so, you know, *bigger* problems. A more reasonable target is mid-20s (low $30s at best) within 2-5 years assuming there is no moon landing and the retail interest dies off and CLOV becomes just another ticker in the garden. The current 12-month average price target is $10.30.  Again: **This is gambling**.

There are a bunch of believers for this stock (like any ticker that gets its own sub reddit), and I think if we end up in the long-gamble, much like poor Lord Stannis, they will be in for some disappointment.

[What you thought you bought vs. What you actually bought](https://preview.redd.it/giidi4f4q7d71.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c200009a29a4702ba7ca271b799dd3dce03ade6c)

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 6. And now my Watch has begun**

I'm a bagholder. I'm not gonna lie about it, bullshit you, tell you I'm happy about it, or claim I've discovered the secret to curing your financial woes. Much like Stannis, First of His Name, Rightful King of the Seven Kingdoms, I thought I was to be the savoir of my own story and yet here I am, freezing my balls off at the Wall with a bunch flee-ridden dudes and an old lady in magic makeup, waiting to see if the cold or the ice zombies kill me first.

As you can see from my positions below, I'm not in the worst spot--not in the best, either. My odds of break-even are pretty good. I might have to wait two years to get there, but I think I'll get there even if CLOV falls off the face of the internet. My odds of doubling my money are okay, if I'm patient enough. Which I won't be... obviously. Odds of 10x in 10 years *without* the Wizardry: 0.1%, ***exactly***. Like all my trades, my entry into this position is full of shoulda, coulda, woulda's. So it is with us all.

&#x200B;

***Good luck, and may the lambos be with you.***

Edits: Spelling & grammar, per usual.

Sunday addendum:

I woke up this morning in a cold sweat, beset by the terrible realization that I had neglected to mention the single most important reason to buy CLOV:

Jim Cramer said [don't buy it](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/21/cramer-lightning-round-nokia-is-a-buy.html). He called it a ""two-leaf clover"" and said you should buy UNH instead. Pfff. Who the fuck would do that? He also called NOK a buy, so definitely buy CLOV instead NOK."

BABA's anti-trust investigation was met with little resistance from BABA. Jack Ma and BABA pretty much admitted guilt and gladly paid whatever fine to get over it. It's as if US Justice Department sues FB for anti-trust and wants to split Instagram from FB and Zuck just says ""Okay! And here is 1 billion dollar for your trouble Mr Judge."" Instead, any similar anti-trust case in US will be met with fierce resistance from big corporations and litigation will last for years or maybe decades.

DIDI, with the rumor that Chinese government is going to give them unprecedented punishment, dropped 20% today.

Overnight while all tards are sleeping tightly in the freedom country, Bloomberg reported that Chinese government is planning to turn education and online tutoring sector into **nonprofit.** It dropped the entire Chinese education sector by **50% - 70%**. RIP for EDU and TAL bagholders...

Well,  the scary thing is the public opinion in China always aligns with what the government wants to do. If you have friends in China, look up their comments on WeChat or WeiBo, they are cheering for turning education sector into non-profit.

The honeymoon with Chinese tech stocks are way over and the price Chinese stocks, even now for some, have priced in friendly, laissez faire regulation and CONTROL from the Chinese government.

And we can look at the data ""In total, more than $650 billion of market value has been erased from  the 98 stocks that make up the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index since  the gauge hit a record high in February."" - Bloomberg.

Without the regulatory pressure, I believe Chinese stocks would have been at ATH just like SPY and other indexes.

It might be the time to be greedy while the market is fearful. Chinese market is huge and with tons of growth potential for anything and everything. But maybe in the short-term until this muddy policy /  attitude shift is over, it's better to stay away from the Chinese stock to not have that gut wrenching feeling when one of your holding drops 50% overnight without any fundamental change to its business.

**FA:**

FOMC meeting is on July 28 and they will be, yet again, discussing fiscal and monetary policies. Fed funds rate could remain at <=0.25% or bump up. The rise in fed fund rate is pretty unlikely as JPow communicated that QE slowdown will precede interest rate hikes, but there's a good chance that tapering will be further discussed. US exports have climbed back to precovid numbers, US imports are higher than ever before despite DXY getting slapped meanwhile the GDP target has risen for 2021 signaling a sooner than anticipated economic recovery. Not to mention the continuous MoM CPI climbs in absurd amounts and the US operating at a massive trade deficit, all signal that tapering may start in the very near term despite JPow repeating how far we are from the economic target. However, officials have echoed on numerous fronts, the interest rate is not expected to see a hike until 2023; although, they predict that tapering plans will be announced in Fall of this year, but with everything seeming to go back to status quo sooner than expected, tapering or other bearish monetary policies could be announced and implemented shortly.

Tech earnings week is fast approaching. It’s unlikely the prices will hold when tech stocks sit at all time highs and the ER forecast for blue chips remain stagnant compared to its previous quarters.

**TA:**

TA says we’re reaching upper level resistance. Volatility is extremely high on the upside and can trigger HFT or quant funds to reduce inventory. We can expect higher levels of volatility (VIX futures that is only 1 week dte trading at roughly 20% from current levels).

[Reaching critical trend line resistance. Consider QQQ to have a upside of +1&#37; from here at $370\~$371](https://preview.redd.it/2pp016pjbzc71.png?width=1546&format=png&auto=webp&s=3248a4a2286ac3add6b4a7351682104e2ff5a773)

EWT says we’re reaching the massive correction cycle. It's the same shit when it comes to tech earnings run-up followed by the dump in spite of a decent performance.

Uncertainty creates risk and risk drives fear so the fact that ER release (granted a beat) by the blue chips might not be large enough to justify current prices, or the possible sector rotation that may ensue post ER release, or the possible tapering discussion which may change the macro, or reaching the upper level resistance of a major trend line could scare smart money away from the equity market in the near term. Call it quad witching if you will.

**QQQ ETF weighting/ER Date:** 

* AAPL - 13.39%/July 28 
* MSFT - 10.76%/July 27 
* AMZN - 10.66%/July 28

* TSLA - 3.45%/July 26

Bored of this, heard it too many times?  Not scared any more?

Well the virus and variants didn't get bored.

Reviewing the top five economies and their case trends -------------------------

Source : Worldometers.info

USA:  new cases curving upward, especially in FL

China:  they lie about their numbers

Japan:  new cases increasing at a roughly linear rate

Germany: new cases growing again, though off of a low base

France:  new cases surging and strong in the numbers, curving up

UK:  new cases surged though showing signs of starting to drop

Keeping your elder family members safe from your infecting them is still a cultural truth.

One political party in a given country wants to make another fail.  One party will weaponize the virus and threaten the other to take action.  This is what leads to restrictions.  Before it was the Democrats shutting down businesses to make the economy worse for Republicans.  Now it is the same, but Repub states will shut down and Dem states will want to keep businesses open.  In another country similar games will play out.

So all the potential economic shut downs are still there.

What is different is that all the technology that was bought to have the kids educate from home, such as tablets and web cams and online meeting subscriptions don't need to be bought a second time so soon.  So the 2nd set of restrictions on the population comes without a sector that gets an economic boost.  The exception is grocery stores and online shopping.

The extra unemployment benefits end on Sept 6th in numerous states, but investors know that and would sell effected stocks sooner.  The moratorium on evictions ends this fall, and so tenants will stop the games and scramble to pay their landlords, taking away their spending money.  If they don't they will get an eviction on their credit record.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

Now to valuations

[https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe)

shows that the Schiller PE ratio of stocks is 38.3.  The .com bubble was the highest it ever got, higher than this level for 2.5 years, and getting to the mid 40's.  Other then that, at no time in history was this valuation ratio this high.

Note also that in 1982 at the peak of interest rates 13 to 14%, the average stock had a PE of 7 to 9.

A book by O'Shoughnessy ""What Works on Wall Street"" studied 40 years of stock market data.  Its results shows that a price to sales ratio is 'the king of value factors', since sales can't be manipulated like earnings can.

[https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales)

shows that this valuation is higher now than at any time charted.  The book suggests that a price to sales of 1.5 is considered a good deal.  We are over twice that level on average.

The market breadth has eroded under the mega techs.  Not the Russel 2000 declined recently.

Here are the price to sales of the mega techs, using data at Reuters.  This can be hard to find in navigation, but a direct link will help, for example

[https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.N](https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.N)

use .N and .O at the end of the symbol for NYSE and NASDAQ.

price to sales:

MSFT = 13.3 ; FB = 10.4 ; AAPL = 7.5 ; AMZN = 4.3 ; GOOG = 8.76 ; NVDA = 25.2 ; AMD = 9.5

These clearly can fall and still be overvalued.

Some have sighted the growth in the money supply, such as M2, as part of what has pushed the market higher.  However, it is important to note that M2 was recategorized in 2020.  So even though you can go to the Mises Institute's site and see articles of big increases in the M2 money supply, much of that is due to the recategorization and strangely the articles omit this but for a footnote.

Inflation ----------------------------------------------

A large part of what we pretend to understand about inflation is the CPI and PCE.

We think that we know that the last CPI reading was 5.4%.  That is above the target of 2% of course when action by the recipe is needed.  This coupled with Powell not wanting to raise rates and desiring to de-prioritize inflation is ""bad enough"" from a stock perspective.  Jim Cramer described Powell as ""having a heart"" in wanting to prioritize helping people back to work.  Recall that interest rates have to be jacked up in response to inflation eventually.  Acting to late makes it worse.  From business school texts, higher interest rates put downward pressure on the value of future earnings.  Thus the forward looking value of stocks drops.

  But I challenge all of you to take the CPI by its percentage components and REBUILD it yourself with online research.  I did.  While the published number was +1.6% year over year at the time, I found no component less than 2%, and most were a good deal higher.  It is easy to find information showing education expenses rising at a +5% annual rate for many years.  Medical costs I found web sites saying +4% annually consistantly over many years.  At the time, only oil was lower than 2% price growth.  Today, with oil back up above $70 a barrel, that is not to be taken lightly.

  Recently the Fed has emphasized the PCE, the Personal Consumption Expendatures index.  Do you find as I do it strange that they publish the 'this month vs last month' number, making it look like small 0.1 to 0.3% rise, and not the more useful year over year number, which would show a larger % increase?

  The National Debt takes no small part in the desire to have inflation be low and keep interest rates low.  But that combination is impossible over time.

  I have been at individual stock investing since 1996 and I have sold most of my stock holdings.  I lived through the .com crash which I took on the chin (with small dollars since I was young and I learned from it such that I was 66% in cash for the crash of 2008.  If you have not been in the habit of thinking about economic impacts, valuations, and questioning what real inflation is, it is certainly time to start.

  The great bull market of the 1980's in the USA was spurred by the acceleration of women entering the work force and the personal computer.  The great bull market of the 1990's was spurred by implementation of the internet, immigration, and foreign economies developing.

  What is the story now?  5G networking is just a faster version of the same thing, but only over shorter distances.  Artificial intelligence is intended to replace humans.  Electric vehicles only reduce pollution after 100k miles according to an article in the WSJ.  I think to move on to much higher valuations we need a big economic story that just isn't there right now."

**Low market breadth and divergence:** there are fewer stocks rising versus ones declining, and a larger number of stocks are hitting the 52 week low than the ones hitting the 52 week high. 

**Overbought stocks:** such as AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, NVDA, and ARKK all have recently breached the 70 RSI overbought marker and are now dropping fast. This ties in well with the poor market breadth as allot of the money existing other stocks as they sell off is just pilling in few top stocks in an unstained way, hence the overbought flag. 

**Reduced volumes:** signal weakness in the market and provoke profit taking. For example the Russell 2000 average volume has dropped to just under 3 billion per day from a three months average of 3.7 billion. Incidentally this index tracks 2,000 small cap US companies which have been dropping for most of the last 3 weeks for a total decline of 7.3% thus far. 

**Major trend line broken:** for the second time in less than one month the S&P 500 has dipped under its major trend line. The first time on May 18th, it reversed and went back up on the back of decent labor and production reports plus earnings expectations. Now that earnings are underway and most economic indicators are pointing to growth peaking it might not be able to reverse the drop. 

Obviously all of the above are technical indicators that try to explain market behavior based on historical metrics, but they don’t explain the reasons behind such changes. We have to look at economic news to identify causes including: 

**Peaking economic recovery:** several reports this month point to an economy that has reached peak recovery. For example, both the services PMI 64.6 vs 65.2 vs 64.8 (actual, forecast, previous) and ISM 60.1% vs 63.3% vs 64.0% reports for June show a declining rate of expansion. Also, industrial production is showing similar pattern 0.4% vs 0.6% vs 0.7%.

**Mixed Q2 banking results:** also point to the same issue above. While the overall figures are up, the details point to absence of loan growth and net interest margin weakness. 

**Declining consumer sentiment:** while consumer spending came in higher than expected for the month of June consumer sentiment declined from 85.5 to 80.8. The main driver behind this is inflation.  

**Inflation rising:** the FED has been harping on inflation being transitory because of the “base effect” and some temporary supply constraints. Their timeline for all of that to sort out was few months. Now it’s more than few months and inflation continues to rage registering the highest figures in over a decade with Core CPI (the Fed’s favorite metric) registering 0.9%, the highest increase since 2008.

Furthermore, the PPI (producer price index) also continues to rise at a rate of 1% in June indicating that consumers are still going to see higher prices in the coming months and that overall inflation will overshoot the FED’s 2% threshold by a wide margin. 

**Reemergence of a new variant:**  the delta variant is causing allot of lock downs and interruption throughout the world. While its effect in the US might be limited, a slowing world economy does not bode well for stocks in general, hence perhaps the reason why bonds have gone up. 

**Bond yields going down:** usually indicates that an economy is slowing and investors are looking for safer assists. Many have pointed out that bond yields usually peak 3 months in advance of the stock which they did in March. Since we are in July and bond yield continue to decline many think the bond market is sniffing out something and reacting to it. Remember, the inverse relation between bonds and yields. 

**China’s Crack on tech:** has rattled some investors especially that it came at a time when that market was showing sign of bottoming out. 

All of those events point to a possible correction sometime in the near future. Most experts expect that sometime after Q2 earnings, but it could be starting as we speak, especially that corrections don’t play out in one straight line. They tend to move in a series of several lower lows and lower highs until bottoming out. 

It’s important to also point out that a correction is not a market crash. Corrections are a much smaller event, ranging around a -10% drop on the low end for the leading S&P 500 index and much more for individual speculative stocks. They are a healthy event that helps reinvigorate the market with new buyers. 

A crash on the other hand is a much larger event that’s usually provoked by a combination of events or a single major event. Crashes usually last much longer than people expect, well past the initial large drop. 

There are several catalysts for such an event such as the emergence of a virus variant that outsmarts vaccines or a collapse in the reverse repurchase facility. The most prominent of them however, is QE tapering (quantitative easing) and increase in interest rates. 

Massive QE and low interest rates have been the driving force behind this bull market. They are the justification given for the current astronomical valuation where the S&P500 Shiller P/E ratio is reaching a whopping 38%! That is a historic high only second to the Dotcom bubble in 2000 (44%) and is in general an unsustainable level in the long term. 

Some argue that the FED will manage to taper QE and increase interest rates gradually in a very controlled manner and avoid any meltdown, but given rising inflation beyond expectations, the FED might very well be forced to act much sooner than it would like. Equities and bonds expert Ray Dalio explains this process in his most recent video on YouTube."

The nature of technology is that of exponential progress. If you were to review the latest greatest tech of each era, it would be plainly obvious just how fast things evolve. TV to VCR to Walkman to Playstation to VR. The next new tech of today often makes the last thing look ridiculous. Even if you were to look year to year, you would witness growth that reaches far beyond any other sector. I'm going to make a few quick cases for technology being the highest value, highest growth, and simply the best investment of the next decades and beyond.

1. **It is being subsumed by everything.**

Technology is no longer a separate entity. Recently Bank of America claimed they are really a tech company. That's kind of a stretch, but the point is taken. Everyone has incorporated tech into their business model. Tech is what makes things cheaper, easier, more efficient, cleaner. And any company with intention of surviving is rapidly adopting technology into their models.

2)  **It was fairly stagnant for a very long stretch.**

If you look at QTEC or any of the other technology ETF's you'll see a ten year period from 2006 to 2016 where the value of tech more or less doubled. Doubling your money in ten years is nothing to sneeze at. However, if you look over the next 5 years, from 2016 to 2021, tech more than tripled from there. There are many who might claim that makes tech overvalued, but I look at it as more as coming into a 'catching up' phase. Tech brought a lot of prosperity to the world from 1970's to today. That was not properly reflected in share prices until recently. I think you could make a case that, especially when considering point 1 above, tech is still vastly undervalued. If tech was to disappear, it would not only be companies like Apple, Microsoft, Palantir, etc that would fall, but the value of every company on earth would fall as well. Ask yourself: How much prosperity on the S&P over the past couple decades can be directly attributed to tech?

3)  **The future depends on technology.**

If you were to ask someone what are the most sensitive issues going forward, you might hear things such as energy concerns, climate change, security, food shortage, water shortage, pollution. You'd hear a lot more answers as well. How will they be solved? To make an argument outside of technological disruption would be laughed at, and for good reason. We've hit an inflection point where all the problems we've gotten ourselves into can be solved only by technology. Will it happen? There are concerns around the viability of technology to solve our issues at the speed necessary. But what is the alternative?

**Conclusion**

Technology will almost certainly experience a pullback at some point over the next few years. It could be now, next month, next year: no one knows that. But what is almost certain is that for a young investor, technology is very likely to be the best investment you could make. Fintech, genomics, AI, VR, AR, cybersecurity, agriculture, EV tech, this list goes on. What are the chances these things do not play a gigantic role in our futures?

All opinions are welcome. I'd encourage people to stick to mature discourse since this thread is kind of lacking it at times. I'm really curious to hear any supporting or differentiating opinions. Thanks!"

Trading MSFT calls is like printing money. There is a clear pattern here and I figure some of y'all might need some inspiration.

I go to sleep when the market opens and I wake up after it closes and I've still make a bunch of money off MSFT.

When to go in you might be asking? Wait for a sell off and go in on 2/3 week out options itm, or if you are feeling spicy load up on otm calls your choice. It's not a 10x stock, but most of you use that as an excuse to go -99%. Take this easy win."
ok4l9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ok4l9c/i_analyzed_the_performance_of_companies_in_the/,I analyzed the performance of companies in the “best places to work list” over the past 10 years and benchmarked it against S&P 500. Here are the results.,700,122,2021-07-14 21:42:01,"**Preamble:** Every year Fortune publishes the top 100 companies to work for in the world. The results are based on an anonymous survey conducted on over half a million employees.

I wanted to check whether companies where people are the happiest to work produced better returns for their shareholders when compared to the market. My hypothesis is based on two assumptions

a. An employee would create his/her best possible output when they truly love the place they work

b. Companies with excellent culture would create a feedback loop to attract top talent by word of mouth and referrals.

I feel that both of these factors would contribute to the company innovating over their competitors and creating outsized investor returns.

**Data:** There are a lot of players that create the best companies to work for list. I chose Fortune as they are the most established company and have been doing this over the past 20 years. Their survey sample size is also very high (more than 5,00,000 anonymous responders), which would give us a fair representation and minimize the chances of false positives.

For this analysis, I took companies present in the best places to work for list in the last 10 years (2012-2021). But, not all the companies on the list are public and listed. So, the current analysis will only focus on the companies whose shares are listed.

All the data used in the analysis is shared in a Google sheet at the end.

**Analysis Methodology:** Every year Fortune publishes its result on the 2nd week of February. I have considered two different ways to invest in the best companies to work

a. You invest in the company as soon as the list comes out and hold for 1 year and then sell and repeat this every year

b. You invest in the company and hold (This is based on the assumption that company culture does not change year over year and once the company makes it into a list, it’s a good long-term investment)

Returns from the above strategies are then compared to the S&P 500 returns \[1\] over the same period.

**Results**

https://preview.redd.it/fxgwbdq9m6b71.png?width=1032&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a26a48dd0922c14776c97a6fab8ba706315aadd

The companies in the best places to work consistently beat S&P500 in stock returns. There is a noticeable difference in return as you move up the list with the best place to work (Rank-1) beating the market comfortably by 9.5% every year! \[2\]. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/uxfqsqebm6b71.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=93e4c7d47160e3accf8fbc845417413ef3e367a4)

The difference in returns becomes more noticeable if you buy and hold the company for the long term. Here we can see a steady increase in returns as you move up the ranking ladder with the top company returning a whopping 131.5% more than the index over the last 10 years. This also validates our assumption that companies having great cultures create superior investor returns over the long term.

Now that it’s out of the way, we can dive deeper into the data and find out which stocks made the best returns and how your returns would have faired over the years.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/4s97sp3dm6b71.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f5aa6f005cc1f72f5acb30c5f15180567ac27a0)

The best long-term return among the top companies to work for was generated by Adobe! The stock has returned 1762% over the last 10 years. As expected, tech companies have generated the most amount of returns with Microsoft, Google, and Adobe all present multiple times.

For our final analysis, we can check if the returns were consistent throughout the years or was it just a few years that are contributing to the overall positive results.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/tcry8ieem6b71.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=48368f25abadca99ca2f9e7ba0184b10b3b45d13)

I think this graph shows one of the most important takeaways from this analysis. As we can see best companies to work for have beaten SPY by a considerable margin in 8 out of the 10 years (80%) of our analysis timeframe. Even in the years that our strategy did not beat the market, the difference between the returns was negligible.

**Conclusion**

No matter how you slice it, the above analysis shows that companies that are exceptional places to work create exceptional returns to their shareholders.

I think this ties in nicely with our initial hypothesis that companies having great culture will have happy employees that create the best possible results and also would attract top talent. Both of these in turn would lead to market-beating shareholder returns.

Now you know what to do when the next year's results come out!

**Footnotes**

\[1\] I have considered the benchmark as S&P500 as the Best Companies to Work for list contains companies across industries and I think that S&P500 is a fairer representation of the overall list.

\[2\] 6 out of the last 10 years, the top company to work for was Google.

Activision Blizzard (ATVI) is the video game holding company responsible for the biggest hits in gaming including Candy Crush, Call of Duty, Diablo, Hearthstone, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, among many others. The company is one of the oldest third-party video game developers. It has a successful track record  that rivals the industry giants like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo. The company survived the great fall of revenue in the gaming industry in the mid-80s and came back strong years later. In the 90s Bobby Kotick bought the company and has been CEO ever since. Kotick is actually the longest-tenured CEO of an S&P 500 company. It's safe to say that Activision Blizzard has solid and reputable management.

The success of the company is mostly attributed to quality acquisitions of gaming studios. We're talking Activision, Blizzard Entertainment, King Digital Entertainment, Infinity War, Sledgehammer Games, Toys for Bob, Treyarch, and Vicarious Visions. If you don't know of or have played a game created by one of these names you are living under a rock, under a boulder, under a mountain. Video games produced by these studios have revolutionized their genres and the industry as a whole.

Countless hit games results in countless sales. The companies EBITDA has grown pretty steadily over the last 6 years and is forecasted to grow even faster over the next 4 years. EBITDA in 2014 was $1.5B. EBITDA in 2020 was $3.3B. EBITDA in 2024 is estimated to be $5.7B.

The semi-conductor ""chip"" shortage has created a great opportunity to invest in ATVI. Let's look at the numbers in a different way. Sony's PS5 sales within the first year are at 7.8 million units compared to the PS4 which sold 7.6 million units in the first year, and it hasn't even been a full year since the release of the PS5. The Xbox Series X is the same story but we don't know the numbers. 7.8 million units is not even the full potential of the PS5 sales. Sony and Microsoft have been stalled by the chip shortage. Gaming consoles have been selling out much faster than the companies can produce them. That being said, the chip shortage should calm down and Sony and Microsoft are doubling production. Limitless hype + double production = double sales.

But remember, I'm not suggesting anyone buys Sony or Microsoft in this thread. I'm suggesting you buy Activision Blizzard. The latest generation gaming consoles are equipped with SSD, AMD CPUs, and AMD GPUs that allow for ray tracing technology. The ceiling that limited the gaming experience has been shattered. Games will be more realistic, beautiful, fun, immersive, and addicting than ever before. Activision Blizzard makes the best games. Activision Blizzard's video game releases and sales are partially dependent on the gaming consoles reaching maximum sales.

The video game industry has changed drastically. The growth in the population of gamers and the diverse age groups that game today will slingshot the industry to a $300B market sooner than you might think. Adolescent kids, young adults, and older people that don't have jobs spend hours playing Call of Duty. Stay-at-home moms stare at their phone screens without breaks and relentlessly swipe their credit cards for more lives in Candy Crush. Everyone loves Activision Blizzard games.

Take a look at the technicals. Two years after the release of the last generation of gaming consoles (PS4 and Xbox One) ATVI stock price doubled. Less than five years after the aforementioned release the stock price quadrupled.  Following a sharp dip in late 2018 the stock traded a wide base. The price then broke out from a C&H trend in late 2020 and has recently formed a bull flag. Currently, the stock is consolidating and should soon bounce off long-term support and break out from that bull flag. The stock is primed for a rally. My price target before the end of the year is +130.00.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR** 

There has never been a more exciting time for the gaming industry and Activision Blizzard is a great company with an impressive portfolio. 

I bought shares of ATVI this morning at 92.95 to start a position and I'm looking to add more over the next couple months. I'm also looking to buy LEAPS but I have only glanced at the option chain. I don't suggest short dated options."

Hope all of you had a blast on the 4th. Even though the market finished at new ATH this week, major US stock indexes fell by nearly 1% on Thursday before rebounding on Friday, recovering the previous day’s losses and then some. Also, given that we are entering earnings season, Wall Street is expecting the biggest quarterly earnings growth in a decade \[1\]. Overall, the discussion volume across social media was muted this week due to the dropping stock prices for the most popular stocks.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/lopqx8zb7la71.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c63a005bfa54b2dfedcf94aca1d3346d6215244)

This unusual flip-flop of the market this week caused increasing chatter about SPY. This is the first time where SPY became the most discussed stock. GME, AMC, and WISH continue to be the top 3 discussed stocks with almost similar discussion volume. Newcomer’s to the list include Newegg following their 143% stock price rally last week and DiDi and Alibaba Group following the Chinese crackdown on tech companies.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/lctpkzbf7la71.png?width=1195&format=png&auto=webp&s=e38b966eebc8a8dbee01c5ef5d4246f4e165653e

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.

**Newegg Commerce($NEGG):** NEGG stock has more than doubled this week ending 143% higher than last week. While there is no concrete reason why NEGG was soaring, one catalyst was the availability of option-based trading that started in early July. But, retail investors are extremely skeptical regarding the current rise as reflected in the stock sentiment (-0.2%).

**Amazon($AMZN):** Amazon was trending due to its deal with Comcast. Under the deal, Amazon would now be able to offer recent live-action Universal movie releases. Adding to this, the speculations surrounding Bezo’s and Branson’s space race are also spilling over to the stock.

**DiDi Global($DIDI):** DIDI stock took a hard tumble following the Chinese crackdown on tech stocks. Beijing has now put DiDi under cybersecurity review and has also banned it from accepting new users. Adding to this, it has also directed app stores to stop offering DiDi’s app. The news also caused sell-off across Chinese tech stocks with Alibaba dropping 5% and NIO dropping 11%. According to a rough calculation from a new partnership formed by the Rhodium Group and the Atlantic Council, as much as $45 trillion in new capital flows into and out of China by 2030 would be stopped due to the rising regulations.

**Microsoft($MSFT):** MSFT was trending as the stock had a nice rally till Wednesday before dropping. Adding to this, the Department of Defense announced that it is killing off its controversial Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, cloud-computing project. This was one of the military’s largest technology contracts ($10B) that MSFT won in 2019.

**Honorable Mentions:** Alibaba Group($BABA) chatter went up 60% following the Chinese crackdown on tech stocks and Boeing($BA) was trending (+67% chatter) following the willingness of Chinese aviation officials to conduct flight tests on Boeing Co's 737 MAX, potentially paving the way for the fastest-selling jet's return in China.

ohzght,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ohzght/there_is_no_stopping_oracle_from_hitting_100/,There is no stopping Oracle from Hitting 100$.,6,26,2021-07-11 14:38:04,"$ORCL is currently at all time highs and is breaking out with 3% moves for the past few days. Here's a few reasons why I think this will keep going and if you do not want to miss another MSFT or AMZN, you should buy Oracle.

&#x200B;

1. Oracle is extremely undervalued with a P/E of 19.19 as a Cloud/Software company.  Usually Cloud/Software companies like Microsoft or Google have P/es in the high 30s/40s.
2. Oracle does massive stock buybacks with them announcing a 20 billion stock repurchase plan this year as well as having a dividend yield of 1.46% which is way higher than AAPL or MSFT.
3. Oracle is growing massively with 8% YoY growth from last year yet they are being priced as a boomer company
4. With the recent JEDI news being cancelled now Oracle has a shot of receiving this contract which should also boost stock price.  [https://www.barrons.com/articles/oracle-stock-defense-cloud-contract-51625863023](https://www.barrons.com/articles/oracle-stock-defense-cloud-contract-51625863023)
5. Stocks love round numbers. When was the last time you saw a stock at 80 or 90 and eventually never hit 100? Almost never. Stocks love to hit round numbers.
6. Options are extremely cheap on oracle with them sometimes being less than 10 cents even though the stock is at 80$ currently. This means there is alot of gamma squeeze potential with Oracle as it is extremely cheap to buy OTM options for Oracle and thus force MM's to buy shares.

&#x200B;

Tl;dr: Oracle is an extremely undervalued Cloud/ Software company that is currently breaking out right now with an extremely high chance of hitting 100 very soon. I would recommend buying calls on Oracle as they are currently very cheap with them being a few cents each for OTM calls."

Discount can be attributed to lockup expiry and growth stocks getting killed in general. SNOW found support at roughly $184 in mid May and has bounced 27% since. I still love the entry point. SNOW has a crucial competitive advantage of efficiently crunching data from multiple lakes. Not even MSFT or Amazon have that same capability of compiling data from multiple lakes. That is why almost 40% of the Fortune 500 companies use Snowflake. 

Released their plan to reach 10B in revenue by the year 2029 which would be a compounded annual growth rate of 44%. Huge things in store for this company and the price where it’s at today is too good to pass up.

Lovely cup and handle forming on the 3 month chart. RSI has been steady as it’s been consolidating lately. This is due for a breakout higher."

As I type these hallowed words, I am wearing Sony XM-4s and bumping my 7 TeraByte folder of Playboi Carti leaks. Please see below my thoughts on the cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike, which trades on the Nasdaq as $CRWD.

The Kaseya ransomware attack this weekend affected 17 countries and 200 businesses. Cyberattacks are growing more and more frequent. Surely you've seen the news reports. Cyberattacks are also growing more and more sophisticated, so much so that they can even infiltrate American government agencies. The $750B the Pentagon gets every year wasn't enough to prevent that.

The consequences include breaches of sensitive user data and trade secrets, operational shut downs, and millions lost to paying ransoms. So, clearly, preventing these attacks is in the best interest of everyone from CEOs to Presidents to Winnie the Pooh looking ass dictators. Clearly they need to spend more. Cybersecurity products and services are going from ""nice to have"" to ""gotta get it"" status real fucking quick.

**Business Model**

CrowdStrike is the first of its kind among cybersecurity companies. Incumbents like Palo Alto Networks, Symantec, and even FireEye (FireEye has a lot of respect in the public sector) are all Dotcom era dinosaurs. 

That's because CrowdStrike is a cloud-native SaaS that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to prevent attacks. That enough buzzwords for you? 

Forrester, Gartner, MIT, and Google (an early investor) and many other reputable sources have called CrowdStrike leader in endpoint protection. The cloud-nativity has allowed it to strike partnerships to integrate with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=f4fb055a-5333-4b6e-8d8b-a4143ad7f6c7) and [Google Cloud](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiuodTa-srxAhXaAnIKHcIlAPQQFjAAegQIBhAD&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.google.com%2Fpress-releases%2F2021%2F0506%2Fcrowdstrike-google-cloud&amp;usg=AOvVaw0GTGScrx6huf5ULshEqTDA). CrowdStrike can just piggyback off their explosive growth.

**The Bull Case**

According to Grand View Research, the global [cyber security services market](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/cyber-security-service-market?utm_source=prnewswire&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ICT_13-Apr-21&amp;utm_term=cyber-security-service-market&amp;utm_content=rd) size is expected to reach USD 192.70 billion by 2028.

I say the true opportunity is even bigger, because they haven't factored in all out cyberwar between America and the evil trinity of Russia/Iran/China. State-backed cyberattacks are nothing new. Remember North Korea and Sony back when the JamesFranco-SethRogen masterpiece *The Interview* came out?  Or remember when [Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/09/10/cyberattacks-us-elections-trump-biden/) reported that foreign hackers were trying to compromise the 2020 elections? Remember when [China agreed to invest $400B](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/27/world/middleeast/china-iran-deal.html) in Iran's tech sector?

Want more proof? Just look at the [FBI's webpage](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/cyber/news) for cyberattack press releases, there's a fuckton. [Recent research](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252499042/Nation-state-cyber-attacks-double-in-three-years) estimates that state-backed cyberattacks have doubled in the last three years.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Geopolitical tensions will of course continue to heat up. This is because humans are just a bunch of glorified, nuclear-powered apes. We will see stronger legislation mandating that businesses armor the fuck up. We will see outsized and reactionary government spending on cybersecurity. We will also likely see tax-payer funded incentives and subsidies directed toward cybsersecurity firms.

**Management**

When I worked in venture capital for a summer, I realized just how important the management team is to potential investors. And CrowdStrike lives up to all expectations in this area.

George Kurtz, the CEO and Co-Founder of CrowdStrike has a track record of CyberSecurity success. His startup Foundstone was acquired by McAfee in 2004, after which he worked his way up the ranks to become the CTO of McAfee. Clearly, this guy knows what the fuck he's doing. He's no sleazy salesman, he's a princely technocrat.

The Chief Strategy Officer used to be the Executive Assistant Director of the FBI’s Criminal, Cyber, Response and Services Branch. I'd bet my house that this white male has many white male friends in high places. Friends who'd gladly toss him a contract or two.

The rest of the C-Suite are all cyber veterans, even the CFO. It's a who's who of hacker nerds who saw the light.

**Financials**

Who the fuck cares.

Okay fine, I care a little.

Here's an overview of Q1FY22 results: Revenue increased 70% YoY, which reflects 82% growth in subscription customers. They had a net loss of $85M only because they are investing aggressively in growth and R&amp;D. At the end of the day they have $1.7B cash on hand to weather any shitstorms.

The customer relationships are deep and broad. Recurring revenue is over $1B. Furthermore, existing customers end up buying more and more products from CrowdStrike as time goes on. 64% of customers have now adopted four or more CrowdStrike products into their subscription. And it's not like companies who need to cut costs are going to get rid of their cybersecurity provider.

**Conclusion**

Why buy a shitass SPAC for upside? $CRWD is a litass business with the world at its feet.

**TLDR:** Lick lick lick my balls

Sources: Most recent 10-Q, company website, Cybersecurity news reports on Financial Times, my friends in tech and the public sector, *Mindfuck* by Christopher Wylie, *1984* by Georgei Orwellovski, *The Communist Manifesto* by Karl Marx, and -- most important of all -- the tingling in my balls

Position: Shares for now because all my liquid savings are going toward rent, but I've got a sweetass summer internship and I promise to YOLO my next paycheck into this. Buy calls, shits finna rip Tuesday.

Learn to use your brain.,11174,2543,2021-07-05 01:03:18,"I’m just an autist that wants to help my fellow dudes make money. Have I been guilty of this in the past? Absolutely. In my post history you’ll definitely find me shilling for CLOV. Stupid piece of shit CLOV. 

Turns out, you’ll find most of these stocks are shorted FOR A REASON. THEY SUCK ASS. THINK YOU DAMN APES, THINK. 

AMC and GME actually did squeeze. But those are RARE exceptions. And they totally poisoned this sub with a bunch of Neanderthals looking for the next short squeeze. Stop. Get help. It feels like we’ve had 5 years worth of short squeezes in the last few months. It’s over. 

Why should you listen to a random nobody yelling at you on the internet? Because. People are making money out there while you baghold these crap stocks. SPY at an all time high. You coulda made more $$ playing Microsoft or Apple. 

Or actually, don’t stop. Lose your money please. And then fuck off to your lonely 9-5 daily cocksucking for that $500 weekly paycheck. And never come to this sub again. So I don’t have to read your bullshit. I just want to wake up, pull out my phone, and not see your dumb ass. Your wife/girlfriend however is invited. 

So, want to know why your “short squeeze” DD isn’t working?! Here’s the difference- AMC and GME are household names. If you want retail to pile on? It’s gotta be a household name. Retail loves nostalgia. They love familiarity. 

So is it a retail squeeze, or can you get the big bois on board? Here’s some facts for ya- they don’t need your shit DD. They have Bloomberg Terminals. They have 100x more data than we do, and they see it before we do, in real time, and they play market rotations and earnings. They’re not googling 1 week old short interest data. They got the real time shit. They play this game on another level. And if you can’t get them on board, and the stock isn’t a household name, then you fucked up. 

So this is what I’m saying- I blame all you fucks for missing plays like NKE last week. 

Come on. NKE was a fucking given. It was written on the wall in neon letters and most of us missed it. 

TL;DR- want to make money? You can be a millionaire without ever touching a short squeeze. 

Fucking rookie ass bitches.

EDIT MOTHERFUCKERS- 

Somehow my rant, which I thought would get me banned or downvoted to hell, has made it to the top in just a few hours. 

Sure, the comments are trying to wreck me. I also got a Reddit admin notice asking if I need mental health help lmao. Got a good chuckle out of that one. Fucking trolls. 

But you can see this is a place where we can still say fuck this short interest bullshit. And we can still find others who agree. I’m ok with conflict as long as nobody gets banned or their comments deleted. 

When you try to have a counter opinion on most subreddits you get insta-banned. So I’m just happy we have some freedom to talk shit here and disagree openly. It’s fun. Appreciate it you cunts. 

I know it won’t stop the shilling but 🤷🏻‍♂️. Let’s get some real fucking DD in here. Fuck short squeezes. It’s too easy for people to come in and manipulate this crowd on SI news.

FINAL EDIT- mods flair me. What’s it take? Who’s dick I gotta suck?"

The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. I have also added the Week-on-Week stock price change due to popular requests. 

Happy Independence day to all of you! S&P 500 hit a new high (1.7% WoW increase) following Friday’s strong job report (U.S. economy added 850,000 jobs, the most in 10 months). This marks S&P 500 rise for the 7th straight day, the longest winning streak since last August. Even though the market had a strong rally, almost all the popular stocks took a significant beating in the past week.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/3q1rkh0my6971.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a33ca58866f42a1a9368919fd3e785ce5b96da4)

This is the first time where all the popular stocks except SPY ended in red the same week. This week's stock returns also illustrate the need for effective diversification of your portfolio!

WISH continues to be the most discussed stock, but its sentiment took a significant beating following the 17% drop in the stock price in the past week (dropped to 4% from 46%). The best performing stock on the list was BlackBerry which almost recovered all its losses following the company’s earnings report. A newcomer to the top 10 list is Virgin Galactic following the announcement that its next spaceflight test will carry founder Sir Richard Branson.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.

**Micron Technology($MU):** MU released its [Q3 quarter results](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-technology-inc-reports-results-third-quarter-fiscal-2021) on June 30th, beating both revenue and EPS estimates. Even though the company had strong quarterly results, the stock tumbled 5% following the earnings due to raising capital expenditure forecast. Investors believe that this is just a minor blip as the company has reported impressive revenue growth of 36% (YoY) and a gross margin of 42% and MU can expect strong demand from the data center, PC and graphics, mobile markets.

**Virgin Galactic($SPCE):** SPCE had a wild week with the stock jumping 23% on Friday after the company announced that its next spaceflight test will carry Richard Branson. The launch is expected to take place on July 11th and marks an attempt to beat Jeff Bezos after he announced that his company (Blue Origin) will have its first passenger spaceflight on July 20th. SPCE stock, in general, had wild swings this year with the stock climbing above $60 in February and then falling as low as $15 in May.

**Vuzix Corp($VUZI):** VUZI is considered to be at the forefront of the wearable smart eyeglasses industry. The company was generating discussions as it gained almost 8% mid-week before dropping down. Investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock as reflected by its sentiment. The stock has experienced very large swings this year with it starting at $8 in Jan and rallying up to $30 in April before dropping down to its current level of $17. Still, the stock is up 109% YTD.

**Paysafe($PSFE):** Paysafe is a payment platform that enables payment processing, digital wallet, and online cash solutions. The company is trending as it had recently announced its partnership with Microsoft and is now enabling online cash transactions on Microsoft Store. Adding to this, the company also announced an expanded partnership with FOX Bet.

**NIO Inc($NIO):** Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer NIO has now climbed more than 20% in the last month. This strong rally is generating more discussions about the stock. In addition to this, analysts’ recommendation has also become more bullish for the stock with Citigroup‘s Jeff Chung issuing a price target of $72 from the current $50 level. This is predominantly driven by the company’s excellent shipment volume, with NIO confirming they have delivered 8,000+ vehicles in June and 21,896 vehicles for the entire second quarter.

**Honorable Mentions:** ZIM Integrated Shipping($ZIM) got a boost in mentions following [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oakw8w/zim_pirates_of_the_zimmabean_dead_mans_dd/) excellent Due Diligence that was posted on wallstreetbets which showcased the company is a good long-term play. Intellia Therapeutics($NTLA) was also trending following their announcement that they have successfully corrected a hereditary disease ATTR amyloidosis, with a single infusion of CRISPR, a programmable gene-editing tool. The stock jumped 50% on the news but dropped down to a 15% gain over the last week.

Thank you for reading and hope you enjoyed this week's analysis!

A few weeks ago I began posting on AMD. At the time, the stock was trading in the mid-70's.

Today, as expected, we crossed $90 price... but our trip is just getting **STARTED**!

The deal with TESLA was announced, as well as the next AMAZING technologies in Computex, including the stacked cache for Zen3, Fidelity FX Super Resolution, the 6900 XTX Liquid Cooled, etc.

There's a very simple reason why AMD will go past the MOON and MARS: **ENTERTAINMENT**

The world revolves around entertainment and in this new era, this activity is mandatory to deal with Covid-19, the lack of international travel, work from home, etc.

TESLA adopting AMD for its new Model X and S is HUGE. It will take a Navi23 and an APU (two chips) per car, likely becoming an optional for all other vehicles in the future. More automobile brands will follow, as TESLA is leading the way in the industry.

&#x200B;

[TESLA selected AMD chips for its upcoming vehicles](https://preview.redd.it/aekg7gm3u8871.jpg?width=2243&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c178f47df42b4159f92d1248ac9618a3f8440643)

With autonomous driving, gaming in a long trip will be mandatory. But even without it, the rest of the passengers can game, either with their fellow companions or online, from their car.

So, yes, the current automotive revolution will have AMD as a main supplier.

Then you have consumer processing, which includes CPU's and GPU's, where AMD is dominating (mostly on the former). The Zen3 architecture is a MONSTER. Intel just cannot compete. And with the stacked cache providing up to 15% more gaming performance, that lead will continue on AMD's side.

On GPU's, AMD's Navi31 is expected to be MCM (multi-chip module), aiming to repeat AMD's success with Intel, but now against NVIDIA. ""Chiplets"" allow for economies of scale to thrive. More silicon, with less defects, better binning, cheaper... it is an AMAZING IDEA. Just add cache and the latency problem can be mitigated.

On console gaming, AMD is the undisputed KING. They're in the PS4, PS4 Pro, PS5, Xbox model and series X/S. Also in the Aya Neo and expected in Valve's next handheld, which will be a MONSTER.

On Datacenter, AMD is groundbreaking. Epyc and the new offerings from **GOOGLE** for virtual machines is an INCREDIBLE deal. **AMAZON, TENCENT, ALIBABA, AZURE** (Microsoft), they are all buying chips from AMD. More CORES means MORE power processing, lower energy, lower licensing costs and certainly better SECURITY (as INTEL has been plagued by Spectre & Meltdown issues). AMD is now expected to go from 64 cores in EPYC to 96... and also 128. That's just ludicrous, 128 CORES and 256 threads. And X86 clients are THRILLED to buy more power in a more efficient chip.

[Google wants AMD Milan Epyc Chips for its Datacenter](https://preview.redd.it/36x8ygt6u8871.jpg?width=2284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d96e3eab884218203d9fbe906b9ba3474902e13)

Deals with the US Department of Energy (El Capitan), Singapore and Germany, all for public datacenters worth millions of dollars. That's just the tip of the iceberg, as private players are taking note of EPYC.

Last, **but certainly NOT least: MOBILE**

AMD will power Samsung's S22 flagship phone. Its GPU is expected to break records, as engineering samples already have it beating MALI and Apple's options, by **double digits**.

**Samsung** is delighted and **Google** also wants AMD chips for its phones.

&#x200B;

[Samsung wants AMD's chips for its flagship GALAXY S22](https://preview.redd.it/xu07hgobu8871.jpg?width=1919&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dfea79ba818835fb83a9cb5f51d5189cf2d034e0)

But enough on the PRODUCTS. What about the fundamentals?

Revenue growth is expected at 50% by the end of 2021. How many companies are growing by 50%?

And that guidance was provided with the Q1 results in April, which were exceeding expectations. AMD raised the guidance from 37% to 50%... and will certainly BEAT IT.

AMD is NOW a profitable company... and it literally CANNOT keep its products on shelves, as its clients are buying ALL THEIR CHIPS.

AMD's valuation is $110 billion, while NVIDIA (w/slightly more revenue & profit) is $500 billion.

How is NVIDIA 5 times the value of AMD???... Just because of a stock split?

It is currently trading at 38 times earnings, which if they grow by 50% in 6 months, will certainly drop.

So yeah, the stock is currently above $90 and aiming to reach its all-time high of $99 which was reached a few months ago, in January.

Analyst consensus of the stock is currently $106.54 ([https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast)) which is roughly an 18% upside, taking it to a mere $ 132 billion market cap.

If you ask me, AMD should be **at least HALF** of NVIDIA's $500 billion market cap.

Lastly, the Xilinx acquisition, which will aim to create synergies among functions (e.g. HR, Procurement, Engineering, etc.). It will also increase AMD's share of the silicon purchasing world, as TSMC will have AMD as its #2 client, only second to Apple.

Xilinx cancelled its dividends as its shareholders approved the merger with AMD.

AMD may choose to bring dividends back after the merger... yet in the meantime, they announced a $4 Billion share buyback program. They know their stock is trading **CHEAP**.

# On the positions (full disclosure): YES, I hold AMD stock.

I bought $25K back in 2013, when the stock was at $2.46 (on January 18th, 2013), a bit over 10150 stocks. I saw the stock go up to $20 and sold half of it in 2018. Later, I bought back a bit (crazy ape mentality).

Today, I stand with 7500 stocks. Certainly worth a couple of Lambo's, yet I drive a Nissan.

If you ask me, my next car should be a TESLA... with AMD chips (yet I'm not selling AMD).

WE ALREADY PASSED THE MOON, we will pass **MARS** (Tesla) and also our **Galaxy** (Samsung).

# Join me, together we will conquer the Universe!!!

Pack your bananas.... we're in for a journey!"

Blackberry IVY advisory council now includes GEICO TELUS HERE AWS CERENCE and it's expected to be launched in February 22.

Just today Blackberry was awarded 4 patents and they have nearly 500 new patents pending approval.

Blackberry Patent sale is nearly complete. This is going to be in billions and it's likely Facebook is the buyer of the patents and Blackberry may be partnering with Facebook to secure WhatsApp Messenger

When asked about patent sale, CEO John Chen said stay tuned. He meant hold don't sell your shares because Good News is Coming Soon.

Blackberry recently beat revenue estimates in Q1 FY 22 and went on a hiring spree. They upped sales hiring and expected to increase foot on the street by 23% this quarter.

In the quarter Blackberry customer wins include US Canadian and European Gov. In addition to highly regulated industries such Bank of China.

Don't sell your Blackberry shares only to discover that Facebook paid Blackberry over 2 billion in royalties and Blackberry and Facebook partnered to secure WhatsApp and will split revenues 50/50

More recently Facebook announced WhatsApp stores and messenger for Enterprise with premium. Blackberry could have their finger in this new venture by Facebook and it's a win win situation both both companies.

Blackberry Facebook partnership is very likely and the news could be out very soon.

Who isn't partnering with Blackberry these days.

Blackberry is on the world's stage dancing with the giants. You must pay attention who they are hanging around with and why. From Amazon AWS to Geico to Microsoft, Telus, and Baidu, Here, Cerence, Vodafone Verizon.

Is Facebook next. I wonder.

I'm talkin about VRT, the best value stock on the goddamn market right now. Nobody is trading this shit, it regularly has less than a million in volume a day. ""What the fuck is Vertiv holdings?"" I see you wondering. Well, they're basically the wal-mart of data centers. they supply data centers with everything they need. Server racks, power, air con, i dunno, other shit that data centers need who gives a fuck, they're data centers. They make you get your porn of your wife fucking her boyfriend and his 8 best friends faster.

There's about 3 million data centers in the US, and they upgrade their equipment every 3-5 years. Vertiv works with all of them that aren't shit. Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, all work with Vertiv to supply infrastructure to their farms.

Now obviously my DD blows because i'm not retarded so I didn't waste my time going to business school and i'm not an autist so I have no idea how to look at shit beyond charts and knowing that a supply company in a trillion dollar industry should probably be worth more than 10 billion.

Its server business was under serious threat with the advent of cloud computing; its personal computing and productivity business were... stagnant, to say the least.

But with the help of its scale, MSFT reoriented its entire towards new business models like cloud and SaaS. It opened up its Azure platform like AWS, and transformed Office into a huge ARR generating machine. The result? Its share price appreciation and valuation speak for themselves.

On the other hand, IBM decided to double down on its on-prem centric business, paddling products like hybrid and private cloud. They decided to focus on their relationship with large accounts and didn't advertise their platform to the burdgeoning startup community. The result? Stagnation.

Fast forward to today, everyone thinks VIAC is dead. Its linear business is under the threat of streaming platforms like NFLX, and its ad business under structural decline thanks to programmatic advertising platforms like GOOGL's Adwords, which are miles better in terms of targetability and traceability.

The response from VIAC management has been a swift shift into streaming. They bought Pluto, which enables Adwords-like targetted advertising; consolidated their vast media assets into P+; and reconstituted the entire company's leadership to focus more on streaming.

Will VIAC become more of a MSFT or an IBM in the age streaming? I think chances are good for the former."

If you had bought Nano Dimension on that day, you'd be up 23% right now. If you would have caught the bottom in Mid-may, you'd be up over 58%.

Here's the same DD, with updated information.

Think you missed it? No. I think this stock has room to run further. Here's why:

&#x200B;

Nano Dimension $NNDM

Company Description (From their website)

Nano Dimension Ltd. engages in the provision of intelligent machines for the fabrication of additively manufactured electronics. Its products and services include DragonFly Pro System, conductive and insulating inks for printed electronics, and optimized multi-material design of complex electronics.

**Where They Can Sell**

In several investor phone calls the past few months by CEO Yoav Stern, he has stated SEVERAL times that the companies deals with companies in the Defense sector. What they produce with these machines (3d printed ELECTRONIC devices) can be used in many various sectors, like defense, medical, aerospace, etc. 

In March, a RF circuit board printed by them was sent to the International Space Station. 

In May, the company sold one of their machines to the University of Quebec.

**Customers**

Nano Dimension recently posted their June 2021 Investors Presentation.

Samsung, Nvidia, Elon Musk's Neuralink to name a few of their customers.

&#x200B;

**Cathie Wood**

She is obsessed with Nano Dimension. Nano Dimension is in FOUR Ark ETFS. (\* as of 6/27/21) Over 16 million shares she owns.

ARKQ (7,644,621 Shares)

ARKW (7,630,616 Shares)

IZRL (733,585 Shares)

PRNT (198,291 Shares)

**Revenue**

It's a speculative stock as of now, so the numbers are not very pleasing.

In 2020, their total revenue was just $3.4 million, with $48.49 million in losses.

In pre-covid times, 2019, their revenue was $7 million. Flash forward two years, with a bunch of cash on hand (explained below) and hopefully as COVID subsides, I'm expecting to see higher revenues and hopefully in a few years positive earnings.

Most recently, they released Q1 2021 Earnings. They reported revenue of $811,000 in the first quarter and a net loss of $9,314,000. 

*""Wow they are losing a lot of money!""*

***-->  The Company ended the quarter with a cash and deposits balance of $1,471,014,000 (including short and long-term unrestricted bank deposits) <--***

\*As stated on their most recent earnings call, no guidance was given\*

**Cash on hand**

Every time the stock spiked, they did an offering. Their most recent offering, on February 16th was for $12.80. And it raised $500 MILLION. As of two weeks ago, they had just about $1.5 BILLION cash on hand. After two acquisitions already (explained below), they have just under $1.4 BILLION

(Yes, that means a bunch of people bought shares at high prices and you can buy it now cheaper then they did)

Yes, stock offerings are not good but Yoav Stern (CEO) made it very clear on the investors phone call they hosted last week that they have enough cash on hand to do what they envision, and no more share offerings will happen.

To put this into perspective, they have $1.4 billion in cash. their market cap as of today is just under 2 billion. Roughly, their current cash values them alone at around $6 a share. This doesn't include patents they own, the newly acquired companies, their technology, and just the valuation itself.

**Acquisitions**

The company plans to use its money on acquiring companies (No, $NNDM is NOT a SPAC)

So far, they've acquired two companies this year (and these are very tiny acquisitions, bigger ones are expected)

DeepCube (AI Company - their technology will be used in the currently DragonFly Machine) ($70 Million TOTAL - 40 Million Cash / 30 Million Shares)

NanoFabrica (3D Printing - \*the company had a investment lead by Microsoft) (\~$59 Million TOTAL - \~$27 Million Cash / 32 Million Shares) \*The final numbers are not confirmed\*

So they've only burned through roughly $70 million. They still have around $1.4 Billion.

Their plan is to acquire companies listed as Type A, Type B, and Type C.

Type A - Existing companies in PCB business. Companies with revenue between 40-150 million!

Type B - Technologies they think their machines need

Type C - Companies that have machines that cater to the same customers that Nano Dimension does. Literally buying their competition and expanding their customer base.

**Unusual Option Activity**

Specifically, for short term options, there is high open interest on 3 strike call prices.

July 16th Options (\*As of 6/27/21) \*This stock has had HEAVY volume on $10 July 16th calls almost the entire week of June 21st-25th trading week.

$7.50 - 11,820 Open Interest

$10.00 - 39,978 Open Interest

$12.50 - 18,114 Open Interest

Should also be mentioned the activity on the Puts.

$7.50 PUT - 6,732 Open Interest

**Stock Activity**

This stock, as well as other growth stocks, seem to be gaining steam again, and momentum looks to be back. Do with that as you please.

**Upcoming Catalysts**

* News related to new customers/partnerships/sales, including with their 2 new recently acquired companies, NanoFabrica & DeepCube
* According to the CEO, they have a NEW DragonFly they are expecting to release in the near-future
* Any further acquisitions (Already had 2 this year - The CEO on their May earnings call said starting in June they can tour facilities - they couldn't before because of COVID)

**Video With More Information**

Quick 15 minute video with the CEO, Yoav Stern.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdE6DoqmeqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdE6DoqmeqY)

**The Negatives**

* The company has a rather high short interest (many websites are giving different numbers, but according to FinViz it is around 38%)
* The company isn't producing high revenues, and its burning cash

TL;DR - This company has a bunch of cash (1.4 billion), has some futuristic technology, and can literally buy out their competition or buy companies that'll help them (which they are doing)

Overview

	AMD is a global semiconductor company offering x86 microprocessors as standalone or integrated (CPU’s, GPU’s, server systems, Etc…) and intellectual property/ services.

Products

	AMD’s primary products consist of CPU’s and GPU’s which are on par or out performing NVIDIA GPU’s and Intel’s CPU’s. While these other two giants have dominated the market for sometime, AMD’s recent move has evolved from a slow creep to a brisk jog. 

Competition 

	AMD’s largest competitors are Intel (CPU’s) and NVIDIA (GPU’s). With the release of AMD’s Ryzen processors in 2017, AMD has been steadily over taking Intel’s dominance over market share. AMD’s current market share (over all CPU’s) currently sits at 44%, levels it has not seen since 2005. AMD took 20% of the market share in past 2 years with a significant jump in 2019. Since the release of Ryzen, AMD is now on par or out performing Intel chips and has gained a significant amount of sentiment over the soy boys at intel. AMD is on track to overtake the majority of CPU market share within the next year based on current projections.

	Now NVIDIA is a whole other beast who currently has a significant advantage over the dGPU market. Nvidia at the end of Q4 2020, held roughly 82% of the market share which was a increase of 9% from the previous year. AMD’s high end GPU’s do not come close to Nvidia’s high end models, UNTIL AMD’s Radeon 6000 series, which are now on par with Nvidia’s cards, either outperforming or underperforming in various tests. AMD catching up to Nvidia is the same move that AMD made against Intel in 2017, 4 years later they are on the verge of overtaking market share. While Nvidia is a monster of a company, I believe that AMD will begin taking more market share from Nvidia and establish a decent foothold over the next few years. AMD has already taken the game console market, console plebs.

	AMD has already proved they are able to take back significant market share with there current and future products, Lisa Su is a genius and I believe she’ll lead the company to Valhalla. What does AMD have that Nvidia does not? Aside from many differences, I think the fact that AMD has an ecosystem will play a significant role in catching up. Now that AMD can evenly compete with both of their rivals, AMD plans on leveraging the fact that they produce CPU’s and GPU’s. There are already incentives to using AMD’s CPU with their GPU rather than an AMD CPU with a Nvidia GPU. With AMD taking the CPU market, retail users will be more likely to stick with the ecosystem, and I’m a big fan of companies producing an ecosystem (laughs in apple). 

	A new player enters the battle. Intel has been working on their own dGPU and will surely be releasing in the next few years, but I believe this will be comparable to Sony vs Microsoft with Nintendo enjoying their best life staring at butterfly’s, covered in drool in the corner lol.

The Merger

	Nvidia set to acquire ARM, AMD set to acquire Xilinx. What are they and how are they expected to impact the company?

ARM - Create and dominate the mobile processor market, covering TV’s, phones, tablets, and other similar products as well as some software applications. I will not be covering much more of ARM in this DD.

Xilinx - Designs and develops programmable logic products. As far as I can tell this is some big brain shit that I’m sure some booger nosed, mothers basement living, neck beard having, nerd will easily explain in the comments cuz Wikipedia ain’t cutting it.  

	If AMD completes the purchase, which is likely and expected to happen by the end of 2021, Xilinx shares will become worth 1.723 shares of AMD. AMD is currently trading at 86.10$, meaning that shares of Xilinx will be worth 148.35$ if the deal were to go through right now. Xilinx is currently worth 133.71$, I’m betting heavily that AMD will continue to pump prior to this deal as well.

	ARM will be huge for Nvidia, but this is running into some major road blocks and is likely some ways off or will fall through.

Financials and projections (I had pictures but I’m reddit dumb)

Net Revenue
$9.8B(2020), $6.7B(2019), $6.5B(2018), $5.2B(2017)
Net Incum 
$2.5B(2020), $341M(2019), $337M(2018), $(33)M(2017)
	
	I like your growth G

	AMD decreased their debt to 338 million from 568 million.
	
	$1.6 billion in cash ($9 billion in total assets, I find cash on hand more important)

	GPU/CPU sales accounted for $6.5 billion while enterprise accounted for $3.3 billion, GPU/CPU sales saw a 37% increase over 2019 while enterprise saw a 65% increase in 2020. 2021 is set to continue this trend of growth.

	AMD has a high price target of $169.70, median $107.00, and an average of $103.92. I just read 100’s of pages of 8k’s and 10’ks, plus I’m super attracted to the ole doc Su Bae so I’m betting that it will get a target price upgrade, regardless $103 will make me rich. There is a lot more we could dive into on financials but idk what the fuck I’m doing so nah.

Risks

	I like to plan for more than 1 risk occurring at a time so keep that in mind. Ive highlighted the risks that I find most impactful/ probable. Also keep in mind of global shortages for damn near every company, especially with chips.

	- Intel/ Nvidia’s market share dominance (mostly Nvidia)
	- Seasonal sales can make for shit earnings in Q1/Q2
	- Reliance on third parties for manufacturing/ distributors
	- Xilinx deal falls through
	- Jim Cramer also likes this stock

	That’s enough risks, what am I, a gay bear?

TLDR

AMD will moon, Lisa Su is my mommy and is cooking up some tendies, AMD GPU’s are now in Teslas,  obligatory rockets (insert rocket emojis here), lots of words just buy it.

Not a political post!

The Supreme court decision today is sending the financial relief decision back to the lower court but a favorable ruling regarding the unconstitutional FHFA director position.  In hours, Biden Admins have already removed the FHFA director.

**Quick history:**

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been in government conservatorship since the 2008 housing crash.  In 2012, the FHFA decided to take all the lambos for themselves and sweep the money into the treasury when the companies turned a profit.  The congress at some point realized that they could not end these companies because of stonks so shareholders still exist.  In 2019, Fannie and Freddie were finally allowed to retain their capital to the tune of billions.  Many apes agree that Fannie and Freddie’s current woes largely resulted from them being used as a political scapegoat but to top it off, the former FHFA decided the two companies would need to raise $283B to be released.

**Enterprise Value (EV):**

To give you an idea what these companies are worth, Fannie and Freddie service half of the mortgages in the United States.  They are a cash and dividend paying cow.

  

|**Company**|**EV**| **Market Cap**|Share Price|

|Fannie Mae|4.1T|2.5B|$1.52|
|Freddie Mac|2.7T|1.4B|$1.41|

**Institutional holders makeup 24.7% of total outstanding junior preferred.**

Top institutional holders include Paulson & Co., Pershing Square, Capital Management and Fairholme Funds, Inc.  These guys have diamond hands since 2008!

**Short Volume fintel:**

Short Volume   22M

Short Volume Ratio 4868%

&#x200B;

I'm curious what would happen if we send this stock to its proper valuation, $10, $20, $50, or $100+? Would this force the government to sell their senior preferred shares?  The relief sought by shareholders would entitle them to $124B, rapid raise in share price and future lambo paying dividends.

\*i might or might not change your life, or atleast your account balance.

today i will be writing about alibaba stock ""BABA"" and exlplain my thesis regarding the underlying.

# intro:

Alibaba Group Holding Limited operates various segments including : core commerce, cloud, digital media, entertainment, payment services...

business which Alibaba group own: Taobao, TMALL, Freshipo, Lazada, Ali-express, Alibaba, ele,me, 1688, youku, alibaba-cloud, alimama, cainiao network, dingtalk, ant group, ali-pay

Alibaba group does business in almost every thing you can imagine, therfore you can compare them to every big tech you know, they stand with the big dogs.(AMZN, GOOG, AAPL, MSFT) but they get less attention at the moment.  i think the sentiment towards alibaba is bound to change, very soon.

**Why BABA ?, why now ?**

baba showed negative performance relative to the other tech stocks at the moment (market sentiment due to politics - alot of impact on the stock) . but baba strength can be seen in a few areas: revenue growth, solid financial position with reasonable debt and very reasonable and cheap valuation. the profit margins are lower when comparing to peers right now but baba business have much to grow and much to be expected to fix that issue.

Baba stock experienced little decline in most recent quarter in comparison to performance from same quarter a year before, but i think the next earning this year will reveal growth in EPS.

Now, lets start of with the basics and take a look on baba financial and valuation.

&#x200B;

# valuation:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/anm5scpa30771.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a6194d33f1165898de0cc04ce59c7e736bb9dbc

so looking at valuations:

Mkrt value:  573B

p/e: \~25x

Fp/e: \~21x

p/s: \~5.2x

p/b: \~3.9x -> very attractive at this rate !

eps(ttm): 8.48

eps(ntm): \~12

next e/r : Aug 19

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pkphleqb30771.png?width=226&format=png&auto=webp&s=102d445ee3ce2b7d931e42e4e62ea38ee0ae9d5e

At BABA current stock price of $211, the market is expecting revenue to grow at 48.8% for the next 1 years. Over this period, BABA is also expected to generate an average Economic Earnings Margin of 13.8%

Baba have increased theirlong term debt looking at their financials but due to increase in future revenue i believe it is nothing to be bothered by. debt is not an real issue to baba.

\*\*very important note is that comparing baba to other big techs valuations at the moment proves that baba is dirty cheap and can be a good short/long term play . even is market goes sideways i dont see baba going any lower than right now. 200 price is pretty strong ressitence and still a good price.

revenue growth: 47.96%

eps growth : 14.42%

i will be including a look into baba Assets and Liabilities, which i believe is showing us a healthy company which keep growing and expanding and inceasing their cashflow, revenue and shareholders equity.

## Liabilities:

**Profitability:**

Profitability in baba business is quite larger comparing to peers.

# ANALyst reports:

most of the ANALysts recommend this stock. various price targets between 260\~350 price targets.

# Technicals:

52wk High: 319.32

52wk Low: 204.39

Avg volume (3M) : 15.8M -> breakout will increase volume obiously everybody watching the stock movement right now.

baba is down \~33% from the top at 319.32 (10/27/21).

I expect to see a bullish breakout in a couple days, can be happening anytime right now. good support at 209-210 level, every time we get there i can spot large money flowing into baba.

I believe that a price of 300$ before the year ends is possible and quite easy with a very little catalyst or sentiment change towards the company. right now from what im reviewing the sentiment towards baba is starting to chagne across the internet and financial market.

I haven’t seen it discussed on this sub because it’s market cap is only 1.54 Billion USD.

There is A LOT of DD on this company out there that takes weeks to really go through. I’m not going to even try to cover it all, but basically ReconAfrica is an oil exploration company that recently discovered and has 90% rights to the largest undeveloped onshore basin in the world right now, the Kavango Basin, with total petroleum generating potential that’s north of 120 billion barrels of oil. Given it’s current market cap, I believe ReconAfrica is one of the most undervalued stocks in the market, a potential future 10-100 bagger.

**Some history on the ReconAfrica**: the company was taken public about two years ago. Back then, all it really had was an aeromagnetic survey showing what the company interpreted to be extremely deep sedimentary basin in the countries of Namibia and Botswana. On the basis of this survey, they had the foresight to purchase drilling rights to over 8 million acres of land for very cheap. Last year Recon purchased a drilling rig and shipped it to Namibia to get more detailed stratigraphic data. The company commended drilling the first well in January/February and are currently midway through the second well.

The preliminary results have been very bullish. I am not a geologist but as I understand it, an active petroleum system needs to have a source rock, a seal, and reservoir, and traps in order to be viable. With the data released in the past two months being even better than expected, it looks like all of those components are present and there is potential for huge amounts of extractable oil. A full suite of results from the core samples in the first two wells is expected to be released soon. In future wells, they plan to target an actual oil trap using the seismic data. By the end of 2021, they hope to be entering discussion with Joint Venture partners.

Geologically speaking, the Kavango basin is similar to the Permian Basin in Texas (which has over 50 billion barrels of oil and is currently producing 5 million barrels of oil per day). However, the Permian acreage is Texas is divided among dozens of companies. The largest of them Diamondback (FANG), Pioneer (PXD), Concho (CXO), and EOG all have market caps in the tens of billions of dollars. In contrast, ReconAfrica has the rights to the entire basin all to themselves. That is what makes it an incredible opportunity in my opinion.

I think the company (currently trading in the $9-$10 range) could be a $100-$200 stock by next year once the exploratory drilling and seismic program is completed and the company enters Joint Venture (JV discussions). Long term, I can see the company being a next oil supermajor. Again, for one company to own the drilling rights to an entire basin like is extremely unique.

Another bullish tailwind for Reconnaissance is that Western supermajors have been cutting oil exploration expenditure due to environmental pressure from environmentalists and the EIA. However, demand isn’t going to significantly decline for decades and we could be in for a [major oil supply crunch](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Saudi-Arabia-And-Russia-Warn-Of-Major-Oil-Supply-Crunch.html). The company is in the perfect position to capitalize on a good macroeconomic environment for oil and gas

**The bear case:** Some of the biggest risks are

* Extreme opposition from foreign activist groups who want to stop ReconAfrica and Namibia from developing in the Kavango. They’ve spread rumors and misinformation on social media, published hit pieces in newspapers, organized marches, etc. If they are successful at slowing down or stopping ReconAfrica that would obviously be bad for the company. But I don’t believe their criticism is justified. If ReconAfrica is successful, you can bet that it will hugely benefit Namibia and Botswana which in turn will be massively beneficial for the people and wildlife. There will be more money to raise people out of poverty, increase access to healthcare and education, support conservation areas, etc. So far, ReconAfrica and the governments have been committed to protecting wildlife, the livelihoods of local people, following international best standards, and promoting economic development.
* ReconAfrica has no *proven* reserves yet. We are waiting on more data from additional stratigraphic wells and seismic activities before the company can formally declare it has oil and gas reserves, meaning we still aren’t 100% derisked yet. However, given that we now have two exploration wells with thick marine source rock, carbonates, and a rift basin full of convention traps the play has been significantly derisked.
* Governmental risk. Of course it is ultimately up to the government and people of Namibia and Botswana to decide how they want to develop their natural resources. However, [Mines and Energy Minister Tom Alweendo](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/03/africa/namibia-oil-exploration-intl-cmd/index.html) and [Kavango East Government Bonifasius Wakudumo](https://www.namibian.com.na/102332/read/Oil-driller-announces-petroleum-system-at-second-well) are both excited and supportive of ReconAfrica’s activities in the Kavango Basin. And just last week, ReconAfrica and NAMCOR (Namibia’s national oil company) [signed a partnership to work together on exploring and developing the Kavango basin](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/ReconAfrica-Press-Release-061421.pdf).

**Disclosure:** I am long RECO with shares I bought in January. Oil exploration is a high risk/high reward game, so don’t take this as financial advise to buy shares. Do your own DD and come to your own conclusions.

First of all, I'm not qualified to give any financial advices, I'm just here to share a few facts, that makes me believe AMD could start to rise before July. It reached this week more than 85$ (after Google announced it was working with AMD for Google's Cloud computing which was huge news), and went back to 82,6$ after a dip that hit both AMD and NVDA. 

Here is different articles I found that seem to show that this dip could be an opportunity before a rise : 

https://www.notebookcheck.net/Exynos-with-AMD-mRDNA-2-to-be-unveiled-in-July-peak-performance-better-than-next-gen-Mali-GPU-while-beating-latest-Mali-even-with-30-throttling-Google-signing-up-for-mRDNA-2-as-well.546822.0.html --> it has been public knowledge for sometime now that Samsung and AMD are working on a mobile GPU, but official announcement should be next month, AND, as mentionned in the article, Google could also use AMD's RDN2 tech for something in short term (Google Pixel?). Concerning Google, this is the third time that I see this rumor. 

https://www.thestreet.com/investing/amd-no-ec-objection-to-xilinx-merger --> for the moment the acquisition of Xilinx seems to go well 

https://www.neowin.net/news/amds-next-gen-rdna-3-performance-jump-rumored-to-be-absolutely-insane/ --> some good news about 2022's GPU 

I think next earning release is on 07/27/2021 ; we should see good things there. 

There are also the Xbox/PS5 that are a huge success and based on AMD's GPU ; Microsoft and Sony will keep buying tons of AMD's GPU (maybe more than expected originally).

It's my point of view but, to invest in mid-term, it looks good. 

Have fun today!"

I know right, that is SO DIFFERENT than like 97% of the companies that get hawked here. You see, unlike the money losing companies that get hawked here with the expectation that they will lose slightly LESS money next year (or, even better, the ones that just lose even more money as the years go on), this one not only makes a shit ton of cash but will make a METRIC fuck ton of cash next year and EVEN MORE the year after. Golly, that would be a sight, am I right?

So, what is this magical stock called? Well, say it with me, it is Century Communities Stock (CCS). What does it do? It is a homebuilder (The 9th largest one across 17 states). One that was (gasp) profitable in 2008 (18 years of consecutive profit)!

They operate through two home building segments. The first is called **Century Communities** which is their “flagship brand, offering everything from single-family floor plans to condos and townhomes. Enjoy the freedom to build and personalize your new home from the ground up or find the perfect quick move-in listing.” These homes are 1) To-be-built and quick move in homes, have2) full smart home packaging, and 3) can be reserved online. The second offering is **Century Complete** which are affordable and streamlined homes that Century makes that offer built in savings through a groundbreaking online purchase process and a versatile selection of quick move-in homes. This segment offers quick move-in homes, starter smart home packaging, and the ability to buy them online. They also do home loan, title insurance, and home insurance.

Let us do a highlight reel before we get into the nitty gritty. They have delivered 10,386 new homes for the last twelve months through quarter 1 of 2021, and 80 percent of their deliveries are to entry level buyers (the largest segment of purchasers). Those home deliveries helped them notch 3.6B in total revenues for LTM 1Q 2021.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Valuation Metrics for CCS for Q1 2021**

Century Communities reached a net homebuilding debt to net capital of 19.9% from 52% in 2018. Their homebuilding debt to LTM EBITDA is 2.0X.

Their Book Value per share is 40.74, and tangible book value per share is 39.83. Yes, you see how they do not have much of that squishy “goodwill” or “intangibles.” This stock is a straight shooter. That entails a 1.52 Price to Book Ratio, and a 1.55 Tangible Price to Book ratio.

The trailing P/E ratio for this company is a stunning 7.54 P/E ratio with a dividend yield of .95% (60 cents a year). Fully year EPS for 2021 on an average basis is 11.64, and 12.72 for 2022. **That means a Forward P/E ratio of 5.32 for 2021, and 4.875 for 2022.**

Their price to sales ratio is .47.

Analysts have an average price target of 92.

It is a steal, and I am going to explain further down why I believe analysts are wrong, and it is even more of a steal than they say. But before I do that, I am going to compare this stock to its peers.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Comparison to Other Homebuilder Stocks**

Lennar has a P/E Ratio of 9.10 (After recently reporting its Q2 Earnings on Wednesday), a 2022 Forward P/E ratio of 7.41, and a 2023 forward P/E ratio of 7.23.

Toll Brothers has a P/E Ratio of 13.38, a 2022 Forward P/E Ratio of 6.70, and a 2023 Forward P/E ratio of 6.91.

But Hani, the market cap of these companies is much bigger! Fine, fine, let’s look at home builders with a market cap similar to CCS then!

Meritage Homes has a P/E ratio of 7.54, a 2022 forward p/e of 5.46, and a forward 2023 p/e ratio of 6.62.

The only home builder that comes close is M/I homes but it has a future P/E that lower than that of CCS, and it is in slightly less markets. Still, it is a strong buy as well.

I cannot be bothered to compare every homebuilder stock but suffice to say it is better than KB homes, NVR, D.R. Horton, Tri Pointe Homes, and PulteGroup. In short, it’s undervalued in a sector that is being undervalued by the markets. The only stock that comes close, or slightly edges it out is M/I Homes (which doesn’t offer a dividend).

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Lennar’s Earnings to shed light on the earnings of CCS.**

On Wednesday Lennar destroyed earnings with adjusted quarterly earnings of 2.95 per share. Stripping out items, it reported earnings of 2.65, which handily surpassed analyst estimates of 2.38 per share.

They also beat on revenues and issued an update to its homebuilding outlook for the third quarter and is now anticipating new orders in the rage of 16,000-16,300 units and “deliveries between 15,800 and 16,100 units for the new quarter.”

The Macro Commodity Outlook & Home Price Appreciation FY 2022

Timber prices have made homes about 30,000-35,000 more expensive to build, but ever since they peaked on May 7th, at 1670 a unit they have gone down, and they have gone down fast. It closed on Friday at 904, and analysts believe it will continue to go down to roughly around 600. There are some analysts, however, that believe it could go as low as 500 to 550 and I share that sentiment. That is because DIY builders have largely stopped buying timber with the great opening, home builders are not going balls to the walls with their home building, and because sawmill operators are increasing capacity.

Building construction accounts for nearly half of all copper use (and residential is roughly 2/3rds of building construction), and with China having announced it is releasing its metals reserve and trying to tamp it down copper has been coming off its highs faster than usual. Interestingly Copper also peaked on May 7th at 4.75, and it is most recent close was at 4.14.

Aluminum is used as an insulation layer of building roods, for windowpanes, etcetera. It peaked on May 7th as well and is now sitting roughly at 2384. I believe it will continue to decrease, due to China’s attempts to moderate the prices by releasing its reserves, as well as due to eventual balking by customers at the prices.

Meanwhile, home prices will increase in 2022. Freddie Mac predicts that home prices will rise by 4.4% in 2022. In 2021, “Higher building costs, longer delivery times, and general unpredictability in the construction supply chain are now having measurable impacts on new home prices. The median sales price of new houses sold in April 2021 was $372,400, 20% higher than a year ago. The average sales price was $435,400. The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of April was 316,000. This represents a supply of 4.4 months at the current sales rate.” What am I getting at here? Well, there are currently bidding wars, and Lennar’s earnings calls will reinforce that. Homebuilders are passing off the cost, and the consumers are taking the increased cost. What is more, homebuilders are INCREASING their margin.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**HUGE undersupply of homes, and a huge ongoing need for new homes**

Freddie/Fannie have predicted that there is a 3.8 MILLION undersupply of homes, and home builders will need to build 1.2M homes a year just to keep up with year-on-year demand. When I say 1.2M homes, that does not actually chip at the backlog. To cut into the inventory shortage of 3.8M they will need to build more than 1.2M homes a year.

But homebuilders are being cautious, and so it will take 8 to ten years to fill demand unless they ramp up significantly. Currently Housing Starts are only 1.572M units on a seasonally adjusted basis. Furthermore, permits for future homebuilding fell 3.0% to a rate of 1.681M units in May.

Let me be clear then, that this is not a cyclical play, but a circumstance of over a decade of concentrated underbuilding by home builders that is now leading to a golden age for them in the coming years.

What does this all mean for when CCS reports earnings in Q2 and for Q3 and Beyond (August)

I am going to throw some quotes from Lennar’s earnings, and you can spot the goodies. READ IT ALL, but I will bold some things:

**Jon Jaffe Co-Chief Executive Officer:** “Q4 of 2020 is when we saw the first significant increase in lumber costs, which impacted primarily our Q2 deliveries. **The lumber increases, which occurred in Q1 and Q2, will mostly flow through our deliveries in the second half of the year. But as we noted and Diane will cover more detail, we believe that Lennar's pricing power will more than offset this and we expect to deliver stronger gross margins. Looking forward, we expect to see some limited relief on our lumber costs for our July starts as more expensive lumber works its way through the system. And if the current downward trend holds, we'll see a more significant benefit for August starts.”**

**Diane Bessette CFO:**  And now, let me provide some high-level guidance for the fiscal year. We still expect, as we mentioned, our deliveries to be between 62,000 and 64,000 homes\*\*, but with a now higher gross margin guidance of 26.5% to 27% for the year and an even more efficient operating platform with SG&A guidance of 7.3% to 7.5% for the year.\*\*

So, as you can see, this is fantastic news. The reporting period for Q2 for CCS ends on June 30th, which means I expect them to revise guidance upward for Q3-EOY in terms of margin because that is when the housing starts will start to fully benefit from decreased lumber prices (As well as other commodity prices). Furthermore, consumers are taking the price increases on the chin and allowing margin to expand as you can see in Lennar earning call as well as government data, and this is going to be seen as soon as this upcoming quarter as you can see by Lennar's earnings beat. I expect earnings to be at least 3 EPS, and maybe even more, beating the analyst consensus of 2.73. I expect FY EPS in 2021 of at least 12 dollars in earnings per share which beats the analyst consensus.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Anti-Inflation Play**

The rise in housing prices accounted for over a quarter of the overall increase in inflation in May ([An inflation storm is coming for the U.S. housing market | Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20210619290/an-inflation-storm-is-coming-for-the-us-housing-market)). Guess, who that benefits. That is right, this stock.

Furthermore, purchasing a home is the quintessential anti-inflation play because the mortgage stays the same over 30 years while rents increase to match inflation. Furthermore, your home appreciates roughly at the same rate as inflation when you are a home buyer. So, to beat inflation… People buy homes.

Finally, building costs are decreasing with commodity prices going lower, but margins are expanding. HMMM!!!!!

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Debt**

CCS was upgraded to B1 by Moody’s on Feb 22, 2021, and put their outlook at positive. This is one step below investment grade.

They have no debt on their revolving line of credits, but they have two senior notes. 495M worth of notes due May 2027 u/6.,75%, and 397M worth of Senior Notes due July 2025 u/5.875%.

The 6.75% Notes means annual interest payments of 33.412M, while the 5.875% senior notes give an annual interest payment of 23.324M. This equates to roughly 56.74M in interest expenses. If they got rid of the debt, they would add an additional 1.68 to their EPS in the full year by removing that interest expense.

Alternatively, they can get upgraded to investment grade by EOY and then choose to refinance for better rates and save on interest expense. After all, their set to almost reduce their net homebuilding debt to net capital to 0 by the end of this year (and that is if they only meet and do not surpass analyst expectations. I believe it’s only a matter of time before they are upgraded to investment grade debt due to the strong financials here.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Russel Inclusion**

On May 8 of 2020 was the Russel Ranking Day for reconstitution. The stock was 23.87$ at that time (clawing its way back from the doldrums of the pandemic lows). The Russel Ranking Day for 2021 was May 7th. The price then was 79.84. That is a 334.4% increase in the share price. The market cap, therefore, would have been 3.46B on ranking day. It will remain in the Russel 2000, with a much larger weighting as the higher on the list you are the higher your weighting is.

Since then, however, it’s decreased roughly 28 percent to 62.01, which means that the weighting will have an outsize impact on the share price on the reconstitution date.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Institutional Ownership and Insider Ownership

Institutional ownership is 89.54%. Insiders own 11.9% of the company as well. This is pretty fucking bullish.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**In conclusion**

I have 220.57 Shares worth of CCS and 7 September 17 Calls for 65 dollars that I averaged down to 7.66 a pop. I intend to open a further, significant, amount on Monday provided there is not an explosion in the stock price as this is severely undervalued. Additionally, I think I’m going to open a smaller parallel position in M/I Homes. Price target by analysts is 92 dollars for CCS. The great homebuildergeddon of June 8-11 (Save for Lennar which boomed the day of earnings and the day after when JPMorgan initiated a price target with 50% upside), happened for literally no reason. It was just a sector bloodbath and CCS was hit the hardest of them all by far. Be aware that the bid asks for options is quite different, though not as illiquid as CNNE (My poor CNNE calls are getting slaughtered, but I have till August). This company is super undervalued and doesn’t deserve to be where it is.

This isn't a fucking pump and dump, don't make it one, because it doesn't deserve to be tarred by that association. This is a deep value play. I would have mentioned the 10% buyback authorization they have, but i don't care to because their focused on increasing earnings and making money hand over fist. Also, they should probably focus on removing all their debt notes, before doing share buybacks because it gives a better ROI.

edit\* Here's a scratch off ticket:

**Key words to understand:**

**Inflation-** Things cost more, the purchasing power of the dollar is less. You probably already notice that  materials have cost more. Inflation as mentioned by the FEDs is temporary and here to stay, for now. Think materials like stock, people hoard, lack of supply, lumber hits $1000 per 1000 ft. The overestimated inflation is now coming back to to find a midpoint. Because inflation is here we need to take a look at the return on investments.

&#x200B;

>!Inflation short term, it's already here! Commodities are dumping from being over inflated. With inflation being here, better make sure you beat inflation.!<

&#x200B;

**Interest Hike** \- Everyone is talking about whether or not JPOW is going to raise interest rates to counter inflation. By raising rates you would make people spend less because you get more of a return from savings than spending. If people spend less, then demand goes and deflation will occur.

>!Interest rate hikes adjust from 2024 to 2023. More inflation?! Possibly, but the 5 year yields are going up and the 30 year yields are going down. More return on investments for 5 year vs 30 year. What does this mean?! Borrowing short term money will cost you more than borrowing long term money. The 5 year and 30 year. Growth is slowing so you get punished for not growing. With the rates of 5 years going up to pass the 30 year, an economic slow down is suggested. Better make sure you beat that short term treasury rate.!<

&#x200B;

**Reverse Repo-** June just provided the highest reverse repo of all time. Reverse repo is the buying of securities or equities and and promising to only sell them at a higher price. Think stocks now. Where will money go if you are guaranteeing you'll only sell at a higher price.

>!Repos and reverse repos are short term borrowed money. With such high reverse repos, better make sure you beat that increased short term borrow rate.!<

&#x200B;

**TOUR OF CASINO**

You walk into the casino, the thermostat is set at a mild temperature. Maybe a little too warm. The lights turn on. There is suddenly a halt and an announcement that there are table staff changes.

&#x200B;

Let's take a tour of the casino and look at the systems in the casino and see where we are positioned.

**Slots** (>!Dividend Stocks!<): People tend to like dividend stocks because the companies pay you for holding the shares. Dividends generally pay 2-4%. The issue here is that in an economic slow down, companies may see a reduced revenue and the dividend payout might not beat the interest rates. If you get 2% in a savings account, why risk the biscuit for the dividend?

**Roulette** (>!Defense Pharma & Research Heavy Stocks!<): To save money during inflation, there are generally budget cuts to stop spending. This affects the defense sector in many ways. Future grants are generally pulled and R&D is usually cut.

**Craps** (>!ETFs, recovery, inelastic holdings!<): Not sure what to hold, want to be safe, let someone else do it for you. ETFs generally hold some form of dividend stock or businesses that stay flat for stable growth. At times like this where there are still better investments on the table like hiked treasuries, foreign investments, and growth stonks. Who likes watching money burn in ETFs? Talk about .5% fees.

**Blackjack (**>!Meme stocks, trenders!<**):** Memes don't last forever, but we will forever remember the meme. The come and go, that's just the way it is. Big money, small money, no money, doesn't ever want to bag hold. Just here to win it and make a killing. With money moving away from the stock market going out, volume will be a lot less. It's one on one with the dealer. How many hands do you want to play?

**Poker (**>!Growth Stocks!<**):**  So you're telling me growth stocks don't need to spend much on R&D?! YES! Let's narrow down the list that has shown exceptional growth. Got dealt two aces, might as well push everyone else out. Ace 1( Growing Revenue YoY), Ace 2 (Growing footprint YoY)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Which game do you want to play? Seems like the casino is shutting down some of it's services and the others don't have many players.

&#x200B;

**I can't bluff well so I'm going to try the games:**

**Slots** You start playing and accumulate into year 2030. >!You're finally at your breakeven point, the bullmarket starts. Oh the joy of saving and making null.!<

&#x200B;

**Roulette** baby, here we go! Yolo is the only way of life, either get rich or die trying. >!You died!<

&#x200B;

**Craps.** Throw ten darts and land three, win some lose some. It's only money. Time to roll the dice. You start winning, then you start losing. Then you win some more. >!Radioshack bled out by accident. Fuck my life.!<

&#x200B;

**Blackjack**. Man, I don't really want to play alone, let's find a crowd.>! You find a good seat with a lot of players. The table suddenly goes out of service. You panic and rush to the nearest one and go all in. You died.!<

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ah.... you chose (**Poker)**

Not a bad choice. Fun game.

Let's look at what growth stocks there are that are generating great income and expanding the foot print.

There's large caps like: >!SQ, FB, NFLX, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN!<

There's small and mid caps like: >!FVRR, ETSY, PINS!<

There's proven foreign growth investments like: >!BABA, JD, TSM!<

There's semis who can't meet current demand: >!AMD, NVDA!<, >!oops \~\~INTC drank one too many drinks \~\~!<

&#x200B;

14 choices!? So many to choose from! Takes step back. (**over 9000 tickers**)

&#x200B;

**I'll buy the dip, no worries**....  >!who says there will have to be a dip for growth stocks?!<"
o2sa3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o2sa3e/knowbe4_knbe_cybersecurity_awareness_testing/,KnowBe4 - KNBE - Cybersecurity Awareness Testing & Training - Virtually No Discussion,14,38,2021-06-18 23:52:36,"This is not financial advice, I am retarded. I tried to time the bottom on the tech correction with calls and got bogged. I own shares of KNBE.

KNBE - Everyone is sleeping on this stock and this sector.

Sector DD:

As in industry insider (systems engineer) I am finding that cybersecurity insurance companies are cracking down on practices and minimum prevention standards. I've seen multiple customers of ours edged into security testing + training by the insurance company telling them its mandatory. The insurers seem to get more strict with every major breach - and we just had a nuclear weapons company breached this week.

My investing theory for 2021 is that insurance companies are going to compel massive amounts of cybersecurity spending and produce huge earnings reports.

If you're on LinkedIn, you might have noticed job alerts for cybersecurity jobs have gone up triple or quadruple since January as companies scramble to not be the next one on cable news for getting bogged by eastern european glow in the dark boys.

KNBE DD:

\- Barely recognized, almost zero results searching WSB or Reddit as a whole.

\- Good market cap but almost no volume.

\- Recent IPO - only two quarters. Price discovery still taking place.

\- Doesn't even have options yet.

\- Widely considered the industry leader for email phishing test campaigns.

\- HQ'd in Florida. Most employees are Florida Man / Florida Woman.

\- 45% rev growth YoY

\- Turned profitable this year - positive EPS

\- Financials: [https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/KNBE/financials](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/KNBE/financials)

The product: The main product is email phish testing. Fake scam emails sent out by IT meant to get Karen in HR to click on free Apple giftcards / etc. Some more advanced and believable templates as well and the ability to customize them to internal company branding / terminology.

They also have awareness training to remediate staff and departments that are falling for the scam emails, or to proactively introduce employees to email security concepts.

I did a short trial run with them for a few clients a year ago and was impressed with the platform. I also tried Microsoft's 365 equivalent.

Risks:

\- Not a monopoly. Already other companies in the same security awareness / testing space.

\- Competitors includes Microsoft - premium Exchange 365 licensing grants a similar but much less developed product amongst other security tools - but minus the remediation training.

\- The greatest risk from MSFT is that companies may ""already be paying for"" their phish testing tool as part of existing security licenses - similar to business onedrive / sharepoint vs dropbox.

\- First DD I ever posted so it's probably shit.

\- Stock already up 60% this week, might correct.  


tl;dr: Insurance companies are making small/midsize businesses spend money on cybersecurity and getting more strict about payouts. KnowBe4 has a good product and a first mover advantage. They're profitable already. Almost zero social media sentiment or press around KNBE and no options - this feels to me like an early bird special.

Holy Mackerel what did I stumble onto...then I come across this Motley Fool Article about Is Zynga an acquisition target.  The Fool is often a stupid analyst company (even though they added ZNGA into their top 10) but when there's smoke it's best to check if there really is a fire.

Here's why I was sold:

YOY Revenue: 68%

YOY Income: 78%

Active Daily User (people who use their game once a day): Up 85% (WHAT??!)

Active Monthly User: Up 140%

AD revenue: Up 100%

They acquired Echtra games.......For those of you that don't know.....Echtra is Max Scheffer and his team...you know the REAL brains behind titles like....DIABLO, DIABLO 2 and TORCHLIGHT.....for any real PC gamer I don't think I need to point out how significant this is.

They have some HUGE titles coming out for casual mobile gamers like Starwars Hunters and a Harry Potter game...whatever, they'll print money but who cares.....

I think ZYNGA really is thinking about selling their mobile gaming branch....maybe Microsoft with their xCloud platform that they're pushing hard.

For those of you that follow gaming stocks...GLU shares went up 36% when EA bought them out...

Position: I bought 2000 shares today."

#ASTS is a satellite company which allows 5G internet/cell phone connectivity anywhere in the world **through your existing cell phone**. In short, ASTS represents an attractive asymmetric bet in the following ways:

* [**Space Launch Market Competition:** It seems every week there is a new article about how cheap launches are becoming due to increased competition. SpaceX, Blue Origin, \(among others\) have brought space into the mainstream and are allowing for repeatable launches. Billionaires are throwing away cash just to win some twitter space race. The question here is; who actually stands to gain from cheaper launches? The International Space Stations 10 Astronauts trying to satisfy their coke addiction and a satellite company like ASTS.](https://i.imgur.com/8QqoIDQ.jpeg) 


* **Customer Acquisition:** ASTS works with existing telecom providers and does not need to acquire customers, pay for marketing, or gain approval for spectrum usage. By signing with existing telcos, all ASTS needs to do is launch a (patent protected) satellite and collect a check.

* **5G Fund:** $9 Billion in government funds are in play for rural 5G expansion. AT&T is working with ASTS to gain access to this money. Microsoft believes ~157m Americans do not have access to broadband internet. ASTS solves this.

* **Sold off:** ASTS has been wrapped up in a space market correction without participants understanding the value this company adds. At current levels “you” are buying in below investors like Vodafone and Rakuten who have all vetted this company and have a vested interest in the company's success. American Tower is invested and is essentially hedging their business against the success of ASTS removing the need for Cell Phone towers. *Take a second to look at their chart (and thereby the proliferation of cell towers) and think of Satellites replacing their entire business structure.*

&nbsp;

**What makes ASTS Different:**

[A comparison chart.](https://i.imgur.com/3jzbOoB.png)

[Something with less words for the High Schoolers who forgot their Ritalin today.](https://i.imgur.com/01RnI87.png)

&nbsp;

Iridium currently sits at a $5B market cap and allows for cell phone calls to be completed via satellite. This company serves maritime and oversees applications, charges customers by the minute (think cell phones circa 1999 or Roblucks(?) if you're the same high schooler) and requires a separate bulky headset. This is the difference maker for $ASTS, anyones existing smart phone can connect to their satellite as they rely on a larger high powered satellite vs IRDM which has a smaller satellite and relies on the headset to make up the difference. This same principle can be transferred to Starlink which has smaller satellite arrays and relies on a dish to connect.

&nbsp;

The average AST SpaceMobile satellite signal is powerful enough to penetrate two walls inside a building, the fuselage of an airplane, or the interior of a car or train. No direct line of sight is needed and the service is similar to that provided by a tower two to five kilometers away from a handset. The satellite architecture is completely different from that used in other systems. With each satellite providing coverage to a large area approximately 2,800km in diameter, a much smaller number of satellites are required to achieve global coverage compared to other systems and the constellation will be capable of supporting 5G speeds as defined by the FCC.

&nbsp;

AST SpaceMobile recently participated in the public comment period regarding the 5G Fund for Rural America. In October, the FCC formally moved to allow mobile-satellite providers that meet specified performance standards and other requirements to apply to participate with its partners in the 5G Fund auction as a 5G broadband provider. The 5G Fund will distribute up to $9 billion for 5G wireless broadband connectivity in rural America to close the digital divide.

&nbsp;


The first phase deployment of 20 satellites is expected in the second half of 2022 with coverage to 49 equatorial countries in 2023. ASTS plans to achieve full global mobile coverage with 110 satellites by the end of 2023 or early in 2024 with a total of 168 satellites by the end of 2024. Commercial service expected to be offered beginning in 2023 across 49 equatorial countries.
If ASTS proves to be successful IRDM would be an easy short ala long GOOG short YHOO.

&nbsp;

**What moat exists:**



[With 836 patent claims and growing](https://i.imgur.com/iTXb4VW.png), the company believes it has a five to seven-year first-mover advantage over competitors. A steep barrier to entry exists in the satellite space which these patents protect. ASTS CEO Abel Avellan has proven another satellite company Emerging Markets Communications which sold to Global Eagle for $550m. 

&nbsp;


Customers have already been established with ASTS. SpaceMobile service will be initially offered to 1.3 billion users. Vodafone has a 50/50 revenue share agreement covering its markets. Millicom, LiLAC, TEF, AT&T (including Mexico) and TEO, among others, already have a memorandum of understanding with ASTS. All of these companies have done their own DD on the technology and have signed off on it. This isn’t a question of if it will work, but when. AT&T has signed on for the exclusive rights in the US. They think of this as a potential difference maker in carrier choice going forward *(think iPhone exclusivity that existed previously).*

&nbsp;



**What need is there:**

Management estimates that 90% of the planet's surface isn't reached by wireless networks. About 5.2 billion people move in and out of coverage as terrestrial towers frequently fail to reach distant areas. There are 3.3 billion people without wireless data connectivity and another 0.7 billion with no cellular coverage whatsoever.

&nbsp;

In middle America broadband speeds are lacking as is cellular connectivity. This is why the government is looking to make advances in 5G quickly. Microsoft believes ~157m Americans do not have access to broadband internet.

&nbsp;


**Addressable Market and Costs:**

Cost of the service estimates for final users living in emerging markets could be as low as $2.06/month. Currently, carriers spend 80% of their capex serving 20% of their traffic in remote areas. ASTS could significantly reduce the amount of capex needed to serve unconnected areas.

&nbsp;


The development efforts to date and the equatorial project should cost $510M and the global constellation a further $1.3B of additional capex. ASTS projects to generate revenues in 2023 and become cash flow positive by 2024.

&nbsp;

With as little as 9 million users in emerging markets SpaceMobile expects to generate $181M in revenues and $130M in EBITDA by 2023E. Once phases 2 and 3 are completed, revenues and EBITDA would shoot up to $1.07B and $1.0B in 2024. At this point the company would generate enough cash flow to pay for its future expansion.

&nbsp;


**This doesn't fit anywhere:**

The Barclays Managing Director who did the due diligence for ASTS merge, Scott Wisniewski, left his job to joins ASTS as their Chief Strategy Officer. This mans job was doing DD on space companies and he left for $ASTS options.


&nbsp;


**Potential Catalysts:**

Research Coverage Initiated: As of now no price targets have been set for ASTS. Research coverage being initiated could result in a positive reaction for the stock. This was what set SPCE on a run (which this sub participated in) in January 2020.


Blue Walker 3: As of now the proof of concept launch used a satellite on the ground connecting to a phone in space. Q4 of this year will be the launch of their test satellite. A successful launch and test would mean the business will be able to go through Phase 1 and become cash flow positive. Someone much smarter than me will tell you what that is worth in terms of stock price. 

&nbsp;

**TL:DR** Max Bid ASTS Walk Away. Space internet on a toilet anywhere in the world.

## A distressed company: Is the cure worse than the disease?

Oscar Health’s core business is as old as the American Dream itself: deny poor people medical care, and then bill them for the privilege. Oscar adds a fun twist to this winning formula by using technology to deny insurance requests faster and more frequently than traditional companies, which require actual human representatives to decide whether deaf children are allowed to have hearing aids.

Founded in 2012 by current CEO Mario Schlosser, Kevin Nazemi, and Josh Kushner (brother of sentient wax doll Jared Kushner), Oscar Health provides health insurance with a particular technological emphasis. Unlike other providers in the space, OSCR cuts costs by emphasizing telemedicine, automated referrals, and remote prescriptions \[1,2\].

OSCR IPO’d at $39 in March, and almost immediately plummeted to the mid-20’s, where it’s been fluctuating ever since. OSCR’s IPO went so poorly that at least one law firm is considering a class-action suit for securities fraud on behalf of investors \[3\].

## Signs of life

Like many early-stage companies entering an entrenched industry, Oscar initially burned money faster than a secret service agent at a luxury golf course: in 2016 the company lost $204.9 million, while in 2017 the company lost $83 million. However, as the company has expanded its subscriber base and adjusted its risk calculations, it has begun to turn around: in 2018, OSCR posted profits of $1 billion from 400,000 subscribers, and in 2021 it is expected to bring in $2 billion \[4\].

Moreover, OSCR has relatively little competition in its space. Similar startups like Collective Health and WSB’s sweaty dakimakura Clover Health have substantially fewer subscribers and have struggled to turn a profit \[5\]. Meanwhile, larger players in the insurance industry like Anthem are full of polo-shirt thumb-typers, leading to mishaps when they have tried to integrate new technology into their existing offerings \[6\].

Moreover, OSCR has a reputation for poaching top tech talent from companies like Microsoft and Amazon, and Google has even invested in the company.

I am bullish because OSCR has several unique advantages over comparable companies:

## The Bone Saw Gambit

In 2021, companies throughout the world are reckoning with the ethical implications of taking on unscrupulous investment partners. From severing ties to the Chinese government, to removing board members with histories of harassment, corporations worldwide are defining a new approach to vetting investors that will likely restructure the nature of the venture capital space for years to come.

But not Oscar Health. These chads and chadtoinettes will take money from anyone who offers them a nickel and half-kilo of Paradise White. Just last year, OSCR closed a $165 million financing round shortly after co-founder Josh Kushner and Jared Kushner visited Saudi Arabia and met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, everyone’s favorite journalist-murdering oligarch \[7\].

## Daddy’s Money

The renowned Chicago school of economics is a neoclassical school of economic thought based on post-Keynesian monetary theory. Over the decades, one guiding axiomatic principle has emerged from this storied institution:

RICH. KIDS. CAN’T. FAIL.

Due to co-founder Josh Kushner’s involvement, OSCR has its own insurance policy I the form of being intimately intertwined with the Kushner family. Patriarch Charles Kushner alone has an estimated net worth of \~$2 billion, giving him plenty of runway to bail out his son as needed:

* Earnings underwater because we blew all our VC money on coke and legal settlements?Emergency cash injection from Papa.
* Our machine learning algorithm stopped running because our Office 365 free trial expired?Bailout from El Padre.
* Service outages due to buildup of a strange powder in our server’s ventilation ports?Thanks for your credit card info, Mr. K.

Daddy Kush will stake anything and everything to make sure that little Josh’s lemonade stand makes it. Ten years from now when OSCR hits $1600, we can all watch Josh’s TedX Talk on becoming a self-made billionaire.

but the fact that much of the loaned money goes into stocks

which artificially drive up their value. (This is known as “asset inflation”. No wealth is being created here, the numbers are just being unnaturally propped up by the money printing)

So it's imperative that you take profits. I know diamond handers won't ever sell, but if I can reach one poor soul to wake up, and to put their profits into assets that will hold it's value.

And if you just prefer stocks, even putting them in say, companies that will be around 20 years from now would be far less risky, such as Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft ect.

The alternative is to completely chance it and see how long you can ride this bubble, but the odds are totally stacked against you. You will never be rich this way.

**FUNDAMENTALS: IT'S ALL ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT**

In a post COVID-19 world, people will continue to flock towards entertainment.

As confirmed by TESLA & AMD last week, the NEW Model X and S have an AMD GPU & APU. This is HUGE, as the feature will trickle down as optional to the Model 3 and rest of the EV fleet.

Why is gaming important in the EV space? Just listen to Elon Musk drool over PS5 performance on road trips with autonomous driving & AMD. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl\_-bFNRJaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_-bFNRJaw)

But that IS NOT ALL: Valve will LAUNCH an AMD portable handheld soon! HL3 anyone???

(source: Chris, The Good Old Gamer): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA)

In essence not only the PS4, PS5, XBOX X & S, but also Valve is going FULL AMD.

Who do you think Ford, GM, Chrysler, BMW, Audi, Volkswagen, Renault/Nissan will go with?

[MERCEDES ALREADY MADE THEIR CHOICE.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dninScDsGno) You want a BENZ AMG??? You need AMD!!!

**ENTERTAINMENT IS KEY and AMD is all over it**

Software will be tailored to AMD's processing pipeline. As an example, **Unreal Engine 5** ALREADY performs better on a 6800XT than it does on a RTX3080 (up to 12%  better, as per Digital Foundry's performance benchmark - see screenshot  and video link below).

[AMD 6800XT on left with 61fps - Nvidia RTX3080 on right with 56fps](https://preview.redd.it/eruzko9mwy471.jpg?width=1289&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5fcbb478a1bcc940bd8c564b5d6b6ace551aa401)

(digital foundry's benchmarks) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0)

Unreal Engine 5 (with Lumen) will make Nvidia Ray Tracing obsolete. This software solution is much more efficient at managing illumination, allowing it to work with non-RTX hardware.

Enthusiasts are pumped with AMD's Computex presentation, where Fidelity FX SuperResolution was shown. It aims  to provide up to 2x performance while super sampling images up to 4K. And the kicker is that this solution will be OPEN to ALL platforms, including NVIDIA GTX and Intel.

**Intel's Raja Koduri** (Head of Intel GPU, formerly an AMD employee) has already confirmed they are looking into AMD's Fidelity FSR (as per his tweet a few days ago). They want in!

**So yeah, AMD is the future of GAMING**

But on the stock analysis front, AMD has also begun its climb towards previous highs.

It made a huge recovery since my latest post, when it was trading around $72.

AMD is currently trading at a Price/Earnings multiple of 34, with a market cap of $98.7B

Nvidia is has a P/E of 84 (over twice as much), with a market cap of $444B (over 4 times more).

But when you look at AMD's latest financials, the differences shrink.

On Revenue, AMD has sales of $9.7B and net profits of $2.5B. Nvidia sold $16.6B for a net $4.3B.

How does that support Nvidia being over 4 times more expensive than AMD? **It just doesn't**.

If AMD were to trade at the same multiples: EPS of 2.38 \* NVIDIA's P/E of 84.28 = $200 per share.

At $200 per share, AMD's market cap would be $243B... STILL HALF OF NVIDIA!!!! (WTF?!?!).

Think about it, it is bound to close the distance towards $200 per share in the next 12 months.

The reasons are simple: Tesla, Valve, Unreal Engine 5, Ryzen 3D stacking and 50% growth for 2021.

The Xilinx deal WILL CLOSE in the next 6 months. THE BREAKOUT is IMMINENT!!!

To summarize, the product pipeline is AMAZING, not to mention the leaks on RDNA3 and Ryzen 4.

The new clientele is incredible: TESLA and Valve, added to Microsoft and Sony, with more coming!

Add the Xilinx FPGA accelerators integrated to AMD's Intellectual Property and fuel the rockets!!!

**REMEMBER:** In a matter of months you will be kicking yourself for ignoring this post!

* [Amazon Web Services](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181010005314/en/C3-and-Amazon-Web-Services-Expand-Collaboration-to-Drive-Enterprise-Artificial-Intelligence-Adoption)
* Fidelity National Information Services
* [Google](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180821005202/en/C3-IoT-and-Google-Cloud-Announce-Partnership)
* [IBM](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-02-27/correcting-and-replacing-ibm-services-and-c3-ai-announce-strategic-alliance-for-digital-transformation-with-ai)
* [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/09/microsoft-sees-gain-on-c3ai-investment-concurrent-with-ipo.html)

Although the average total subscription value is decreasing and may continue to decrease, C3 has restructured the sales organization and expanded the market-partner ecosystem to address small, medium, and large sales opportunities. The progress is promising as the average total subscription contract value for six months ended October 31, 2020 was $7.7M.

On February 1, 2021, the [launch of the Open AI Energy Initiative](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-c3-ai-baker-hughes-220000073.html) was announced by Shell, C3, Baker Hughes, and Microsoft. The initiative provides a framework for energy operators, service providers, equipment providers, and independent software vendors for energy services to offer interoperable solutions powered by the [BHC3 AI Suite](https://bakerhughesc3.ai/bhc3-ai-suite/model-driven-architecture/) and Microsoft Azure.

**BEAR ARGUMENT**

C3 faces intense competition and which could be an “early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese” type of situation as second movers could develop technology to improve upon any shortfalls. The main sources of potential competition include:

* Greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and larger customer bases
* Larger sales and marketing budgets and resources, and the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing across a broader portfolio
* Wider geographic presence
* Lower labor and research and development costs
* Larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios
* Greater financial, technical, and other resources to provide support, make acquisitions, hire talent, and to develop and introduce new products

The Chief Executive Officer, Tom Siebel has received many [honors and awards](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181112005818/en/EY-Honors-Thomas-M.-Siebel-as-2018-Entrepreneur-Of-The-Year%C2%AE), but if he, or other senior management team members, were to leave the company C3 may not be able to execute their business strategy. Siebel is critical to the overall management and continued development of the AI suite and AI Applications. All of the executive officers are at-will employees and they do not maintain any key person life insurance policies.

C3 has a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future. The sales cycles can be long and unpredictable and the sales efforts require considerable time and expense. This is due to investing into sales to large organizations that typically undertake a significant evaluation and negotiation process due to their leverage, size, organization structure, and approval requirements. A limited number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of C3’s revenue. The top three entities together accounted for 34% and 44% of the revenue for years ended April 30, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The same entities have been with C3 for an average of 3.3 years.

**CONCLUSION**

Given the success of C3’s customers, I feel it will increase penetration of their existing customer base. They are primed to expand the major account sales organization to focus on large enterprise software agreements. Additionally, C3 will continue to develop high volume distribution channels to address the needs of small and medium businesses. I think they will continue to bring new product families to market that will develop into substantial recurring revenue streams. The total addressable market is rapidly growing and estimated to grow to $271B in 2024, a 12% CAGR from 2020's estimate of $174B.  This is a big opportunity for C3.  The lock up period [ended on June 7, 2021](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/ipos/overview?dealId=907559-94759), and earnings happened on June 2, 2021. I believe everyone who wanted to sell has sold at this point. I am bullish and think C3 has great potential for a swing trade, but more so a long-term investment.

This would relieve some valuable debt from the transaction between $DISCA $T and also provide $MSFT at least a couple of beloved studios that would boost GamePass and give them even more dominant IP in the gaming space. Right now these are **strong rumors** in the gaming community.

If this transaction is announced, expect volatility in all three tickers on Monday. I expect a run on $DISCA and possibly $T as the deal gets put back under the microscope by analysts and the sentiment turns positive.

Disclosure: I'm long $DISCA which is both oversold and the A class shares are being brutally shorted due to the upcoming merger which combines all classes - HF are shorting A class and buying into C class since all classes will combine at merger close by mid-2022.

The book ""What Works on Wallstreet"" analyzed 40 years of stock market data.  It determined that a price to sales of 1.5 is considered a good deal.  It also determined this was the most important ratio to use in valuing a stock.

I disclose I am short 120 shares of AMC, starting two days ago.

2019 their sales were 5.47 billion.  Now they are 1.24 billion

(1.24/5.47) x 47.8 = 10.84

So when things return to normal and their sales go back to normal, the price to sales would be 10.84  assuming the stock stayed flat.

This 10.84 is a high level.  This level of high price to sales is where Microsoft lives; at 12.1 currently.

As fascinating as it is that this movie theater company has been able to raise a great amount of cash through the Reddit craze, AMC is no Microsoft."

Sector: Technology

Industry: Consumer Electronics

Market cap: [1.13B](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VUZI?p=VUZI)

Vuzix is engaged in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of augmented reality display devices also referred to as head mounted displays (HMDs, but also known as video eyewear or near-eye displays), in the form of Smart Glasses, and Augmented Reality glasses. Their Augmented Reality wearable display devices are worn like eyeglasses or attach to a head worn mount. These devices typically include cameras, sensors, and a computer that enable the user to view, record and interact with video and digital content, such as computer data, the Internet, social media or entertainment applications. Their wearable display products integrate micro-display technology with advanced optics to produce compact high-resolution display engines, which when viewed through their smart glasses’ products create virtual images that appear comparable in size to that of a computer monitor or a large-screen television. Vuzix's offered products are M series Smart Glasses, Blade Smart Glasses and other Augmented Reality Products. 

**FINANCIALS**

Sales of Smart Glasses products for the year ended December 31, 2020 rose by 107% over the same period in 2019, primarily the result of stronger customer demand for the new M-Series models, which were not available for sale for the entire comparable period in 2019. Sales revenues from the M-Series Smart Glasses were $8,406,623, a 112% increase of $4,432,628 over the prior year’s comparable period. Total M-Series unit sales increased by 109% for the year ended December 31, 2020 versus the same period in 2019. Revenues of Blade Smart Glasses decreased by $240,747 or 14%, primarily driven by lower average sales price as compared to 2019.

Sales of OEM Products, and Standalone Waveguides and Display Engines were nil for the year ended December 31, 2020 versus $951,570 and $152,499, respectively, in the 2019 period primarily due to not receiving new orders.

Sales of Engineering Services for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1,500,287 as compared to $673,151 in the 2019 comparable period. The revenue recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020 for engineering services was primarily a result of several waveguide and display engine development projects which commenced in the first and second quarters of 2020. The majority, all but two, of these projects were completed and delivered in 2020. 

**BULL ARGUMENT**

Augmented Reality Smart Glasses enable the wearer to see computer-generated information, graphics or images projected into the real-world environment or upon an object that the user is observing. Thus, whether in the warehouse, on the factory floor, or in the field, users wearing Augmented Reality Smart Glasses may access a manual, tutorial, or image that is connected to the task at hand which will assist them in completing that task, while also viewing their current surroundings and nearby objects. Additional possible applications of AR-enabled Smart Glasses include hands-free alerts, messaging, location and context aware information and social interaction.

Vuzix has developed their own intellectual property portfolio that includes [patents](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/vuzix-corporation), over 22 years of manufacturing know-how, software, proprietary processes, materials and equipment to create high performance waveguides, and near-eye display products. It can be argued their waveguides and compact display engine technologies are a key differentiator for enabling next generation Augmented Reality and Smart Glasses hardware for the enterprise and consumer segments because they will ultimately allow Vuzix to make HMDs nearly indistinguishable from regular eyeglasses.

Key growth areas for Vuzix are the enterprise, medical, consumer electronics, OEM, defense and security markets. They are addressing most of these markets by developing and selling their own finished products and building a growing eco-system of software and services internally and with their value added resellers, developers and end customers. Another potential channel to these markets they are developing includes supplying mass production of waveguide optics and display engines to select third parties to use in their products. Vuzix recently announced they will expand their Augmented Reality surgical product presence to [support shoulder, knee, and spinal surgeries](https://ir.vuzix.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1895/vuzix-smart-glasses-expand-ar-surgical-product-presence-to). 

**BEAR ARGUMENT**

Vuzix has incurred net losses since inception and may continue to incur losses. They reported a net loss of $17,952,172 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a net loss of $26,476,370 for the year ended December 31, 2019, and a net loss of $21,875,713 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Vuzix has an accumulated deficit of $162,694,983 as of December 31, 2020.

They operate in a highly competitive market and the size, resources, and brand name of some of their competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than Vuzix. Some competitors include: 

* Samsung Electronics Co.
* LG Electronics 
* Epson
* Sony Corporation
* Microsoft Corporation
* Oculus/Facebook
* HTC Corporation
* Snap
* Lenovo
* Google
* Magic Leap

Many of their competitors have substantial market share, diversified product lines, well-established supply and distribution systems, strong worldwide brand recognition, and greater financial, marketing, research and development resources. Additionally, many of these competitors also have substantial competitive advantages such as: 

* longer operating histories
* the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products
* broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners
* access to larger established customer bases and known branding
* greater resources to fund research and development and to make acquisitions
* larger intellectual property portfolios
* the ability to bundle competitive offerings with other products and services

**CONCLUSION**

I have a hard time pulling the trigger on a long-term investment with Vuzix. With their current financials and competitors, I feel this is a better day/swing trade opportunity if played correctly. The volatility is where I like it for those types of trades. It will be interesting to see how Vuzix develops over the next 1-3 years, but I won’t have positions longer than a couple weeks during that time span.

I mean, how the fuck does [my one DD on WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/nvibpi/wwe_can_you_smell_what_the_stock_is_cooking/) cause a $4.4b stock to move up 11% (~$450m in market cap)? Clearly something must be wrong with the market, right?!

Here's some fun [math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msDuNZyYAIQ#t=41) for you: WWE's IV was 35%. The standard deviation for a daily move (using the rule of 16) is 35/16 = 2.1875%. It moved 11%/2.1875% -- about *five* standard deviations. The odds of that? Roughly 1 in 1.74 million. (Let me know if this is miscalculated).

So how does a 1 in 1.74 million event occur? And, more practically: Why didn't it close at a lower, more statistically reasonable price?

# The SMELL - high bang for the buck

If you remember my [first post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/nvibpi/wwe_can_you_smell_what_the_stock_is_cooking/), I chose this ticker due to it passing the SMELL test:

* **S**hort Interest is high
* **M**arket cap is high
* **E**xtremely Memeable
* **L**ow IV  <-- (implies low volume, as well)
* **L**ow Float

What differentiates WWE from other new meme stocks (CLOV, CLNE, etc) are the Low IV and Low Volume. I'll touch on that in a sec.

First, let's get one thing straight. The bump from yesterday was **definitely** from my original post. To me that's incredible... because I don't even consider that post a wild success:

* It didn't hit the frontpage.
* It was buried a few pages deep for awhile (it got a late start).
* In the end, it garnered 1k upvotes and 230 comments.
* WWE reached something like #25 in mentions on WSB. Meh.
* **Yet, still, caused a *five sigma* move in the stock.** That's pretty good leverage.

I think that's the SMELL at work -- particularly the low IV and low volume. There's just not much liquidity in this stock. Not much of the market cares about it. If they did, then after settling down at $65.00, with volume tapering off.. where were the profit takers? Where were the shorts? **A 10% day with *zero* news, and momentum seemingly fading... and it stays at +10% five sigma levels?**  With a single 1k upvote WSB post?

I'm bullish.

# Show me the memes

Now do me a favor and find some second-generation meme stocks with DD-post numbers that low that have done *anything*. Seriously, I'd be grateful if you find one. I don't think any stock has moved 11%, much less five sigma of its IV, from a single DD before. (Well, maybe CLNE. But it wasn't five sigma, and it was already widely discussed recently before the run-up. I could be wrong here.)

A more typical example: CLF, a new star, a had *several* DD posts yesterday, all raking in *multiple times* the amount of upvotes and comments. And what did CLF do yesterday? Up 14%. With an IV of 60%, a 14% move is 3.2 standard deviations away, or 1 in 1000 odds. All of that attention and it breaks out by an amount 1000x more likely than what happened to WWE.

**WWE got far less attention, but moved a much more significant amount.** See what I'm saying?

Also yesterday, the other second-generation meme tickers were fetching in tens of thousands of upvotes across several posts. They seemed to just hang out. Some dumped. Meanwhile, WWE just hangs out even while the WSB ""trend"" ranking is like [#26](https://www.quiverquant.com/wallstreetbets/) on the rankings. (Scroll down to ""Trend Map"" or Ctrl+F for WWE).  It's mentions count is *way down there* .. below CRSR, BARK, SI, SDC, TWNK, and a bunch of other shit I had no idea anybody still cared about or just started fawning over.

**And, yet, WWE pumped and did not dump.**

> Why didn't it close at a lower, more statistically reasonable price?

I believe there is simply not much real inflows or outflows in WWE.

Remember, the daily volume on this was generally very low, the IV was very low, and it's 120% insitutionally owned. Nobody trades this, it's not expected to move much, and the shareholders are boomer funds. How many of those institutional owners actually reposition their holdings regularly? I don't think many. At least, not many did yesterday.

The WSB post started reaching obscurity, but WWE held steady at 11% gains -- with literally *no fundamentals* changing from day before. The shorts are being cautious, and the longs are just chilling.

**If you believe that my one shitty little post was enough for what happened yesterday, then you should see that it doesn't take much to move this stock.** With WWEs meme potential, and it being short squeeze season, there's a lot of upside, and not a whole lot of downside (maybe -11%, back down to where it was).

Admittedly surreal to see these.

# tHe sQuEeZE iS nOt sQuOZe

In case any of you are into this for the squeeze potential - 22% of available float - let's discuss. If you don't care about sqeeziness, great, you can skip this.

I don't believe we saw any squeeze yesterday:

* Post market and pre market shows extremely bullish activity.
* MMs and quant algos see an uptick in WWE mentions on ""the bane of our existance""
* Asks for options go up defensively
* Market opens, and plethora of options orders come in. (Not a crazy amount, just 1k upvotes worth). They continually hit the ask and ramp up the volatility.
* MMs are forced to gobble up shares to deltahedge from both the new options, and also the *huge* gap at open, and also the *huge* increase in IV. Remember, based on the prices they've sold the existing OI, this is a *five sigma* event.
* On a stock with hardly any volume to support that.
* Stock wobbles around as the feeding frenzy ensues
* Volumes tapers down, stock holds at +10%

No hockey stick squeeze. No high volume spikes mid day. Thus, I think no margin calls and no covering.

**Furthermore, I'm told Ortex did not show a decrease in shares on loan.** I'll update this tomorrow when that data becomes available.


# Conclusion

It is my opinion that non-retail longs and shorts are just sitting on the sidelines. Not much profit taking, not much shorting, and not much covering. They're all being cautious. Look at institutional ownership of this thing. **120%.** How many of these fund managers are going to reposition their WWE holdings mid-day? Probably not many.

I feel like yesterday's movement was all us, MMs, and HFTs shuffling. Just from one itty bitty 1k upvote post. That's a lot of leverage. The SMELL in real. What happens if this post hits 2k? Or this thing gets memed by others? What happens if shorts actually start to cover? What happens if there's an acquisition?

*But don't kid yourself... this is still speculative.*

I'm now *less* bullish, but not bearish, about:

* A fundamentals based justification of current share price.

I'm now *more* bullish about:

* The impact that visibility here could have on the share price.
* The probability of shorts covering, probably slowly for now, but possibly biting the bullet if we get into the $70s.
* The IV getting more jacked (90% IV is high for this ticker, but low for a meme-stock)

And, lastly, when this thing peaked just after open and you all complained about not getting in: Well, [I felt ugly. I felt stupid. I felt gay.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_do8VgY4bqI&t=50s) Sorry about that. My next DD, if I find another SMELLy stock, will be during market hours.

# TLDR

* I'm bullish that a single 1k-upvoted DD on WSB, reaching only #25 most mentioned, was able to move this stock 11% up (+$440m to market cap)... which @ 35% IV is a five sigma event. About 1 in 1.7 million.
* By comparison, CLF had several posts each with ~3k upvotes, 3x the comments, etc, and it saw a 14% move. That's 3.2 sigma move, about 1 in 1000.
* To me that indicates there is not much liquidity in WWE, and the volume yesterday was MMs, HFTs, quant funds, and retail buying options and shares.
* 120% institutional ownership must have a lot of float locked up as well, and they're not in the business of repositioning randomly on a bump with no news.
* Price **held** at +11% -- five sigma above what the market thought this was valued at a day ago, despite no news. Why no sell-off?
* Again -- all this from a single *moderately successful* post.
* To me this reads as bullish: the small visibility on WSBs has a massive impact on the share price. More massive than any other tickers I've seen catch on here lately.
* I saw no signs of covering or margin calls. Neither did Ortex. Still estimate 8m shorted.


# Positions

After yesterday's action, the risk/reward for options is significantly higher. I don't think the IVs are too crazy, yet, but the odds of a 20-bagger are slim unless we see CLF levels of hype. Regardless, I trimmed most of my options, and have left in the $-amount I started with.

Same positions as before, but now evenly spread:

* Jun 18 $65, $70
* Jul 16 $60, $65, $70
* Jan '22 $60
* If this post picks up traction I'll be adding onto the 70s at open.
* I will likely buy many shares at open, as I think the worst case with them is they go down 11% to $58. No biggie."

Today we had a mini-squeezed with no news! **We went up 10.78% and the short interest today is 31.5%!!!(very high refer to part 1) So, we haven't even seen the real one yet... With a catalyst, In one shot we could easily go up 40-100%+!!**

What happened today reminds of what happened in Mid-May when Ark exited their $SPCE position. The short interest of shares outstanding was \~16%. After Ark completely exited their position, the **stock went up 6.36% the next day and the second market day it was 35.74% up!** The second jump was mainly due to the catalyst news of an upcoming test flight and it jumped. After the success of the flight, **the stock is now 150% up from Mid-May.**

Now for Huya, Ark is almost completely done of their sell off. Yesterday, 877,347 shares were sold and **what's left in their portfolio is \~151K shares from a peak of 6.8 million shares!!**

As I mentioned in Part 1, $HUYA is criminally undervalued and it's primed for a moon launch with the upcoming catalyst news of the Merger. If the CCP doesn't fuck us and the merger goes through, there would virtually be no competitors to $HUYA in the streaming world!! (It's like Apple joining Microsoft in the Operating system market...).

After Friday's action, the conclusion is no, but let's look at the chart and see what's going on.

What happened on Friday:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x2wmukqxbp371.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=01459ffc0e98d47ef446f563fcf853f0fff36af1

The first real red day in 2 weeks lost support at the $14.50 USD mark but also had reduced volume. Can't win them all. We should consider this pullback extremely healthy and does not interfere with the overall bull trend as we were exceeding the Bollinger bands for 5 straight trading days. Exceeding the Bollinger bands is considered to be a strong indicator of volatility, and I strongly believe we have more volatility to come. I would also assume traders were taking their anywhere from 60%-100% profits off the table.

We did not bounce back up to the $24-$33 range as I expected on Friday, but again opinions are like assholes. Everyone has one. I believe that range is easily accessible still through this coming trading week.

Signs that make me bearish:  
\-1D chart RSI is still quite high but is reaching back into a healthy range.  
\-Lower volume Friday. But the overall market was low and red so I'm not too concerned.  
\-Gap to be filled on the chart. \~$11.56-12.30. Usually, gaps do get filled on charts but not always in the short term.  
\-Loss of the 14.50 support. On the hourly chart we had a small bounce in that range on Thursday after the massive opening and slightly recovered, a bounce again just after open on Friday but ultimately failed for the rest of the day. This is a volume issue and many taking profits/losses trying to swing trade.  
\-Possibility of reaching $12.10, if that fails next stop is probably \~$11.30

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nvjhe4fybp371.png?width=1811&format=png&auto=webp&s=817de62d8aedc2eacb1a9bcbbb5e3ac73bf1a80e

These are the bearish signals that I can find and are important to note but again the overall bull trend still exists on a daily, and when in doubt zoom out is the motto. One bad day does not mean you have a bad life.

Signs that make me bullish:  
\-We ended the day inside the top end of the Bollinger bands and they appear to not be contracting yet on the daily chart.  
\-20 DMA and 50DMA have just crossed. This is called a golden cross and the 200DMA is now beginning to slope upwards.  
\-Large amount of strength in the $13.00 range. If you look back at the hourly chart above where we ended Friday you can see where it is flat in comparison to on Wednesday. This shows strong support in this range and will be a powerful foundation to build a cup and handle formation. This range was also significant in the previous run in January

&#x200B;

\-Still a large following and people interested in $BB this weekend across forums, subreddits, and media. #1 ticker on WSB Thursday and Friday.  
\-Largest open interest of stock options is $20 USD.  
\-Put/call ratio still relatively low  
\-Small short shares available (Squeeze is in the realm of possibilities again)  
\-RSI looks healthy on the hourly for a dead cat bounce at open  
\-Currently, one of the best plays technically speaking but also fundamentally for the long term (1-2 years+).  
\-I have confirmation bias because cybersecurity is a massive growth market. If you didn't hear, JBS is the world's largest supplier of beef, and got hacked might actually cause a shortage of beef in the supermarkets or a large squeeze in beef prices. Go long on beef and cybersecurity.  
\-Institutions are still accumulating. Remember, around 48% of BB is owned by institutions and insiders. This is massive. One of the largest companies with large institutional ownership is Microsoft at \~70% or Facebook with an %80. We aren't that far off with a much much lower share count.

If the share price goes down significantly tomorrow I'll post another update, only because if the share price goes down with such a small amount of short shares available I believe this will only be tightening the slingshot further that would rocket $BB's share price to the $30s.

Things that we need to continue to look for:  
\-High volume  
\-Amount of posts and articles about $BB on Reddit, commercial websites, and other forums  
\-News or statements from $BB. One piece of news that's significant could be the catalyst to a moonshot.

This week's price target remains the same as what I wanted on Friday. Anywhere $24-$33USD.

Take care, and stay healthy. Go drink some water, please."

ntc52w,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntc52w/zip_dd/,ZIP DD,0,22,2021-06-06 11:05:48,"First off this is not financial advice; just my personal opinion on a recent IPO that has a lot of room to run. ZIPRecruiter (ZIP) is undervalued and in the sweet spot of a massive secular trend; my DD has me convinced that this stock could break out.
 
First off, it’s important to realize that pretty much every employed person in America is considering a job change now that the pandemic is easing up. For the past year and a half, people have stuck it out in terrible jobs mostly because they were happy to have stable employment at the time, and also nobody was hiring. Now that the economy is taking off and companies are trying to hire again, most workers are going to test the waters. Recent estimates from Microsoft are that 40% of US employees will switch companies this year, and other surveys found that at least 26% of workers leave their companies will find new work. Experts are calling it the “Great Resignation of 2021”. The numbers are impossible to predict, but just think about all the people in your own friend groups that have been complaining about their jobs for months and are trying to make a change.
https://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-great-resignation-of-2021-are-30-of-workers-really-going-to-quit/ 
 
So if you agree that the labor markets are unfrozen and people will be taking advantage of it, how can you make money off it? Look at the software companies that will power/enable this big trend. Staffing / recruiting companies that offer this as a service will benefit, but they don’t scale well. If Manpower Group or Kelley Services has an extra 10 job applicants, they may need to hire an extra recruiter (costs go up as revenues go up). With software platforms, the new job applicants add volume with no incremental costs. 

The biggest recruiting tool of all is LinkedIn, but that’s owned by MSFT and is just a sideshow to their main business. Other large software players in the HR Tech space have recruiting tools, such as GOOG, SAP, WDAY, ADP, CDAY, etc – but again the recruiting platform is on the periphery of what they do... so not a core competency of any big players. Besides these guys, the market is fragmented. There are thousands of job boards, recruiting firms, talent agencies and staffing companies that will help match applicants to companies, but there is only one standalone software company that focuses on recruiting that is publicly traded: ZIP.
https://ideal.com/top-recruiting-software/
 
How does ZIP make money and why do they stand out? The platform is free for individual people to look for jobs, but companies will sign up for recurring accounts where they create jobs and post them into the platform. ZIP is a job aggregator, meaning it takes the job posting and replicates this on thousands of job boards across the world, and then brings back quality candidates to the companies. For employees, it will match you with dozens of roles based on what you are looking for. And because most jobs are virtual/remote now, this software opens up new roles and opportunities that previously a person wouldn’t have considered.
 
Now here’s where it really gets interesting. ZIP went public a few weeks through a direct listing, with no fanfare or hype. Unless you really follow the HR software IPO market, you wouldn’t even know that this happened. Shares currently trade around $24 and the company has a market cap of $2.5B.

ZIP has an EV/Rev ratio of ~9x, which is under the big players above: MSFT = 10x, CDAY = 14x, WDAY = 11x, etc… meaning it’s cheaper to buy a share of ZIP than a fully diversified software company that has products in multiple categories. If recruiting is going to grow gangbusters this year as the economy rebounds, how come ZIP is trading at a discount to larger companies that have smaller expected growth rates?
 
I’m not a professional stock picker, so this is just my speculation, but I think there are 4 reasons why ZIP isn’t getting any love (yet)

1. They are too small. $2.5B market cap is a rounding error to a company like MSFT, GOOG, or WDAY.
2. In 2020, ZIP had a negative growth year (2019 revenues of $430M went down (3%) in 2020 to $418M). Professional investors don’t like that, especially when every other software company went gangbusters in 2020. Well let’s dig into that… why did ZIP’s revenue decrease in 2020? BECAUSE NOBODY WAS LOOKING FOR JOBS AND COMPANIES WEREN’T HIRING NEW PEOPLE. It was a pandemic and nobody was doing anything except watching netflix. 
3. The company had a Q1 earnings call in between filing the IPO paperwork but before the stock was trading. Management had a lot of great things to say (they basically argued that this is an unprecedented time in the recruiting market and they are well poised to capture it), but I honestly don’t think anyone was paying attention
4. On the earnings call, the management said that Q2 is going to be huge (80% growth when compared to Q2 2020) but then the second half of the year could ramp down if people stop switching jobs. Perhaps analysts didn’t like that, but isn’t that obvious? As long as the economy keeps picking up steam, ZIP is going to do well.
 
TL/DR – ZIP is a stock worth taking a look at; I feel they will fly under the radar until Q2 earnings when they will explode. I’m not a financial advisor, so do you your own research too. I LIKE THE STOCK!! I picked up 1200 shares last week."

Ever since the past last year, the government seems to be declassifying a lot of UFO-related information - maybe preparing us for some disclosure this year and the deadline to declassify such info reaching soon, ANOTHER story gained traction.

Something about a user named throawayalien revealed 7 years ago that there is going to be mass disclosure at a very grand scale sometime around July 18th, 2021.

That story has gained immense traction around the https://www.reddit.com/r/ufo/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/ subreddit. He came back again after 7 years because a lot of folks were claiming to be him and he made another post - https://archive.is/CQgEn. (Archive on all of his previous posts after he decided that he was ""done"" with this world and deleted his account)

His story seems to coincide with these UFO declassifying deadlines.

Basically, we've been visited, and there are different groups of ETs, and NEW group is replacing the OLD group of ETs this July, the new ETs are more about ""let's reveal ourselves"" type.

If ETs are benevolent:

1. All astronomy/space-related stocks may FLY out of its orbit because of some possible collaboration with ETs in the future with how to make space travel possible. I'm thinking SPCE, TSLA (because it correlated with the success of SpaceX)

2. Everything stock that's related to God and religion will tank (not sure if there are such)

3. Any company that helps the US Department of Defense would fly because of increased military spending on starting another sort of arms race with them. So that would mean JEDI contract holders like MSFT and PLTR that literally runs their military operations is good for the long run

If ETs are malevolent and they start doing some General Zod type shit and start terraforming the Earth or threatening some catastrophe then:

1. The stock market will tank and honestly may just close down"

For those who don't know how a RTOS microkernel operates let's explain with minor detail. QNX is one of the most adopted embedded OS's in the world it's installed in defense systems, power plants, municipal grids, robotics, rockets, rail and 175 million vehicles and rising.🚀

The reason for it's adoption is because of the way a QNX Neutrino RTOS operates compared to what we consider typical everyday operating systems. Most operating systems including IOS, Windows, Linux(Android) and MacOS to name the most apparent run on monolithic designs or hybrid kernels.🚀

A true microkernel architecture like QNX Neutrino RTOS has full memory protection which is built in meaning that any component can fail and be restarted without corrupting the microkernel or other components in the system. If failure does occur, QNX has the ability to rectify the problem without affecting any other part of the system through process monitoring and recovery components. This feature and ability equals extreme reliability, security and being a microkernel the OS is also modular.🚀

So what is the big deal your probably asking, Apple, ABC, and Microsoft might enter the space? Not exactly, in fact there has been work in this space from all three companies. Apple opened a facility across from QNX in Kanata and hired the ex creator of the OS Dan Dodge in 2016 to work with Mansfield on the autonomous car project called project Titan. The need for a secure and stable software is where Dodge and his decades of experience from QNX come into play.🚀

The need for a software system as reliable and secure as QNX should be a big flag to the sheer potential of QNX. It is clearly a threat and tough competition for even the biggest software companies. Not only this but project Titan continues to be illusive revealing possible setbacks and interference in trying to compete but also Apple lost several top managers from it's Apple Car project causing a potential setback to the launch revealing some attrition in the project.🚀

QNX version (7.1) is years ahead and analysts predict the next competitor is still 5 years away from anything even remotely close.  QNX hypervisor 2.0 is 61508 SIL 3 certified and has been recognized as ISO 26262 ASIL D compliant making it the world's first ASIL D safety-certified commercial hypervisor. 🚀

As other's race to catch up, BlackBerry has been filing patents on it's system.🚀

The QNX Hypervisor utilizes patented and patent-pending technologies that simplifies how elements are shared on the system. Multiple OS's can use 1 display controller to render content onto multiple displays, aka digital instrument clusters and infotainment.🚀"

Ford’s plan to invest in EVs and self-driving cars rose to $29 billion, including $22 billion for EVs through 2025. 

Ford and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL are entering a six-year deal that will make the tech giant responsible for much of Ford’s growing in-vehicle connectivity. This partnership is designed to streamline Ford’s operations and accelerate an ongoing $11 billion restructuring plan. 

General Motors:

General Motors announced that it plans to invest $27 billion in EV and autonomous vehicles through 2025. The company also mentioned that it plans to release 30 EV models globally by 2025.

The company has partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT in leading a $2 billion investment round in self-driving car startup Cruise LLC.

Difference:
Ford is going with Google and General Motors is going with Microsoft. 

Google has 14 Automotive startup investments and Acquisitions.

Microsoft only has investments in 4 automotive startups.

This will help Ford and General Motors in the following areas:

- Autonomous driving technology.
- Connected car tech & fleet management.
- Electric vehicle technology.
- Automotive retail.
- Mobility-as-a-service & shared mobility.

Who wins?
In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars.

I will keep buying Ford, because of the potential technology integration.

While we have all heard of the chlorine shortage, I am convinced we have incorrectly concluded the cause for the shortage. It is my belief that as a result of COVID overwhelming the entire healthcare industry (especially hospitals), the product that healthcare relies on most (chlorine and chlor alkali) became overwhelmed as a result. The true cause of this shortage is simply the effect of the overwhelming strain this pandemic placed on the entire healthcare industry. Information below helps provide clarity on how vital chlor alkali is to the healthcare industry.   

#### [Chlorine: On the ""Front Line"" in Hospitals® (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Chlorine/Front-Line/)  

#### Chlorine and Life-Saving Drugs 

From the computers used in admissions to the sutures used in surgeries, chlorine is a vital part of hospital operations and patient treatments. In fact, probably no other institution relies as much on chlorine as hospitals. Hospital pharmacies are full of medications that rely on chlorine chemistry. Today, about 85 percent of all pharmaceuticals contain or are made using chlorine, including medications that treat heart disease, hypertension, cancer, AIDS, arthritis, pneumonia, depression, diabetes, allergies, meningitis, glaucoma, osteoporosis and ulcers.

Acetaminophen, the most widely used pain reliever in hospitals, is made with chlorine. Sodium chloride is also used in every COVID vaccine.

Chlorine and Medical Equipment

Chlorine is essential to a wide variety of hospital equipment. An estimated 25 percent of all medical devices in hospitals are made using chlorine, including some of the most widely used equipment:

· IV and blood bags. Chlorine-based plastics are used to make the millions of blood and IV bags used by hospitals and blood banks each year. 

 

* Sterile tubing       and packaging. Chlorine-based plastics are also used to make these       essential devices.  

Premier Infection-Fighter

Chlorine compounds are used widely to maintain hospital cleanliness and prevent thousands of life-threatening infections. As a bleach and medicinal aid, chlorine compounds:

· Prevent bacterial contamination of patients' burns and wounds

· Disinfect kidney dialysis machines

· Clean and disinfect work surfaces and equipment in medical laboratories

· Kill deadly bacteria, such as Legionnaire's Disease, that can live in hospital water and air conditioning systems.

Chlorine in the Operating Room

Chlorine plays a number of critical roles in the operating room:

· *Anesthesia.* Anesthetics, such as Anactine Flopak, are made with chlorine.  
 General cleaning and disinfection. Infections are a significant threat in hospitals. Chlorine-based cleansers disinfect work surfaces and equipment.

· *Sutures and other surgical equipment.* Chlorine helps make nylon, an essential material in surgical sutures, artificial blood vessels and osmotic membranes. And vinyl, a chlorine-based plastic, is used in heart catheters.

 

* *Electronic       instruments.* Computers       and electronic devices play an increasingly important role in the       operating room and hospital patient care, and chlorine provides one of       the crucial building blocks in the manufacture of semiconductors used in       these life-saving electronic instruments.”

It’s obvious that chlorine plays an irreplaceable role in healthcare and the safety of our healthcare workers, and safety has never been more crucial than during COVID. It is my belief that to ensure safety for healthcare workers and availability of chlorine dependent products used in healthcare, Biden used the Defense Production Act to require companies that produce critical chlor alkali raw materials to prioritize production for the healthcare industry and combatting COVID.

[The Defense Production Act and the Biden Administration – Publications | Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2021/02/insight-the-defense-production-act-and-the-biden-administration-first100) 

### BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S EXPECTED USE OF THE DPA

&#x200B;

* The      Biden administration has publicly stated that it intends to use the DPA to      combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the administration is likely      to use the DPA to accelerate COVID-19-related supply chains.
* The      administration has identified 12 categories of critical supplies that will      accelerate the manufacture, delivery, and administration of COVID-19      vaccines.
* The      six vaccine candidates being developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, as      well as companies manufacturing COVID-19 therapeutics, have priority DPA      ratings.
* On      January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that      directs federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including      the DPA, to fill supply shortfalls that are critical to the COVID-19      pandemic response.

With chlor alkali producers being forced to prioritize chlorine based raw material production for the healthcare industry and COVID pandemic, all other industries dependent on chlor alkali have been left behind to experience a complete lack of the same raw materials. The impacts are detailed below.

The computer chip shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Trichlorosilane: Cornerstone Chemical for Electronics and High-Tech Toys (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Science-Center/Chlorine-Compound-of-the-Month-Library/Trichlorosilane-Cornerstone-Chemical-for-Electronics-and-High-Tech-Toys/)

Silicon chlorides are some of the cornerstone chemicals of the Information Age. Trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) is an intermediate compound used to produce extremely pure silicon, from which computer chips, the ""brains"" of electronic devices and high-tech toys, are manufactured. The famous high-tech industrial area of California, Silicon Valley, was named for the chemical element that has revolutionized the way we communicate and play. And chlorine has played an essential role in the high-tech revolution.

The aluminum shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:  [Aluminum Chloride | Aluminum Sulfate | Aluminum Manufacturers](https://www.aluminummanufacturers.org/aluminum-sulfate/aluminum-chloride/) – Chlorine based chemical used primarily in the production of aluminum metal. Chlorine is also used in the recycling of aluminum. 

The plastic shortage, especially PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Polymer Raw Material Shortage for 90% of Converters (plasticsconverters.eu)](https://www.plasticsconverters.eu/post/polymer-raw-material-shortage-for-90-of-converters) 

According to **EuPC Managing Director Alexandre Dangis***, “Manufacturers of plastic products all over Europe are experiencing serious bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials since the beginning of this year. Delivery problems have become increasingly widespread, affecting raw materials for example (not limited) such as Polypropylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, and Polyethylene, as well as special additives that are crucial for the manufacture of compounds and plastic products. The serious market disruptions currently taking place all over Europe are a symptom of the structural imbalance in Europe between the local production of and demand for raw materials and additives. Without restoration of that balance, periodic recurrence of gross disruption of the production chain is highly likely.*

*All of the 3 raw materials mentioned above are chlorine based.* 

The cat food shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:   [Functions and Requirements of Chlorine in Cats | Pet Care Advisors](https://petcareadvisors.com/cats/functions-and-requirements-of-chlorine-in-cats/) – Chlorine is used in cat food as they are highly attracted to it. 

The chicken shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:    [Chlorinated chicken explained: why do the Americans treat their poultry with chlorine? | Analysis & Features | The Grocer](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/food-safety/chlorinated-chicken-explained-why-do-the-americans-treat-their-poultry-with-chlorine/555618.article) – The US Poultry Industry chlorinates chicken as a part of the disinfection process. 

This dependency on chlor alkali to fight COVID isn’t just happening in America. Below are links to numerous countries around the globe using chlorine and chlorine based products heavily to fight COVID.

With this information, it is my belief that chlor alkali manufacturers will continue to experience overwhelming demand nearly impossible to satisfy for the next 2 years plus. This demand will of course create record breaking revenues and profit margins for the industry. As the largest chlor alkali producer in the world, Olin Corporation (ticker symbol $OLN) is in perfect position to reap the most reward. I am highly confident that gross revenue / net profits will significantly exceed expectations for all of 2021, 2022 and likely 2023.

- Rumor about potential buyouts . We already know Microsoft tried to buy them out pre ipo but CEO declined which eventually turned into a $50 million investment from them . At these lower prices , it can be attractive.

- Beaten down tech / growth stocks are poised for a recovery looking at last Friday’s action / C3 AI would benefit as peers like PLTR recover

- No. of shares Short is around 16% of float which can always create a mini squeeze as it recovers

- lockup expiry is on June 7th but they had a clause which let early investors sell prior to lock up if price increased by 30% after IPO. Most investors used this so lockup expiry would most likely would be a non event considering the stock price is not that attractive to sell

What is Huya? 

Huya is the largest game streaming platform in all of China, it’s basically the Chinese equivalent of Twitch. 

Esports is absolutely huge in China, bigger than in the west, it’s like a real sport over there. They hold tourneys in giant $900m stadiums and offer substantial cash prizes to winners. This is an industry with strong tailwinds and we know there will only be massive growth for the foreseeable future.

The majority shareholder of Huya is Tencent, which is great news for Huya because they can buy exclusive streaming rights for all Tencent games like League of Legends and Dota2 as well as exclusive broadcast rights for tournaments, which is creating a very nice moat. Add the network effect and you can forget about anyone ever challenging Huya’s dominance in the industry. We all know Google and Microsoft could never even compete with Twitch despite sniping the largest streamers Ninja and Shroud, because the network effect for game streaming is just that strong.

So what makes Huya so undervalued?

Well, just look at these goddamn numbers:

Market Cap: $4b

Sales: $1.67b

P/S: 2.4

PE ratio: 28

PEG ratio: 0.3

2020 Revenue growth: 30%

2020 Earnings growth: 89%

5 yr revenue cagr: 20-30%

Cash: $1.6b

Debt: $0

Compare these with a somewhat similar company, Bilibili, the Youtube of China.

Market cap: $37b

Sales: $1.8b

P/S: 20.5

PE ratio: 0

PEG ratio: 0

2020 revenue growth: 50%

2020 earnings growth: -118%

5 yr revenue cagr: 35-45%

Cash: $2b

Debt: $1.29b

But why?

Huya has been hit with the perfect storm of bullshit. We all know tech and growth stocks are crashing right now because of inflation, add the fact that Chinese stocks are getting hammered right now because of the new regulations that threaten to delist some of the shadier Chinese companies out there. But that’s not all, there is something else holding this stock down, a pending merger with their largest competitor Douyu.

This potential merger would basically double Huya revenue instantly, double the cash on the balance sheet, while giving them a new market cap of roughly $7b, and they would instantly capture 80% of all game streaming market share in China. Basically a monopoly in a hyper growth industry. They could also increase margins substantially with no competition and no need to outbid competitors with large contracts to their streamers to keep them on the platform.

Under normal circumstances this potential merger would be the most bullish development of all time, but not today. The CCP really doesn’t like it. They don’t like Tencent buying up smaller companies within an industry, merging them together, and creating a monopoly. These days it seems like there is an article every day about how the Chinese government is really starting to crack down on Tencent and Alibaba. The Huya Douyu deal is at the center of all of that China stock FUD, and there is a real good chance that this merger gets blocked outright within the next month or two.

Then Huya is screwed? 

Not really. Whatever happens, it’s good for Huya share price. Right now Huya is one of the most shorted stocks in the market. There are a large number of shorts looking to take advantage of the price difference between Huya and Douyu shares, Arbitrage shorts. They will have to cover either way once the merger decision is reached, leaving Huya to run higher once the merger FUD is over. Over time, Huya will rise to reflect the strong fundaments and growth of the company. 

This stock should be 5x the price it is today at a bare minimum.

What am I doing?

I’m buying LEAPs all the way down, averaging in from the start of this week. I’m up to 90 already and buying many more hopefully before it shoots up.

Positions: HUYA $20 calls 01/2023."

I am just sick of the media choosing to play easy journalism, in turn, putting so much pressure on ape stocks. BUT, this is a great buying op and here's why.

TLDR: CPI %Change number is COVID-biased. The actual number is not high. Inflation is already priced in.

Since yesterday all the channels have slammed ape stocks with the CPI data saying its YoY number was ATH since 2008. It's not fair to use YoY numbers because COVID messed up the trajectory of the CPI. The YoY 2019-2020 April number barely changed (from 255.548 to 256.389)[ https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/), which created stored energy that MUST be realized once the economy started recovering. The latest number of 267.054 is justified because it put the number back into the previous trajectory. In simple terms, the +4.2% seems huge because April 2020's number was frozen by COVID.

It's more appropriate to use Yo2Y number in this case (actually, in many other cases too as broader scope = more smoothened/accurate, less squared error). Think of it this way, without COVID, the number would not have been different than what we have now. The number should still be in the range of 264 - 268.

YoY, It's fair to say +4.16% is huge as it has not been this much since 2008 Sep.

[YoY](https://preview.redd.it/q1exbb7s2wy61.jpg?width=1892&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a6d0ff66f3c9da03fed8f0217ce8431eb057668)

However, if we smooth the data with a Yo2Y calculation, an increase of +4.5% over a period of **TWO** years is so common. The average number is +3.8% (this means +3.8% in **TWO** years).

[Yo2Y](https://preview.redd.it/ft5ukqtt2wy61.jpg?width=1892&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=17854220026ae80337519a3b9c356fa06a1cb3fd)

Please shut the fuck up about CPI. The use of CPI is retarded, but the way it's being brandished is even more retarded.

IMO, Inflation has already been priced in as, currently, KO has a higher P/E than AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, BABA by more than 10%. These are not ape stocks, but my point stands as ""value"" stocks are overpriced than these tech stocks.

It's important that you know this because stupid journalism is making the price discovery process fucked. Investors flee to safe big cap stocks, making them overvalued. These big cap stocks then use these undeserved overvaluations to:

* afford massive ads budget so that it can shove stupid just-to-be-seen ads in your face. I don't want another Coke or Fanta ads to sell me the same message over and over for decades. It's an absolute waste of time and resource.
* lobby. Boy oh boy, where do I even start?
* take over other small companies.

The list goes on.

**Introduction**

Of the many forces of society, the advancement of technology is one that is truly unstoppable. From how we obtain information to how people communicate from a distance, technology has changed the way people live their lives. The service providers of our everyday lives are consistently looking for ways to automate & improve their offerings/operations. This created a market and demand for Amdocs Limited (Nasdaq: DOX), a technology and software product/service (such as consulting) provider that serves companies in communications, media, finance, entertainment, digital, etc.

**Company Overview**

Established in 1982 In Israel, Amdocs Limited is a multinational software company headquartered in Missouri, US. For 40 years, Amdocs has been offering advanced software products and related technology services to optimize their clients’ operations. With 26,000 employees, Amdocs is currently in business with 350 service providers in more than 80 countries. Their clientele comprised of leaders in a wide range of industries: telecom giants AT&T & Bell, financial institutions like HSBC, and general crowd favorites such as Amazon, 7Eleven, and Microsoft.

Most of Amdocs’ offerings are provided within “amdocsONE”, a comprehensive collection of products/services consisting of: Digital Experience & Monetization; Media & Digital Services; Enterprise & Connected Society; Open Cloud Networks & NGOSS; Services & Hybrid Operations; Technology & Practices-Driven Innovation. With its “cloud-native, modular and open offerings”, Amdocs helps clients smoothly and fully transition into tech-automated, digital operations.

In such a demanded market with high-ticket clients, Amdocs recorded $4.16B in revenue during FY2020 (ended September 30th, 2020), at a 33.9% Gross Margin, 19% EBITDA Margin, and 11.9% Net Profit Margin. DOX also has consistently growing Operating Cash Flow, recording $910.7M in the Last-Twelve-Months ending in December of 2020.

Yes, everything seems to be working out well for DOX, but that brings up the question: is there still room to grow, or has DOX plateaued, making it a safe bet, but not a high-return investment?

**Capital Structure & Shareholders Breakdown**

A quick look at Amdocs’ capital structure: **22% Debt, 77.1% Common Equity, 0.9% Minority Interest.** What is important to point out here is that DOX has **recorded $0 in debt** for 3 straight years from FY2017-19. This is a very uncommon occurrence for a company to be 0% leveraged. In contrast, most of its competitors are operating around the 15%-25% debt/total capital ratio, comparable companies like Akamai Technologies recording \~40% leverage in its capital structure. 

When it comes the shareholders of DOX, most of its outstanding shares are owned by institutional holders. Traditional portfolio managers such as asset manager firms are the biggest investors, with FMR LLC. as the largest holder. The large scale and consistent (holds & buys) asset management investment shows street professionals see DOX as a profitable, stable investment.

**Looking Long**

Overall, I believe DOX shows potential at a hold/buy for long positions if you are looking to invest in an undervalued, but experienced & matured company.  The following are three main theses behind a long investment in DOX:

* **Strong & Consistent Financial Performance:**

As an established company, we are seeing highly predictable topline growth rate with consistent profit margins. Although these no longer large-scale increases we would see on a growing tech company, DOX’s consistency and strong performance is definitely a supporting factor when it comes to investment. In more detail, DOX has a 2.9% top-line 5-year CAGR as of December 31st, 2020, with corresponding 3%, 3.6%, and 10.4% 5-year CAGR with EBITDA, EBIT, and Net Income, respectively. Although top-line growth was contracting a few years prior, it has rebounded between 2015-20, which could be contributed to the increasing number of companies transitioning into digital operations/cloud systems. Nevertheless, the higher (and increasing) bottom-line CAGRs means the company is still consistently increasing its profit margins (it is important to point out in that 5Y Net Income CAGR as of Dec.31st 2020 is significantly higher than previous years, which were around 2.2%-5.3%). DOX also has a strong cash flow, largely due to steady increases in operating cash flow. The OP cash flow is the best indicator here as unlevered free cash flow has seen some small-scale turbulence in recent years due to M&As such as the acquisition of Openet Telecom, Juganu Ltd., and Veego during CY2020. Overall, DOX is a strong investment from the financial perspective due to its margin growth and consistency.

* **Deep Product Portfolio with Wide Coverage**

Through “amdocsONE”, Amdocs is able to provide a full-suite of comprehensive products/services that covers every stage of digital transformation. From cutting 80% of time-to-market when utilizing Amdocs bundle offers, to continuous operational support and open tools/cloud platforms, clients receive a thorough service when working with Amdocs. Within the six main categories of offerings mention above (Digital Experience & Monetization; Media & Digital Services; Enterprise & Connected Society; Open Cloud Networks & NGOSS; Services & Hybrid Operations; Technology & Practices-Driven Innovation), there are numerous individual products that allows users to customize their usage of the Amdocs’ platform and offerings. For example, CES20 is Amdocs’ cloud-based customer experience suite. Within CES20, there are 4 products that helps automate and digitize the users’ operations: DigitalONE, CatalogONE, RevenueONE, and Service & Network Automation. DigitalONE is a cloud-based system that allows users to work on their branding and customer experience. CatalogONE is an open-cloud platform catalog solution that allows users to launch new products easily with a detailed user interface. RevenueONE is a platform that allows users to scale or acquire new revenue stream while limiting the cost of acquisition. Last, Service & network Automation is a branch covered by amdocsNEO. AmdocsNEO is a service & network automation platform that offers a wide range of tracking and management capabilities. It is used to drive and control the fast automation process of the company. The CES20 is just an example of how Amdocs products are often interconnected and deeply comprehensive. They also offer certain platforms or products/services that are industry specific.

The wide coverage of the Amdocs offerings means they can gain market penetration across numerous industries. At the same time, the stage-specific offerings allow Amdocs to stay in demand and relevant as clients transition and grow. This plays a huge part into client retainment.

Last, the continuous innovation initiatives at Amdocs supports an investment as it shows the company is consistently trying to grow and improve itself. As a tech company, it is extremely dangerous to slack-off on innovation, which is often seen with tech firms that reaches a consistent profit margin. Being in the tech industry means you live and die by the creativity and uniqueness of the offerings. Amdocs is consistently investing \~20% of their gross profit into R&D. This shows the company’s dedication to innovation, which ensures that it will remain in demand in the future.

* **Extremely Low Leverage**

The last thesis is quite a short and simple one: the low leverage of the company means reduced risks and limits debt-related expenses such as interest/principal payments, which in turn increases their profitability. As mentioned above, there has be several years where the company literally at $0 in debt. During FY2020, the company took on \~$1B worth of debt, which could mean they are preparing for large scale development as from a financial standpoint, they are not in a situation where taking the extra cash is worth the liability. With that being said, the new debt is only 22% of the company’s overall capital structure, and they will have no problem paying off the related fees as they have a strong track-record of positive cash flow.

**Macro Market Trends**

The overall demand for digital/automation transformation/operations creates numerous trends that can positively impact the future of DOX. With the COVID-19 pandemic, company were pushed by the circumstances to digitize their operations, which will expand the market as well as create higher demand for the future. Here are some top trends that will impact DOX’s performance:

* **Overall Growth of the SaaS Market:**  

   * has been consistent growth in the past decade in the SaaS market. This is driven by multiple factors including the automation of internal control, enterprise centre processing system, as well as the boom of 5G and cloud-based services. Looking into the future, for the period of 2019-23, the worldwide SaaS market is expected to reach a $60.36B valuation, recording a 9% CAGR over that period.

* **Lasting Impacts of COVID-19:**  

   * The pandemic has already significantly accelerated the digitization rate due to the lockdowns and remote working environments. This is not a one-time catalyst, but rather a preview of what was going to happen in the future regardless; the pandemic situation has simply brought the future quicker. Going cloud or digitizing is not a temporary decision, this means the market has permanently expanded, and will continue to grow as demand increases.

https://preview.redd.it/78jymbukhhy61.png?width=601&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0362d3fb6c918222d0ffb49fff1132dadea2686

* **5G Penetration & Advancements**  

   * Continuous developments in 5G technology will impact the SaaS industry in two ways:

1. It will increase the accessibility of cloud-platforms and related services, thus increasing demand.
2. It will improve the quality and range of capabilities for the products/services of software companies.

https://preview.redd.it/zcswsxwlhhy61.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3c6560ebdcf519a5bbed1bdc42acc3c298571bc

In the modern society, it seems like life is limited if you have bad Wi-Fi connection. That is emphasized in the world of SaaS. Broader bandwidth and connection qualities will incentivize potential customers to digitalise and help service providers create higher quality products.

**Financials and Valuations**

When it comes to the fair valuation of Amdocs Limited (DOX), I used both comparable companies and intrinsic valuations, then weighted the price outcomes for the final target price. Instead, I evaluated the company using a basic comparable analysis. The companies included in the comparable universe are Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM), Ciena Corporation (CIEN), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (CTSH), and Perspecta Inc. (PRSP). The DCF valuation is relative crude with simple margin and top-line forecasts, but the results seem very reasonable and in-line with street estimates.

**Risks**

To finish off this analysis on DOX, there are a few key risks to keep in mind:

* **Cyber Security**

Although moving operations towards cloud or digital platforms will increase efficiency and limit costs, it does come with security risks. By nature of public, integrated, and/or connected cloud platforms or enterprise central systems, a large quantity of information can be easily accessed in one spot. Although that makes operations easier, it also increases the impact of hacks or other cyber security concerns. In these interconnected platforms, large amounts of information are at risks once the “first door” is opened. Hackers no longer need to crack multiple systems to acquire different information such as customer information and financials. If Amdocs gets hacked, it will likely be very detrimental to the company as large quantity of information will be exposed.

* **Limited Innovation or Growth due to Lack of 5G or Internet Penetration**

For Amdocs and the entire SaaS industry, poor internet infrastructure will limit growth potential and market penetration. If 5G usage and general internet coverage does not match the rate of innovation of Amdocs, revenue growth will stall, which might impact the pricing of the stock. It will also limit the room for innovation and enhancement, which allows more time for competitors to grow within the current infrastructure and increase the competition.

**In the End: Buy, Hold, or Sell?**

Overall, I think Amdocs Limited (DOX) is currently undervalued. In general, the street has a buy or hold/buy valuation on the current price, which I do agree with. Therefore, my final thoughts on DOX are:

* **Buy** for long-term value investment. The stock might be somewhat volatile in the short-term, but its long-term value will be consistent.
* **Hold/Sell** if an investment return is already realized. The economy and overall market is kind of inflated as we recover from the pandemic, therefore a potential cash-out is definitely tangible as rumours of stock market crash spreads.

**TLDR**

An undervalued technology solution and service provider in a growing market with $0 debt and an upside of at least 25%

n9c48p,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9c48p/the_nokia_renaissance_nok_how_the_finnish_telecom/,The Nokia Renaissance (NOK): How the Finnish telecom giant will flourish in the era of 5G,116,24,2021-05-11 02:20:43,"Last Friday, Morgan Stanley analyst, Dominik Olszewski, upgraded Finnish telecom company Nokia to Overweight from Equal Weight. Commenting, “improvements at Nokia are coming faster than we had expected.” AKA, it’s a Buy. The upgrade comes as one of many in a recent positive shift in the stocks rating across the board, including “Buy” ratings issued by SEB Equity Research and UBS Group.

Just like their infamously durable 3310 mobile phone released at the turn of the century in 2000, Nokia’s success in telecommunications remains invincible even in the 5G era. With cutting-edge patents and new contracts with tech giants including Amazon, Microsoft and Google, Nokia is set up for continued strength and relevance in their respective markets.

Although less famous for their mobile devices nowadays, Nokia still crushes earnings expectations with telecom sales due to new remote labor models born from the pandemic. First quarter EPS in 2021 were reported at .08¢, beating the .01¢ forecast eight-fold.

In one year, Q1 ’20 to Q1 ’21, net sales have grown 3%. Adjusted for currency fluctuations, net sales have actually grown 9% on a constant currency basis — an extremely compelling figure. Gross margins climbing to 37.9% from 35.3% in the same period, indicating refined operations and a positive reflection of new leadership.

Pekka Lundmark took over as Nokia’s CEO and President in September 2020, saying he’ll do “whatever it takes” to win the 5G race. Other competitors to look out for are Swedish multinational Ericsson and China-based Huawei. Chinese telecom giant Huawei, however, faces widespread suspicion over state surveillance concerns.

The US has pressured allied nations to avoid collaboration with the Chinese firm, and many countries — such as the UK and Sweden — have placed bans on their technology. Although bad news for China, this opens up greater market share potential for Nokia. This coincides with a year-over-year change of 13% net sales gain in the North American region alone. Possibly indicating the geopolitical tensions are working in Nokia’s favor. As of now, there seems to be no winding down of strained US-China relations.

Nokia appears to be in great health, boasting a D/E ratio of 0.37 as of 03/31/2021. Even more alluring are the four consecutive quarters of positive free cash flow. Nokia netted EUR 1.2 billion in Q1 ’21 alone, with an end-of-quarter net cash balance of EUR 3.7 billion, allowing for aggressive re-investment, particularly in 5G tech. As the decade of 5G ramps up, Nokia is financially positioned to take full advantage of cutting-edge research and development.

Nokia’s existing arsenal of 5G tech is teaming up with behemoths like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft, Google and the US Federal Government. AWS has expanded their existing partnership with Nokia to include cloud-native convergent charging solutions for CSPs (communication service providers). Google, like AWS, is also collaborating with Nokia to enhance cloud services. US Federal Government’s National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) 5G Cybersecurity Project has tapped Nokia to provide a secure transition to 5G networks.

The company’s Q1 ’21 interim report paints a positive picture through 2023, anticipating faster growth than the market. Similar to previous quarters, Nokia is expecting a “clearly positive” cash flow over the next couple years. Optimistic comparable operating margins predict 7–10% through ’21, increasing to 10–13% in ’23. Conservatively managed, Nokia’s guidance appears to deliver from previous quarters. All in all, this optimistic outlook could very well be outperformed in the near future — which is great news for investors.

As the petals of 5G technology unfold across the world, Nokia is in full bloom with it. Strong demand, fresh leadership, top-of-the-line tech and a solid balance sheet are the seeds of a new renaissance in telecommunications. Nokia will once again be reinstated as the best of the best, and prove to be one of the decades most advanced leaders in 5G technology.

[Paysafe Partners](https://preview.redd.it/5dsiel82vby61.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d18a5ff23c52205e6e84ba6b4c0f5f44d68dc146)

Paysafe is one hell of a company. They are a fin-tech like PayPal and Squares, thus should be given a higher multiple for valuation. They got a lot of exciting and growth customers/partners like Barstool (PENN), YouTube (Google), Twitch (AMZN), FanDuel (PDYPY), Roblox (RBLX), CoinBase (COIN), Visa (V), ApplePay (APPL), BetMGM (MGM), Spotify (SPOT), Microsoft/Xbox etc., and on top of that they got a huge digital wallet (#2 in market share) where you can trade/buy the fast-growing e-currencies which is growing in popularity. I truly believed this Paysafe is undervalued compared to its peers. You can read a very good Paysafe DD below on reddit and it gives a lot of insight of Paysafe valuation and bear cases:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mysz54/reviewing\_the\_bear\_case\_on\_paysafe\_psfe/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mysz54/reviewing_the_bear_case_on_paysafe_psfe/)

(the link above is a really really good read with lots of info about Paysafe valuation in-depth and discussion of bear cases, so I’m not going to repeat most of the good points the author mentioned in that sub.)

Most of the time analysis use assumptions to make predictions on future growth. As an example, EV-related stocks (PLUG, BLNK, QS, LAZR, NKLA, BLDP, etc) get higher or ridiculous valuation based on assumption that gasoline cars will eventually be phased out. As you can see most if not all of these companies are unprofitable and some don’t even have revenue, yet worth billions. While this assumption may be accurate, it is extremely hard to know when will growth begin to accelerate. Because of this predictive nature, it’s really hard to know how long you will have to hold onto the stocks before they pop. When or if it will pop is anyone's guess. So while holding onto these stocks will likely result in wild price swings thus high risk / high rewards.

But what if you have the data before you showing the financial growth of your customers or partners? If your customers/partners' revenue grows, it’s more likely than not they are using more of your products or services. Paysafe is one such company where you can actually look at their customers/partners' financial reports to predict where the company will go in the future and when growth will start. For this reason, Paysafe is more of a lower risk but still has high reward potential.

Paysafe will be reporting earning for the very first time as a public company again on May 11. The good news is we already have their customers results in and here are some breakdown of their 1st QTR results showing huge growth:

1. PENN (Reported May 7, 2021) - “Penn National’s income from operations rose to $216.5 million in the first quarter against ($560.6) million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDAR jumped 77.2% from the year-ago quarter to $447 million. Moreover, adjusted EBITDAR margin expanded to 35.1% from 22.6% a year ago.” ( source: [https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1515673/penn-national-penn-q1-earnings-revenues-beat-estimates](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1515673/penn-national-penn-q1-earnings-revenues-beat-estimates) )
2. DraftKing ( Reported May 7, 2021) - “DraftKings is raising its fiscal year 2021 revenue guidance from a range of $900 million to $1 billion to a range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, which equates to year-over-year growth of 63% to 79% and a 16% increase compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance” Source: [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/07/2225374/0/en/DraftKings-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results-and-Raises-2021-Revenue-Guidance.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/07/2225374/0/en/DraftKings-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results-and-Raises-2021-Revenue-Guidance.html) )
3. Spotify (April 28th, 2021)- “Revenue increased 16% to €2.15 billion ($2.6 billion) from €1.85 billion ($2.22 billion) in the same period last year….” (source: [https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9564180/spotify-q1-2021-earnings-report/](https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9564180/spotify-q1-2021-earnings-report/))
4. Youtube/Google ( April 27th, 2021 ) - “ In its first-quarter earnings report Tuesday, Google parent company [Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL) said YouTube [brought in](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/alphabet-goog-earnings-q1-2021.html) revenue of $6.01 billion in advertising revenue during the quarter — up from $4 billion from a year ago, for a growth rate of 49%. That’s an acceleration over its 46% growth in Q4. It’s also nearly twice the growth rate of Netflix, which reported 24% revenue growth [in Q1](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/20/netflix-nflx-q1-2021-earnings.html), and [expects](https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/FINAL-Q1-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf) growth to slow to 19% next quarter.” (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/youtube-could-soon-equal-netflix-in-revenue.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/youtube-could-soon-equal-netflix-in-revenue.html) )
5. Skillz ( May 4, 2021 ) - “Revenue grew to $83.7 million during the first quarter of 2021, up 92% over the prior year. Gross profit grew to $79.4 million during the first quarter of 2021, up 95% over the prior year.” (source: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504006307/en/CORRECTING-and-REPLACING-Skillz-Reports-Record-Q1-Revenue-and-Raises-2021-Guidance](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504006307/en/CORRECTING-and-REPLACING-Skillz-Reports-Record-Q1-Revenue-and-Raises-2021-Guidance) )

As you can see these Paysafe’s customers/partners are reporting explosive growth. While some of these companies may report an earning loss it may be due to higher expenses such as customers acquisition cost (i.e. Draftking). However, here we are more focused on their revenue as the more transactions they do the more likely all or part of that transaction is done by Paysafe. These companies reported earnings before Paysafe, so it can be highly expected Paysafe will report a very good earning and future growth projection tomorrow ( May 11).

Several things to note about Paysafe besides their customer’s earning growth. These factors will also influence Paysafe’s future growth:

1. They are a monopoly when it comes to iGaming/Sport Betting as you can see the explosive growth by DKNG, MGM, PENN, SKLZ, etc.
2. Paysafe took a hit during the pandemic because they also do offline transaction processing, but now things are opening up we can expect going forward these offline transactions will grow again. Also, when re-opening occur, more sport events will occur thus more betting means more transactions for Paysafe.
3. They are #2 in digital wallets and you can buy digital ""stuff"" with the wallet. These currencies has been generating huge revenue for PayPal and SQ  on their 1st qtr report (more on this below)

Finally, both PayPal and SQ reported earning before Paysafe and their results beat estimation:

Paypal earning ( May 5, 2021) “ Revenue: $6.03 billion vs. $5.90 billion expected by Refinitiv” (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/paypal-pypl-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/paypal-pypl-earnings-q1-2021.html) )

Square earning ( May 6, 2021 ) “Square reported a profit of 41 cents per share vs. 16 cents per share expected in a Refinitiv survey of analysts. It also brought in $5.06 billion of revenue vs. $3.36 billion expected by Refinitiv.” ( source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/square-sq-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/square-sq-earnings-q1-2021.html))

So I can say with confidence Paysafe will likely beat their own guidance for Q1 on May 11th. For those of you who don’t know Paysafe, they are not a small player. Their transaction volume is about that of SQ \~$100 Billion. I get it, people will say look man their CAGR is way too small compare to PayPal or SQ. I'm not looking at the past. I'm looking at the future. Their CAGR estimate did not include the sportbetting/igaming growth. Remember that Sportbetting was banned in the USA but has been overturned by the SCOTUS recently. Right now less than 1/2 the population can bet online, and the 4 largest states haven't yet legalized online gaming. This is why I post the results from their customers like DKNG and PENN which is showing high growth rate. And best of all? They own this space in online gambling as they are a monopoly. So we'll see what their new CAGR will be going forward once they reported earning tomorrow (May 11). If Paysafe is able to show growth on par with PayPal and SQ they should be trading at a much higher multiple. See the reddit link above for DD on valuation.

Paysafe involved with Gaming, Sports, e-wallet/currencies which I find very exciting and feel that if I own the stock I’ll be part of the journey of growth with these sectors. Roaring Kitty/ DeepFuckingValue simply invested in GME because he liked the stock. I’m investing in Paysafe simply because it's cool and sexy, regardless of its growth potential.

Summary: Paysafe I believed is a lower risk and high reward stock, since their growth is easier to predict as we can rely on their publicly traded customers data which is showing high growth going forward. They got the 2nd largest digital wallet. I believe as a monopoly in iGaming/Sport Betting their growth will be massive when 20+ states including the 4 largest states: CA, TX, NY, FL begin to allow online sport betting. This is something about Paysafe that I like so much because no other fintech has this space. This is a massive high growth (as seen with DKNG, PENN, MGM 1st qtr report) area and they owns it. For these reason, I am extremely bullish and I like Paysafe for both short and longer term play.

If you sold Nokia during the run-up then you just hate money. NOK got caught up in the GME saga and now the stock has a stink on it thanks to the mainstream media and others who don’t understand how a Short Squeeze works, and how GME went parabolic in one week. Let's keep in mind, there were some good and truthful DD posts on NOK in December/January, and some great fucking DD on Nok in the last couple months. I suspect it went from $4 to $9 just from the massive influx of new members checking out our old posts, trying to find an affordable seat on the Rocketship. No, Nokia doesn't have a ton of short interest. But I still really like the stock and I’d like to tell you why, and a little bit about our future re: John Titor

\>Let's not forget about when this wasn't ALL about fucking the shorts, jeezus christ.. NOK is different from that bullshit, because it truly has deep fucking value. And believe me, this goes DEEP.. They don't manufacture or sell phones anymore. The only connection they have in making and selling phones is the Nokia brand name being licensed out to a Taiwanese manufacturing company called HDM Global. Almost all the company's revenue comes from Wireless Network Infrastructure and Internet Routing Equipment. Let's go back and track this evolution --> In 2010 this only generated 30% of its revenue (Networking Products, Cellular Base Stations, etc) -- In 2020 this made them 85% of their revenue!! Nokia transformed itself into Wireless Technology Company you fucking retards!! They did this through a series of Autistic Acquisitions ""AA"" -- In April of 2011 they acquired the Wireless Network Infrastructure Assets of Motorola Solutions (this basically gave Nokia all of Motorola's 2G 3G 4G assets) --> In August of 2013 Nokia acquired Nokia/Siemens Network joint venture and renamed the division ""Nokia Networks"" and that same year Nokia sold its entire mobile phone division to Microsoft --> The in early 2016, Nokia agreed to acquire Alcatel-Lucent for $15.6 Billion which gave then all of their Wireless Technology, Routers, Switches, and Optical Tech within Alcatel as well as Bell Labs (formerly an Alcatel-Lucent division) -- This final deal gave Nokia the massive scale they have now to compete with the industry giants like Ericsson and Huawei head to fucking head (yeah.. this is real you idiots) And we know that Huawei is literally banned in multiple countries around the world soo... So where am I going with this, and why will they emerge as one of most important companies the near future?? \*\*REEFSHARK - AI DRIVEN 5G WIRELESS NETWORKS - NETWORK SLICING - AND THE POWER OF THE FUTURE\*\* Take an extra retard pill for the rest of this DD post, you're gonna need it. They have been building themselves up to this moment. ReefShark is the key here, 5G Network is the door, and AI Driven 5G Network Slicing is the living room of the future. Nokia has this proprietary chip that will play a big role in how 5G will be available. It will ease the load of 5G Network rollout because it has a 50%-%60 reduction in energy use, which is an outstanding selling point to the industries looking to tap into 5G bandwidth. It is the most efficient chip of its kind, by far, with the added benefit of boosting antenna performance. This efficiency is necessary to the way different industries and companies will utilize the 5G Network. They will go through MVNO (MOBILE VIRTUAL NETWORK OPERATOR) to basically rent out their 5G bandwidth from a cloud. This is called \*Network Slicing\* for all u chimps out there. For example, Tesla will rent out their own slice of dedicated 5G Bandwidth. More than 1,000 companies use MVNO already and most apes have not even heard of it yet. Here is how Nokia fits into all of this techy garbage: NOK IS ALREADY THE BIGGEST PLAYER IN THIS MARKET SPACE (they made up $4.5 billion of the $66.9 billion of ""Telecom Software and Services"" in 2019) AND \*REEFSHARK\* MAKES THEM THE UNCHALLENGED LEADER IN THIS EVERGROWING MARKET WITH AI POWERED NETWORK CAPABILITIES<

\*\*\*BONUS LEVEL\*\*\* Last year NASA selected Nokia's Bell Labs division to supply the 4G LTE communications network for the moon soon. No joke, the ACTUAL Moon, not emoji moon. Before the end of 2022, they will put a highly functioning 4G network on the lunar surface in preparation for the planned 2024 return mission to the Moon. Drop the crayons for a second and think about this... Ok now eat the red one (it's the same colors as your wife's butthole after her bf leaves your driveway in his big loud pickup truck) Your stupid little smooth brain is probably wondering what all this old 4G talk is about with all the 5G shit rolling out nationwide, changing the course of history... Answer--> the lunar surface is relatively flat so there won't be interference with the cheaper, more practical 4G network. We are talking about putting a mobile network into space you retards so stfu. The signal will travel further, it just makes more sense. They must start somewhere, though this will evolve into 5G up there eventually. \*\*NASA could've given this contract to anyone, but THEY CHOSE NOKIA because they believe in them!! They believe Nokia has the best performing Wireless Network Equipment.. So I like the fucking stock ok?!! --> Insert Rocket Emojis, Fire, Boom, Flags, all that shit right here <--

**In short, they are still growing on most segments, the CEO does smart acquisitions (usually at a bit of a premium).**

\--The Business--

Microsoft is a technology titan focused on commercial and industrial applications with software and solutions such as Office 365, Azure, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, Linkedin, Windows 10. They also provide platforms for developers via Visual Studio Code and Github. A smaller segment of Microsoft are their devices and their games division powered by Xbox.

**--Next Moves: Healthcare Applications--**

The healthcare sector is characterized by massive bureaucracy and opportunities for growth. It is one of the rare sectors where real future growth is possible by innovation. Microsoft has established itself as a corporate and industry suite, but now it seems that they are taking their whole Eco-system and moving on the healthcare industry.

This is pure speculation, but it can be one of the boldest moves yet, as healthcare facilities, operations, education, training, quality control are large complex systems that can benefit from the tools and services that the company offers.

We have seen Microsoft positioning for a certain client type and taking over most of their business. As the opportunities for growth in the corporate sector decrease, Microsoft might just turn to one of the most complex industries with high barriers to entry and large upfront investment costs.

On 11 April 2021 they entered into an agreement to acquire Nuance Communications for $ 56 per share, or $19.7 Billion. Nuance is a cloud and artificial intelligence (“AI”) software provider with healthcare and enterprise AI experience, and the acquisition will build on our industry-specific cloud offerings. This is effectively their foot in the door to the healthcare industry.

**--Value--**

I think that the company is trading around its intrinsic value, with potential for growth in the future. There is inflation related market risk that can push down value, but with proper management and pricing flexibility they can at least sustain current value levels.

Microsoft solidified the cloud for the corporate & business sector, and decreased the risk of their sales by adopting a continuous subscription model for most of their services.

Their business model seems to be growth trough innovation as they are positioning themselves precisely in segments where innovation is lacking and are integrating those segments within their high-barrier to entry, complex systems.

\--**Product Breakdown--**

AZURE:  The backbone of the productivity suite for most of the western corporations 

Office:  Stabilized revenues for essential business tools

Windows 10:  Declining bloatware built upon old architecture 

LinkedIn:  Well positioned, profitable social network with long-term commuted users 

Dynamics/Viva:  A major competitor for CRM/ERP market-share with potential for innovation 

PowerApps:  The future tool for cutting operating expenses and bureaucracy for companies 

Devices: Uncertain potential for a better experience for Windows users. Augmented reality done right with industry application

GitHub, VS Code:  The platforms that will keep MSFT on the cutting edge of development tech

Gaming/Xbox: Large but risky potential for growth if the devices and games are improved

Microsoft has a wide and complex set of products and services which can be understood as cost cutting tools for businesses, system architecture utilities, productivity and effectiveness tools. 

They have created a well-thought off interconnected Eco-system that is nothing like the company was even five years ago.

It is now apparent that they are well positioned as a market leader for industrial and business applications and will further solidify their position in the future.

\--Competition--

We are already witnessing the convergence of competitive advantages between the technology titans of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and it is clear that all of them are fighting for market share in similar technologies and industries. 

It seems that every company is fighting for their specific industry positioning within technology. For example, Facebook, Microsoft and Google all experiment with Virtual Reality tools such as Google Glass, Oculus Rift and the HoloLens Headset from Microsoft. However MSFT seems to be the most successful as it is positioning for industrial, military and hybrid workspace applications for the headset - the others had less luck in the consumer/gaming sector application of VR.

Google, Amazon and Microsoft are likewise competing for cloud dominance, where Amazon AWS is positioning as a cost effective player for developers, MSFT is positioning as a stable and secure platform for companies and Google is positioning as an advanced cutting edge option for new technologies and companies that are able to scale.

The last example is between MSFT and GOOGL where they competed for the use of virtual conference apps driven by the new hybrid work culture from the pandemic. Both of the competitors had a variant starting off, MSFT had Skype/Teams, and Google had Hangouts/Meet. It is evident that Microsoft had the right approach with Teams and took over the commercial sector for online communication. Side note, Skype is a drain on the Microsoft brand since the appearance of the pretend close feature. It is irredeemable and should be retired.

DISCLAIMER: I do not own a MSFT position, I am planning to go long on MSFT next week.

Any good news causes the stock to take a massive shit. 

Yes, you heard it here. Any news that would otherwise cause a stocks value to rise actually makes it take a huge dump. 

Tilray: acquired Aphira, prospects to be the worlds number one weed supplier look great. Stock drops 4 bucks and stays there.

MVIS: currently the only company with a working (and best in industry) Lidar and has prosect to either get massive contracts or even be bought out by Microsoft. Plummets like 15 fuckin bucks and hasn't gone anywhere since. 

GME: Hired top E-Commerce figures and booted their old dusty ass Board. Poised to be an industry leader in online sales and paid off their debt. Shit dropped from like 250-275 to 150-180 and has struggled to get anywhere since. 

But what's that you say? Bad news should make the stock rise then?

Fuck you for even thinking it.

Tonix pharma: rejected trials, failed formulas. Shit was once 4 grand a piece and now it's struggling to hit 1.20.

Apple and others suffering from Chip shortages, fell from 140s to 111. 

So whatever you're invested in, if you are expecting to hear ANY news about it coming up, wether earnings, announcements on product trials or if the CEO was caught at the boarder with drugs, prepare for a kick in the balls.

Exception: Alibaba ... Massive law suit, CEO disappears for weeks, suspected killed by China's Gov for calling them out, shit skyrockets ... 

None of this is advice for anything, least of all investment or financial."

($SONY *formerly SNE*)

Given the GME interest, here is an investment idea.  Sony makes & sells games direct to consumers, without relying on a middle man (like Apple). Sony makes & sells the most sought after gaming machine - demand will likely exceed supply all year (at least). They're also into VR (and make & supply the small OLED displays that power VR headsets & viewfinders).

Sony has a well established music & movie studios.  They  recently signed large streaming deals with Netflix and Disney.

Sony is also the top producer of image sensors - from mobile phones (iPhone) to high end cameras (they also produce their own line of stills & cinema cameras and lenses) to industrial sensors for cars & other machinery (ahem MVIS).

In addition to car sensors, they are now road testing their own EV - way ahead of Apple and many of the recent TSLA-wannabe startups.  They are a key supplier for other companies (Apple, Nikon, Panasonic, et al.) and they use their parts for their own products (the competition helps to subsidize their own products like Samsung).

Clover health has fallen from 3rd position last week to 7th this week. Coinbase also dropped out of the top 10 and is now in the 12th position. All the others are the usual stocks in the top 10 list except for Microsoft. They booked their biggest revenue growth since 2018 but down 3%+ after hours. 

 **Top Growing Stocks of the Week** 

https://preview.redd.it/obttnaoueiw61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8e0b1a918c030d69646aa7f4915def8c13f1007

 Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.

**MicroVision ($MVIS)** has been trending for the last two weeks. To say that the stock had a wild ride for the last 2 weeks would be an understatement. The stock went from having less than 500 mentions to more than 15,000 mentions in the last 2 weeks. The sentiment has also been affected by the recent drop going from 24% last week to 15% this week.

**Globalstar ($GSAT)** is a Mobile satellite service company incorporating themselves into many new areas. GSAT was up 50% on Monday causing the spike in chatter. There has been a lot of discussion on the company trading at a value less than what their satellites currently in orbit are worth.

**Nokia($NOK)** has beaten all expectations in earnings report and the stock jumped 11%. Their net profit increased more than 11-fold to 375 million euros ($455 million) which was well above analysts' estimates for adjusted profit of 90 million euros. The extremely bullish outlook is also reflected in the sentiment figures.

**Ocugen($OCGN)** was trending mainly due to their partnership with an Indian firm – Bharat Biotech which produces Covaxin. The vaccine was found to neutralize a new type of Covid-19 variant and Dr. Fauci has said that this might be very important against the current pandemic. Ocugen is planning to bring this COVID-19 vaccine to the US, pending FDA authorization.

**Amazon($AMZN)** was generating discussions due to its pending earnings report. There was a lot of speculative talk about a stock split. But they delivered beats on overall revenue and AWS revenue and far exceeded EPS estimate for Q1 2021.

**SOME FAQ’s:**

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).

Can I use the code/is it open source: Yes.

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.

Thank you for reading!

Royalties this year are expected to be $3.3 million for 2021 (virtually double the 2020 royalties) thanks to the $22 billion contract between Microsoft and the US army. S2upid smashed up a Hololens to prove MVIS tech was in it and MVIS confirmed it was their part in S2upids video during their meeting May 2020.

We also now have back on the table the rumoured $100million deal with Sharp who have just had a 12 month extension granted to their exclusivity deal for MVIS tech for a display/smart speaker etc.

We then have the value of 484 patents as of last year, which has no doubt increased in number since then.

We also have the disruptive best in class A sample LIDAR produced this month, which beats anything from  anyone else hands down.  A bidding war feels imminent on this, unless a deal has already been agreed privately subject to maybe one more milestone of them testing it themselves first...

And then add on the other products that they are working on. 

I’m amazed this hasn’t gone higher in share price! It definitely feels like it will be a 3 figure stock for the buy out. 

It just shows how much power the hedge funds have when they short, to drag the price down so low. I thought they might have learned a lesson from GME but clearly not!"

I spent 10 years with the company, now off and not under any NDA or limit to trading, so I’m now happy to throw some money at the share.

Nokia results this morning show good growth and strong pick up in profitability! Beating the estimates with a comfortable margin. With the house cleaned from bad leadership and product transformation well on its way, I think there are a few benchmarks that support price doubling.

Base business alone supports 50% up: Look at Ericsson: Although Nokia’s business is broader (I come to this why the real gem is there), at the heart is a business similar to Ericsson: 5G Networks. Ericsson trades at double the valuation. This should not be as customers, Operators, want to keep their vendors balanced to avoid paying massively more for their equipment and SW. This valuation gap will close as the roadmap gap has now been closed. Nokia is well ahead on future technologies such as Open RAN and Cloud RAN. 

In addition to Ericsson, Nokia has a better licensing and patenting business being a stronger brand and getting all the patents from Alcatel-Lucent as well. Also in terms of 5G patents, the long term money maker, Nokia is well ahead. This business is basically revenue=profit, thus its key to keep in mind.

Then there is the gem of the business: IP and Optical Networks. This is the crown jewel here, this part is always forgotten by analysts and investors. These guys are brilliant, top engineers and researchers sitting in Mountain View and Belgium, and as shown by the Q1 results, in a growth area. They make incredible products. Go and have a look at the valuation of Cisco (200B company), Juniper. Back? Good, these guys absolutely smoke both companies when it comes to technology alone. Have a look at Arista. Now Network Infrastructure division also provides similar dc networking equipment to the webscale companies like Apple and Microsoft. Arista alone is worth as much as whole Nokia, so there is massive upside here. The worst case is that this part is sold to a Private Equity investor, I know some are after it. This means maybe 10-15B valuation for it. Great, but I think this has potential for so much more. 

Why it has underperformed: Bad management and badly managed merger with Alcatel lucent. Nokia was held back for years by really incompetent management - that management has now been cleaned out. How incompetent? Think hiring senior people based on private life matters…Think throwing half of your R&D budget on a single customers request… New CEO, new Business Group presidents, transformation well under way (since 2,5 years in 5G), and potential in the share to double when executed right. And way beyond that thanks to that nice IP and Optical business. Think Cisco scale. 


Excited to see how the market takes to this today. The fundamentals are solid, and engineering competence is there, the results are coming in!!"

It seems like people are expecting some kind of announcement/ earnings beat from Microvision $MVIS this time around, following the [March 2021 announcement of Microsoft winning a 21.8 billion dollar contract with the Army for the HoloLens.](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html)

It is rumored that this is a big win for MVIS, since they might make some of the components for the HoloLens, or at least may be licensing the ip.  

I have read some of the DD posts by others on this and wasn’t entirely convinced. There is no mention of the HoloLens or Microsoft explicitly on the MVIS investor relations, However I did find the following:

Quotes from MVIS recent 10k for Q4 from Dec 2020:
“we have developed micro-display concepts and designs that could be utilized in head-mounted Augmented Reality (AR) headsets and have developed a 1440i MEMS module that can support augmented reality headsets.”

“In 2019, our revenue was derived from the sale of components, from development contracts, and from royalty fees for LBS (laser beam scanning) technology. Beginning in the third quarter of 2019 and through the end of February 2020, we were selling components to a high-definition display system that we developed for a well-known customer under a development agreement. The volume and resulting revenue and gross profit from this business was fairly low. Therefore, in March 2020, we transferred production of the components to the customer. Starting in March 2020, we earned a royalty from the customer for each unit shipped, with amounts applied against the prepayment that we had previously received from the customer until the prepayment is exhausted. The value of the royalty is approximately equal to the amount of gross profit we would have earned if we continued to produce and ship the components. We believe this arrangement will help us conserve cash, and still preserves our ability to experience financial benefits should the volume of components increase in the future.”

MVIS has had very little revenue, has never reported a profit, has negative operating cash flow and negative operating income, and until recently was trading at about a couple dollars or less per share for many years. 

Current stock price is about 20 dollars, and I think it will either be a bust or a blowout very soon, but I am really not sure which. All depends on earnings report and call.

Has anyone here ever done a straddle play where you buy equal amounts calls and puts for a near term expiration in expectation of a significant stock price move in either direction?

Anyone think MVIS this is the right application for a long options straddle?

*Update 4/29/2021: I did not make any play, and instead decided to stick this one out. MVIS announced they are [making progress with their lidar tech for autonomous driving](https://microvision.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/microvision-announces-completion-its-long-range-lidar-sensor) on April 28, 2021. Therefore, I figured that even if they don't show any profit on their earnings on April 29 and make no mention of a buyout by Microsoft or anything about the HoloLens, their increased share price may be buoyed by new investor sentiment on the prospects for this lidar. If the stock price doesn't move enough, obviously I would take a loss on a long straddle, and I am not sure that it necessarily will since they did at least have some good news to report and there is of course still the potential that they are involved in the Microsoft-Army contract deal. Maybe they will make some announcement regarding a buyout or something in the future, but nothing was said about it on the earnings call, so for now it seems like speculation and too dangerous for me to participate in either on the bullish or bearish end (though I would lean towards bearish right now.

I did listen to the earnings call and read the earnings report, and I am unimpressed, but you should do your own DD and obviously come up with your own conclusions. Feel free to correct me on anything!

Good luck"

I fucking love earnings season. It’s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

This week, more so than others, is extra spicy, with all of $FAAMG (I kicked out Netflix for Microsoft after their disgusting showing last week) reporting alongside loads of other mega cap companies. There is a *stupid* amount of money to be made this week, for traders of all skill levels and styles.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades, I've enlisted the help of my buddy /u/laseryellow and [**compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Enphase fucking MOVES! On average, the magnitude of any given move for it is 15%**!!! An awesome play here would be a long straddle, or reverse iron butterfly. You don’t know which way it’s gonna move, but you do know that wherever it does, it’s gonna fly.

- Although a relatively young company resulting in less data points, **Pinterest also moves with similar magnitude**. You could consider doing something similar on this ticker as well if you think these premiums are better.

- At the opposite end of the spectrum, we’ve got stocks that *dont* move whatsoever during earnings season. The IV on these tickers is unreasonably jacked up for no good reason, so we can look to *sell* options on them to amass a small fortune. **Sirius XM, General Dynamics, CME Group, etc, all don’t really move, but the options are priced as if they are going to anyways**. Use this to your advantage.

- **Over the past 25 earnings seasons, Shopify has gone up nearly 75% of the time**! If you want a “safe” gamble, selling ATM put credit spreads would net you some *insane* premiums. BP also follows a similar pattern, clocking in at a 68% beat-rate, allowing us to make this play one two separate days, ensuring we’re not over-leveraged.

- Lastly, **Microsoft also follows an extremely similar pattern, clocking it at a near 70% winrate**. It’s IV is considerably lower than the other two however, so one may want to use standard call / debit spreads in this case as they are pretty cheap relative to the stocks price and implied move.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 60 fuckin’ companies, theres plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We’ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there’s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll hit up /u/laseryellow and continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**"

That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

This week, more so than others, is extra spicy, with all of $FAAMG (I kicked out Netflix for Microsoft after their disgusting showing last week) reporting alongside loads of other mega cap companies. There is a *stupid* amount of money to be made this week, for traders of all skill levels and styles.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades, I've enlisted the help of my buddy /u/laseryellow and [**compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Enphase fucking MOVES! On average, the magnitude of any given move for it is 15%**!!! An awesome play here would be a long straddle, or reverse iron butterfly. You don’t know which way it’s gonna move, but you do know that wherever it does, it’s gonna fly.

- Although a relatively young company resulting in less data points, **Pinterest also moves with similar magnitude**. You could consider doing something similar on this ticker as well if you think these premiums are better.

- At the opposite end of the spectrum, we’ve got stocks that *dont* move whatsoever during earnings season. The IV on these tickers is unreasonably jacked up for no good reason, so we can look to *sell* options on them to amass a small fortune. **Sirius XM, General Dynamics, CME Group, etc, all don’t really move, but the options are priced as if they are going to anyways**. Use this to your advantage.

- **Over the past 25 earnings seasons, Shopify has gone up nearly 75% of the time**! If you want a “safe” gamble, selling ATM put credit spreads would net you some *insane* premiums. BP also follows a similar pattern, clocking in at a 68% beat-rate, allowing us to make this play one two separate days, ensuring we’re not over-leveraged.

- Lastly, **Microsoft also follows an extremely similar pattern, clocking it at a near 70% winrate**. It’s IV is considerably lower than the other two however, so one may want to use standard call / debit spreads in this case as they are pretty cheap relative to the stocks price and implied move.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 60 fuckin’ companies, theres plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We’ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there’s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll hit up /u/laseryellow and continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**"
mznbvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mznbvw/covids_massive_effect_on_the_semiconductor_market/,COVID's Massive Effect on the Semi-Conductor Market: What This Means for Electronics Manufacturers on Earnings Week,39,17,2021-04-27 20:27:43," Chip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020’s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand. 

Cisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could “...\[take\] another six months…” for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware. 

The effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW’s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, “...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter…” So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.

The United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders earlier this month to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.   
Meanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC has announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang’s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap. 

The increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reports earnings on Wednesday. Analysts are looking for the technology giant to post earnings of $0.98 on revenue of $77 billion after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple’s first product showcase of the year last Wednesday, and the company’s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it’s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat. 

Microsoft will report earnings Tuesday. Analyst estimates place earnings around $1.78 per share over $43 billion in revenue. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft’s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector."

Yes everyone has heard of LiDar tech and its pros and cons. But the one thing everyone gets wrong with MVIS is that their LiDar tech is much smaller than the rest of the markets which allows car makers to use them and not have it look unappealing to the consumers. Plus MVIS is doing much work to make their LiDar at a much lowers cost which is key especially for the average car instead of the higher end cars. This will allow auto makers to catch up to the autonomous software used in the higher end cars without the automakers having to invest a lot of time and money. Then there is their Augmented reality which is gonna be huge in the years to come. We all know the hololens 2 made from Microsoft that  uses  Microvision Tech in the augmented lenses. However it seems a lot of people overlook the use of augmented reality into today's society. Hello pandemic goodbye big business conferences, meetups, face to face interactions. Here comes augmented reality to still be in the same room and looking at the same material and be able to interact with the people and material. Future of construction, construction workers can work on the physical site with an augmented layout of what they are working on and be able to interact with that blueprint right at the sight. How this will save so MUCH MONEY AND TIME for construction. Hello Biden administration massive infrastructure plan over the next 10 years. How about training new employees. There are many people looking for jobs and many companies hiring (today's issues of hiring isn't not enough jobs but not enough qualified people for those jobs). So how do we get those people hired and trained quickly to be able to keep up? Augmented reality! A much more fast and cost efficient way to get that on job experience. This can be applied to mechanics, healthcare workers, construction workers, many sales & marketing, field service, farming, architecture. The uses of MicroVision tech and almost infinite. MVIS owns 55 patens and 90+ pending patents.With most of those very high tech patents that can be HUGE revenue income for them."

Earnings season is in full swing this week, and the markets were volatile. Boatloads of news, combined with a healthy amount of FUD was dropped this week, and I wasn’t around to observe the markets until Thursday, so this recap will be a little bit more bare than most. Apologies in advance. If you want a copy of the newspaper early, feel free to see the links on my profile! With all that being said, let's get into it.

&nbsp;

- **On Monday, the media decided to spread some FUD regarding TSLA** after reports revealed that two people died after a driverless crash in Texas. TSLA shares initially slid 6%, until people pointed out that *literally nobody was driving the fucking car*, meaning that the owner purposely managed to bypass all safety measures in order to avoid outright driving the car. Fuk a weight sensor, fuk a seatbelt sensor, fuk a steering wheel sensor, and fuk the bears, buddy put a case of beer or something in the divers seat while he went to plow his Tinder date in the back seat. Despite this gut wrenching news, TSLA closed the week up 4%.

&nbsp;


- To add to the FUD on Monday, **The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a warning advising consumers to stop using Peloton (PTON) Interactive's treadmill** if there are small children or pets at home. The warning comes after a small child died in March, *nearly two months ago*, during a treadmill accident. America really decided to snitch on PTON over some old old beef just to put my calls OTM, kill me man. This headline is extra stupid cause a small child and animal can die on ANY treadmill, not exclusively a PTON one. PTON never actually recovered, and closed the week down 7%. Guh.

&nbsp;


- **On Tuesday, Netflix reported some disastrous earnings**. Netflix beat on earnings a bit, but then casually tried to slip in the fact that they lost nearly HALF of their yearly subscriber growth, reporting 3.98 million vs 6.2 million expected. Obviously, investors were PISSED and Netflix plunged 10% on the week. To be fair, that’s what you degenerates get for sharing your Netflix passwords with your friends, y’all deserve this one. During the earnings call, CEO Reed tried to “urge investors to look beyond subscriptions"", as if the writing wasn’t already on the wall. NFLX did announce a healthy share buyback during the call, which is pretty awesome considering they just created a dip to buy. Cathie Wood, and CEO Reed were promptly seen religiously doubling down on their shitty investments.

&nbsp;


- Throughout the week, **random shit was mooning left and right, most notably SKLZ and MVIS**. No news announcements, no earnings reports, no catalyst. Just good ol fashioned market manipulation baby. MVIS saw $10.20 before closing the week up 80% around $18.00, while SKLZ followed closeby seeing $12.50 before closing the week up 50% at $18.50. I was eyeing skillz for weeks at this point but didn’t want to catch the knife until it settled. Ah well, live to trade another day I suppose.

&nbsp;


- On Thursday, the media was back to spreading FUD. According to a report by Bloomberg, **President Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6%** to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new marginal 39.6% rate would be an increase from the current base rate of 20%, the people said on the condition of anonymity because the plan is not yet public. The proposal could reverse a long-standing provision of the tax code that taxes returns on investment lower than on labor/salary. **When coupled with the 3.8% tax on investment income that funds the Affordable Care Act, federal tax rates for investors could be as high as 43.4%**. For $1 million earners in high-tax states, rates on capital gains could be above 50%. For New Yorkers, the combined state and federal capital gains rate could be as high as 52.22%. For Californians, it could be 56.7%. Although this news has already been known for a long ass time, it still tanked the markets 1% on the day. Algos reacting to humans reacting to algos, crazy shit. I can’t help feel like this entire situation was comedic as hell. Rich people make too much money, therefore we wanna increase taxes on the ultra-wealthy. The ultra-wealthy then immediately withdraw all money from the stock market and we’re left with retail traders left holding bags. Wealth is transferred from the poor to the rich. Mission accomplished.

&nbsp;


- **To those familiar with the [Lil Yachty Indicator](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg0975/lil_yachty_theory_goes_on/), this week was terrifying**. On 4/20, Lil Yachty released a hit single, causing the market to absolutely shit itself. Although the market managed to recover, the stress it caused wasn’t all that welcome, because the song itself was pretty dogshit. On top of all that, on Friday he also announced that he’s dropping a ***WHOLE ASS ALBUM***. Friday was a ripping green day, which is really fucking awesome, cause it means I got to liquid all my positions at an all time high. I hope you all followed suit, cause next week we’re gonna be blood red. Don't believe me? Search up ""Lil Yachty Crashes Stock Market"" on youtube for some definitive proof.

&nbsp;


- **There was a whole bunch of news this week that I didn’t have time to write about, but I encourage you to look into it** later if it interests you! I’ll summarize them all below. The U.K. government said it would probe **Nvidia** Corp.'s $40 billion deal to buy British chip-designer Arm from SoftBank Group Corp. Chat startup **Discord** Inc. has halted talks to sell itself to potential suitors including **Microsoft**, according to people familiar with the matter. On Tuesday, **Apple** announced a new slate of products set to include the company's own chip. **U.S. weekly jobless claims fell to 547,000** in the latest week, below the 617 estimate and from 586,000 prior week. Continued claims fell to 3.674M vs. the estimated 3.667M.

&nbsp;


All in all, that wraps up this week's recap! Apologies for the shorter report this time round, I was extremely busy with work this week, and earnings season came with WAY too much additional news. I hope you all have a wonderful weekend, and come back on Monday rejuvenated for some more trading. Cheers 😎"
mwwt2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwwt2h/end_of_week_market_report_week_of_friday_4232021/,"End of Week Market Report: Week of Friday, 4/23/2021",42,12,2021-04-23 22:42:42,"Hello Traders and Investors! What a week right?! So many stories and earnings! Here is my weekly recap which I share every Friday to help to wrap your head around these markets! Feel free to DM me any of your questions and happy trades! 

The S&P 500 opened at $4138.78 today, lower than its previous Friday’s close of $4185.67 and its 52 week high of 4,191.31. Recovery from COVID has seen significant gains in the market as prices pull back from last week’s all-time-highs. 

Reports released Thursday that President Biden could propose a capital gains tax increase to 39.6% on individuals earning $1 million dollars or more, nearly double the current nominal rate of 20%. Additionally, a 3.8% investment tax currently exists to fund Obamacare. This potentially pushes the tax rate 43.4% which conflicts with long standing tax practices that have historically seen investment income lower than labor taxes. Such an increase seeks to address long standing notions of wealthy individuals paying lower tax rates than middle and low-income workers, a sentiment that President Biden campaigned on and championed. 

Members of the GOP suggest the increase will halt economic growth, leading those affected to hoard assets in order to avoid the tax. It is unclear if these claims will hold water, as historically there has been a low correlation between increases to the capital gains tax and the market. In 2013 the S&P experienced stellar growth of 30% despite an increase to capital gains tax of over 86%. 

Jobless claims dropped more than 7% from last week according to the Labor Department. This coincides with robust gains in the market as a whole as the country recovers from last year’s COVID pandemic. Current job loss from pre-COVID era still hovers around 8 million. Increase in national vaccine rollouts, averaging 3 million per day, should expedite this recovery. Approximately 40% of Americans have received at least one dose of the vaccine.  
Several major travel companies reported earnings this week. This includes American Airlines, United Airlines, Royal Caribbean. The International Air Transport Association has commented on the situation, citing potential losses in the sector of $48 Billion for the 2021 fiscal year. These numbers are over a 25% increase from previously released estimates of $38 Billion. Although significant, losses are down significantly from last year, where the industry suffered a $126.4 Billion loss in the wake of COVID shutdowns. 

American Airlines posted dismal earnings of -$5.54 per share Thursday. A spokesperson for American Airlines said the company is spending around $30 Million per day in operations costs, despite reducing annual operating costs by $1.3 Billion. The company continues to consolidate and revealed it expects to reduce its workforce by 1,600 in the coming months. In addition, American Airlines reportedly reached a deal with Boeing to delay delivery of twenty-three 737 jets for up to 3 years. American Airlines posted revenue of 4.01 Billion, just under half of it’s posted revenue only a year ago. Airports are functioning at around 60% of their capacity. 

""We continued to excel in growing customer relationships in our market focus areas of mobility, fiber and HBO Max,"" said AT&T CEO John Stankey in reference to a favorable Q1 Earnings report for the communications giant. Q1 Earnings reports reveal an excellent quarter for the company, who continues to grow in cell-service subscribers. AT&T also posted favorable results for its HBO Max service, which it received in its 2018, $85 Billion acquisition of Time Warner. 

A Tesla vehicle was involved in a fatal crash that killed two people over the weekend. The car was suspected to have been functioning on Autopilot by investigators as it was found with no occupant in the driver’s seat. Tesla has revealed that they have no data that suggests the vehicle was on Autopilot during the crash at this time Tesla did not rule out the possibility that further investigation may reveal the vehicle was in-fact on autopilot, but declined to make any additional comments at this time. 

Discord, a popular chat application developed for gamers, has ended months-long acquisition talks with tech giant Microsoft. Market Valuation of Discord has skyrocketed to $10 Billion from last year’s June valuation of $3.5 Billion. This comes at a time where many social media platforms are looking to develop and integrate chat functions in a way to capture user engagement and capitalize on the increase in remote work. Discord now intends to stay independent and pursue an IPO. 

The decision by Discord comes as Salesforce looks to acquire Slack in Q2 ‘21 for $27 Billion. Slack operates a chatroom not unlike Discord, but targeted at businesses as opposed to consumers. The acquisition is currently pending a U.S. Justice Department probe that will determine whether or not it will continue. Microsoft's attempted acquisition of Discord on the heels of Slack’s pending acquisition is likely a response to increased competition for Microsoft from Salesforce in the B2B and B2C technology markets. 

Netflix reached 208 million subscribers in Q1, just missing its projection of 210 million. The tech giant blames this miss on societal normalization as COVID regulations ease and more people return to work. Quarantine mandates saw a massive increase of 16 million new subscribers in the early months, and just over 10 million between April and June of 2020. In contrast, January through April of 2021 saw only 4 million new subscribers.  Regardless, the streaming giant reported an earnings per share of $3.75, versus $1.57 the year prior, which beat Wall Street predictions. Netflix’s 2020 subscriber boom showed massive financial gains in revenue, operating income, and operating margin. Q2 forecasts project a slight correction to this growth due to job growth and general societal rebound.

I've seen a couple people a few months back lightly cover this company but without details. So, here's my take.

&#x200B;

***TELOS***

&#x200B;

**What is it?** An I.T. and cyber-security company that serves govt and large enterprise clients and focuses on leveraging cloud technology.

End of 2020, going into ‘21, Telos switched their focus to product development, scaling, and deliveries. They didn’t have any strong advertising or marketing strategies ending 2020, though they plan to drastically change that this year with a planned *300%* increase on revenue from their 2020 advertising/marketing investments.

Their biggest product, Xacta, is used by BIG names: ***CIA, DoD, National Archives, Department of Energy, Amazon, and Microsoft.***

Telos has been flying under the radar for the past few years, being used only by people like the CIA, because they’ve wanted to focus on a niche customer-base and provide quality service, building up their business through hard work and a loyal, federal customer base rather than hype-- another reason you won’t find out too much information on them through typical analyst ratings: they’ve had a completely different customer-niche than usual companies. As they begin to spread into commercial organizations, more data will be released for the public to analyze.

Now, as cyber-security becomes increasingly important, institutions are setting standards that security and I.T. companies have to comply with. These organizations outside of federal agencies are constantly seeking help to comply with these new sets of standards which Telos has mastered with their cybersecurity product, Xacta. Telos is the only player in the game with a product like Xacta. All eyes are turning to them for help with complying to these new standards. Roughly 50% of commercial organizations are set to adopt these standards this year, with Telos’ product Xacta. Commercial companies/organizations everywhere are starting to do their research on who can help operationalize these standards and soon beginning to find out that Telos is the top dog in the game for it.   

The next venture of domination for Telos seems to be the educational sector. Unleash: ***Telos Ghost***. The Ghost product actually aims to completely hide the school’s network and cyber infrastructure from any outside or even internal threats as well as simply unauthorized users. Another goal of Ghost will be to completely prevent cyber bullying and hide the students and their assets, digitally speaking (very interested to see how the prevention of cyber bullying will be implemented into the security framework). Not only will Telos conceal the students and the school’s digital infrastructure with Ghost, working with Telos helps with school audits, making the exhaustive process smoother and within compliance with security standards. As we mentioned before not many products, dareisay…. Any at all… offer full security to organizations within the new set of security standards. Another factor that Telos has is the wifi networks they offer to educational institutions. It offers massive collaborative capabilities to the students and teachers, helping everyone achieve their goals together on the go with peace of mind of any security breaches on mobile networks. 

Looking at Telos as a stock, as of 4/19/21, institutional ownership has risen .1% to 27.6% and insider ownership has risen *16.3%* to 26.6%. They’re closest competitor is CSP Inc. which ended last year on a negative 1.45 million in net revenue, whereas Telos has actually ended 2020 with a net gain of 6.84 million. They only plan to increase their net revenue this year with the marketing and advertising investments they’ve made. The net gain of 6.84 million is up from last year’s negative 2.3 million and up from prior years as a whole, showing healthy signs of growth. Their revenue growth has gone up 20 million consecutively each year the past two years. Towards the end of 2020, Telos also signed a 10 year, 10 Billion dollar plan with TSA and their pre-check system. Coming into 2021, they’ve even managed to go ahead and set up $75 million in deals with customers *so far*. They still have plenty of time to add a couple more deals in. Their revenue for the end of the year is projected to be between 283 million and 295 million, which is over a 50% increase in revenue compared to last fiscal year.  Their earnings are projected to grow over 60% this year-- that’s faster and higher than the u.s. stock market as a whole year to year. The return on equity for the next 3 years is predicted to be almost 30% (29.3%). Telos also has NO debt. The company actually just completed a “Follow-On Offering,” which is a great thing for Telos because all they were doing was simply raising capital shortly after having their IPO-- a completely healthy move, in fact, a very bullish sign (remember, they have no debt, so all it did was give them more money to work with for future projects).


Edit1— positions: 7 shares @ 33.33/share (I plan on amassing more ASAP)

An exciting week ahead of us, here is my weekly newsletter which I share every Monday to help prepare you for the week! Feel free to DM me and happy trades!

**Week of 4/19/21**

The S&P500 opened Monday 4/19/21 at 4179.80, just below the previous close of 4185.67 on Friday  
4/16/21.

Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) prepare to square up over the social media platforms controversial  
tracking of consumer data. Facebook, which generates a large portion of its profits from targeted advertising, is known to collect consumer data to deliver the ads it believes will be the most successful. Apple has been in the process of developing what it calls “App Tracking Transparency,” for its devices and announced in January that the feature will be included and enabled by default on all new Apple operating systems. The technology, which was tested publicly in summer of 2020, will prevent applications like Facebook and Instagram from being able to collect user data. Facebook has begun preparations to sue Apple, who is currently in the midst of a lawsuit over App Store payments for the popular online game, Fortnite.

Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke on the issue following statements from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg citing Apple as their, “biggest competitor.” Tim appeared committed to continuing to roll out the technology, saying, “Technology does not need vast troves of personal data, stitched together across dozens of websites and apps, in order to succeed. Advertising existed and thrived for decades without it. And we’re here today because the path of least resistance is rarely the path of wisdom. If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform.”

Apple will hold its first product showcase of the year tomorrow, 4/20/21. The technology frontrunner is suspected to unveil our first glimpses of consumer-grade Augmented Reality technologies. The product showcase comes on the heels of a great month for the emerging AR industry, which was just the subject of a $20 Billion military contract with Microsoft. Apple is up 0.86% on the market open.

Emerging fitness company Peloton (PTON) traded down 5% on the open following federal regulators warnings against treadmills sold by the company. The Consumer Product Safety Commission released statements April 17th warning parents of children and pet owners to exercise caution after the death of a child who became wedged underneath the machine. At least 40 incidents of injury related to the machine have been recorded since its release.

Reports of Google (GOOG) using foreign tax loopholes to evade taxes have emerged. The company reportedly used the “double-Irish,” loophole to funnel over 100 Billion in profits through Ireland and into Bermuda in 2018 & 2019, allowing the company to collect the profits free of U.S. taxation. The loophole was addressed and abolished by the U.K. in 2015, however the nature of the change to legislation still allows companies established before it’s passing to exploit the loophole. A spokeswoman for Google indicated that the loophole is no longer being used by the company, and that the U.S. taxes avoided by using the loophole would have amounted to approximately 80% of all taxes levied against the profits.

The September 2020 agreement to merge NVIDIA (NVDA) and ARM Ltd. is currently in limbo as U.K. regulators have released statements intervening in the acquisition. The merger, which was negotiated by NVIDIA and SoftBank, is worth approximately $40 Billion. The intervention was released this morning, 4/19/21, and carries with it the stipulation that a full federal investigation be conducted and completed by the end of July 30th, 2021. The state of the deal is uncertain as markets await a press release from NVIDIA.

JP Morgan (JPM) has displayed considerable interest in funding a new professional soccer league in Europe. The European Super League, which was announced on Sunday by a dozen of the world’s largest football clubs, will be established to rival the current European Champions League, and will consist of 12 of Europe’s leading clubs, mostly from Spain and the U.K. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan confirmed in an email that it would be involved in funding the league, but the amount in which JP Morgan will be contributing is still unknown. JP Morgan posted earnings of 12.61 last week and was up 0.5% on the market open.

A relatively low amount of major economic numbers will be released this week. Reporting starts with Jobless Claims at 8:30AM on Thursday, April 22nd. Instead expect a busy week for earnings reports, with many major companies reporting earnings throughout the week.

Some of the larger players releasing earnings include Coca-Cola, on Monday, Johnson and Johnson on Tuesday, Intel on Thursday, and American Express on Friday. Also reporting earnings this week are several of the major travel companies impacted by last year's COVID shutdowns. This includes United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, and Royal Caribbean.

# TL;DR

`Heutagogy - self-determined learning, is a student-centered instructional strategy that emphasizes the development of autonomy, capacity, and capability`

`Pedagogy - the method and practice of teaching, especially as an academic subject or theoretical concept.`

Roblox is fundamentally an education company that encourages students to learn modern-day equivalents of typing on a computer. These skills involve things like learning how to code, develop art, or strong communication skills. =

>""We plan to continue to make acquisitions and investments in other companies, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute our stockholders, and significantly harm our business. As part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies, features, and technologies. For example, in 2020 we acquired Ceebr Limited, a company that operated a platform that teaches children age 6-13 to design, program, and play their own games."" - Roblox S-1

# Purpose

To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here. WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts can crush Wall Street analysts at places like Morningstar or M-Fool. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation or cooperation.

* Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**
* How do we compare social media incentives? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**
* What really is customer service? **(GameStop DD Complete)**
* Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(Kansas City Southern Rail DD Complete)**
* What are elements behind US lagging industrial sector? **(Autodesk DD Complete)**
* Do we understand the consequences of STEAM education (Science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics)? **(YOU ARE HERE)**
* Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? **(Cloud Compute DD in Progress)**
* How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that’s why I’m sharing my writing. I’m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.

# Video Games & Heutagogic Learning

It appears clear these days that video games are the most dominant form of media. This is because the video game industry can better access and more aggressively capture our high-barrier entry need for adventure and journey. Other industries compete with this element but ultimately place their customers in the spectator's seat. For example:

1. The short stories on social media like Snapchat, Instagram, Youtube, or Twitter.
2. The hero tales created by Disney or Netflix.

&#x200B;

[Gaming as the leader in entertainment or media](https://preview.redd.it/xms6g6ksvpt61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=e84e0655c99280e464931f3da513e33404fbdee6)

One must remember that the attention-economy fundamentally depends on on key metric: **engagement**. It is no secret why organizations like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, or even Tesla have further intersected with gaming in aggressive maneuvers in recent years as a result of this economic condition. Gaming is a big winner of the attention-economy and often sits at the frontier of new economies.  When looking at age, gaming or other medias can be the shortest path to reaching new or lifelong customers. It is a lucrative and difficult position to acquire or maintain.

&#x200B;

Think of it historically; during the first iterations of the web, many customers were fearful of putting credit-card information online while online gaming companies have ventured into selling branded debit cards that sold to children and youth that otherwise did not have access to banking. Roblox takes this nature a step further by effectively defining and supporting Robux-to-fiat economy as the lifeblood of the company.

&#x200B;

[First generation fintech and banking services](https://preview.redd.it/72qme0crxpt61.png?width=353&format=png&auto=webp&s=cadb26b801c61afe73a8a96cb16a0024c66e316b)

I’ve discussed internet media, user incentives, and their distinctions in a previous DD involving Pinterest. To highlight one of main ideas:

>""An internet forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. In my view, it ranks like the following list, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:

1. Google is fueled by customer’s need for answered information.
2. Online video games are fueled by a customer’s need for adventure.
3. Reddit is fueled by a customer’s need for community.
4. Pinterest is fueled by a customer’s need for ideas.
5. Facebook is fueled by a customer’s need to connect.""

In this DD, I would argue that gaming is one of the most comprehensive applications of internet forums that can encapsulate all of the needs above and dig deeper into the ideas that drive it.

&#x200B;

[The investment incentive: low barrier to entry & decentralized game development](https://preview.redd.it/hmibns2pzpt61.png?width=1303&format=png&auto=webp&s=a08c1a1680665d6f9272f3cff8ab19bb68f3f3ed)

I typically do not like to assert authority on a subject when I write DD, but I feel that in this case it is necessary due to an enormous complexities behind education technology, what's wrong with it, and what needs to be corrected.  In short, my view is that video games are one of the most powerful ways to engage students in a meaningful and long-lasting education, ranging from social to reading skills.

&#x200B;

[Heutagogic learning](https://preview.redd.it/rq9dxj9yzpt61.png?width=591&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4fbe53adde74b85313ca4dca53077e14de64983)

Online games fulfill a similar shortcoming that traditional medias fail in regards to adventure or journey.  In the same fashion, education and the art of teaching generally stutters when the student remains a spectator for too long.  What gaming achieves as an education service are all the critical requirements of a healthy STEM education:

&#x200B;

1. The ability to inspire curiosity and confidence.
2. The ability to deeply engage.
3. The ability to produce imagination or creativity.

Some of us may scoff about this, but there is a lot of truth to this sentiment that I believe many would agree with. For many early online child gamers, skills like typing quickly, bartering, multiplying, reading comprehension, or the desire to pursue arts originates from our time spent engaged by video games.

This is the goal and nature of heutagogic learning. This nature extends to adulthood, as many of us experienced this phenomenon while learning about advanced financial instruments for the sake of ""learning the game""  of stock market investing. We spend time scowering through forums and generating a community no different than that of popular online games.  Many of us have even acquired generational knowledge as a result of this media condition. We have met the proper requirements and incentives for a STEM education at scale.

[Andragogic\/Heutagogic learning at scale](https://preview.redd.it/gplo1bx41qt61.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=715bae2a0ff447bd5d21569bcac401c636c69dae)

I could talk length about this subject alone, but simply put, the world is not quite ready to accept such an idea. Games are still seen as entertainment, but it typically evolves each generation. In my generation, three societal transformations occurred:

1. It stopped being weird to purchase in-game cosmetics.
2. The idea of watching others play video games was normalized.
3. E-Sports became popular and inspired a new economy.

&#x200B;

[Second generation online gaming](https://preview.redd.it/4bt555i62qt61.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c281084802f3ff72cb8143b40761bde4fa9e5ed)

Some of these resistances are interesting when you look at it from a simpler lens. Why was it weird to watch others play video games online, when it was seemingly normal to watch someone play Dance Dance Revolution in an arcade or an older sibling progress through a game? Why was it strange to purchase cosmetic goods where we spend a large percentage of our time in digital worlds? Why was it bizarre to see dedicated players compete at global levels when gaming and online access became a worldwide normalcy? Usually there is no good reason for the psychological resistance to change.

Yet here we are, playing and learning effectively one of the most popular mobile games in the US.

&#x200B;

# STEAM Pedagogy - Arts in STEM

&#x200B;

[STEAM pedagogy for architecture, engineering, or construction](https://preview.redd.it/b57peu7j2qt61.png?width=2782&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e6ce51e01691091ff6dbeee88ff1dad985a2ff7)

With that idea covered, I want to transition to examine one of the leading pedagogies in US education, which is the inclusion of arts in STEM, known as a STEAM pedagogy.  It may not be immediately clear why the inclusion is such a drastic change to STEM, but one should consider several factors:

1. STEM education standards are poor with low engagement (a societal problem)
2. Good science and engineering requires confident students (resisting imposter syndrome)
3. STEM requires creativity and imagination (critical thinking requisites)

&#x200B;

[Game development, code, or design](https://preview.redd.it/556dqhnp3qt61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6b4a2ac6c89a435890fcd01210026208aae9337)

What an arts education does is fundamentally produce new language and learning skills that are actively applied in a STEM education. Typically speaking, arts is also far more engaging to youth while traditional STEM learning models can carry less obvious inherent incentives.

However, slowly but surely, we are beginning to see students who seek to learn digital art, coding, investing and other STEAM-derived interests that can transition into other branches of STEM as a result of incentivizing the desire to learn these skills.

A young Roblox game developer is only a short path away from finding a passion in architecture or cloud computing. This strategy is not new and has had success for organizations like Adobe, Microsoft, Autodesk, and other technical skills. These are largely andragogic forms of learning, or adult-centered educations.

&#x200B;

One of the most significant accomplishments of the inclusion of Arts in a STEM-centered education is the inversion of a question that afflicted many classrooms for generations:

>“Why do I need to learn this?”

It turns out, the answer is not

>“so you can become a scientist!”

but to provide an environment that encourages and incentivizes a proper learner's mentality

>“I need to learn this, so that I can create that.”

&#x200B;

Engineers and scientists are simply disciplined creators no different than an artist or performer. However, there are significant and clear barriers to entry to STEM-based and Arts-based learning. It is far more pragmatic for a child to inspire creative behaviors with a canvas, skateboard, or instrument while the barrier to entry for engineering practices may be far less accessible.

Some of this is partially a consequence of time, where there has been less knowledge transfer on writing software vs. writing prose and some of these barriers have compounding consequences at the socioeconomic level.  For example, there is a large disparity in big tech hirings, and such consequences can carry over to other multi-trillion dollar industries driven by infrastructure and Green New Deal policies.

&#x200B;

[Socioeconomic consequences in education support](https://preview.redd.it/t2mh2ikz3qt61.png?width=987&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ed2aadf47bb21e36d44864efe58303c20119d74)

Another huge barrier to entry to STEM is simply the fact that many students do not believe in themselves or have not been encouraged to imagine that they are capable of achieving success in subjects like mathematics and science, so there is an enormous amount of undue self-filtering in the field. Learning how to dance is a far more engaging practice to a child, while learning how to code in some developer environment without the proper incentive may seem pointless. Organizations like Roblox can and are changing the equation for some students.

You may be at a loss at this point, but it's worth taking the time to simply ponder on this and what it means economically for Roblox. The language used here is directly aligned with the language used in the Roblox S-1 registration document:

1. Inspiration mentioned 9 times.
2. Create and inspiration mentioned 75 times.
3. Engagement mentioned 160 times.

This language is particular due to the game identifying with its original iteration, Interactive Physics, an education game that launched in 1989.

>""The story of Roblox began in 1989 when our founders, David Baszucki and Erik Cassel, programmed a 2D simulated physics lab called Interactive Physics, which would later go on to influence our approach to building the groundwork for Roblox. Students across the world used Interactive Physics to see how two cars would crash, or how they could build destructible houses. In starting Roblox in 2004, we wanted to replicate the inspiration of imagination and creativity we saw in Interactive Physics on a much grander scale by ushering in a new category of human interaction that did not exist at the time.""

# The Roblox Vision

>""We focus our business on our developers, creators, and users, and acting in their interests in the long-term may conflict with the short-term expectations of analysts and investors.""

&#x200B;

[EBP - Engagement Based Payouts started in 2020](https://preview.redd.it/z63prfzr6qt61.png?width=467&format=png&auto=webp&s=faad3efe3a156c1f26e4adadefb20346466bb37e)

Understanding the nature of modern-day cloud computing and its future direction will allow investors to understand the paths that Roblox will take. The fundamental theory of this economy is that a customer's data is an increasingly tangible asset. The way that I like to examine the economic output of this industry is by two core economic elements.

1. The value of work generated by machine-to-machine transactions (network output).
2. The value of data and services generated by human experiences (customer input).

[Serverless computing - network service architecture for real-time and powerful apps.](https://preview.redd.it/wl88yq547qt61.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&s=618f6be99e0b7cc157065b4505cb82d7f89d5e36)

There are many organizations that capture the essence of this industry. Organizations like Square and Zoom will provide services that we're all familiar with, but we often forget the under-hood-details that exist and govern the infrastructure of these companies. What cloud computing organizations have realized is that as our engagement with platforms increases, the value of our data and needs becomes increasingly tangible. Our needs for financial technology or property rentals have resulted in regulatory or social challenges, which we typically refer to as ""disruption"". The disruption is rooted in the fact that our data is an authentically tangible good.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vpzpov6deqt61.png?width=845&format=png&auto=webp&s=0128b3dd2ee4912161dbfc99c9d312b8f57f9b6c

&#x200B;

This idea that our data and time spent on digital platforms is the central hypothesis behind creation of the robux system that Roblox lives on. There are many things that Roblox needs to accomplish in the near to short term to achieve long-term profitability and the leadership seems to have a clear vision on how to achieve that:

1. The company will continue to redistribute its wealth back toward its developers.
2. The company will aggressively invest in education sectors to incentivize students to learn valuable skills.
3. The company will support wildly successful games as a way to create a long-term identity for Roblox (like popular Nintendo games)
4. The company will continue to invest in its cloud platform and eventually develop its own hardware platform to reduce its expenses.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jr21jf1b8qt61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8175cc302d2be55fe0e446f0b78dc71d6f1d4956

The reason that I'm certain of this is because the organization needs to accomplish the following incentives and financial feats:

1. Reached a large enough audience in order to maintain long-term relevancy.
2. Produced and support games that create enough incentive to join the platform.
3. Created enough incentives for developers to produce quality experiences.

&#x200B;

>""Roblox has a vibrant economy built on a currency called Robux, which can be purchased through the Roblox Client and website. Users can also acquire Robux through a monthly subscription to Roblox  
>  
>Premium. Developers and creators earn Robux by selling access to virtual content. Developers can also earn Robux by driving engagement of Premium subscribers through an engagement-based payout system. When Premium subscribers spend time in a developer’s experience, that developer earns a prorated share of the user’s monthly subscription fee. Engagement-based payouts incentivize developers to invest in the engagement of their experiences. Roblox allows developers and creators to convert earned Robux into the real-world currency of their choice through our Developer Exchange Program.""

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h95ts6pt8qt61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0406e17772f8f302bfdc4beb4eee288509e07440

In my view, Roblox's 2020 premium payout system will be one the biggest shifts in media as it has many potential outcomes that we aren't fully implemented yet. This is the nature of certain powerful architectures like computing more data at the edge or leaning on services like Fastly, Amazon Fargate, or other serverless/back-end platforms. Roblox is no such stranger to this and I would say that they certaintly have a vested interest in pushing these kinds of interactions.

Some uses cases of engagement-based payouts are repeatable to other platforms, where organizations like Reddit could easily implement similar financial logic if they discover that Reddit Subscribers spend the majority of their time to a small concentration of subreddits. This already exists to an extent, where users represent engagement through coin-sharing and reddit emoji placements.

Another example, if a high-quality education game were to be released on Roblox, where the developer agrees to redistribute their earned Robux to schools in need, then Roblox has achieved an economy where a student who is spending time learning has resulted in the improvement or construction of other learning facilities. This is also reflective of the idea that data is increasingly tangible.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bb9j3yj7aqt61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=8308e21dd05757fa74928a26560f665d0d61bf12

The possibilities with an engagement-based payout system are enormous for Roblox and produces added value to the ideas behind things like virtual concerts, streams, or other experiences that aren't fully realized in the gaming sector. For example, what is the economic consequence of children having a safe environment to attend concerts of their favorite artists? At the same time, the Robux payout system is a non-trivial distance away from creating applications of other alternative currencies like exchanging Robux with other digital assets like VBucks, tickets, or block-you-know-what-based applications.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1g33ivkwaqt61.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6ff4e2b37801f0ee02fa70d46b8fa636bc5455b

Another core element to Roblox's financial future is to ultimately secure its means of distribution. As it currently stands, the biggest expense to the Roblox platform is the fee processing it must agree to when it comes to doing business with organizations like Apple, Microsoft, Google, and other payment processors like Visa and Paypal. One way to reduce these costs and increase profitability is to develop products akin to the Nintendo Switch or Oculus platform. This idea is not too far away given the nature of Roblox's business, which has an enormous amount of various types of games that would be well-suited by Roblox partnerships. Overtime, the value of Apple or Google's distribution power weakens as the company cements itself into public consciousness.

&#x200B;

The company has alluded to this idea with an April fool's joke in 2019, with a console known as the imagination-powered Robox:

>"" At Roblox, we’re continuously exploring new and innovative ways to bring our platform to millions of people across the world. Just as we’ve expanded onto phones, tablets, the Xbox One, and virtual reality, we believe that there’s an even greater potential just waiting to be unlocked. A new way to experience all your favorite Roblox games. A new way to connect with your friends. A new way to make your dreams a reality in stunning, 8K ultra-high definition graphics and at greater than 120 frames per second.  
>  
>Welcome to a new era of interactive entertainment. This is **Robox**.""

# Conclusion

There was a lot of ground to cover here so let's briefly review. Gaming is arguably the best form of media in the attention-economy where Roblox identifies itself at the intersection of education and digital media development.

A significant portion of the education sector is focused on STEAM pedagogy which aligned with and supported by Roblox goals long-term. Roblox is able to leverage cloud computing to disrupt traditional models in gaming, education, financial technology, and imagination markets.

Since the announcement there's been radio silence. Despite this, Discord was recently in the news again for banning NSFW servers from IOS. This could mean two things; A, Discord is scared of Apple taking notice and being banned from the appstore as a result of the ongoing lawsuit (Apple v Epic Games); B, Microsoft's top dogs are combing through every negative aspect that needs fixing before acquisition. I believe the ladder as Discord is definitely looking to get money ASAP but hasn't announced anything. In my opinion it'd be worth while to buy MSFT. It'd also might be worth while to hold on to the stock a bit longer while Microsoft would move Discord's server hosting to MS Azure hence strengthening their own platform. Take this with a grain of salt though as I'm in high-school and haven't invested in stocks."

If you're thinking of buying shares or calls, don't. If you hold shares or calls, sell them. If you want to make a bet, buy puts.**

It's July 2000. You've made a decent amount of tendies over the past few years investing in hot tech companies. The markets are down a fair bit from their March highs, but that just means there are more buying opportunities. Maybe you can find the next Microsoft.

You find a stock that looks promising -- Plug Power. It's down 50% from its 52-week high, but you're sure it's gonna be huge. Green energy is the future. It's got the largest company in the world, General Electric, as an investor. [Bob Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli), the head of GE Power Systems and a contender to succeed Jack Welch, is on the board of directors. And their joint venture with GE just announced a deal to sell 1500 fuel cells to a Saudi Arabian trading company controlled by the royal family. If even the oil kingdom is moving to the hydrogen economy, you want to be a part of it. You're buying.

Over the next few years, you will lose more than 95% of your investment.

What happened? Well, there is public documentation on some of this: the Saudi trading company sued Plug and the GE subsidiary that co-owned the joint venture in 2008 for breach of contract and misrepresentation. You can find a summary of the complaint [here](https://casetext.com/case/soroof-trading-development-company-ltd-plaintiff-v-ge-microgen-inc-and-plug-power-inc-defendants), but I'm working from a copy of their First Amended Complaint.

The complaint alleges that GE and Plug ""understood by February 1999 that [Plug's fuel cells] would never be marketable"" but formed the joint venture (GE Fuel Cell Systems, which I'll call either GEFCS or just ""the JV"" for short) anyway to try and recoup costs. Soroof (the name of the Saudi trading company, but I'll call them ""the guys who financed 9/11"" for long) further alleges that GEFCS was just an empty shell with ""nominal assets consisting of a small amount of furniture, a telephone switch and a computer server"" and an office subleased from Plug. And GEFCS duly extracted $1 million from the guys who financed 9/11 in exchange for exclusive rights to distribute the fuel cells in Saudi Arabia.

Somewhat incredibly, the complaint alleges that Plug and GE then proceeded to jerk around the guys who financed 9/11 for *five years*, telling Soroof over and over again that they were improving the product and it wasn't quite ready yet but it would be soon. Finally, ""In 2005, Soroof expressed its dissatisfaction with [GE and Plug's] complete lack of performance to date"", which you might recognize as the same thing your wife did right before she introduced you to Chad. The JV had effectively been dead for years (or so Soroof claims), but GE and Plug knew to expect a lawsuit, and hurriedly wound up the operation, with PLUG indemnifying GE against the first $1 million in claims arising from GEFCS. Plug [filed an 8-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000119312506063079/d8k.htm) notifying the markets of the termination of the JV, but they didn't tell the Saudis. And when the Saudis found out in early 2007, they completely lost their shit, and they sure did sue. (As best as I can tell the lawsuit ended up dissolving in a flurry of procedural arguments. I'm not a lawyer and I don't care.)

So if this complaint was filed by the guys who financed 9/11, why should you believe them? Well, there are other signs that the higher-ups at GE knew pretty quickly that Plug's fuel cells weren't going to be commercially viable. GE had agreed to buy fuel cells from Plug in early 1999 -- but they [couldn't meet specifications](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB957739751789506989) and cancelled the entire contract in spring 2000. Bob Nardelli was [off the board by mid-July 2000](https://eepower.com/news/john-g-rice-assumes-position-on-plug-powers-board-of-directors/), and it's telling that neither his [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobnardelli/) nor [his successor's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-rice-30b651118/?originalSubdomain=hk) nor the [president of the JV](https://biography.omicsonline.org/france/technip/barry-glickman-36852) makes reference to their involvement with Plug or GEFCS. And this also sounds like the MO of General Electric circa 2000, which was, in hindsight, [a bag of shit trading at 50 times earnings](https://philo.substack.com/p/success-theater) propped up by expansion into questionable businesses like long-term care insurance and a whole bunch of accounting gimmicks. That stock is also down more than 80% from its October 2000 high, although at least you got paid a dividend for your trouble.

But the biggest reason GE should have known early that Plug's fuel cells wouldn't be marketable is basic physics. To get green hydrogen, you need to consume electricity to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen (losing some along the way). Then you need to consume more energy to compress and transport the hydrogen. Then you turn it back into water, electricity and waste heat in a fuel cell. It's much cheaper and more efficient to transmit the energy directly over high-voltage power lines! For some applications -- like the forklifts that Plug promotes today -- there is a last-mile problem to solve, but as I'm sure you've heard, battery technology today is very good, and it's just more economical to use battery power. (I'll have more to say about both the physics and the forklifts in follow-on posts.)

Through the fiscal years 2001-6, Plug Power produced a cumulative loss of $16 million on $67 million of revenue *before any operating expenses*. Their net loss was much worse. By early 2007, the stock was trading at about where it is today on a split-adjusted basis, and if you bought in July 2000 you were down 95%. It got cut by another 90% before it rallied last year. And today looks a lot like July of 2000: Plug is [partnering with big oil companies](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fossil-fuel-mainstay-baker-hughes-joins-plug-power-in-green-hydrogen-fund-11617629145) and [taking sovereign investment money](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921001786/tm211407d2_8k.htm). More worryingly, it's delinquent filing its 10-K for 2020 and is [restating its accounts](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-to-restate-financial-statements-stock-plunges-11615930211) for the last two years, and it posted a [negative gross profit in Q3 2020](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837020013381/plug-20200930x10q.htm).

I started this project due to the **lack of options data available to the everyday ape**. While some broker platforms have pretty great tools for retail level investment, they are not clear or easy to use. 3-5 times per day, I've been scraping the entire options chain for most of the meme stocks and high volume tickers. I've been collecting data for about a month now. 

I wanted to share some data with my fellow apes that I think presents good information in a clear and easy to understand way. Recently, there has been reports of a drop in option activity from retail investors. It would be a shame if this degeneracy didn't continue, so I'm sharing some data which I think is interesting and helpful to the ape community.

I've noticed a lot of **newcomers that are scared of options** (probably due to massive losses/gains posted by smooth-brained brotheren). However, once you understand the risks you're taking, options can be a powerful tool for both adding or reducing risk on your degenerate bets. You can continue to make degenerate bets if you like, but at least grasp what you're doing. 

For this post, I'm going to assume *some* working knowledge of what options are, but here is link with a more basic explanation I wrote earlier: 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1ahd5/visualization\_of\_all\_open\_option\_contracts\_on\_gme/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1ahd5/visualization_of_all_open_option_contracts_on_gme/)

# Comparing MSFT to GME

My presumption here is that Microsoft is a stable stock where the option data trends are representative of the current state of the equity options market (or is at least is similar to other stable stocks. *Note,* *I dug through a bunch of tickers and this seemed like a reasonable assertion*).

**An important note on greeks:** Looking at options in terms of the greeks is necessary to quantify how much they will change in value, especially if you're going to basket multiple options together or make complex trades. However, it seems like these statistical models may not always apply in highly volatile situations like GME. 

If you're reading this and think the greeks are people from a country that makes dank meat dishes with yogurt based sauce, worry not because this information doesn't require you to really understand them. I am plotting purely in terms of absolutes. That is, **1.) How much does the option contract cost, 2.) How many people are buying it, 3.) How volatile is it?** 

**How do the price of GME options compare to MSFT?**

[Absolute prices for the entire option chain of GME and MSFT. Options price behaviour is non-linear, making it difficult to trade based on tables\/numbers alone.  This was from last week, but data is collected daily. ](https://preview.redd.it/ipbfo81pjer61.png?width=11250&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb896e446c085da7b5ede7ca88160da4d62d7d5e)

The main take-away here is how much of a range there is with GME option prices that are out of the money. The other is how expensive GME options are. 

For sake of just gaining an understanding of how options are priced, please understand that almost all option prices for most any stock will follow roughly the same trends and curves as above. This may not help us trade, but it will help you understand **why yolo'ing your savings on weeklies is a dumb idea.**  

**No one is buying GME Options!!**

If you look at exactly how many contracts are out there, you will see that pretty much no one is buying GME. However, it does look like people are successfully selling way out of the money puts (probably purchased by apes on here). 

&#x200B;

[Option open interest indicates nobody is buying GME options. This is likely due to their exorbitant cost and massive associated risk.](https://preview.redd.it/q3466ujtner61.png?width=12054&format=png&auto=webp&s=69c8590800ad6f0652cb7452173625f2e541448c)

Notice how MSFT has a much more even distribution of puts and calls. People are betting both sides, and option strikes being bought are much closer to the stock price. 

**Implied volatility and why/how thetagang makes money**

Implied volatility or IV is a often not precisely defined quantitatively. It can be calculated using different options pricing models using an iterative method. However, for purposes of this writeup, you may think of **IV and demand interchangeably.** If an option has high IV, there is often corresponding demand. 

What is interesting is that IV is really high for options really close to expiry, even with Microsoft (i.e a stable stock). This would indicate that these options near expiry ***should be cheaper,*** but they're not. **There is a demand for (weeklies, FDs, yolo's whatever you want to call them)**. This would indicate that people are **buying these options to protest against sudden downswings** (historically this is the reason). **More recently, retail apes are treating weeklies like a casino**, which has likely compounded to even higher IV. 

This phenomenon of high IV at extreme strikes seen for the upcoming expiry is known as the volatility smile. It was actually first notice after the crash in 1987, since people suddenly became terrified of flash crashed and began protecting themselves with cheap, way out of the money options. 

Thetagang will sell these high IV options on a week-to-week bases to collect a small profit with a large amount of leverage (if not covered). It's also how selling covered calls can make you money. You risk getting burned if the stock price moves against you, but the higher the IV, the more upside there is to selling that option. You just go bankrupt of if you don't have the cash or stock to cover in the event things don't move your way. 

Implied volatility for both MSFT and GME show a volatility smile. Note GME is heavily skewed toward the out of the money side on puts, and the in the money side of calls.

Notice how GME is heavily skewed toward the out of the money side on puts, and the in the money side of calls. In my opinion, this is due to the market makers probably trying to gouge retail and/or setting prices high to deter retail from purchasing GME options that they would need to hedge. The massive spread supports this opinion.

# Conclusion

GME options are expensive and some people appear to have made a tidy profit by selling way out of the money puts. This didn't require the long winded explanation given here to figure out, but I hope to have made some wrinkles in some ape brains.

Use the information above, and please try to understand that options prices change non-linearly and is the reason why they feel like a lottery. Use the information above to more safely trade options (i.e. buy further out in time, expect the value of your option to drop in said time, buy closer to the money).

***Most importantly, this is not investment advice. None of this is guaranteed to be accurate. Please do your own research and make your own decisions.***

Positions: 100 shares of VXX and 100 shares of SQQ, getting absolutely hosed on both. Too stubborn to stop now.

DD:

----

- The 5.5% TSLA equity short interest of 44m shares [1] is only part of the ""true"", effective TSLA short interest: there's 2.6 million put option contracts open right now [2], a significant part of which are in the money, which, on a ~20% rally due to record Q1 results, combined with 2.6 million open calls, have the delta hedging effect equivalent to another ~100m shares short covered ...
- The pro-forma float of TSLA is 771m shares [2] - but at least ~130m of that is locked up by S&P 500 index funds, ~90m by options market makers for current delta hedging requirements: 220m shares or 28% of the float is already locked up today - effective float is 551m shares or lower.
- Due to TSLA's +1,000% rally in 2020 options market makers are net long TSLA by tens of millions of shares - so the delta hedging effect of put contracts doesn't show up in the regular short interest as it normally does for other names. Much of the effective short interest is ""hidden"" by this temporary artifact.
- So if we plug these numbers in: with TSLA starting at $661 if we have a major rally due to the Q1 results (TSLA already up +7% today) then we have 44m shares equity short and market makers lock up another ~100m shares during the rally just to delta-hedge the millions of puts and millions of calls.
- The delta hedging by market makers is anti-dilutive, just like short covering: it removes shares from the effective float. Anti-dilutive buy-to-cover is much stronger buying pressure than the typical trader-to-trader buying, because it contracts the float. 
- So should most Tesla shorts want to cover (not all: some are price insensitive hedges), they have to compete with the delta hedging of market makers (and regular bullish buyers): there's a combined buying of 144m shares on a 20% move, against an effective float of 551m shares. **That's an effective short interest of 26%.**
- A short interest of 26% for a low-float megacap like TSLA is excessively high compared to other megacaps: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and GOOG short interest is all below 1%, and their options open interests are an order of magnitude smaller than that of TSLA. [4]  [5]


I.e. the Tesla shorting that drive the price down from the $900 ATH to the current $661 is an ***excessively*** overcrowded short trade, with over $30b value at risk - which they'd want to cover much faster than any GME short position.

So a significant TSLA ""synthetic short squeeze"" is possible IMO, driven in part by excessive short options bets.

Should after the record quarter TSLA rally beyond $900 price levels to new ATHs, then all bets are off.

The response I received was amazing and lot of you were asking for weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/tkhtpy8hq6r61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=cde4524f9c0f45d083d6370cce81e462640a965c

GameStop continues to be the top discussed stock with more than 27K mentions. AMC dropped from 2nd to 4th position. PLTR gained in mentions and was the second most discussed stock last week due to a long-term deal they won with the U.S Department of Energy which is potentially worth 89 million dollars. ViacomCBS also made it into the top 10 but not in a good way. The company has lost 50% of valuation in the last 2 weeks and the sentiment reflects that. Rest all the companies are regulars in the top 10 list!

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/brep8x8qq6r61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=47be46b91c1230ab01f618066a0344277613d285

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.

**ViacomCBS($VIAC)** was the company with the most growth in mentions. But, the average sentiment across the mentions was negative given the 50% drop in valuation. The stock had crossed the $100 mark on 22nd March 2021 and has lost more than 50% of its value since then. The market had been over-enthusiastic about the stock since the beginning of 2021 due to its effort of transforming to a streaming giant from a traditional cable media company. However, this enthusiasm was short-lived. There might be some scope for a short-term rebound.

**ASO** was also growing in mentions due to their stellar earnings report. The company reported

* Revenues were US$5.7b, approximately in line with what analysts expected.
* (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$3.79, an impressive 41% ahead of estimates.

**Humanigen(HGEN)** reported phase 3 results of Lenzilumab™ stating it improves survival without the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The stock jumped 100% on Monday and has stabilized at around 34% increase from last week. 

**MicroVision(MVIS)** stock soared 50% on Wednesday. This is mainly due to Microsoft receiving a U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets. (It's estimated to be worth $21.9B over the next 10 years). There has been a lot of rumors stating Microsoft is planning to buy MicroVision which predominantly drove the discussions on MVIS.

**FUBO** stock price has been on a continuous decline for the last 2 months (more than 50% drop) and there is now increasing chatter on whether it is oversold or on the path to a rebound 

**SOME FAQ’s:**

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyze financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments

Disclaimer: I am not a financial or investment advisor.

Disclaimer: This is a monster stock.

Note: I have attempted to pull together the business case and investment thesis and summary of recent compelling events based on the work of many in the MicroVision community r/MVIS, including u/S2upid and u/BigBlackWifey to name a few, with the intent of spreading the word about this great company with massive potential.

Many of you may have first heard about MicroVision due to the recent news of the $21.9B US Army contract awarded to Microsoft for over 120,000 IVAS/HoloLens 2 headsets over the next 10 years. This contract is only for the US Army, imagine once the other US Military branches decide they need IVAS as well...

This is significant for MicroVision because their tech is in these headsets. We know this because the now legendary Hololens 2 tear down by u/S2upid:[S2upid Hololens 2 Teardown](https://tinyurl.com/S2upidHololens2Teardown)

This is why MVIS spiked 50% following the news.

Full article: [Microsoft Wins US Army Contract](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html) 

This deal will surely lead to an significant increase in MicroVision’s AR vertical revenue, however, the military contract is just the tip of the iceberg...

The big PR that everyone has been waiting for has yet to drop... MicroVision has best-in-class 4D LiDAR with technical specs and price per unit meeting or exceeding OEM autonomous driving requirements.
The company has announced at the last EC that the LiDAR A-Sample will be complete in April 21, and all signs point to a buyout already being negotiated with Google for the Auto Lidar vertical and possibly Microsoft for the AR divisions... there could be a bidding war soon unless a deal has already been inked. 

This video by u/thestocksocks does a great job of breaking down the value and potential of MVIS technology and IP:

Let’s connect some dots...

Summary of the recent compelling events:

Note: Some of the below DD based on summary from u/t-jameson-corazon 

Feb, 2020 - CEO Sumit Sharma takes the reins. Sumit used to be Director of Google Glass. 

June, 2020 - Dr Mark Spitzer joins the BoD. Spitzer has ties to Google.  Dr Spitzer is the leading AR expert in the world and came out of retirement to be a part of MicroVision’s journey.

Q3 2020 - Ford announced a stake in Velodyne (VLDR), a competitor in automotive LiDAR.

Dec, 2020 - Judy Curran (Ford) joins the Microvision BoD.

Judy Curran previously held executive positions at Ford Motor Co. She has more than 30 years of experience in vehicle program, engineering, and technology leadership. Judy Curran is very pragmatic and would not join the board of a failing company. Curran currently serves as Head of Global Automotive Strategy at ANSYS, a developer of multiphysics engineering simulation software. ANSYS could conduct testing for interested parties to have benchmark data.

Ford and Google have a strategic partnership.

2/1/21 - State of Michigan has purchased 1 Million shares of MVIS (not $1 million worth of MVIS, 1 Million SHARES).

Ford is based in Michigan.

2/5/21 - Blackrock buys 2.4 million SHARES.

Mid-Feb 21 - Ford sold its position in VLDR.

Feb 16th 21, MVIS announces a $50M ATM offering agreement with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. This ATM gave MicroVision the Net Working Capital (NWC) needed to facilitate a Merger and Acquision. This was filed with the SEC in a way that allows MVIS to pay fees based on the current share price and not disclose the future share price (Sign of incoming buyout - This is BAFF (Bullish as Fucking Fuck).

March 2nd, 21’ - BoD Bernee D. L. Strom steps down to make room for the newest board member, Seval Oz. (Sign #8)

Seval Oz, the newest BoD, is a recognized global business and marketing leader in mobility, autonomous vehicle technology and intelligent transportation systems. 

Oz was a Founder and CEO of Aurima, Inc, a multi-sensor awareness platform powered by AI deep learning for autonomous vehicles. She was previously CEO of Continental Intelligent Transportation Systems, a division of Continental AG Interiors Division. She has served as Head of Global Strategic Partnerships for Google[x]'s Self Driving Cars Program (Waymo) where she supported global business and marketing efforts for Google’s self-driving technology commercial launch. In addition, she is an executive board advisor to automotive industry leaders and an investment advisor to several investment funds and holds 10 patents in vehicular technology software.  

Seval Oz - “I am thrilled to join the MicroVision board of directors at this opportune time. I am excited to bring my expertise and experience in autonomous vehicle technology and mobility to the Company as it develops its automotive LiDAR technology and explores strategic alternatives.”

Seval Oz has been on the board for the last month and has not filed a Form 4 with the SEC yet. Seval Oz would not just join the board of a failing company, and she certainly would not join the board without compensation. The only logical reason for her not filing a Form 3 or 4 with the SEC already is if she is being compensated by the acquiring company (Google). This is BAFF.

Sumit has repeatedly stated he is interested in exploring strategic alternatives including the sale of a vertical or multiple verticals. 

Direct quotes from the earnings call on March 11 with [transcript](https://tinyurl.com/ECTranscript):

“The ability to deliver a high performing long range Lidar sensor that is designed to meet or exceed current OEM requirements.”

“The scalability of our sensor to meet future price targets.”

“I believe that adding these new expertise and insight to our current board, to augment existing expertise in business, including expertise in mergers and acquisition, strengthens our ability to create value for our shareholders.”

“We’ve pioneered scalable solutions that we believe are far ahead of global competitors.”

“The impact and value of what we’ve achieved was hard to measure (insert SS chuckle) since there were no competitive solutions for these verticals.”

“Our automotive Lidar product addresses an emerging market segment that has the potential to impact millions of lives, in mobility and safety, with potentially billions of dollars in sensor and sales for OEM’s, and multi national technology companies over coming decades.”

“With such capabilities, in our first potential product, we believe a future product could then include a Lidar, and a camera module, combined in a single sensor.”

“As I mentioned in our call last October, regarding our A sample timing, we expect the hardware for demonstration, along with select benchmark data from our development platform, will be available to interested parties, in our April timeframe, followed by complete benchmarking and testing. I also expect that a version of our solid state long range Lidar sensor could be available for sale, in small quantities, in Q3 or Q4 this year.”

“Our solid state long range Lidar sensor could enable any interested parties to perform testing, with our sensor, on their platforms, such as cars, and long haul trucks.”

“We expect to establish a pilot line with appropriate capacity to demonstrate scalability as we have done over the last decade for multi technology national partners. Let me be specific on this. Our capabilities include delivering maps, control plans, supply chain partnerships, automation, and product integrity qualification, for high yield design, that can ramp.”

“In conclusion, we remain committed to exploring strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the company, in part or whole, to maximize value for our shareholders.”

“I am profoundly optimistic.”

“During the year ending Dec 21st 2020 we applied a total of 2 million dollars against the prepayment.”

“We anticipate the financial statements that we will be releasing shortly, will no longer have a going concern opinion.” (have since been released)

“On our April 2017 customer, we are expecting that royalties in 2021 will increase over 2020, and we’re rooting for that product to do well.” (note April 2017 customer is Microsoft, $22 Billion US Army IVAS contract awarded last week)

“We are a stand alone company right now, but we’re up for sale.”

“I’m always optimistic about the company. A year ago, where we were, people asked, what do you think, you know (insert SS chuckle) MicroVision, you know, even back then, I think it’s worth billions.”

“I’m trying to draw the bigger picture of how important it is to actually solve these problems in these segments.”

“I want to be very crystal about what we’re working on, and our commitment to strategic alternatives.”

“If you solve a key problem, and your extremely valuable, of course I’m optimistic about the company. Hugely optimistic about what it can enable.”

“The demonstration would be for potential customers or other interested parties. It’s not a public demonstration per se, but for folks that were in conversation with.”

“This is a fight for the future. The last time I remember feeling this kind of excitement was what we call the internet age in the late 90’s, mid 90’s, where we knew that there was a big revolution that would impact everyone’s life, so I’m excited. All of us are.”

“This is benchmarking data that is provided for interested parties.”

“Everybody’s thirst for data, will be done, who is working with us under NDA.”

“...we need to give confidence to customers, people, you know, perhaps in a strategic transaction.”

“Save millions of lives, and make billions of dollars over decades.”

“The process continues, but we will not be commenting on any specifics.”

More dots...
No fireside chat after Q4 2020 earnings call (They typically have had these but it seems they are trying to say as little as possible, a sign of a buyout being negotiated).

Short Squeeze coming...
There is significant short interest against MVIS, in fact several short firms have been very vocal about being short on MVIS. Based purely on the P/E ratio, it would seem that shorting would be a good strategy, however, MVIS value is not in the current earnings, it is in the IP of the LiDAR and AR tech, and upcoming buyout.

Look at the short interest, borrowed shares and float. The shorts are all-in and there is about to be a massive short squeeze...

Tesla crashing causing increase in liability and eyes pushing for regulation.

Samuel Kang, head of total solutions North America for BYD says last week, “we believe in mvis” and comments after, “they have better tech then Luminar.”

MVIS is considered a Mid-Cap stock since its market cap is over $2B. This has let to a further increase in institutional ownership.

Russell indices reconstitution coming up in May. Today MVIS isn't in any Russell indices since it was below the min $1/share cutoff last year. This year, MVIS should land in several.

Competitors:
(Detailed competitive analysis located in Deep Dive link below)

AEVA 
The new kid on the block, AEVA recently went public via SPAC. Founded by ex-Apple guys, so they have generated some buzz snd have a current market cap of $2.6B. AEVA also has 4D LiDAR, their tech is based on a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) system that integrates onto a chip. Our key advantage over AEVA is timing and speed to market. AEVA has announced they will not be ready for production until late 2023/early 2024. MVIS has comparable if not superior technical specs and has a 3 year head start on AEVA... 3 years...

Luminar (LAZR) 
LiDAR is currently valued at $8B, they were $10B prior to the tech correction, and MVIS LiDAR is superior in terms is specs, size, and scalability (See the Deep Dive link for detailed competitor analysis). 

Velodyne (VLDR)
Inferior 3D LiDAR, does not track velocity (4D), inferior resolution specs. Ford had a significant stake in Velodyne and sold it shortly after Judy Curran joined the board of MVIS.

Price Target:

If we use Luminar’s (LAZR) valuation as a benchmark, we can estimate the fair market value of MVIS auto LiDAR vertical being at least equivalent to LAZR at $8-10B ($51-$63.50/share). I personally think MVIS LiDAR should garner more since it is superior to LAZR, so I am estimating $63.5-100/share for the Auto LiDAR vertical. More conservatively, we can assume that the Auto LiDAR vertical should be worth at least as much as the LAZR valuation of $8B (~$50/share), and I would expect MVIS should be worth more given our LiDAR is superior to LAZR. That is not even mentioning the value of the Consumer LiDAR and AR verticals. While we don’t know how much these are worth, we know the AR verticals just got much more valuable with the $22B contract. MVIS has a portfolio of over 460 patents. My price target for the entire company is at least $150/share.

MicroVision regarding their LiDAR:
“We expect our 1st generation LRL Sensor to have a range of at least 250 meters and the highest resolution at range of any LiDAR with 340 vertical lines up to 250 meters, 568 vertical lines up to 120 meters, and 944 vertical lines up to 60 meters. This equates to 520 points per square degree.”

mhiefm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mhiefm/ntla_poised_for_growth_at_a_crisp_pace/,$NTLA - poised for growth at a CRISP pace,40,33,2021-04-01 07:22:29,"**Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA)** is an advanced biotechnology company developing medical treatments with the use of **CRISPR**. 

**Unsmooth your brain - background on CRISPR:**

Now, what the fuck is a CRISPR and why am I bothering to explain it?  CRISPR is literally one of the most important inventions of all time. I'm not exaggerating. 

Your ape body is made of trillions of little fuckers called cells. You have all kinds of cells inside you -  skin cells, blood cells, bone cells, etc. Some of us here even have brain cells. But inside all those cells, there's something called DNA. You've heard that mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell. Well DNA is the CEO of the cell. It makes pretty much all the decisions, and is also the instruction manual/blueprint for how to make every part of the cell.

Now, imagine we can take the DNA instructions to make the chemical that makes a bug glow in the dark, and stick it in a banana. Think how much money we would make selling glow in the dark bananas to apes looking for a midnight snack.

That's what CRISPR is. **It lets you take DNA from pretty much anything and stick it pretty much anywhere inside another piece of DNA.** 

**Why NTLA?**

Making glow in the dark bananas is cool, but what if we used this to, idk, help people? Couldn't we just inject some magic DNA into people and cure their diseases?

Yup. And NTLA are the first ones to do it.

Late last year, the first human had the DNA in every cell in their body altered using CRISPR technology. 

This experimental ""drug"", NTLA2001, is for a rare genetic disorder that can be very painful and dangerous. **Until now, medications have only been able to treat the symptoms. NTLA2001 (theoretically) cures the disease, permanently.**

**Why now?**

On Tuesday, the **EU declared NTLA2001 an orphan drug**. Orphan drugs are medical treatments that are deemed important enough to have around even though the disease they treat is rare. **Important enough to have around that the government subsidize the research and production for that orphan drug.**

So not only do we have a world's first whole-body CRISPR therapy - which alone is enough to make the likes of Cathie Wood sploosh - but it just got bankrolled by the entire goddamn European Union.

**Strategy**

This is a long-term HODL move. But what a long-term HODL move it is. Imagine you're buying AAPL/MSFT in the 80s or AMZN/TSLA in the 00s. **This is not the only CRISPR company, but of the Big Three (NTLA, CRSP, and EDIT) it's got the most momentum**, making it suitable for shorter term plays as well.

**TL;DR - WRINKLY BRAIN GENIUS APES AT INTELLIA ($NTLA) GET BANKROLLED BY EUROPE TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING FIRST OF NEW CLASS OF WORLD-CHANGING MEDICINES.** 

**E: best immediate move would be to pick up long calls and/or LEAPS. I would want to see it dip to the 65-70 range to buy shares**

Vonage is a communications company offering voice, messaging, video and data capabilities across unified communications, contact centers and API’s.    The company was started in 1998 with a focus in VoIP,  and IPO’d in 2006.     

Currently, VG is in the process of transforming from the legacy consumer communications business to a CPaaS (Communication Platform as a Service) company. 
 
Prior to 2020 CPaaS sector was growing as companies focused on digital transformation and omni-channel customer engagement.   The pandemic further accelerated this trend with the need for enterprise communication tools to manage remote work. 
 
VG is not best of breed in its industry and does not have any unique functionality that leads me to believe it will substantially eat into the market share of the industry leaders.  However, the CPaaS total addressable market is growing rapidly so there is room for VG to grow, nonetheless.  
 
Avg daily volume 3.68m on 249 million shares outstanding with 97% owned by institutions.
 
*Competitors:*
Ticker/Market Cap/FY20 Rev/FY20 Grwth/ P/S

TWLO / 65b / 1.76b / 55% / 31.2

RNG   / 31b / 1.1b    / 31%./ 26.1

BAND / 3.2b /343m / 49% /  9.1

VG     /3.1b /1.25b.  / 6%  /   2.4

*I only picked standalone competitors but it is worth noting Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and other big players have offerings or are working on offerings in this space.
 
*The case for VG:*
As you can see above, the headline growth number for VG is ugly compared to other CPaaS players and the valuation on a P/S basis reflects that fact.   VG revenue compares favorably to Ring Central but has just one tenth the market cap at present.   Simply put, VG is not valued as a growth CPaaS company at present, but when you break down the earnings report, I believe there is a case to be made that it should.  VG has two main segments the legacy consumer segment and the VCP (communications platform). 
 
Legacy consumer segment revenues were 333 million for FY20, a decrease of 14% yoy and is expected to continue decline over the next few years.   VG thoroughly investigated selling this segment but has opted against it.  This business is profitable, and the cash generation will help to fund continued investment into their new offerings.  Nonetheless, the decline in this segment is a drag on earnings.
 
Looking at the VCP segment is a different picture altogether.   FY2020 for VCP revenues were 856m, a 19% increase.  Further, the VCP API segment, the highest value segment grew at 33% and is expected to grow 34-36% in 1Q21.   Overall VCP segment revenue grew to 76% of total revenue from 70% prior year.   The CPaaS business is clearly becoming the dominant business within VG and is much healthier than the headline numbers would indicate.   Additionally, VG has been working on operational efficiencies to reduce expenses while investing in their new offerings.  
 
I believe VG is due to be revalued as a CPaaS company,  with a higher P/S multiple than it currently has.   VG management agrees, and this quarter they have started to report earnings in a way that highlights the strength of the VCP business.  Management also noted they will be focusing on driving Rule of 40 metrics (revenue growth + margin &amp;gt; 40) which is a common measure for SaaS companies.
 
FY21 VCP segment revenues are projected at just over 1b alone and total VG revenues expected 1.32b.   Discounting the entire legacy business, a P/s of 5 on 2021 VCP revenues alone would be a 40% increase from current prices. 
 
8Risk:*
The primary risk is execution risk as VG builds out its newer business.  Margins are currently below industry SaaS and CPaaS leaders and management needs to continue to manage expenses while growing the business. 

Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan are both neutral and of the opinion that this story may take multiple quarters to play out but are encouraged by the plan.     Avg Price target is $15.36 by 15 analysts (6 strong buy, 4 buy, 5 hold).
 
This is a space with tons of new competition and missteps could result in a lagging position that is difficult to rebound from.
 
*My Plan:*
As this is a turnaround / transformation play, I do not expect out/under performance without VG specific news or earnings reports.   8/20 13c $1.45 would allow me to capture 2 earnings reports to see confirmation or rejection of my thesis with minimal risk.  
 
Let me know what you all think!

TLDR: Vonage is a CPaaS company priced like a more like traditional telecom due to its declining legacy business.  This will change as their transformation continues to progress.

Current analysis is that BlackBerry is starting to rise in value ""on the street."" And NOT just WallStreetBets... Here's some of the more interesting reasons why I think BB is sorely undervalued...

First let's take a look quickly at what BlackBerry IS NOT...

&#x200B;

\* They are not a cat! (sorry DFV)

\* They are NOT a ""phone company.""

\* They are NOT, however, totally ""out of the phone business."" As early as June 2018, BB had made some interesting BlackBerry Key 2 phones for the international markets, and the Evolve and Evolve X had been licensed for the market in India by Optiemus Infracom.

&#x200B;

This last point is MOST interesting. Here's why...

&#x200B;

Though BB had sold most of their phone patents to Huawei, their licensee Optiemus Infracom (founded in 1993, I might add) seems to be a VERY strong player in the Indian market. Though the phone systems have seemingly been abandoned, or sold, by BlackBerry, there's ONE bit of VERY important news that isn't getting through:

""As of 2019, BlackBerry Limited stated that only technical support will be offered for the Indonesian devices built by the company. Additionally, the operational status of Optiemus is unknown as of September 2020, as there have not been updates posted from them in regards to BlackBerry in India since 2018.""

This last bit of information is MOST interesting! Did BB decide to intentionally hide this bit of info from the rest of the investing world? Did they think that their PR machine needed to NOT mention this fact to investors and shareholders? COULD BB at some point surprise the market with a new brand of phone?

&#x200B;

Okay, so India... It's a country on the ""other side of the world,"" why should we care?

&#x200B;

It is the second-most populous country, the seventh-largest country by land area, and the most populous democracy in the world. Cool geographic facts, but HOW BIG IS THIS MARKET? With a fifth of the world's population, it's current population is 1,389,308,662 as of March 10, 2021... Not much to really explain at length here...

Though BB DID ""officially"" declare as of September 28, 2016, it would cease designing its own phones in favor of licensing to partners. TCL Communication became the global licensee of the brand, under the name ""BlackBerry Mobile.""

&#x200B;

Now, what does this have to do with the ""validity"" of BB? This last bit of interesting info makes for a rather brow-raising piece of info:

A few weeks prior to the expiration of TCL Corporation's global license expiration for the BlackBerry brand, it was announced that Texas start-up OnwardMobility has acquired a license to make 5G devices for the brand beginning in 2021. Unlike for the partnership with TCL, OnwardMobility will be making the devices for the enterprise market, with manufacturing partner FIH Mobile.

Looks like BB is still involved in the overseas market. You can see just how far this company has reached!!

&#x200B;

Enough about the phones and speculation for the future of another BB phone, let's talk about the more recent events (besides WSB ""liking the stock"") for a minute...

BlackBerry has been in the healthcare market for some time...

In December 2014, BlackBerry and NantHealth, a healthcare-focused data provider, launched a secure cancer genome browser, giving doctors the ability to access patients' genetic data on the BlackBerry Passport smartphone!

Sheesh, I didn't know that!

Here's something interesting from the company's own website that caught my eye:

""38,000+ patents

18 major development centers in 7 countries

I wonder how many patents were sold off to Huawei.

&#x200B;

NINETY...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

You gotta be %$%&# kidding me?!?!? Out of 30 THOUSAND patents, only 90 were sold?!??

I'll let you ponder that point for a minute...

&#x200B;

So, we all know about BB's involvement in other countries, but what about here at home?

But wait, what about those other 30 something thousand patents, what are those?

Well, according to a Reuters article from January 12th of this year, those are:

""which include cybersecurity and building computer operating systems for cars.""

CARS... So BlackBerry COULD find itself on the cutting edge of EV and Self driving car technology!

&#x200B;

Now, I would be amiss if I didn't address ALL sides of this statement, and this is the BIG one for me, though not a total failure. Read on...

Articles from 2014 and 2016 point to Ford Motors using BlackBerry's QNX operating system in the new version of its Sync in-car communication and entertainment system, instead of Microsoft Corp.’s (MSFT) Windows, which it uses currently. One might wonder WHY the Microsoft system was steadily being abandoned by Ford...

Ha ha! Windows jokes abound I'm sure in this one, but quite simply put, the shift is being induced by numerous reported malfunctions in Ford’s current technology systems and touch screens.

So what happened this year? Ford decided to go with Android for it's future in car technologies. It's a Route One financial observer (affiliated with Cnet) noted, with automakers continuing to follow in Ford's footsteps, most notable with Volvo and it's cousin division Polestar.

Two things make this not TOTALLY bad news for BB, though this bit definitely affected BB price shares through most of the month of February (the news broke Feb 1st):

One, Ford didn't entirely detail what will make the partnership ""unique"" for drivers, but what will come to its cars in two years will be transformative.

Two, and most importantly, BB isn't TOTALLY out of the equation for Ford cars, since ""the Android software will also provide access to third-party developers who want a shot at creating apps specifically for the car. The automaker thinks it'll be what drivers increasingly want in the future: more customization and personalization in the car.""

So in a nutshell, BB COULD, theoretically, come up with apps designed to run off of the Android software that's going to be in these cars. It's funny how vague and murky the press release from Ford was without giving specifics to exactly HOW transformative this will be...

READ BETWEEN THE LINES....

&#x200B;

Finally, a few other noteworthy items this year to pay attention to...

As of June 2020, ""its QNX software is now embedded in more than 175 million cars on the road today."" That's a LOT of cars that will still be on the road for some time to come. In fact, if those are NEWER cars, those systems will probably still receive maintenance and updates/upgrades. (As opposed to, say, cars from 2000 - 2010.)

What sorts of cars are these systems in? That same article references... ""Automakers and Tier 1s use BlackBerry® QNX® software in their advanced driver assistance, digital instrument clusters, connectivity modules, handsfree, and infotainment systems that appear in car brands, including Audi, BMW, Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, KIA, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Toyota, and Volkswagen.""

&#x200B;

Shit, we haven't talked about cyber security or software!!! Cars, cars, cars! Yes, EV and self driving cars ARE THE FUTURE, even if it is still 2, 5 or 10 years down the road...

One thing I've noticed; once companies get government contracts, unless they royally screw it up, they're usually around for good, and stock prices seem to reflect that. With the newest Microsoft cyber security threat, you can be damn sure that Cyber security companies will get their ""day in the sun."" This March 9th article is MOST compelling, and a reason why BB is setting itself up for the future...

""BlackBerry Limited today announced new technology advancements to BlackBerry AtHoc that will improve how U.S. Federal agencies communicate and collaborate during times of crisis, and reduce the risk of unauthorized access to Federal data, systems and applications.""

This is freakin' HUGE... ""BlackBerry AtHoc is trusted by government, military, commercial and humanitarian organizations around the world including over 70% of U.S. Federal Government employees."" This comes from BB's own website, and you gotta like the numbers... :)

&#x200B;

March brought a number of other announcements as well, which makes me think the prices of BB, though rising at this particular point in time, aren't rising high enough. From the March 8th article stating ""BlackBerry Limited announced that it has teamed up with Desay S.V. Automotive to launch a dual-screen virtual smart cabin domain controller to enable safer driving. Leveraging the QNX Hypervisor and the QNX Real-time Operating System (RTOS), the new technology is now available in leading Chinese automaker Chery’s Tiggo 8 Plus and Jetour X90 models.""

to the March 15th article about introducing Next-Gen critical event management for the commercial sector, it appears readily obvious that BlackBerry isn't resting on it's laurels.

Add to that third quarter fiscal 2021 total Company non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, a high standard of measuring companies' financials here in the U.S.) revenue of $224 million, $757 million of cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments at November 30, 2020, AND having 19th consecutive quarter of positive non-GAAP operating income, and you see a company that has effective money management.

&#x200B;

However, all that being said, BlackBerry currently has a Return On Equity of 21.22 percent, which is somewhat high in the index, but when compared to companies like Microsoft (42.7%), Google (19%) and Amazon (27.44%), sounds like it should be even MORE of a bargain. Let me say, though that I'm not 100% sold on using ROE as a sole indicator of a stock's value...

All in all I love the stock and believe in this company's future... Thanks for sitting with me through my first ever attempt at providing due diligence on a company... It was rather fun to dive into this company's history and outlook for the future.

I’m sick and tired of hearing the narrative passed around:

 “Hurr durr Nokia Float too big- Nokia never move”

Here are some fun facts as of writing this post:

1) Regardless of how “large the float is”, Nokia’s market cap right now is ~24 billion and is trading at $4.30/share. 

2) Guess what hot company everyone has loved FOMOing into for the last 3 months? GME. Do you retards want to know what the market cap is for GME right now? ~25 billion while trading at $250/share. 

Quite literally the only thing required for Nokia to move at the same rate as GME is for buyers to buy ~58 shares of Nokia for every one share you’d have bought of GME. You’d have spent literally the same amount on your investment with either choice. 

Not only that, but as you’d have more shares amassed in quantity, when Nokia’s value is recognized and it booms, you’ll be able to make even MORE cash by selling covered calls against your shares. 

If you wanted even more leverage, because I know you retards do, you could buy LEAPs now, and sell calls against them either now or in the future after the leaps have appreciated massively in value. 

And, make no mistake, Nokia is set to boom. They just announced major deals today with the biggest tech companies in the world- Amazon, Microsoft, Google. That’s not even mentioning the non-stop contracts they’ve won globally the last few months- major contracts. The investing community is ignoring this diamond in the rough, but those that get in now on the ground floor are the ones that are going to see significant returns. 

Do your own DD. Make your own decisions. But...

For fucks sake, inform yourselves on what it takes to move a companies shares price. All Nokia needs is buying volume and a willingness for investors to recognize the value staring them in the face. 

I recommend both shares and LEAPs as the plays here. 

I’m holding 250 1/21/22 10c

 I know there have been a lot of posts about NOK recently across several different subreddits, but I recently did some due diligence on the the stock and wanted to share my findings.

I originally had a lot of links in this, but it led to the post getting auto-removed. Let me know if you would like any sources.

# History of Nokia

If you've seen any of the recent Nokia posts over the last few months, a common comment you will see is: ""Nokia?!? That stock has been trading sideways for years!""

While yes that is true, it is important to understand why. Let's take a look.

**2000-2013**

Nokia dominated the mobile phone market during this time due to a quality handset. NOK traded in the $50s during the Dotcom bubble and in $30s before the housing crash. However, they never recovered after 2008 due to struggling to keep up in software as the mobile phone market started to shift to smart phones.

**2013-2019**

When Nokia realized that trying to stay in the phone space was a losing battle they sold their phone division to Microsoft in 2013. For the next 3 years, Nokia was a large company in disarray.

This did not get much better in 2016 when they acquired Alcatel-Lucent and decided to focus on networks. The merger did not go as smoothly as planned and over the next 5 years Nokia started ""trading sideways"" due to a bearish sentiment.

Some investors stuck around through all of this due to a dividend being paid out, but that was suspended in 2019 so Nokia could focus on developing its 5G mobile networks. This dropped the share price down to $3.50.

**2020-Present**

In March 2020, sentiment started to change somewhat bullish as they announced Pekka Lundmark would be taking over as CEO. Pekka worked for Nokia for a decade in the 90s and most notably served as Fortum's, a Finnish state-owned energy company, CEO from 2015 to 2020.

The bullish sentiment was shorted lived due to the pandemic crash dropping the share price to $2.42. It started to pick back up over the summer when it was announced that Pekka would take over a month earlier than planned.

This was followed by rumors that there was a chance Nokia could win Verizon's $6 billion 5G deal. Hype around this brought Nokia's price above $5 for the first time since they suspended their dividend in October 2019. But in September, it was announced that Samsung won the Verizon deal and NOK fell down to $3.78. It fell even further to $3.37 in October when the rest of the market saw a down swing.

Then it climbed back up to the low $4s, had a crazy January hitting $9.79 for about 10 seconds during to the meme stock frenzy, and has since returned to the high $3s low $4s after the Q4 earnings call.

**Q4 Earnings Call**

So what exactly did happen during that earnings call on 2/4/21? Why did it hurt NOK's price?

A lot of people blame Pekka messing up the call with some pessimistic word choices, most notably the word ""challenging."" Why would he say this?

It may just be his straight forward personality. It might have been an intentional sandbag so he can control future expectations. It may because Nokia prides itself on being on ethical company. I think it was probably due to a little bit of all of the above. Pekka using this language was not surprising. He said the exact same thing during the 2020 Q3 earnings call.

So the rumors that Nokia may blow it out of the water during their Q4 earnings were unwarranted. Nokia did beat their expected earnings, but because of a decrease in year over year revenue, people overreacted (just like they did when Samsung won the Verizon deal) and sold their Nokia positions.

**Pekka's Tenure**

Pekka has been in charge for 7 months during a global pandemic, but he has been able to make some progress it appears. Much of this information can be found in the Nokia 2020 Annual Report.

* He trimmed their employee size by 11,000.
* He improved their free cash flow to $2.6 billion.
* Even with the decrease in revenue he nearly doubled their operating profit (page 82).
* He drastically reduced their net deferred tax balance (page 175).
* He created four distinct business groups with plans for these groups to be shared in more detail during during Capital Markets Day on 3/18.
* He replaced Nokia's CFO, CTO, and CMO (CFO happened before he took over)
* It appears he issued new shares to leadership.
* Pekka has a stake in the company (page 67 of annual report) with a long term goal to ""Focus on increase in share price and restoration of the dividend"".
   * "" In addition, Mr. Lundmark received an award of EUR 1.3 million of restricted shares on joining to buy out the awards he forfeited on leaving his previous employer. Mr. Lundmark was invited to join the co-investment based long-term incentive arrangement (eLTI) targeted to engage senior leaders with the long-term nature of our business and share price, and purchased EUR 2.6 million of Nokia shares against which he was given a matching award of EUR 5.2 million of Nokia 2020 performance shares. This investment by Mr. Lundmark aligns him with shareholders from the start and is a sign of his commitment and engagement with the company. Delivery of actual Nokia shares would take place in 2023 subject to performance conditions""

# Bullish

Here is a list of 28 deals and partnerships Nokia has established since December 2020. Some of these deals are not massive, but they span across 6 continents.

**Largescale Network**

* 5 year Multi Billion Dollar T Mobile Deal
* 7 year Belgium deal
* Deutsche Telekom in Germany
* France's Mainland 5G Network
* 5G Network in Austria
* Telecom Italia
* Cibicom ISP in Denmark
* Polkomtel Phone Provider in Poland
* Telenor Group in Thailand
* Ooredoo in Algeria
* 5G Network in Philippines
* Tele2 in Sweden, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia
* Ecuador
* Vodafone in Australia
* Saudi Arabia
* Singapore

**Private 5G Deals**

* San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Private Network
* Port of Seattle
* Japanese Companies Conexio, Hitachi Kokusai, Nippon Steel, Omron and Sharp:
* WEG Motor Manufacturer in Brazil
* Elisa in Finland
* Optus Stadium in Australia

**Partnerships**

* Google Cloud
* EU's Hexa-X 6G Project
* Brazil's Telecommunications R&amp;D Center
* AT&amp;T tests to deploy virtualized and open RAN
* Patents deal with Samsung
* LG Uplus trial in South Korea

**5G is the Future**

The confusing nature of 5G could be holding back the market's valuation of Nokia. 

* Nokia is currently trading at a market cap of $22-23 billion even with a 2020 revenue of $24 billion.
* A letter that Pekka recently published gives a decent explanation of what 5G is.
   * In it, he admits ""\[5G\] is exciting, but it can seem a bit abstract."" But then goes on to describe some real world examples that really helps explain it.
   * ""Our partners saw unanticipated breakdowns and production line defects drop by 30% after installing smart video sensors in our manufacturing deployments. In the logistics sector, deploying augmented reality devices cut machine monitoring costs by half. In ports, remote-controlled cranes doubled productivity and eliminated staff injuries: an incredible 100% drop.""
* This seems to suggest that there may be more uses for 5G worldwide than cellular networks.
* Nokia released a study stating that 5G could have an $8 trillion impact on global GDP by 2030.
* Nokia and Ericcson may have a duopoly on 5G with Huawei and ZTE being banned in many countries. This trend may continue.
* Some analysts have predicted massive (&gt;1,000%) growth in the 5G market over the next 5 years.

**Upcoming Events/Rumors**

* **Capital Markets Day (3/18/21)**
   * This is when we will get some true guidance on the future of the company. Not only will they lay out the strategic business plans for their 4 business segments as I mentioned above, but it should be when they make announcements toward potential a Dividend Reinstatement, Share Buyback, and future R&amp;D decisions.
* **Annual General Meeting (4/8/21)**
   * Not sure what they plan to cover during this, but I would assume it will act as a follow up to Capital Markets Day
* **Dividend Reinstatement**
   * Most signs point to Nokia investing in R&amp;D for a while, but based on Pekka's compensation package it should be back by 2023 at the latest.
* **Share Buyback**
   * Nokia did buy back 1.25 billion shares in 2015-16 and 1 billion shares in 2016-17. So the rumors they plan to do this again could be true. They can purchase up to a total of 550 million shares both this year and next year. 550 million because it correlates to 10% of the companies total outstanding shares.

# Bearish (Risks/Cons)

* The meme stock frenzy has a long-lasting impact on the opinion of this stock.
* The dividend is not reinstated for another 3+ years.
* Pekka does not have what it takes. Nokia is a sinking ship and cannot be turned around.
* FCF is used solely for R&amp;D and no shares are bought back over the next three years. The float does turn out to be too big to move significantly.
* Nokia may not be undervalued and their revenue streams may continue to decline due to network share loses and pricing erosion.
* Pekka has been very serious over the last two earning calls and things are going to get much worse/challenging before they get better.
* With a new US administration in place, the trend of banning Huawei and ZTE that they started is lifted. These two competitors then undercut Nokia pricing.
* 5G is no where near as big of an industry as the experts predict. Covid continues to slow the rollout of 5G well past 2030.
* 5G is too confusing and never gets the buy in from today's investors."

>In February 2000, with the Year 2000 problem no longer a worry, Alan Greenspan announced plans to aggressively raise interest rates, which led to significant stock market volatility as analysts disagreed as to whether or not technology companies would be affected by higher borrowing costs.

So the fed hasnt came out and raised rates but mortgage companies are already raising rates and the broader repo market refusal to buy bonds are a bad sign. Smart money isnt dumb enough to buy inflation is only at 2.9% and it is showing in equities and real estate. Many analysts/fund managers have came out and said they expect repo rates to spike as high as 3% by the end of the year.


On tope of this even though its not rate hikes, they just fucking rekt any corporations paying execs over 1M and made sure to put into the stimmy 60B worth of tax hikes removing deductions for large corporations and the CNBC/Bloomberg channels havent said a fucking word even though this is kind of significant.

I mean what the absolute fuck. The writing is seems to be on the wall. Like this is so eerily similar to what happened in 2000. 

Add into this the absolute fearlessness retail has regarding “Stonks go up bro” is scary. We are like deer in those neighborhoods where people havent gone hunting in decades and we are eating out of the predators hands. Last march was essentially a flash crash. This is the longest bull run in history.

m2h4zy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2h4zy/why_the_price_of_gme_shares_could_reach_anywhere/,Why the price of GME shares could reach anywhere from $12k to $28k,258,131,2021-03-11 11:49:58,"While reading through comments on WSB this week, I've seen a fair amount of skepticism regarding some popular price targets for GME. This post is an attempt to bring some context to some of these price targets. 

Consider the fact that, even if GameStop's market capitalization briefly reaches $2T, it still will not be the most valuable company in the world (that title will remain with Apple). **At a market cap of $2T, shares of GME will be worth $28,680.** At a share price of $10k, GameStop's market capitalization will be  \~$700B, less than those of companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple.

Now, from the perspective of fundamentals, it doesn't make sense to compare GameStop's market cap to those of the companies just mentioned. However, in the context of a short squeeze, it seems like a reasonable comparison, especially in light of any evidence supporting the possibility that GameStop will briefly become the most valuable company in the world. And that possibility is quite plausible. 

Remember that Volkswagen became the most valuable company in the world when the price of its shares spiked in the midst of a short squeeze in 2008. You might say, ""Well, maybe market caps were more uniformly distributed in 2008, so the bar for VW was lower."" Ok, fair point. But at the peak of the VW short squeeze, VW attained a market cap of \~$420B. According to The World Bank (see [https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD)), the total market cap of all listed domestic companies worldwide was $32.27T in 2008, and $68.65T in 2018. So at the peak of the VW short squeeze, VW accounted for roughly 0.42/32.27 = 1.3% of total market cap. In 2018, 1.3% of total market cap was $0.013\*68.65T = $893B. **At a market cap of $893B, GME shares will be worth $12,806.** And this is a conservative estimate, since the current total market cap is considerably larger than it was in 2018.

TL;DR: The price of GME shares could reach anywhere from $12k to $28k. Obligatory  🚀🚀🚀."

But either way, I'd like to bet that aside from knowing that ""hedge funds and shorters got too greedy and we're going to get them for it!"", **you don't really have any idea how the GME rocket started.**

So let me do the honours of giving you all a quick run-down on what is currently happening with GME.

# It all started when hedge funds and shorters shorted GME into oblivion.

With COVID-19 impacting the world the way it did, GameStop was set to become the next Blockbuster and go out of business for good.

Hedge funds, who love to make money off shorting companies into bankruptcy, saw this as a perfect opportunity to make some easy money by **shorting more shares of GameStop than there were actual GameStop shares.**

While some were able to figure this out before anyone else, pointing this out would have meant nothing if there was no reason for GME to go up...

# Then all of a sudden GME had reasons to go up.

People like Michael Burry and Keith ""Roaring Kitty"" Gill pointed out that the fundamentals for GME at the time (mid-2020) were not reflected accurately in GME's current price ($3-4 USD). What Michael Burry found out, in particular, was that not a single GameStop was in the red; they were all making profit to some degree.

After GME starting showing positive trends, people like Ryan Cohen and companies like Microsoft invested in the company as well. With these investors in the company, there was hope for GameStop to not go bankrupt and actually adapt with the rise of eCommerce.

Finally, to really help GME go along, Microsoft and Sony announced that their latest consoles (the XBOX One X and PS5) were still going to support physical disc copies of games. This further gave reason to believe that full-digital wasn't the future just yet, and that there was still hope and profit to be had in physical products/locations.

# And as GME started going up to most people's surprise, people started noticing how screwed shorters suddenly were...

But before we continue, I need to briefly explain what a *""short squeeze""* and *""gamma squeeze""* is. **If you already know, you can skip below.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**A ""short squeeze"" is when lots of people ""short"" shares, yet the price of the stock they shorted continues to go up, and eventually they're forced to cover their positions.**

**This allows those with shares to sell the shares back to them at ridiculously high prices because, well, they have to buy them back.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**A ""gamma squeeze"" happens when many people make lots of  ""call"" options with market makers for prices that are very high to reach (ex. a $100 call for a stock worth $10).**

**They do this in hopes that not only will the stock attain that set price or higher, but more importantly that the market makers don't actually have the shares to give to them if/when the call options can be exercised.**

**If this high volume of ""call"" options does get exercised, and market makers don't have the shares for them, that means that they'll be forced to buy the shares. Those with shares can then make them buy these required shares at much higher prices.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# SKIP POINT

**People online began to communicate with one another about GME, and pointed out that is was going up despite what shorters wanted to happen.**

# It was then that they theorized that with all the shares being shorted, and with the stock continuing to go up, that they could buy lots of GME shares and create many highly priced call options to create a short squeeze as well as numerous gamma squeezes.

# But they weren't going to accomplish this alone...

**Other big players on Wall Street also saw what GME was capable of, and provided the high volume required to send GME to the moon. And they provided the high volume indeed...**

# And thus began the GME Gamma Squeeze of January 2021

What was once a $3-4/share company destined for bankruptcy suddenly sky-rocketed to a max of $480+ essentially overnight, and shorters and bears suddenly found themselves in billions worth of losses.

# But we all know that big guys don't play nice.

Before more call options could be filled and the price of GME could go up any further, numerous brokers halted buying GME all together. This gave plenty of time for numerous ""call"" options to become worthless, and for shorters to regroup and recover their losses.

After all, the DTCC gives a 21 day grace period for investors in huge debt to cover their positions, so these shorters were going to do everything they could within these 21 days to get the price of GME back down. This way, they could not only minimize their losses, but even get back into the green and continue to bankrupt GameStop.

In less than a month, GME plummeted to $40/share, and all seemed lost. Hedge funds would win once again, and retail traders were given a grim reminder that they don't play by the same rules as the big players...

# Yet this is not how GME ends.

Just a few weeks ago, more hope was given that GME would rocket once again.

Keith ""Roaring Kitty"" Gill proved that not only did he still hold all his original shares in GME, he also doubled down on his position right after he announced that he would still buy GME during a Congress Hearing.

During the same Congress Hearing, Melvin Capital (a hedge fund that lost 53% of its value because of the GME Gamma Squeeze) admitted that there was no short squeeze, and that the rise of GME to $400+ was a result of a gamma squeeze.

**In other words, a ""short squeeze"" hasn't happened yet.**

People found that shorts theoretically didn't all cover as shorters continued to be greedy and likely held on to their shorts as they thought they could still bankrupt GME like they originally planned.

They found that while short interest was seemingly much lower that there were still very few GME shares left to short and that shorters were still losing millions every time GME spiked to new level highs.

Not only that, but that shorters likely continued to short as GME went down during the gamma squeeze; putting them in an even bigger short position than the last.

Ryan Cohen made it official that he would be heading GameStop's eCommerce division (because of course he is)...

There were meme tweets of ice cream, frogs, and 1980-90's games/movies...

People began exercising call options once more, and now...

# The GME rocket rises once again...

# TL;DR: Shorters and Market Makers are currently in desperate positions where they need A LOT of shares of GME to cover their shorts and fulfill their ""call"" options, and retail investors (but most importantly big players) are buying and holding all the shares they can to make GME the Big Squeeze of the 21st Century.

# NONE OF THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE, AND PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES. I JUST LIKE THE STOCK.

Feel free to disagree, agree or critique. WSB seems mostly bullish on AMD but we don't need an echo chamber!

Bullish:
- Zen has been a hit and the road map into Zen 4 looks to keep kicking Intel while it's down.
- Recent offerings from the Radeon group have been increasingly more competitive, even rivaling Nvidia's core business on a fraction of Nvidia's R+D budget.
- Zen 3 continues to show excellence in incorporating Chiplet technology. Chiplet technology allows for greater yields at the foundary, product flexibility and lower costs.
- This experience should transfer to Chiplet GPU technology - allowing for the Radeon group to perhaps take a measurable lead on Nvidia for a generation or two while they catch up.
- Epyc Milan looks dynamite and AMD will be able to gain market share in the computer server market. Recent hires in this area will help AMD gain more adoption.
- New chiplet CNDA data center GPU's on the horizon.
- New software stack incoming to compete with Nvidia's DLSS. This upscaling is rumored to provide a 2x performance boost and will be integrated into each games engine. Adoption by game companies is almost guaranteed since both consoles use and are set up to use the same technology.
- Business world views Lisa Su and AMD as ""execution machines"" - Moore's Law is Dead video. Product roadmaps and goals have consistently met and goals beaten expectations.
- Extensive business relationships with Microsoft and Sony.
- Mass OEM adoption seems to be happening in both Laptop and Desktop market.
- Xilinx merger adds massive revenue and capabilities.
- Because Lisa Su.

Bearish:
- Capacity issues at TSMC have restricted profits at times.
- They are competing with 2 monster companies in Intel and Nvidia in their core business areas.
- Semiconductor stocks are volatile by nature.
- Post Pandemic conditions might reduce profit margins.

That being said I'm confident the Bullish thesis is much more powerful than the Bearish one.

Please feel free to reply with any other bullish or bearish arguments. The more we can discuss the better informed everyone is.

Obligatory 💎 👐 🚀

And I really do like the stock."

I am no expert in cybersecurity but I can ""Google"" well. Here are at least a few things you should consider doing **right now**:

1. Change your online brokerage password to something easy to remember but difficult to crack. Remember to mix up the characters in your password, like ! for I and 3 for an E for example. Or you can use Google Chrome's suggested passwords. But remember those passwords will be leaked if your Google account is hacked. So ensure you change your Google password as well. Look here for more information --> [https://www.howtogeek.com/195430/how-to-create-a-strong-password-and-remember-it/](https://www.howtogeek.com/195430/how-to-create-a-strong-password-and-remember-it/)
2. Enable Two-Factor-Authentication (2FA) not only for your online brokerage account but also for the email account that is connected to your brokerage account. Remember, a hacker who has access to your email account can easily reset your online brokerage password. You can opt for receiving a text for your one-time authentication code or use an app like Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator. Here is a link for a blog post by RH --> [https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/best-practices/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/best-practices/)
3. Beware of phishing scams. Do not click on any link sent to your email. If you get an email asking you to input your username and password to ""verify it"", it is most likely a phishing attempt by someone trying to obtain your password.
4. Never login to your email account or online brokerage account from a public computer or even from a family or friends computer. You never know if their computers are compromised.
5. Always update the antivirus and firewalls on your computers to the latest version. I check my antivirus and Windows firewall for available updates every Sunday.
6. Never answer emails asking for your detailed information that could be used to steal your identity. Never provide your full SSN number on the phone or in e-mails or input it in online forms.
7. **MOST IMPORTANTLY -** protect your phone since it will have RH or other online brokerage app running and logged in. Change your login pin/password and remove alternate fingerprint or face ID logins of pets/husbands/wives/boyfriends/girlfriends/neighbor, etc. If your phone is lost or stolen, immediately wipe all data remotely and block your number.

For more information, refer to the SEC guide here --> [https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsonlinebrokeragehtm.html](https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsonlinebrokeragehtm.html)

**Edit-1**: adding good comments from u/SportTheFoole to the post -->  consider getting a password manager. I use LastPass at home and 1password at work. Both have the ability to generate secure passwords. I honestly have no idea what password I have for almost all of my logins. Most importantly: DO NOT REUSE YOUR PASSWORDS. Every site gets a different password so that if one is compromised, the damage is limited.

I would also say make sure your email account is secure (long, hard to guess password, 2FA). IMO, the most important account you have is your email account, because once that’s compromised an attacker can do a lot of damage (like click “forgot password” and have a new one emailed)."

I saw a few posting buying puts pre-earnings, some positive talk but overall little hype except about the lockup end happening on 3/6. So far SNOW is victim of its success with cautious bullishness from analysts, preventing  the market from pushing the stock up like ZM... maybe its growth is a bit more predictable.  


* Quarter results are in, good as expected:  
Q4'20:  
revenue $190M (+117% YoY, beats $178.5M consensus)  
losses -70c/share (vs $-1.67 a year ago, but consensus was an optimistic -17c/share)

revenue of $195\~$200M (+92% YoY)  
2021 guidance:  
revenue of $1B\~1.02B (+82% YoY) - is that really too bearish?

Analysts are cautiously optimistic, because the valuation is high but the prospects also very high so it's hard to put a price tag, just like buying a house when the market's hot:  
[https://www.thestreet.com/investing/snowflake-gets-cautious-support-from-analysts](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/snowflake-gets-cautious-support-from-analysts)  
At $71B market cap/$250 share, and a nearly 2X growth prospect, that's 70X 2021 earnings 35X 2022, 20X 2023... Maybe we can assume growth slows around 5B to 10B aka 10% of TAM.

&#x200B;

* Does the employee lock up really matter ?

Lockup ends this week. The vast majority of the shares are held by VCs, the CEO & founders, etc. the hands of a very few. Those shares will likely never see the market, as they're controlling shares. Original B shares had also 10 voting rights, and needed to be converted to single voting right A shares to trade, but it looks like they're disolving this structure. Will these billionaires sell lots of shares? no. And if they do they'll have to disclose. Snowflake has few employees and they don't hold that many shares so would they really influence the market selling? Also would they sell at $250 lows? Is this deadline just FUD fuel?  


* I like the stock.

I'm personally very bullish on the company's future. I like its culture  and the product, I  trust the founders who've worked hand in hand with the angel investor VCs along the way, and I believe they're passionate about the company and product. IDK about the CEO who was brought in later - because of his track record. There's tons of ex Oracle employees working there who understand the business and the customers (it's a customer centric company).  
For me their product is this : it's a classic SQL OLAP database in the cloud that's elastic, with easy management, which has many plugins to do data mining and AI, and fine controls for sharing securely parts of tables (that's big for security inside a company AND for selling data). It is secure enough to be certified to hold medical (HIPAA) and banking data (CapitalOne!). It's also an ""ACID"" transactional database, and its SQL language superset is rich enough to facilitate migration from other vendors like Terradata, Redshift, Oracle, etc. That'll be key to migrate customers from legacy on-prem solutions to cloud.  
Unfortunately it is not an OLTP database so it can't tap customers sensitive to query latency. It's also likely not the fastest to store and manipulate text like logs, though it can handle large JSON and XML data fine, it shines in columnar data.  
Why it's hot I think is it bring old school SQL to the next century as a compatibility story, where other map-reduce cloud solutions failed to become ubiquitous because it was too hard to migrate.  
The big 3 (AMZ, GOOG, MSFT) provide similar offerings BUT AFAIK, they do so packaging old school on-prem databases into cloud servers, so it's a kludge to make it work and the customer ends up dealing with it when they try to use the scalable ""elastic"" part, aka hiring very skilled DBA engineers. There's a reason SNOW customers like the product, stick there and buy more. It's not just because it's cheaper, it's also easier.  
Databases are the foundations to build on top of, and all businesses need to buy strong foundations, SNOW is such an offering with a few years of lead time vs competition in terms of tech. I believe the addressable market (TAM) is like many 10's or 100's of billions estimated with a handful of big players. ""Big data"" and ""cloud"" have been buzz words since Y2K, but that revolution happening now.  
I have a feeling Snow was at the sweet spot: not too early that it needs to justify why you want to buy the product, and not too late to justify why to use them vs other established vendors. I feel it will be one of the mammoths. :)  


* Why I care?

I am overweight on those shares and I need to decide when to sell & diversify my savings. I still feel Snow might be the next CRM or ORCL growth story, but did it just start too hot? Will it go back to $420 within a few month? How good do the news have to be? I certainly don't feel I want to sell at $250, it feels I could be on a rocket's passenger seat waiting for liftoff and I don't want to miss that... At $350? Hmmm... maybe I'm willing to miss some of the liftoff, and diversify to protect myself if SNOW actually trips :P At $420? I definitely would diversify.  


* Palantir

IDK why there's way more hype on Palantir than snowflake on reddit, and why they're compared so much. Maybe it's PLTR's valuation? What's Palantir's addressable market and its competition? Palantir I feel is more of an end user product to do analytics with custom plumbing behind, but I don't really understand their business  value add and how it's different from say Looker or Tableau, and if Palantir's value add is relevant if the data is in a database format compatible with standard tools, which should be the case for most non-gov customers."

OTGLY/CDR",17,15,2021-03-04 19:11:27,"CD Projekt has lost about 50% from the top because of the terrible launch of Cyberpunk 2077 and a hack. But let’s look at what has actually happened. 

**You will find a TL DR at the bottom.**

 &nbsp;

**Sales of Cyberpunk 2077**

Sure the game was buggy as hell on release and Sony is yet to put it back on its stores (you can still buy the physical copy) but the PC + Xbox version sold well even after refunds and it’s still selling on Xbox store. Also if you look at the independent PC reviews (not count the outlets that always give AAA games 10/10) it was still very well received so if they manage to fix the console version we could very well see the sales pick up for consoles.

The facts are that 12 days after launch they had sold over 13m copies of which 10.8m (80% coming from PC sales) was estimated to be digital, which would make it the largest digital launch ever. This is a big deal because digital sales earn them a much higher margin, for example steam takes 20%(+50m$ sales) while physical stores take 40-50%. These numbers include the first 8 days of refunds which arguably would be the lion’s share of total refunds.

Currently on Steam its still #20 of bestselling games (removing free to play and special offers), if you only look at games costing +30€ then its #7, #5 for +40€, in fact it was the bestselling game for 7 weeks in a row on Steam and it’s still selling for full price. On GOG.com its currently #2 and still full price. On Epic Store its #6 and full price, in other words the game is still selling well on PC and still going for full price. So the sales have not been bad in any way, its possible that’s it could have been even better than good, of course it could have been fucking stellar record breaking shit had they not released a buggy mess but still not bad sales in any way.

So let’s run some simple numbers and lets be very conservative, lest say they only sold standard editions and no €250 collectors editions. Let’s also say that as of today with refunds they only sold 12m digital and 3m physical copies. For retail let’s say the revenue split was 50% and for digital 25% (Steam 20%, GOG 0%, Epic 12%, Xbox 30%, PS 30%). This gives us €690m in revenue and that’s more than all revenues from 2012-2019 combined and that’s just for 3 months of Cyberpunk sales. This gives us a PE of roughly 7 as a worst case scenario.

https://www.pcgamesn.com/cyberpunk-2077/steam-top-seller-player-count

 &nbsp;

**The hack**

Source code was stolen but that’s not a financial loss because a Witcher or Cyberpunk knockoff is not a substitute in any way. The hack has pushed back the second patch about 2 weeks so that’s 2 weeks of lost dev time, make that 2 months and its still not a big issue financially. Add another 4, 5 or 6 months of extra dev time for patches (due to buggy release) and we are still talking peanuts. Also remember it won’t be the full dev team working on patches, just a parts of the original team.

Lost trust and reputation loss has a minimal affect of future sales in this business. EA, Zenimax, UbiSoft, Activision to name a few have been shitting on gamers for a long time now with unfinished games riddled with micro transactions and gamers still come back every time for their fix. FOMO is too great.

 &nbsp;

**The hidden gem**

Now let’s look at what’s actually in front of us and that is something I believe many have missed. I’m sure most that follow the stock knows about the Witcher Netflix series and the Witcher mobile game, by them self’s they are alright but together they could be explosive.

The Witcher Netflix series was a fucking successes and the next season is almost done and will be released this year. The first season also boosted sales of the PC games. Its production is independent of the game studio so it won’t be affected by it. 

The Witcher mobile game being developed by a separate studio from the one working on PC/Console so once again not affected by Cyberpunk problems. The game is basically a Pokemon Go copy and it has been in open beta for 6 months. The reviews on app store are very good, 4.5 and version 0.9 was released a month ago. They released the beta on version 0.6 and they got to 0.9 in 5 months so I think the game is basically done and they are just waiting for the right timing to release it.

https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/the-witcher-monster-slayer/id1509704647

I believe their strategy is for a simultaneous launch or maybe a week or two apart, hoping that the series popularity will bring tons of players to the mobile game and mobile games like that make filthy amounts  money, it won’t make Pokemon Go money  but even a small amount of that would be filthy amounts. 

One could however look at another AR game connected to a popular franchise, namely Harry Potter and say that it wasn’t popular why should this one be? Well to start of that game missed its timing as it was released far after the franchises popularity peak. Secondly I would argue that a larger base of the Witcher fans are gamers compared to Harry Potter fans. Thirdly that game was aggressively monetized and CD Projekt are known to take it easy on monetization which is more profitable in the long run.

 &nbsp;

**M&A**

A third thing worth mentioning is the increasing amounts of M&A happening in this segment and CD Projekt is juicy target, it is almost the only large studio left that has not been acquired as a whole or in part by any of the large players, almost all other large studios have either been acquired or have large shareholder like for example Tencent. Possible buyers could be Amazon or Google, they have both been trying to get into the gaming industry and failed with their in-house efforts. Other buyers are any of the large Chinese players and even Sony after Microsoft bought Zenimax to protect Playstation from Xbox, but this one is a bit of a long shot now that Sony is a bit pissed of at CD Projekt.

 &nbsp;

**So whats the price target?** 

Well the top was not fair value but this bottom sure as hell is not. I feel based on the known revenue from Cyberpunk and the estimated sales based on bestseller ranking we can assume that it is bringing in good money and will continue to do so for the coming years also we must account for some delays for upcoming projects. But all in all I feel a drop of 20-30% would have been fair not the 50% we have seen. So yesterday it closed at 228 down from a top of roughly 450 and my target is somewhere between 300-350.

 &nbsp;

**TL DR**

Based on available data, sales are not a fail, more than all the revenue combined from 2012-2019 on very conservative estimates, it gives us a PE of roughly 7 for just 3 months worth of Cyberpunk sales.

The Hack has limited financial impact, a month of dev time.

Lost dev time for fixing Cyberpunk is also of limited financial impact even if its 9 months as it will not be the entire dev team for all that time.

The combination of Netflix The Witcher Season 2 and the mobile game The Wither Monster Hunt has the possibility to be a fat cash cow.

An increased chance as of late to be acquired in part or as a whole by large conglomerates.

Price target of 300-350, now trading at 230"

I imported SIMM (Single Inline Memory Modules), between 1994 and 2006, for my branded computers.

In that time period, I watched the ""chip"" market more than I did the precious metals market - they moved daily and prices for each type of module was set by noon, each day.

My companies imported tens of thousands of SIMMs from Singapore, Taiwan, China, Spain, and a few other countries. The paperwork required at customs, in Anchorage, was due to an ""Anti Dumping Tax"". This was to prevent North Korean manufactured chips to be imported (as it should be). At the time, Goldstar became a producer of IC (Integrated Circuitry), chips as it could not keep up with the television innovations. BUT... Goldstar was a SOUTH Korean company, with no embargo, yet monitored closely. Thy produced a great product, however, they were also counterfeited easier and therefore, ""a radioactive"" product.

>***Side Note:***

LG Semicon LLC, was a producer, specializing in IC chips. One company bought the other and both Goldstar and LG Semicon became what we now know as LG.

Back in those days tracking the manufacturing of chips was crucial (no pun intended), because of the daily swing of the prices. The determining factors (which I looked at), were :

* Production capacity of each factory.
* Daily production numbers of computers.
* Intel ($INTC), AMD, ($AMD), Microsoft ($MSFT), Compaq, HP ($HP - Hewlett Packard, at one time, ""absorbed"" Packard Bell Computers), and other mass consumers/assemblers of IC chips for PCBs (Printed Circuit Board), including details of motherboard designs and IC requirements.
* Mother Nature and her wrath ""overseas"".

The computer makers, DELL ($DELL), Gateway, and Compaq always had first choice of available chips, due to their deep pockets and demand.

A few companies in Asian countries figured out that by closing a factory, for a day or a week, they could, effectively, increase their profits quickly. This effected the entire ""Technology Sector"", although it did not exist yet.

>**Points:**

* Always ask ""Why"".
* ""Due Diligence"" is not just 2 levels deep. Sometimes you have to find out who is selling the sand/silica, first.
* In this market, ""What goes down, usually comes up"". Write that down.

Let's talk fundamentals, because fundamentals are what we should speak about and I am more of a fundamental player than a technical one. And fundamentally, Marc Benioff has kept to and maintained his 20% YoY revenue growth. The last three quarters, especially, have been gigantic in terms of earnings, as Salesforce has significantly beat Earnings due to the pandemic boost.

Furthermore, margin expansion also beat expectations. Furthermore, what that means is that when revenue growth inevitably dips below twenty percent sometime in the next few years, margin growth should keep earnings growth above 20 percent well in the future. Margin expansion should be helped by WFH after the pandemic, as Salesforce reduces workspace to accommodate (something it has mentioned it will be doing).

The acquisitions that Salesforce has made, while perhaps too generous, ensure that there is retention of top executives because they buy in. It also allows for upselling, and that's huge for us because like, like Microsoft, it can keep you within its ecosystem. As customer retention is above -90  percent-, this allows for sticky customers... And this will likely continue to grind higher.

Furthermore, Salesforce dominates the SFA space but only has 30 percent of the market in a highly fragmented and still growing space.

Salesforce's projected acquisition of Slack was a very large drag, and the general selloff of the tech sector has provided a huge downward push unto Salesforce. I think that critics have been proven wrong about Benioff's prior acquisitions, and that acquiring companies always suffer a short term drag to their stock before gaining upward momentum because of it. Slack's earnings are tomorrow, and should definitely beat last quarter's EPS which was positive. I expect that Slack will have an amazing quarter, much as other WFH companies have had, and that will prove to be a positive catalyst on Salesforce Stock.

Analysts have a consensus price target of 270.75. Morningstar has one at 265. The price right now is a touch under 206. That's huge upside, and a positive catalyst could cause an upward explosion in the stock. It doesn't even have to be micro, but macro, with passage of the stimulus bill which congress says it will pass mid march. Heck, even a  more micro focused easing of tension regarding interest rates would cause a significant upward momentum. Salesforce is oversold.

But when I tried to post an update, it kept getting automodded.

As an update: I took profits on my last play and am now re-allocating them. This is my 1st new play.

&#x200B;

$NOK got a LOT of love when the first $GME spike happened. It got so much love that it popped to nearly 10$/share before RH blocked trading.

Since then, volume's come down, attention has gone away from the stock, this has made options quite appealing.

IV's down significantly and calls are REALLY cheap.

My DD:

* They delivered SOLID Q4 and 2020 earnings, even though it was a tough year in general.
* The company owns the **most** pattents in the 5G space of all it's peers.
* Huauei is being blacklisted in most of the western world, there are only 2 players remaining in the space, Ericcson and Nokia.
* The company is sitting on nearly $8 billion in cash and generates over a billion a year in free cash flow.
* The stock is trading at only 1.5x book value
* They have been increasing the profit margins significantly for the last 3 years and are working towards improving them even more.
* Nokia has announced several solid deals over the past few weeks.

&#x200B;

* **The company is small enough that it could be an M&A target** 
   * The US Attorney General William Barr [said](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-william-p-barr-delivers-keynote-address-department-justices-china) the US -- either directly or through a consortium of private American and allied companies -- should purchase a controlling stake in either Nokia or Ericsson for access to secure 5G equipment. He said such a move could blunt the rise of China and Huawei in the space. 
   * AT&T / Tmobile / another carrier could buy them to lower their own costs of updating to 5/6G.
   * Intel and Microsoft are both focusing heavily on the space and Microsoft already bought part of Nokia in the past.

&#x200B;

* There's also the potential for them to reinstate their dividend payment policy.

&#x200B;

* Average analyst price target is 5.75$
* Over the last 10 years, it's been rangebound between 4 and 8$, it's pretty much at the bottom of the range.
* I'm confident it'll be back to 5 or 6$ by the summer, especially if they keep announcing these solid deals.

Positions: 20 000 shares and 100x 6$ calls sold against them for april 16th.

TLDR: Nokia's a great medium-long term play, IV's down significantly, shares and calls are cheap. This will probably bounce from 4$ back towards 6-8$ over the medium term, or be bought out as a strategic play, likely for over 6$.

I've been on this sub off and on for about 5 years. My first exposure was when people were hyping AMD, and by the time I finished my own DD, stock was up 30% and I decided not to buy. To clarify that was when the price was low single digits and I'd still have made 35x. I've been lurking for a while, MSFT 200 wasn't a winner, nor all those SPY puts. But GME is legit.  

I didn't get into GME in Jan, but I did buy in Feb. This stock isn't about intrinsic value, it's about the short squeeze. Every analyst has it as a short term buy, they see it happening too. 

I am notoriously paper handed, but I can't see myself selling anything below $420.69 a share here. We are going to hit it. I might have my expectations short of the moon, but it doesn't take a genius to see this stock as a buy and hold right now."

Let's get to the meaty part first.

Lesson #1 Fraud is the most bullish word on Wall street, but even better is Monopoly, and Antitrust. Which is why retail weak fingers are getting walked down. (Regulation is the most feared btw.) If it wasnt for Clover health pulling some strings behind the scenes I dont think they would exist. Clov was caught running a red light, so take the fine, and get back in your Tesla. If not for fraud they wouldn't last a year. United health, and Blue cross would've destroyed them right outta the gate.  Look at the most fraudulent companies in the world. They're sporting the highest market caps. Ask Tesla bear scrubs Einhorn, and Gordon Johnson about how Tesla is a fraud. Apple, Msft, Amzn,  seen fraud litigations. Bring in Vivek, and Chamath. Accused of fraud. Get the point? Fraud is bank as long as your the fraud.

Who cares about Last year? You've heard this right?

""**Past performance** is **no guarantee** of future **results**""

A. Grew membership by 36.3%

B. Increased revenue by 45.6%

C. Gross profit increased to 12.2% of revenue

This means absolutely nothing. Again. **""Past performance is never an indicator of Future results.""**

**4 F's  - Future Fun Facts & fundamentals. Speculative Statistics.**

A.  The number of Americans ages 65 and older will more than double over the  next 40 years, reaching 80 million in 2040. The number of adults ages  85 and older, the group most often needing help with basic personal  care, will nearly quadruple between 2000 and 2040.  👈  (Try search engine)

***More revenues from the budget.***

C. Medicare for all. 👈  (Try search engine)

***""Medicare for all"" would push our potential customer base to the moon. (Full Population)***

D.. Clover health's competitors have over a trillion dollars in market cap to swipe.

***Always good to have healthy competition. UNH, ANTM, HUM, CI, plus private ones like Aetna***

E,F,G Highly Speculative. It's a healthcare insurer that's only medicare, and not yet in the workplace.

***If Clover health enters the entire health insurance market whole different valuation is coming.***

&#x200B;

TLDR; For those that are patient. This could be a really great long term growth investment. Clover health currently has less than 1% of available participants in healthcare marketplace.

Aside from the celebrity status of certain board members I'm going to tuck this one under the mattress, set a recurring investment, and probably have fun losing everything if tit's go up.

Edit; Almost started crying today. So I bought some stocks at that emotional moment. My average on clov is now break even. I caught 6.55 and I didnt lose fingers this time. got august 12.5 calls for .90c too. "

$GM has some real potential to bring me some generational wealth. $500 PT. Yes, you heard that right. 

1.	GM is insanely undervalued, trading at only 12.5 P/E currently and $75bn market cap. GM is the largest automaker in the USA selling over 8,000,000 cars per year. In comparison, Tesla is trading at over 1,500 P/E and $750bn+ MC. Tesla only sells 500,000 cars a year. They make tons of money on their existing ICE lineup through popular brands like Chevy, GMC, Cadillac, Corvette and reinvesting it into Autonomous Vehicles, Electric Vehicles and Flying Vehicles. 

2.	GM currently has many government contracts and will continue to win more contracts. Government agencies use Chevy's SUVs and President Biden's limo is a modified Cadillac Limo. Biden has committed to turning the entire government fleet of 650,000+ vehicles (light trucks, SUVs, semi-trucks, etc...) into fully electric. and built in America, I expect an announcement soon and GM to be awarded some, if not a majority of the contract. Other startup EV companies simply do not have the scale to produce the government contract. Ford has EV production in Germany which is not made in America. Tesla recently purchased $1.5bn in cryptocurrency which the Treasury Secretary Yellen is against. I think $GM is the best bet to win a majority of the government's work.

3.	GM has committed to selling 30 new EV by 2025, selling ONLY EV by 2035, and being fully carbon neutral by 2040.

4.	GM owns Cruise Automation. Initially, bought the startup for only $1bn and most recent funding round of $2bn by Microsoft/ Honda has valued the startup at $30bn. Currently in the lead of Autonomous vehicle technology and continuing to grow massively in the technology hub of the world, SF Bay Area. This technology is being massively discounted.

5.	GM has Utium Battery technology and a $2.3bn factory in Lordstown, Ohio churning out their proprietary battery technology. 50-200kWh battery packs that will push the cost per Kwh under $100 (current cost for Tesla is over $230) in the next few years. These batteries will power the new Cadillac Lyriq and Hummer EV coming out later this year. The  cars are not weak, truly cutting edge! 

6.	Apple has rejected Hyundai, Kia, Tesla, Nissan in their bid to find a manufacturer for building an EV. $GM is still in the running and could be a nice surprise. They are cutting edge, mature with manufacturing capability, and made in America.

7.	Famous investors like Warren Buffett, Leon Cooperman, Joel Greenblatt all piling into $GM in the billions.

8.	President Joe Biden will likely renew the EV tax credit in his upcoming stimulus bills which will cut the price of $GMs EVs by $7,500 and spur sales significantly.

9.	Chip Shortage Fear will be over soon and is only temporary. $TSMC has is in the process of building a huge factory in Arizona which will keep chip manufacturing in the US. Biden will sign executive orders to ease this issue through defense production act.

10.	Newly released Chevy Bolt and Bolt EUV is the hands down most affordable and best value EV on the market today. Bolt starts at $31,995 - Bolt EUV starts at $33,995. Both more range than Tesla Model Y and EUV has $GM's version of Tesla Autopilot, SuperCruise already installed (versus Musk's $10,000 for this upgrade).

Megabullish on this to double or triple once the media/ mainstream investors discover what $GM can really do! Position below. Cheers guys.

Ford’s plan to invest in EVs and self-driving cars rose to $29 billion, including $22 billion for EVs through 2025. 

Ford and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL are entering a six-year deal that will make the tech giant responsible for much of Ford’s growing in-vehicle connectivity. This partnership is designed to streamline Ford’s operations and accelerate an ongoing $11 billion restructuring plan. 

General Motors:

General Motors announced that it plans to invest $27 billion in EV and autonomous vehicles through 2025. The company also mentioned that it plans to release 30 EV models globally by 2025.

The company has partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT in leading a $2 billion investment round in self-driving car startup Cruise LLC.

Difference:
Ford is going with Google and General Motors is going with Microsoft. 

Google has 14 Automotive startup investments and Acquisitions.

Microsoft only has investments in 4 automotive startups.

This will help Ford and General Motors in the following areas:

- Autonomous driving technology.
- Connected car tech & fleet management.
- Electric vehicle technology.
- Automotive retail.
- Mobility-as-a-service & shared mobility.

Who wins?
In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars.

I will keep buying Ford, because of the potential technology integration. Also I really like the stock.

lu46g7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lu46g7/jfrog_frog_dd_a_great_software_company_with_a_lot/,🐸🐸 JFrog $FROG DD - A great software company with a lot of room for growth. 🐸🐸,14,48,2021-02-28 11:20:57,"# 🐸 is getting ready to leap.

This is my first DD post so I would appreciate any feedback and criticism of assumptions I am making here. But I thing that JFrog is setup for a good run in the next few months and here is why.

# What do they do?

Their main product is JFrog Artifactory which is a universal repository for software binaries (runnable code) and it also serves as a mirror repository - local copies of Open Source Software. They also offer JFrog X-Ray that scans those Open Source libraries for malware/vulnerabilities). This is one of the most critical cogs in the software sausage factory, Artifactory is comparable to a walk in refrigerator, with the mirror repo it adds the loading dock, with X-Ray it also helps to ensure food safety.

**You may have heard of the Solarwinds attack and if you have been following it heard that it is described as a “supply chain vulnerability” attack. In my professional opinion, the toolset JFrog offers is the best available to combat this kind of threat and will stand to benefit from the need to increase cyber security.** That is why I am very much a Bullfrog 🐂🐸. If there is interest, I will do a deeper dive into this aspect at another time but for this initial one, this is the huge surge in demand for their capabilities and the need for going beyond the basics is my thesis why this company is positioned to do very, very well going forward.

# Company background

They were founded in 2008 and there main product has been Artifactory ever since. It has only 1 direct competitor with similar scope, Sonatype Nexus, but Artifactory is better and cheaper. Sonatype started as a plugin for Artifactory that does something similar to X-Ray before X-Ray existed, then they copycatted the Universal Repo, so JFrog hit back with X-Ray. I have used both of these products over the years (since 2013) and I have worked in environments without, Artifactory improves developer productivity a lot and it secures company Intellectual Property.

Their product is used by most of the Fortune 500 companies. This includes **Google, AWS, Microsoft, IBM, and Facebook. These companies trust this product to keep their crown jewels (the software that runs their entire companies) safe**. That should tell you something about how good it is. They have over 90% renewal rate of their customers.

They acquired Shippable in 2019 which basically lets them offer the whole sausage factory. Though the area where this competes is very competitive with some very good products that are Open Source.

Their focus lately has been on offering a SaaS model to complement their on prem offering and make adoption easier. This should also grow their revenue a lot because it will make it easier to buy the total package instead of just the most basic.

They went public in late 2020 but it was very low key since they came out the same day as Snowflake.

# Financials

I am including a couple of Comps here based on the segment they operate in. Atlassian (TEAM) makes Jira, Confluence, and Trello which are used by most software teams for managing requirements and agile software Team collaboration. I picked them as a comp because I view them as a developer productivity tool that you need around the same time you start needing Artifactory. Crowdstrike (CRWD) is another best in class cybersecurity company that comes into play as you are in operations protecting and detecting threats as your application is running.

* As a high growth software company, unsurprisingly their GAAP earnings are negative. Surprisingly to me though, they are very minor and they have even had 1 quarter of profitability.
   * FROG: -$0.1861
   * CRWD: -$0.4763
   * TEAM: -$4.9355
* Their market cap
   * FROG: $4.9 B
   * CRWD: $47.8 B
   * TEAM: $59.4 B
* Their forward P/E Ratio
   * FROG: 615
   * CRWD: 771
   * TEAM: 173
* They don’t have any long term debt
* Their current ratio (short term assets/short term debt) is 5.3
* Their margin is over 80%
* Revenue is growing 44% YOY

# Ownership

65% owned by insiders and institutions

Most of that ownership is insiders because there are only 5 ETFs (including an ARK Index Fund) that own it.

Their final lockup was just released on 2/16 after their earnings and insiders have through 3/13 to sell before they go back into lockup. This is similar to what happened with Palantir recently, but it seems like most of them have sold what they are going to sell.

# TL;DR

They have a great product and have cornered a growing market they invented which has high barriers to entry. They are well managed and have good financials as well.

# Positions

420 shares and 61 options, I am planning to get 8 more options on Monday. If you haven't guessed yet, I like the stock. You can check my post history to see some YOLO posts from earlier this week. I will post another update when I am fully loaded with 420/69 to ride this 🚀

My EOY price target is at least $100/share from the current price which is at $53.49 on Friday.

# Premise:

Equities are selling off due to rising [treasury yield.](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/textview.aspx?data=yield) The reason behind the rise of treasury yields are complex.

But let me try to explain nonetheless.

1. People are expecting that the economy will reopen successfully and will have a higher inflation and all that stuff. Now yields being that low, it was slowly getting unattractive as bonds are not necessarily the best investment if the economy goes into full gear as there is less need for safety and [more appetite  for risk assets](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-markets-idUSKBN29Q2NR). Plus, bonds were already at a price where yields  couldn’t have gone any lower(meaning existing bond prices couldn’t have gone any higher). Thus, this lower demand  lead to a rise in yields.
2. This created a feedback loop due to mortgage-backed bond investors selling off their treasury bonds which helped the treasury yield to go even higher. They do it due to convexity hedging. If you have no idea about what I said, [read this one up.](https://www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/convexity-hedging-haunts-markets-already-reeling-from-bond-rout) This has been one of the primary driver behind the recent movement of treasury yield. Overall, this elevated level in treasury yield is unlikely to sustain because the FED continues to abolish the free market and will continue to buy. Thus, the yield is unlikely to rise too much higher.
3. JPow and Yellen has already given us enough indications that they will accept lower rates for a longer period of time. Specifically, until we reach full employment. Thus, they will allow the economy to get hot and also allow inflation to rise if the mean inflation is 2%. These are based on their publicly stated statements, which means it may mean something.
4. Now, consider the scenario, real interest rate will remain negative, the yield in treasury is unlikely to reach too high because of the artificial market scenario. While, we know that ***long term bonds outperformed stocks tremendously*** over the [last 20 years(article data till April 29)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/business/bonds-beat-stocks-over-20-years.html) With long treasury bonds having an annualised return of 8%+, while S&P 500 having only 5.5%+; that was a terrible risk adjusted return for stocks. The same picture emerges for the last 5 years [since 2015(dataset ourdated).](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/long-dated-treasuries-crush-s-p-500-performance-over-five-years)
   1. This whole ordeal is because yield was very high at the beginning of the century. And as yield continued to fall, the bonds rose in price, as is customary. Now, as the yield slightly rises, it quickly becomes more attractive as the yields could fall pretty quickly and increase the bond price. This also attracts more bond investors; as a result, I suspect that yields will not rise too much. Plus, it is a very crowded trade.
   2. As a result of bond having this superb risk-adjusted return, stocks saw huge outflows. According to Cathie Wood, [stocks saw $300B in outflows(excluding repurchases)  since 2018 and bonds saw $1T in inflows.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-arent-in-a-bubble-but-heres-what-is-according-to-fund-manager-ark-invests-cathie-wood-11612958113) So, if there is actually any bubble, it is in the bond market. Think about it for a second. Sure, bonds provided absolutely superior risk-adjusted return compared to stocks, but because of this, everyone and their mother are in bonds. Stocks were like the orphan child in the bigger scheme of various financial markets.
      1. Now, bond yields are rising slightly and the yield curve is normalising, but going any higher is unlikely due to the slow abolishment of free market. In this scenario, we won't be seeing any negative rates, while continuing to experience negative real interest rate; being a bond investor would be painful. If you are a bond investor already, you want the yield to go lower, potentially negative, but that is not happening either. If yields rise, you are losing money. If you are a prospective bond investor, you have to worry if yields will go higher just after you invest with all the inflation shenanigans going on.
5. Liquidity is present in the market. Bonds aren't that attractive, stocks are a good bet in this scenario. Especially with all those stimulus talks and stuff. Inflation is also good for the stock market overall as long as we don't go Weimar republic style. After all, you are duddenly not going to stop buying from AMZN, stop using MSFT products or PLTR products just because inflation is here. Question is, which stocks? I think boomer stocks are your best friend(look for the things BRK buys). And after the whole convexity hedging and yield rising stabilises, buying the dip in the tech stocks wouldn't be a bad idea either(I think).
6. US Dollar has been declining after March. It is, overall, good for the stock market and the global economy in general. For one, it makes it easier for foreigners to buy US stocks and two, it boosts the earnings of our corporations in foreign markets. One could say, EM stocks are a potential good source for risk-adjusted return and I also think the same. Although, short USD have had been a popular, crowded and winning strategy for the last year, one should be careful in doing so as any black swan event could catapult the USD higher. However, in the long run, I suppose EM stocks would also be a good area to look out for. Especially, India seems to be the choice for our lawmakers currently.
7. Rising commodity prices and stuff are mostly due to speculation, and not specifically supply crunch. Some are saying that we will see very high inflation due to supply shortage, which would be bad for the market. But I disagree. We have so many structural deflationary forces within our economy. Stagnating wages, high unemployment, technological innovations, cheap labour based production in foreign countries, demographic challenges etc. Some supply crunch is definitely there, but to say that production won't normalise after demand rises due to reopening and stuff is being wilfully blind.
   1. Some of you may not know that CPI does include rents, healthcare expenditures and stuff based on how much they actually cost us, so, before you comment that the government is manipulating CPI to make inflation numbers low, I would suggest you to read how [and what are the weights of each consumption factors.](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/home.htm) Also, stimulus money hardly increases velocity of money because it doesn't really counter the loss of employment income.
8. Our government is doing a shit ton of deficit financing, from that we can expect they will do everything to stop deflation and inflate away the debts. It is in the best interest of our government to keep borrowing money at low cost and to inflate away the debt. Thus, our government has a huge incentive to keep the yield low, while also allowing inflation to rise. You may think, how can this be a free market if... basically, this is capitalism with USA characteristics. Add to that, direct or indirect beneficiaries of these shit ton of deficit financing is, well, the various companies.

# Conclusion

Using my crystal ball, which cost me $0 to buy, I can say this:

This is what I can say from all the points that I have mentioned. Risk assets like stocks are now more attractive than bonds. USD is accommodative for the stock market. Global economic recovery, especially in EM economies will be good, thus helping our companies. Deficit financing. Inflation will be good for ***most*** stocks. Liquidity is present. Bond yields will also stabilise soon as the feedback loop ultimately stops. No deflation. There is likely going to be real inflow into stocks. Stocks will probably finally outperform long term bonds.

Thus, I think, while we will have lower overall rate of return in this decade, I think we will continue to have a good bull market for a while. Current panic in the market is nonsensical to me.

^(Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and stuff. This is a casino. Don't listen to retards on the internet, please don't. I also have used my crystal ball to predict all those future outcomes.)

Risk of my predictions being completely off the mark.

* Fed decides to increase fed funds rate suddenly for overheating/other events and starts quantitative tightening.
* We do have a huge supply crunch in every sector after reopening and inflation goes to the moon. Yields also goes to the moon.
* Black swan events.
* Think of something yourself man! This was a long ass post and I am getting late for finishing my day's work."

ls3ktz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls3ktz/unity_for_the_crazy_or_for_the_tanks_game/,Unity - for the Crazy or for the Tanks? - Game Developer POV [$U],48,58,2021-02-25 18:26:22,"So, here I'll gonna bring **my worthless POV on Unity**, but first of all - a 1 minute background:

**Unity is a game engine, which is the most important infrastructure of game making** \- before game engines appeared, game developers had to calculate every stupid pixel on the screen by themselves, then a lot of wrappers appeared (OpenGL, etc) and after that the game engines. The **game engine allows the developer to connect the code, graphics, music, physics, and basically everything together.**

Most of the large companies develop and use their own game engines. But as far as I concern, the only public, known, large and practically adopted by developers are Unity and Unreal Engine (we'll back to that shortly).

&#x200B;

Let's get back to Unity:

As a game developer (also ML/DL, but who cares), I've used many frameworks and game engines for more than 15 years, hell, I even used ""dark basic"" when I was young, and I can say that **Unity is the only time I felt at home**.

Now **I know you don't give a shit about my experience, so let's talk business**.

**The GOOD stuff:**

Unity solves one of the major problems of native growth in game making and that's a FULLY CROSS PLATFORM ENGINE, that means that I can develop once, and **my stupid stuff would work PC, Android, iOS, Xbox, Playstation, Virtual Reality, Web..**. You got the idea...That work of being cross platform is INSANELY HARD, which means there is a huge leap to create a competing product. Even the best open source game engines have a very limited amount of devices they support, which means that as a developer an open source game engine might be a risk for me in terms of growth and future support.

TL;DR 1:  **Cross Platform**

Unity got a huge asset store, which is a crazy source of revenues from stupid developers like me, that means that even if I'm totally not profitable - Unity might have some revenue from me without investing a penny or a minute of support team.The huge asset store makes it very easy for new developers to do their first steps in the platform, and like Maya vs 3DSmax or Nikon vs Canon - the first one you've touched is gonna be the only one you'll know.

TL;DR 2: **Easy step in, huge asset store, revenues even from non-profitable games**

Next, the future. Game industry is growing and we all know it, but what Unity got that it would outperform the market? Glad you've asked, they got everything.Unity supports Machine Learning infrastructures which can be connected easily to many application - well that's too general right? So let me put it like that:3 years to the future, self driving cars are more and more popular and... regulated. When you regulate it you also have to test it - digitally. Unity is one of 2 (!) game engines that practically gonna be available for that task.Virtual Reality is also a trend - guess how most developers develop for it. Also it might enter the movie industry and stuff like that.

TL;DR 3: **Tons of ""room to grow"" - VR, Algorithms and algorithms testing**

As I've mentioned, Unity got only one real competitor - Epic - which got  Unreal Engine that does basically the same. Epic are not public but hopefully will, but currently Unity is just the only exposure to this kind of product. If I had to choose, I would just put my Happy Hippos on both.

TL;DR 4: **No publicly traded competitors**

Lastly, Unity can grow without a single phone call. There is no major difference for Unity to support 1K users or 1M (just like Google or Facebook) - if we compare it to companies like TTOW, Nintendo and even Xbox-Microsoft and Oculus (Facebook) - they all had to invest ton of money for content creation and physical platform making.

TL;DR 5: **Unity have to spend almost 0$ for each new user**

&#x200B;

**Now for the BAD stuff:**

Unity price was very high, how much high? At the pick Unity passed EA (!) in terms of market cap. That's high.

It's currently at 35% discount right now, and it still might considered high - but do notice it's around 50%-60% more than IPO day (PLTR fore example is already multiplied - I think they were out on the same day).

TL;DR 6: **High Price (whatever that means...)**

Another bad thing - Unity had relatively bad quarter - their revenue went up but they earnings were still negative... Why is that? Well... first of all they've **donated something like** 750,000 shares, which is like **80M$** \- that's exactly the margin they needed to publish a profitable quarter - you know what that means for the next one...

TL;DR 7: **Last quarter was good revenues but bad earnings - mostly due to stupid reasons**

As I've mentioned, large companies generally use their own game engines, that's a lot of money the currently Unity miss.

Lastly, Epic might go public sooner or later, it won't be a surprise if $U would go down some percents at the same day. But for the long run, ETFs would buy both of the stocks (like ARK/ARKK did with Unity) and that would bring the price up.

TL;DR 8: **Their only real competitor might go public sooner or later**

**That's it, if you survived everything tell me what you think.**

For me I think I'll just buy the dip and hold forever since the growth is crazy and the world just getting more and more digital but please do your math since no one know what's gonna be.

Disclaimers: **I know nothing about nothing. I'm not an investment advisor and don't take any advice from me - or in general don't just listen to a random stupid guy on the internet and all that, read about it yourself.**

**I'm just a developer that enjoy and know to appreciate the platform and its cross platform abilities for my game.**"

As You might know this is the last era of the lithium-battery. You know, that chargebale battery and the one and only reason why you have to charge your phone every 2 hours and your Tesla (who doesn’t have one these days?) after 400-500 km. Let’s not forget a battery’s purpose is to stores energy. The more energy you can store in a smaller battery, the happier we humans are. Energy=happiness.

Finding a cost-effective and efficient solid-state battery for electric vehicles could prove equivalent to finding the golden fleece in Greek mythology. According to the legend, anyone who possessed the golden fleece would be considered a true ruler. According to the present technology, anyone who could develop a cost-effective and efficient solid-state battery would rule the EV world.

A few listed companies are working on revolutionary Solid-State Batterys. Instead of LI-ion, Solid-State Batteries use solid electrodes and solid electrolytes. For the ones who never heard about these, use Opera or Google to DYOR.

Solid-State Batteries promise, already today:

\- Twice the energy  
\- 1/100th of the size  
\- 6x faster charsing  
\- 10X longer lifetime  
\- Non-flammability

This new piece of 21th-century-technology will definitely evolve coming years. Elon Musk already called it the MOAB.

Now let’s talk stocks. A few companies are working on a Solid-State Battery, expecting to bring it to the market within a few years. Today, much of the development work on solid-state batteries is performed with partnerships. Among the players are conventional Li-ion battery-cell manufacturers (i.e., Samsung SDI, LG Chem, A123 Systems), battery separator technology solutions suppliers (Asahi Kasei), and materials suppliers (Solvay, Umicore, etc.).

QuantumScape  
Panasonic  
Samsung  
LG  
Ionic Materials  
BMW Solid  
Power  
Toyota  
Ilika

According to Yole Développement’s market forecast, mass production of solid-state batteries will begin by 2022 and represent less than 1% of Li-ion battery demand by 2025. This might explain the relative low interest from investors today, which might change when large solid-state battery manufacturing capacities start to be built.

Samsung, LG, BMW etc are all searching for the Solid-State battery for own use, so that is not interesting for me to invest in; they already reached their market share. Today there are 2 stocks I want to discuss with you: Quantumscape and Ilika.

You might have heard about QuantumScape before. QS went to the moon ($10- $130) when Volkswagen announced it took an extra 20% stake in the battery manufacturing company (crazy times on the stock market back in the days). Now QS is stable between $40 - $50. Fair price for a company with no revenue, but a huge potential in the EV market. QS is already backed by $300 million worth of investment from Volkswagen, Bill Gates and hedge fund billionaire George Soros. Ilika is also a pioneer in solid state batteries, trading around $3-$4. Ilika has has two development programs:

\- Stereax: miniature batterys for MedTech

\- Goliath: solid-states for the EV and other battery-powered transportation The scope of growth is huge in both industries. Compared to QS and to see what’s happening with their stocks, lets only focus on the EV market. Ilika aligned a road map where the plan to start production of the Solid-State Battery in 2026, that’s the same period as the planning of QS. Ilika actually plans a pre-pilot this year and a construction pilot in 2024. For more information, DYOR.

So why is ILIKF trading $2-$4 and QS $40-$50?

Founded by Stanford University scientists a decade ago, with financial backing from Volkswagen AG, QuantumScape became a public company in November after merging with Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp, a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC). When the SPAC deal was announced in September the parties decided a $3.3 billion valuation was appropriate. Following a blistering stock-market run, QuantumScape is now worth more than 10 times that initial value. Those who bought shares in the Kensington SPAC in August have enjoyed a 1,060% return. QuantumScape’s prominent backers include venture capital firms Khosla Ventures and Kleiner Perkins, Microsoft Inc. cofounder Bill Gates, hedge fund billionaire George Soros’s Quantum Partners and investor Jeremy Grantham. JB Straubel, a former chief technology officer at Tesla, is on the board. These people know how to bring a company to the market and make it moon $$$.

Looking at their financials and progress, QS and Ilika do not differ that much. They both have enough capital to fund the business processes for the next 5-7 years, and both planning to bring their product to market in 2025. To understand the difference we have to look in the type of investors of both companies and their strategy for production.

The difference is QS plans to build a giga-factory to manufacture their batteries, which asks for a huge investment (0,5 billion – 750 million per GWh). That is the real reason why they are raising these amounts of capital. Ilika has chosen a different route. They will use the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre (UKBIC) as a first step before scaling up through an existing manufacturing company to get to the GWh. UKBIC is a key part of the Faraday Battery Challenge (FBC), a Government programme to fast track the development of cost-effective, high-performance, durable, safe, low-weight and recyclable batteries. Therefor Ilika doesn’t need the same capital investment to fund their growth.

So here is the point. Solid-State Battery technology is the future of battery. Ilika is growing in multiple industries including the EV market. Therefor I believe Ilike is a save and good investment for the long term. What are your thoughts on this? Is Ilika a good investment?"

But I wanted to go more in-depth into just why I find this company so special and unique. As I mentioned in my DD last night, I am just a 19-year-old college student, not an investment banker or hotshot market maker, but I believe the information I have ascertained about Palantir by just scouring the web distinguishes it from any company on the planet (but we'll keep it strictly to the software industry in this DD).

What is truly unique about Palantir's software (Gotham, Foundry, Apollo) is how collaborative, scalable, and advanced it is. Let me break this down: Palantir's software is COLLABORATIVE b/c it meshes the company's clients' data into a mega cloud. For example, the LAPD, BP, JP Morgan, and top law firms all upload their data onto Palantir's cloud, where they can get insights into efficiency, efficacy, and receive suggestions from the advanced software on how to improve their venture (these guys are all PLTR clients btw), and particularly useful for say, defending an embassy or managing a supply chain.

Now, just to get it straight, there is no data/cloud that can come ANYWHERE close to the insights and knowledge on what Palantir has.  You might often hear from Wall Street research analysts/CNBC shills who complain that PLTR has too many rich clients (big companies/gov't). But I think what boomers don't understand is that building your foundation amongst the biggest fish in the sea is quite the ADVANTAGE, not a weakness.

Let me use an example from our beloved Cathie Wood and her firm Ark Invest's large position in Tesla extremely quickly (I promise). When asked about how she felt about Tesla's performance in the autonomous driving space compared to competitors like Waymo (owned by Google), she commented last year that **having a vast collection of data** would separate those who succeed from those who attempt. As a reference, Tesla cars all transmit self-driving data back to the firm, which comes about through the many Tesla owners who drive all over the world. On the other hand, Waymo is committed to private testing stages only, which is shallow-minded b/c it doesn't have access to trial data on say, congested roads.

Back to PLTR. The reason I bring up the Waymo-Tesla-Ark example is to highlight just how many clients PLTR's revenue base represents, and how impactful that is on a company's growth, scalability, and ultimately, the *success of their product*. But I mean when you think about it, Palantir's clientele is the **ENTIRE GLOBAL ECONOMY/SOCIETY**. Go to the *Financial Times*, and try to find me an article that doesn't talk up Palantir's greatness in the U.K and their work helping NIH. EU members like Greece/France also use it for COVID vaccine tracking. Palantir has contracts with the Japanese/South Korean governments. Palantir has notably helped the U.S. catch infamous cucks like Osama Bin Laden to Bernie Madoff. Quite the diversity!

The reason for that entire BJ to Palantir right there is to illustrate just how extensive this scale is. Not only is all this data accessible RIGHT NOW to all these clients to collaborate on Palantir's platform, but is comprised of the single most dominant and sustainable institutions/enterprises in the world. No matter how the political winds blow or how the global/domestic economy winds up, you can count on 3M, the DoD, Ferrari- to name a few- to continue seeking ways to scale, grow, expand, and Palantir certainly is the way.

This gets back to another central, bulletproof thesis surrounding Palantir. Who are its competitors? Who can do what Palantir does? 

Let's start with Snowflake. All credit to their talented team, Warren Buffett, and their gang of bulge bracket banks who underwrote their IPO and cheerlead the stock on media outlets on the daily. But for lack of a better word, their software just isn't *dope* enough. I mean the UI contrast speaks for itself, but the intelligence is what matters here. Yes, data warehousing is no joke and is certainly a scalable business, but what kind of innovative insights can you draw from just essentially a digital warehouse that doesn't add any value? All Snowflake really is is Salesforce dressed up in pretty bells and whistles. Really makes me question Buffett's whole commitment to ""value.""

[C3.AI](https://C3.AI) at least has me interested. It seems like a real knock-off version of Palantir based on what I can ascertain from their public materials, but so what? A bunch of washed-up junkies from Oracle think they can lead the transition to AI? Compared to a company that was seeded in 2003 specifically to work with the CIA and other intelligence agencies after 9/11 (PLTR also called the ""gold standard"" by these agencies according to *TechCrunch*), why waste your time in [C3.AI](https://C3.AI) or Snowflake? Don't even get make me started on Splunk, IBM (who conceded they suck by signing on w/ PLTR last week), or MSFT.

And while we're at it, let's talk about valuations to drive the point home. According to the *Financial Times,* PLTR is valued at a $48B market cap and is trading at 34X 2021 estimated sales. To start, yes that is very lofty, even after accounting for the recent sell-off due to earnings/lock-up fears. But I'll pick on my prime targets, SNOW and AI, if we can even call them competitors (we'll be nice). SNOW has just under an $80B market cap, but is trading at 80x 2021 estimated sales! AI is trading at a $15B market cap, and is trading at 70.5x 2020 estimated sales!! That's fucking crazy, and Buffett should sell SNOW immediately if he cares about value (or he just doesn't understand technology).

Since the whole speculation is going to be about earnings in the next few years, let's talk about that. As I mentioned in my DD yesterday, PLTR reported EPS of $0.06/share on a non-GAAP basis, which is TRIPLE what the street predicted!! But thanks to a $100M stockholder compensation expense, the GAAP basis was a loss of $0.02/share, and Wall ST took the opportunity to AMBUSH PLTR. 

If you understand how business development works, these incentives are necessary in the early stages of a company. How else do you expect to attract top talent to the company and incentivize existing brains to stay? But as you grow into your valuations, like PLTR will, why do you need to do it? (PLTR has essentially promised 30% + growth for 5+ years, and earnings are on the way this year thanks to their earnings report). Who does Apple need to incentivize to stay? Wall St is simply trying to make something out of nothing.

I also mentioned PLTR was a direct-listing yesterday, unlike any of these other names here. If you don't know what that means, basically PLTR didn't have its IPO underwritten by banks or pay them massive fees in the process. So equity research, investment banking, asset management, and other areas of lucrative finance have no incentive to talk up PLTR (just Jeffries it seems for now).

And this is what I mean. Again as I mentioned yesterday, it happens with all megacap tech companies. Think about it as evolution. Facebook. Apple. Tesla. Google. Microsoft. These guys weren't oversubscribed by the money makers either, nor were they cheaply valued either. But by the time the robust top line translated into earnings, these firms were worth hundreds of billions of $ with the snap of your fingers, which is exactly what will happen with Palantir (we are already seeing this- their institutional ownership nearly doubled from 12% in January to 21% right now).

This is what I want you all to think about. As a disclosure, I am very long PLTR (you can view my positions on yesterday's DD), but irregardless of whether you will invest in it or not, read about Palantir Technologies. This is the company of the future: able to tailor its cutting-edge technology to all the intricate challenges the 21st century projects: climate change, further space exploration, geopolitical/nuclear tensions, renewable energy adoption, inequality, police reform, and so much more, while providing a platform for all these parties to collaborate and improve. Given the world is an ever expanding place, and the dominant players are already seated at the table, I could not feel more relieved or excited than to have all my chips in the one waiter who will serve them all.

\*\***This is not financial advice. I recommend you read up on PLTR, pour through its financials, and hear more from its CEO, Alex Karp, and Chairman, Peter Thiel- then make your own informed, balanced, intelligent, rational decision. Without a doubt, this will be** ***the*** **company being discussed in the decades to come, and I just want to expedite the conversation now.**"

Looks like a solid buy. Sony and Microsoft planning to boost their console production by a lot in 2021 and I assume when the pandemic ends the supply chains will run even better. Apple continues to outsell themselves every other year which makes even more sense of buying these stocks

Recently, we’ve seen a little turmoil in the broader market that has scared some growth investors, and I do think there is some justifiable fear.

A lot of folks are going to tell you this is a great discount on names like TSLA or PLUG, and I certainly don’t disagree with them- I just want to have all my bases covered.

Now we have seen some structural shifts in the broader market. The 10-Year shift up to 1.35% is a noticable tick up, and this is something all of us 🦍 have to be wary of.

As much as I like discounts, when the market prices in tighter money, the Fed will have to listen. I believe Uncle Jay will continue to have the market’s back, and I think the 10-Year should be capped at roughly 1.5-2%. We’ll see how this develops, but the bottomline is these forward-looking growth giants are going to get CRUSHED if they miss expectations.

And well, if technology continues to be a deflationary pressure through innovation as we all expect, then 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 regardless and we can cap the discussion here.

So here’s where sweet good PLTR comes into play. I really, really like how they delivered earnings last week. Didn’t REALLY disappoint: beat earnings on a non-GAAP basis and had 45% annual top line growth.

But that’s not even the kicker for me. The fact that PLTR leadership is essentially guaranteeing at least 30% growth over the next 5 years (read the earnings call transcript), which will look like an absolute bonanza if rates actually start to go up.

Now, the thesis is that growth firms’ future profits are less valuable today if rates start to go up, which would not be great for big growth names like PLTR. But then here’s the thing: it would absolutely WRECK mega tech growth like FAANG or the EV/battery state field.

Let’s go back to earnings. Karp and the PLTR team are essentially setting the bar very low, telling investors to sit back and expect ONLY 30% growth for 5+ years. (For boomers, they realize this is fucking crazy btw).

Essentially, if there is any surprise to the upside, which is totally reasonable with a disruptor like Palantir, and this thing will be worth hundreds of billions in the blink of an eye.

But think of how all these great stories came about. Tesla in 2017-2019. Facebook in 2012-2013. Apple in 2008-2009. These tech stars never had a straight shot up, and the same goes for PLTR.

They faced the same problems. I’m only a college student, but I remember for as long as I have been alive from skeptical financial analysts that Tesla was gargantually overvalued and didn’t have the cash to survive in the EV market.

I watched as a kid as some whiz built up a social media platform from his dorm room, but Wall St attacked him for wearing a hoodie to his IPO. Not only did they not think he could expand his platform from PC to mobile, but they questioned how its cutting edge technology differed from Myspace and Tumblr, and wondered if he could ever scale ad revenue. 
He shore could.

Yes, PLTR is overvalued. What isn’t? Snowflake trades for 80X estimated sales. C3.AI trades at 73.5X its 2020 revenues. Salesforce, Splunk, and MSFT ain’t cheap. 

(For reference, PLTR is trading just under 37X 2021 sales, which is lofty, but looks reasonable compared to these other names that have way higher multiples and much less sophisticated/scalable software).

And if we look at it... PLTR was profitable by roughly $0.06/share if you take out a stockholder compensation expense that otherwise would have left them with $100M+ in operating profit. 

Is it profitable? PLTR has 70% fucking margins. How are Finance pricks not creaming over this??? You want high margin/earnings- this is it right here, man.

But no, no, big bad overvalued Palantir want to pay executives/advisors/shareholders extra money. Bad. Bad- I say they worth $20 in equity research reports and on CNBC instead, but still load up behind the scenes 🤮🤡.

Fuck the shills who say Palantir can’t continue robust growth or be profitable. (I am looking at your trend-seeking bots Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley).

On top of that, yes their revenue base is dominated by gov’t clients at roughly 52%, but let’s pause and realize this is a good thing. I mean... i don’t want to get too political here, but broadly, you’re a fool if you think the Dod, DoJ, or CDC/NIAID are cutting back anytime soon, if not looking to HEAVILY EXPAND given the monumental threats we face- geopolitical foes like China, Russia Iran; climate change; police reform; EV adoption/renewables more broadly; 5G and cloud/quantum computing, i really could keep going (amongst all of them, these agencies have dozens of contracts with PLTR worth hundreds of millions of $).

Not too mention PLTR also has massive contracts with numerous EU members and Asian allies like Japan/S. korea, but there’s honestly so many positive examples about how scalable this beauty is both domestically and internationally.

And let’s take what Cathie Wood said the other day on CNBC: roughly along the lines that some of the greatest innovations come from the military. I think we can point to the WWW as a pretty decent example of that.

Given PLTR traces its roots to the CIA’s venture capital arm and loading up on national security contracts with all the intelligence agencies after 9/11, I feel pretty confident that this lengthy history will continue providing much value in revenue AND earnings to PLTR, especially if rates starts to rise.

Furthermore, the cross that bogged Tesla, Apple, FB, and pretty much every mega cap tech company is restraining Palantir right now. The Street wonders if they will be able to continue locking down corporate clients, which it has been rapidly expanding in recent years.

The answer is yes. But Wall St doesn’t want you to think so at the moment. B/c PLTR was a direct listing, they weren’t underwritten by investment banks, and thus don’t receive the same financial shilling that names like Snowflake or C3.AI LITERALLY PAY FEES TO analysts/associates at bulge bracket banks to shill like a damn used ‘98 Honda Accord (and that’s exactly what these other SAaS names are compared to PLTR)

But we always double down on our convictions. If you have seen Palantir’s demos, read its financials, or listened to their CEO, then you know the potential of this company.

I believe in people. I believe in Peter Thiel and his track record. I believe a guy who founded PayPal with Elon Musk, seeded Facebook when no one else would, and decided to seed PLTR w/ the CIA (when no one else would)- yes, I believe he knows what he is doing.

And I believe he is capable of finding talent like Alex Karp and collaborating with him to build an absolute behemoth.

As a conclusion, can someone give me a firm answer on a company that can actually compete with PLTR in terms of solving a complex issue like tracking down Osama Bin Laden or expanding a niche industry into international markets??? And if your only comment is on valuations, see Snowflake (quite the value investment Mr. Buffett ;).

For disclosure, I am very long PLTR and am simply sharing my thoughts. This is not financial advice. And as always, do your own reading/research, but these are the frank sentiments of a PLTR believer.

Now with the lock-up fucking history, PLTR TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Today I humbly offer my opinions - and they are opinions, not financial advice - on four predominantly UK-based stocks I firmly believe will make fat bank by the end of the year or earlier. I’ll break down each stock individually and my reasoning, as well as a potential risks section at the end.

The stonks, pt.1: Mitchells and Butlers.

Mitchells and Butlers is one of the largest pub chains in the UK. Chances are, if it’s not a wetherspoons or an independent, it’s a M&B joint in one way or another. With a wide variety of brands under its name, M&B enjoys a massive market share of UK booze outlets. Last year saw pubs get utterly decimated, and accordingly, M&B’s stock price crashed hard, but with reopening dates now announced by the government, sentiment towards the pub industry will likely rise, as will M&B profits, as thirsty patrons flock back to their favourite watering holes. The trend will likely only continue to rise, as restrictions are lifted, and more people rush to enjoy cheap steaks and watered down pepsi in summer. In the short term, the value of the stock may go down, but I expect that by the end of May, firm profits will start flowing in, and the stock price will only go up, until it reaches a plateau in about September-October, as the novelty begins to wear off. 

The stonks, pt.2: Restaurant group.

Like Mitchells and Butlers, Restaurant Group owns a significant portion of the mid-to-high class restaurants across the UK, with numerous brands under its umbrella. While Restaurant Group has enjoyed a better recovery over the worst of the pandemic, owing to delivery services, Restaurant Group stock price is still well below its all time high, and the consistent price for the last few non-fucked years. Assuming a rapid increase in stock price upon reopening in late May to July, Restaurant Group could see anywhere from a 120% to 300% increase in value. Theoretically, Restaurant Group has the same plateau, but I anticipate that the stock price will level off at a higher value after the spike than M&B.

The stonks, pt.3: AMD.

At approximately $85 a share right now, AMD is around the highest it’s been for years. The last few days have seen a contraction in price, but AMD is all but guaranteed to bounce back in November/December time. With the release of the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series consoles, AMD silicon is in more homes than ever before, and orders from Sony and Microsoft are only going to keep coming in. However, 2021 also sees the pending release of Ryzen 6xxx processors, as well as a brand new socket platform, DDR5 RAM, and the potential release of RDNA 3-based graphics processors. Given previous company performance, the new Ryzen processors are likely to offer a reasonable increase in performance, as well as a host of new features inherent to a new platform. This will make the systems attractive to both home enthusiasts and laptop/desktop manufacturers looking to put fresh new chips in their computers. Assuming RDNA 3 releases this year, gains could also be boosted by what is likely to be a series of graphics cards that can soundly outperform Nvidia’s current offerings in traditional rendering, and has the potential to be the top dog until Nvidia releases 4xxx series. Even assuming a worst case scenario, where their new processors and GPUs are beaten this year, improvements in market share and product performance over last gen will likely still bring about an increase in value, or at least break even.

But that’s small fry. Because all the above is just a squirt of precum compared to the hot, thick, recoil-inducing money shot that is stonk number 4.

The stonks, pt.4: Rolls Motherfucking Royce.

I know what you’re thinking. “Don’t they make fancy cars? Who’s buying those?” Nobody, my dear ape, but you know what else they make? Jet engines. Rolls-Royce has approximately 36,000 engines in service with airlines around the world, and guess where those engines are right now? In hangars, missing their scheduled maintenance. With air travel being pretty much dead right now, a huge amount of aircraft are now squirreled away, awaiting reactivation. While it’s true that a lot of airlines went bust over the crisis, the planes and engines will be kept around and should eventually be brought back into service, while the airlines that survived will have to un-mothball their fleets EN MASSE. With a year of sitting around, the spike in repairs and maintenance to Rolls-Royce will be huge, and after that, a steady rise in air travel in the central and western Europe region will soon get the stock price right where it was before the pandemic. Travel between the USA and Europe, and places like Japan and Australia, who have handled the pandemic relatively well, will also help to get air travel back up. Not only that, but Rolls-Royce carries the patented “literally can’t go tits up” guarantee, courtesy of Boris Johnson, who gets an erection just thinking about starting a colony, and who will absolutely bail out Rolls-Royce in the event they go tits up. Moreover, with a programme for “Small Modular Reactors,” Rolls-Royce are in a prime position to enter the Nuclear power industry, adding further value to their long term profits. “That’s all well and good, but then, what about other areas in aviation?” I hear you say, you surprisingly handsome monkey. Well, Airbus and Boeing are both recovering from their slumps, but with recent news, Boeing stock is likely to go into freefall for a while, and Airbus stock is on its way back up to normal. Rolls-Royce’s biggest competitor, GE, has their stock chart look like a fucking line. But not Rolls-Royce. Rolls Royce’s stock price right now is only just beginning to recover. Rolls Royce stock prices looked like the trajectory of a Javelin missile in the pandemic, and have only today risen above $100 a share. In comparison, their normal stock price rides around $700, to a peak just shy of $1100. That’s up to an 11 times return on investment, folks.

Risks: the less publicised of the aircraft failures yesterday could have been a Rolls-Royce engine, though the lack of a stock price fall today suggests otherwise. Nonetheless, it is possible that a catastrophic accident could happen, wiping out Rolls-Royce stock price overnight, and severely delaying a recovery. Restaurant Group and M&B both rely on the public running out in droves to enjoy food and drink. While I believe this is all but certain, it is possible that a given percentage of UK patrons no longer wish to go out and have become so accustomed to having their food delivered that they are unlikely to visit these establishments in future. Finally, while I believe AMD’s future is bright, the current shortage of manufacturing is likely to hurt their stock price, and may dampen future product releases, if it continues into the end of the year and next year. Nonetheless, I believe AMD is going from strength to strength, and will only gain value in the long run. Or until they make another bulldozer.

In conclusion: While I’m not an expert and this isn’t financial advice, I have firm belief in the value of these stocks. While I don’t have the capital to go ham on these, I will be purchasing a Rolls-Royce share as soon as I can, and will be following its progress with great interest. The other stocks also represent a firm investment, albeit ones with less potential to go to orbit. Options on any of these would likely also bring profit to potential buyers, if you can’t buy a share yourself, or wish to use calls and puts to potentially make even more money.

That’s all, apes. Remember to wash those diamond hands, and also, buy a GME if you can."

Lots of words below, so here’s the TL;DRs, Table of Contents, a self dox, and position disclosure before my DD.

**TL;DR #1**: After watching Demo Day twice, I am blown away at how much Palantir’s products have matured in the last 6 years since I left Palantir. I find the new UX far superior to offerings from GOOG, MSFT, and CRM. Apollo is absolutely incredible, and it’s going where no clouds have gone before… from Humvees to nuclear submarines. Lastly, it is clear to me that PLTR has invested heavily in best-of-class administrative tools to improve the speed to deploy Palantir. Bottom line: I fully understand why IBM gave up fighting Palantir and is now selling Palantir Foundry to IBM clients.

PLTR when I left in 2015 versus the Palantir I saw on Demo Day:

[You've come a long way baby.](https://preview.redd.it/fuvi00aejph61.jpg?width=1182&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d993cff432e6b8f49b6728ac4d180cbbb2979080)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #2:** IBM just surrendered to PLTR. In the words of POTUS, this is a…

# Big.

# Fucking.

# Deal.

To put it politely, IBM and Palantir don’t have a very good past relationship. So the fact that IBM is now pushing Foundry means one thing: Foundry is so unfuckwithable that IBM was losing numerous contracts to Foundry-wielding competitors and IBM had no choice but to swallow their pride and cut a deal with Papa Karp.

* First they ignore you.
* Then they laugh at you.
* Then they fight you.
* Then they surrender to you and sign a deal to slang Foundry to thousands of clients in 180 countries.
* Then they send your shareholders tendies for decades.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #3:** Regardless of how ‘good’ or ‘bad’ the 2020 earnings are tomorrow, I find the news from early 2021 to be an incredibly strong signal pointing to an eventual $250B+ market cap for Palantir – BP renewing their enterprise deal, Rio Tinto and PG&E signing a new enterprise deals, AT&T aggressively hiring for Palantir skills, and 2,500 IBMers now pushing Foundry to clients all over the world, etc. IE the tea leaves I'm reading point to strong growth in 2021 and beyond.

It's also worth mentioning that many of the new commercial clients have some of the most difficult and complex supply chains in the world.

If they’re in, I’m in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #4**: Eventually, institutional traders will comprehend the immense long-term value of ~~Planeteer~~ ~~Planter~~ Palantir and the stock will join the PFAANG club (though I vote that we rename it the FAAPNG club).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Because there are so many shills, pumpers, and bullshiters on WSB these days, I’ll self dox myself. I’m Jason Payne. I joined Palantir in early 2007, when it was a few dozen geeks with big dreams, and left in 2015 to become the CEO of [Ada Diamonds](https://www.adadiamonds.com/) (hence my username).

I joined Reddit to do an official [AMA on laboratory-grown diamonds](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8pb8d5/i_grow_diamonds_i_make_custom_jewelry_with_these/) a few years ago that hit the front page, stuck around, and have absolutely fallen in love with the Reddit community. Thus, I want to give back to my fellow Redditors with a bunch of words and a few pictures to explain Palantir from the perspective of a former employee.

You may think that I’m a Palantir sock puppet given how my bullish I am in this DD. I’m not. Turns out I have a DD-writing fetish. Don’t kink shame. [Here’s a couple of my prior DDs](https://medium.com/@Jason_Payne) on De Beers, Tiffany & Co., and the FTC.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Positions or ban:** At the current PLTR share price, I hold a Keyser Söze position - I could sell out this week and simply walk off into the sunset. But I’m not going to. I have yet to sell all of my unlocked 20%, and I plan to mostly diamond hands my soon-to-be-unlocked 80%, with a decade long diversification plan to exit my concentrated stock position, regardless of earnings tomorrow.

Why? I like the stock, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#1) Praise & Constructive Criticism for Demo Day**

Existentially, Demo Day was incredibly impressive. This thread with u/namingisreallyhard, u/DentalFox, and u/jamauer sums it up:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d0p7dwzijph61.jpg?width=526&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9caa7b51ca8f7c2315988eda62f4afa7f30f7b07

Four things stood out to me:

**Superior Design Language to CRM, MSFT, and GOOG:** Palantir has a completely different front-end user experience (UX) than my time at Palantir, that I saw for the first time on Demo Day. I find it practical, beautiful, and efficient.

The design language is called Blueprint Javascript, and it’s built on React, a modern web development platform that Facebook built. Big ups to Palantir for open sourcing BlueprintJS, meaning that anyone can use it: [https://blueprintjs.com/](https://blueprintjs.com/)

Blueprint is a UI toolkit for web development of complex data-dense interfaces for desktop applications. Compared to the cartoonish UX of Salesforce’s Lightning, the flat UX of Google, and the rigid UX of Microsoft Office, I would much prefer to work in Blueprint all day.

I struggle with how spread out Lightning is by default and really appreciated how dense the Blueprint inerfaces are without feeling crowded. Getting that balance right is really difficult.

**Deep Investment in Deployability**: Administrative tools are the unloved stepchild of enterprise software. No-one buys the backend system, so minimal investments are typically made to build the backend tools to run the software.

Salesforce still hasn’t ported their admin tools from their clunky Web 1.0 Salesforce Classic to their more modern Lightning design system. Google’s back end admin tools suck compared to their client facing tools - Gmail, Calendar, AdWords, etc.

The admin tools that Palantir demoed appeared far better than what I use every day to run my Salesforce instance. I bet I could do most tasks in Foundry 40-75% faster than Salesforce.

**Migration from ‘*****Find the Terrorist*****’ to '*****Cheat Code for War*****':** When I was at Palantir, the primary use case for Gotham was link analysis to find the bad guy. Gotham has clearly evolved from that mission to a far broader set of missions.

Another Redditor described Gotham as ‘cheat code for war,’ and I think that is spot on. That’s why Palantir has won so many different logistics, mission planning, command and control, etc. military contracts recently, including the Space Force

**DoD IL-6 SaaS Approval:** Palantir moving to IL-6 approval could be an entire massive DD on its own, but I’ll keep it short. It’s a big fucking deal to get Apollo running on classified networks, and Palantir is far ahead of the other big SaaS players in this approval:

https://preview.redd.it/hl1j7wwkjph61.jpg?width=1314&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4dc190a30dc75e8d66bcd6c8ab74cb42472137d

Now that I have fanboied on Demo Day I want to be critical of the presentation style of Demo Day. I’d give the presenters a C+ at best. I found it rushed, confusing, and difficult to follow. I had to watch it twice to fully absorb the content, and I’ve given 500+ Palantir demos in my lifetime! My constructive criticism:

* Slow down 15-20%
* Err on the side of a simpler, more approachable lexicon
* For the love of God, stop reading from scripts. Use bullet points
* Handoffs were way to abrupt. Take a deep breath between presenters for us to get prepared for a new topic
* Get better microphones and Snowsound panels for future presentations
* Get a professional public speaking coach involved in rehearsals

I’m not alone in my take on Demo Day. Here are a few unprompted DMs I got from random Redditors on the presentation:

>*· I don't know if it is just me, but I genuinely felt like I was watching a haphazard presentation that didn't really do justice nor capture attention in a lucrative way*  
>  
>*· It lacked charisma and charm, and it felt cobbled together like a group project by university students*  
>  
>*· I was watching the demo day presentation, and left feeling underwhelmed. It may have been impressive to someone who is in the industry, but from someone outside of it, it all sounded greek to me.*  
>  
>*· I felt like the Gotham team was clearly the A team and Foundry needs better presentation skills.*

I know my last PLTR DD made the rounds at Palantir, so here’s a direct message to those behind Demo Day - if everyone told you that you ‘*killed it*,’ you \*really\* need to find someone in the organization willing to speak truth to power.

\_\_\_\_\_

**#2) Why Palantir is a Diamond Fisted Iron Man Suit**

One of the Demo Day presenters made an interesting comment that stuck with me: At Palantir, we build Iron Man suits, not robots.

No, Palantir does not have a skunk works program building flying mech suits (AFAIK).

Palantir builds *cerebral* cyborgs, not *physical* cyborgs. Palantir’s products create a symbiotic relationship between human beings and computers to better solve *cerebral* tasks, not *physical* tasks.

&#x200B;

[Iron Man. Cerebral Edition.](https://preview.redd.it/77xps5ipjph61.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb3acbee813e27ca69f7b94c9158fba44c6e142a)

If you have not watched Demo Day yet (or you rewatch it), listen for how many times they say the words ‘decision’ and ‘decision makers.’

Why a **diamond fisted** Iron Man suit? Palantir just closed an enterprise deal with Rio Tinto, who is the 3rd largest diamond producer in the world. So Rio Tinto will be using their PLTR-powered Iron Man suits to dig for fistfuls of diamonds on multiple continents.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**#3) The True ROI of Palantir**

Palantir is really expensive. No question about it.

But you know what’s more expensive than Palantir? Bad Decisions. Being wrong is really, really expensive. See the Airbus 380, Microsoft’s market share of cell phones, the Golden State Warriors drafting Todd Fuller over Kobe Bryant, shorting GME in early January, and BMW/Mercedes/Lexus’s dismissal of TSLA.

The true ROI of Palantir is substantially better decision making across your organization. Even a moderate improvement in decision making creates deep fucking value for an organization.

For example, Airbus claims that Foundry helped them improved the speed of A350 production by 33%. There are 5 million discrete parts in an A350, and the Foundry-powered decisions led to a 33% improvement in production. Palantir doesn’t make that claim. Airbus makes that claim. That’s absolutely bonkers and that’s why this is no surprise:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ns8wcvvsjph61.jpg?width=675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fb13831b6f18b58f53fa5131f6543e950e8569f

The BP renewal and the new deals (PG&E, Rio Tinto, Fiat, etc) prove u/petroduct is right. If you have complex logistics, you should have Foundry.

Say that Palantir improves the quality of decisions made at United Airlines by 6.9%. How much will the UAL stock appreciate over the next decade? If Palantir helps Rio Tinto improve decision making by 4.20%, how much will their bottom line grow by 2025?

Below are a few excerpts from United's Director of Technical Operations on how they use Foundry. This is just scratching the surface of how an airline can use Palantir to improve operations; however, if each of these models/decisions are incrementally improved, even a little bit, the value to United is fucking deep.

The entire blog post is a great read if you want to go deeper on Foundry: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/)

>*\[minor edits for brevity\]*  
>  
>*The return-to-service model recommends which specific aircraft to return at which time in the future and how to utilize our available maintenance capacity (internal & external) to ensure they’re airworthy when we need them. Since we don’t know when air travel demand will recover, the models need to account for slow recoveries, fast recoveries, and everything in between.*  
>  
>*Our optimization models consider when “big events” (airframe checks, engine overhauls, and landing gear overhauls) will be due, along with the cost of those events and the available maintenance capacity to complete them. The models also incorporate other factors: parts availability and cost, available technician hours at each maintenance station, ability to secure supplemental maintenance lines at external MRO providers, aircraft-specific mechanical reliability and on-time performance, and even the quality of the in-flight products (seats, Wi-Fi, entertainment, power outlets).*  
>  
>*The team is also helping optimize the cycling of active and parked aircraft whenever we have surplus planes available to fly, which ensures regulatory compliance with the maintenance program, minimizes operating costs, and enables our Tech Ops team to be very intentional about balancing our operational objectives – do we want to fly the most reliable aircraft, the lowest cost aircraft, or the aircraft with the most time left until its next major maintenance event?*

&#x200B;

**#4) Muthafuckin’ Clouds in Nuclear Submarines**

Toward the end of the Apollo demo, one of the presenters offhandedly mentioned something that caused my jaw to hit the floor: Palantir will be deploying Apollo on US Navy submarines.

IL-6. Clouds. In. Nuclear. Submarines.

As someone who has installed and managed Palantir servers in server rooms all over the world, I can’t state how huge it is that the US Navy is approving the Apollo modular cloud architecture to be deployed on some of their most sensitive and expensive assets.

The fact that upgrades to the entire fleet can be managed like upgrading an AWS server?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mvmtqwdvjph61.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef22d9c598c63b3bd4e488b8439bc4082ff9f5ba

\_\_\_\_\_

**#5) Does it Matter that Palantir Needs FDEs at Deployments?**

One of the favorite arguments of the Palantir bears is that Palantir is an unscalable, overvalued services company that should have the same P/E as Accenture, Booz, BAE, etc. The bears say that Palantir only has a handful of clients and can’t scale. In my mind, the quality of the admin tools show on Demo Day and the IBM partnership announcement eviscerated that argument.

When I was at Palantir, it was a bitch to build and manage deployments. From what I saw on Demo Day, Palantir is now easier than Salesforce to deploy. I say that as someone who has written tens of thousands of lines of code for Salesforce (Lightning, Apex, SOQL and Visualforce).

Eventually, Palantir will have the same ecosphere of 3rd party developers that deploy and manage instances of SAP, Salesforce, Microsoft, etc. but that will take years to fully mature that ecosphere. Eventually, Palantir will have robust certifications for various skills and tasks to manage Palantir deployments.

But in the meantime, Palantir's Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) will continue to directly manage deployments. Given how much progress Palantir has made on the tools to improve the efficiency of the FDEs, I no longer worry about the scalability of that team.

Say that three utility companies all buy Palantir – PG&E, ConEd, and Entergy.  Palantir invests 4 years worth of FDE time in PG&E, 1 year in ConEd, and none in Entergy.

* PG&E improves decision making by 10% and does a massive enterprise deal with Palantir to deploy to every part of the organization.
* ConEd improves decision making by 2% and does a moderate renewal for a few specific teams.
* Entergy bungles their deployment and actually makes worse decision as a result. They do not renew.

Assuming \~$500k/year all in is the cost for a good FDE at Palantir, we're talking about small up front investments that return bigly for PLTR in the long run as those deployments are extended like the BP deal.

To put it another way, when you think about Palantir deployments in months or years, the FDE overhead is spooky. But when you think about those deployments converting into decade long *operating system for XXXXXX* deals, the FDE overhead is not significant.

Also, to be honest, there are very few people with TS/SCI security clearances that even know what React is, much less how to write code against it, so in some of the more sensitive use cases for Palantir, I think that FDEs will be the way for a long time.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#6) Should you YOLO on PLTR?**

I’m not going to give anyone financial advice, but I do want to point out a few things:

PLTR is not a meme stock. Palantir is not a small-cap that can move bigly because, a bunch of furry quadrupeds gathering on internet messaging boards collectively decide that we like the stock.

Palantir is a bunch of wickedly smart people building Iron Man suits for the largest, most important organizations in the world.

Many of the larger institutional investors still don’t truly comprehend Palantir and the medium term public valuation may not properly reflect the present and future value created by Palantir. I have no idea when the analysts will finally get the value of PLTR.

A lot of historically successful investors think PLTR is extremely overvalued. They may be right.

A lot of historically successful investors have massive positions long PLTR. CathThey may be right.

So my crystal ball says PLTR may go up, down, or sideways for longer than you can stay solvent or interested in Karp memes.

Regardless of the ticker, if you YOLO, please YOLO responsibly my friends, and for the love of god take some off the table if/when you’re fortunate enough to have green dildoes in your accounts– whether your gains are from PLTR or any other stock you happen to like, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#7) My Appreciation for the Palantir Team**

I do want to take a moment and say to anyone who has been a part of building Palantir over the last few decades: what you have built is incredible. Thank you. As an American, thank you. As a stockholder, thank you.

Enjoy your tendies, you’ve earned them my friends.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#8) How I Play My Lockup**

Regardless of how the markets view the earnings report tomorrow, I’m largely HODLing my remaining Palantir shares, as I think Palantir is in a class of it’s own, lapping the competition like SpaceX and Tesla.

I do have a professional advisor and we have prepared tax-optimized divestment strategies for a number of scenarios, but none of those scenarios involve paper handing out of my remaining position, regardless of a good, bad, or ugly response to the 2020 earnings report tomorrow.

Why would I sell now if I believe that FAANG-like is growth coming over the next 10 years? Why would I sell when I think Palantir in 2021 is like Mercedes F1 in 2014 about to go on a worldwide domination over the next few years? Also, with the shares finally unlocked, I can borrow against them for the first time.

I've already responsibly taken enough off the table pre-IPO, so I’m not in any rush to sell. My first substantial limit order will be at a market cap of \~$100B with a ladder up to \~$250B. So I’m skeptical that I’ll sell any more than 5% of my remaining shares this week.

That’s my $0.02 on Demo Day and some of the recent news.

So long, and thanks for all the tendies. See ya at the restaurant at the end of the universe PLTR gang!

Transportation and delivery stocks took a hit last March when the disruption of pandemic came. Almost one year later they have recovered strongly. Staying at home and working from home have created unprecedented demand for transportation and delivery of goods via vehicles on highways. As the vaccination looms and the economy reopens, the demand might drop, but the habits nurtured during the pandemic could linger for quite a while. I am still cautious about airline stocks; air travel is still far from recovering even 1/3 of what it was before the pandemic and I won’t make a move until the volume reaches about 1/2 . 

Looking at: PAG, KSU, UPS, FDX, UBER, UNP

2 More traditional/” big players” financial stocks

I have opened another post asking for advice, so I will just be copying and pasting:

Fintech stocks and ETFs are popular on the market nowadays and I’ve reaped quite some profits from ARKF, PYPL, SQ, V, virtual currency ETFs e.t.c. But now I am eyeing in on the more traditional/big Wall Street players like Citibank, JPM, Morgan Stanley, Goldman e.t.c. All flaws and blames and crooked behaviors aside, they are still the biggest players in the financial market nowadays and the establishment can’t be overwhelmed by a few Reddit short squeezes. I am trying to observe if these stocks could sort of ""recover"" from the shock and respond to the innovative trend.

There’s also another realm of more diversified asset management player such as CG, BX, BLK, NTRS e.t.c. It seems the pandemic has a very strong asset/wealth reallocation effects and the wealthiest that could afford to have their assets managed by these players are doing well. These institutions also typically have quite established footings in emerging markets such as Asia and South America in both government and private businesses. CG has recently published a pleasant Q4 2020 report and their stocks climbed. I am waiting to see if BX, BLK and NTRS would follow suit.

Looking at: JPM, BX, BLK, NTRS, CG, BAM

3 Military and Defense

The mainstream media tries hard to paint a layer of peaceful color to the new administration, but tensions around the globe won’t just disappear. The US military has quite a few major contracts for new weapon systems delivery coming up, and US arms sales to allies could increase as many of them are located at the forefronts of tensions (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Saudi, India e.t.c).

Looking at: LDOS, LMT, GD, NOC, BA (more for its military contracts rather than for commercial airplanes)

======

4 Tech Infrastructures

With everything shifting to online platform, Tech stocks (IT, cloud computing, semiconductors e.t.c.) have done well in 2020. I am in MSFT and TSM, and I just want to take a look at stocks that offer a more infrastructural exposure to the tech advancements, such as base towers for 5G, solutions for cloud computing and online platforms, workstations, hardware production e.t.c.

Looking at: CCI, AMT, CSCO, MSI, ERIC

5 Virtual Currency

I am not a big fan of virtual currencies so far, and it might be a bit late to enter the game. but nobody could deny the soaring prices of every major virtual currency, and I certainly don’t mind to ride the bandwagon and get a few extra bucks.

Warren Buffett’s favorite valuation metric, a simple ratio of the total U.S. stock market capitalization to annual gross domestic product, effectively gives market watchers a reference point for current prices.

The current stock market value of $42 trillion, compares to annual GDP of $21 trillion. One year after the dot-com bubble popped, Buffett said the unprecedented highs should have served as a strong warning signal. ""If the ratio approaches 200%—as it did in 1999 and a part of 2000—you are playing with fire,"" said Buffett.

Current Buffet Indicator: 195%
Dot com bubble Indicator: 159%


Margin debt balances have exploded on Wall Street, recently hitting an all-time high of $778 billion—nearly 37 times the $21 billion investors held in March 2000. However, the more important metric to focus on is margin debt to cash in customer accounts. It’s currently at 72% more debt than cash, versus 79% at the peak of the dot-com bubble. Speculation is contagious


Among stock market indicators the put/call ratio measures the weekly volume of put options, which are purchased when investors think stocks will fall, divided by the call option volume, contracts purchased by bullish investors


Currently the put/call ratio is 0.4, nearly identical to the 0.39 it registered in March 2000, at the peak of internet stock buying mania.


S&P market-cap concentration is at an all-time high, making index-tracking funds, which represent trillions of dollars in market value, extremely vulnerable to swings in just a few companies. 

Today, the top five—Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla and Facebook—make up 21% of the index’s total market capitalization, even more than the 18% of market value commanded by the five biggest in 2000, when Microsoft, Cisco, General Electric, Intel and Exxon Mobil were on top. 

Is this it? The end is near?

Before Covid supply chain was running smooth as a glove, think of it as a highway full of cars flowing at exact same speed and spaced equally. This supply chain was being perfected for over a decade. And then this shitstorm happened. The highway is clogged, ships are standing loaded with crap they cannot effectively unload quick enough, there aren\`t enough ships to move products that are needed. Including basic materials for industries and intermediate components to make a final product.

For those who don\`t know, there is an absolute chip shortage in the market right now. Spanning from AMD/NVDA CPUs and GPUs, to auto chips, to new consoles, and any kind of electronics. Even AAPL will have sales issues this quarter caused by the chip shortage.

The main chip producer TSMC is ramping up CAPEX to $28 billion, including $12 bn for their US plant.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead) 

The perfect storm is brewing for NVDA and AMD to gain enormously from this market, but in my opinion AMD will end up with upper hand, let me explain.

&#x200B;

1. Back in 2017/2018 year old GPUs were selling over on Amazon and elsewhere for double their MSRP. These were old graphic cards! their price should have depreciated over time, but didn\`t. Why? Cause of B T C. Miners were buying that shit by bulks. Guess what? We\`re at the exact same situation right now, except that price of that thingy is now $50k! and with new cards being more cost effective you wouldn\`t be able to buy ANY right now even if you wanted it to simply upgrade your PC and play something. As a matter of fact try to buy GTX 10xx or RTX 20xx gen on Amazon, there are NONE! So its not only the latest gen that\`s unavailable, its ALL of them. And CPUs have the exact same problem, which wasn\`t so bad in 2018. And soon you might find it impossible to buy even any laptop having latest chip: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156)
2. Not long ago NVDA announced $40 bn acquisition of ARM which would ensure they have access to state of the art IP which would make them future chip behemoth, and not surprisingly the largest companies in the world are now lobbying against that [https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns) . With this in mind, its becoming increasingly likely the acquisition wont go through. On the other hand, AMD replied with the acquisition of XLNX which seems wouldn\`t be such an issue considering AMD is way smaller than NVDA or INTC.
3. AMD and QCOM are actively lobbying US gov to address the issue, which they will. What to expect? Quite likely to remove previous trade policies regarding chips - resulting in easier access and higher/cheaper volume of chips being produced overseas. Which would mean AMD can ramp up production and meet the huge current demand of data centers and whoever needs their GPU. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage) . 
4. Price action - stocks follow certain pattern. They kinda wobble within some range for long period of time, 6-18 months, this is where a lot of accumulation by big players happen, and fundamentals kind of crystalize. Once the conditions are right, the stock can shoot 50% in a span of a month and then hover on new level for considerable time. Look at the chart of TSLA 2015-2019, NVDA numerous times, AMZN, GOOG, etc. Right now, NVDA is up already 20% in the last month. I believe the market will look from NVDA to AMD very soon, given points 2-3 and major holders wont be willing to sell for current price.

To recap what is the perfect storm. In 2017/18 chip shortage was caused mainly by A. the thing we dont mention here, right now its also B. new consoles cant be produced fast enough, C. supply chain issues which might be resolved soon, C. simply way bigger improvement in new CPUs/GPUs hence new upgrade cycle coupled with corporate upgrade cycle due to COVID

They have the best tech in the market, much better than their competitors and are severely undervalued at the moment. MVIS also branches out to many additinal areas in addition to lidar, such as VR etc....go research. Their competitors are only one trick ponies.

Also, there have been rumors floating around for the past few months that Microsoft will buyout Microvision very soon....possibly by April.

Compare to VLDR and LAZR. By specs MVIS blows them out of the water. VLDR is worth 4 billion and LAZR is worth 10 billion. Comparing market caps that would put MVIS at 27.36-68.40 per share. Also those companies are one trick ponies. MVIS has LiDar, augmented reality, virtual reality, near-eye display. They’re a patent farm that’s just now getting noticed because they were so far ahead of the curve. They make the LBS chip that powers MSFTs Hololens 2. And by proxy the military’s IVAS unit."

This campaign has been largely led by large hedge funds. Without S&P inclusion, the story might have ended there with hedge funds trying to escape with their profits and leaving retail the bag. However, S&P inclusion presented these hedge funds with a much better option to close out their positions while also riding the stock down. The shares that hedge funds no longer wanted began to be picked up by passive funds leading to selloffs by the active funds which pushed prices to this level.

With passive funds holding the bag, the hedge funds which lead the rally seem to be attempting to push the price back down through a reverse gamma squeeze^(2).

No retail trader is buying 1m+ in deep OTM puts, this is an attempt by hedgies to push the price down.

We can also see this from the massive shift in options volume. $190B of calls open interest and over $250B of puts open interest, a massive put skew. This is especially significant because ""To put it in context it is equal to the combined $AAPL and $AMZN bullish skew or if you’d rather to the combined  $BABA, $FB, $MSFT, $GOOG and $WMT combined."" reflecting extremely bearish sentiment in an very very bullish market.

Once the reversal begins there will be nothing stopping it as OTM puts get less and less OTM. There are no shorts left to be squeezed and the bag holding passive funds which are largely barred from holding derivatives will have no way of rebalancing the options skew.

You might ask, why is that? Well, here are a few of their partnerships and products that they're developing (and have *already* developed):

* Partnership with Amazon: On December 1st, [BB announced a multi-year agreement ](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform#:~:text=OverviewContact%20Us-,AWS%20and%20BlackBerry%20Join%20Forces%20to%20Accelerate,New%20Intelligent%20Vehicle%20Data%20Platform&amp;amp;amp;amp;text=SEATTLE%2C%20WA%20and%20WATERLOO%2C%20ON,%2C%20Amazon%20Web%20Services%2C%20Inc.)with AWS, which is Amazon’s cloud service business. The agreement plans to develop and market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud. Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences.
* Partnership with Baidu: On January 25, BB announced the [expansion](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology) of its strategic partnership with [Baidu](http://iv.baidu.com/), whose high-definition maps will run on the [QNX® Neutrino® Real-time](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos) Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of [GAC Group](https://www.gac-motor.com/) (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.). The milestones build on the company’s [January 2018](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/blackberry-and-baidu-partnering-to-accelerate-connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-technology) agreement to make BlackBerry QNX's industry-leading operating system (OS) the foundation for Baidu's ‘Apollo’ autonomous driving open platform.
* BlackBerry QNX: BlackBerry is entering into the auto industry by using their QNX real-time operating system that is already built into over 175 million vehicles today and is already being used by automakers like Audi, BMW, Subaru, Volkswagen, GM, Toyota, and Honda. NVIDIA is even building its AI self-driving platform off of BlackBerry’s QNX technology.
* BlackBerry IVY: [In addition to the QNX](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/investors-overreacting-blackberry-deal-with-amazon/) Operating System, their partnership with AWS allows them to store all of this vehicle data through BlackBerry Ivy, which is a cloud-based software platform that allows these automakers to view data and insights for their vehicles.
* BlackBerry Spark: Another major service that BlackBerry offers is its Unified Endpoint Security, which is a comprehensive security approach to endpoint security that is essential to protect against and remediate cyber threats while providing visibility across all endpoints. Through their UES, they plan on improving **cross-platform visibility, cyber threat prevention, and remediation,** while **simplifying administration.**

**Okay, so why is this important?**

1. BlackBerry QNX was created to expand and improve autonomous driving vehicles and is currently being used in over 175 *million* vehicles.
2. BlackBerry IVY helps these automakers (Audi, BMW, Ford, etc) view data and insights on their vehicles. This means that if there is a recall on a vehicle, even like a problem with the sensors, **the automakers can find that issue much faster and quite possibly even fix it through a software update.**
3. They are REVOLUTIONIZING the automobile industry because of these two products. \*\*In the future, we could see a shift from hardware-driven vehicles to software-defined vehicles.\*\*
4. Not only are they focusing on this, but they also have successfully created cybersecurity software that received the **HIGHEST score in the industry for the Enterprise** [**Unmanaged/BYO use case**](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/09/blackberry-achieves-highest-score-in-gartner-critical-capabilities-report-for-unmanaged-byo-use-case)**.**

Gartner Research (who published the study) even placed BlackBerry higher than VMWare, IBM, and MSFT basically signaling that their products and services are better than their competitors. In fact, NONE of BlackBerry's customers that use BlackBerry Guard were affected by the SolarWinds hack. And the stock price is still $12.

**The Sobering Part of this DD:**

After taking a look at their balance sheet, I can agree with the skeptics that they’re not raking in a ton of money right now, but anyone can see that their current balance sheet makes the company appear to be undervalued, especially when compared to their competitors.

I mean, based on this information ALONE, the price of the stock should be much higher than it is right now. BlackBerry's current market cap is around $7 billion, with its competitors like Palantir, a software company that I’m sure you’ve heard other YouTubers talk about, hovering at 60 billion. And funny enough, Palantir is also focusing their software on electric vehicles and cybersecurity, just like BlackBerry. **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as Palantir, its stock price would be $110.**

**Final Thoughts:**

Here’s what the skeptics don’t realize though. They don’t realize that BB is still very focused on product development and customer acquisition, and that boomers probably still think it’s a phone company. Well, it’s not.

With their partnership with Amazon, Baidu, their UES and UEM product known as BlackBerry Spark, BlackBerry IVY, and their QNX operating system for vehicles, it seems like the market is not correctly pricing in BlackBerry’s **future growth**.

Maybe one day if BlackBerry receives the same amount of hype that Palantir is getting right now, maybe then it’ll be taken much more seriously. **But only, once people realize that it’s not a meme stock.**

EDIT: Well, WSB mods have banned me for linking my video. Oh well.

EDIT 2: By the grace of u/DeepFuckingValue, mods reduced my sentence for being a good boy.

Also, I forgot to mention this: to all the retards out there saying “BB is not PLTR” lemme let you in on something.

**BlackBerry’s Fiscal 2020 Revenue: $1.1B**
**Palantir’s Fiscal 2020 Revenue: $1.05B (ESTIMATE)**

And again...

**BlackBerry’s Market Cap: $7.3B**

**Palantir Market Cap: $55.6B**

So, you retards are telling me to sell my undervalued stock to buy *OVERVALUED* stock?! LMAOOO 💎🙌🏻🚀

EDIT 3: Position is 500 shares @ $20.35, and no, I did not make this post to “recover losses.” Please, if you are a cynic, do yourself a favor and realize that not everyone is cynical."

I present to you The Curious Case of Benjamin Butto....err Black Berry. ($BB),401,112,2021-02-13 00:48:09,"Listen up reta.....err, I mean memelords.   I know we’ve all moved on from the meme era into the weed era (and  hopefully people stick around that one due to the fundamentals for a  while, but if not....) and soon to be a redux of the vehicle era, but  there’s one meme stonk we need to have a real, honest heart-to-heart  about (and hey, it even ties into cars):  Let’s talk about Blackberry  ($BB)

# First,  let’s get some misconceptions out of the way: 

&#x200B;

Blackberry was never a  short squeeze stonk, even though it ended up getting roped in with the  other squeezers we were denied squozing  because of Wall Street cheating.  A lot of people thought it was and  that’s simply not the case.  Blackberry was, is, and always will be, a  phoenix rising from the ashes story, nostalgia peppered with  functionality.  You know, kind of like how you sometimes go watch some  classic porn to beat off to and don’t stop to think about the fact that  the actress is now in her 60’s and probably has super saggy tiddies.

Next  misconception:  It’s not a Boomer mobile phone company.  They don’t  make phones anymore – phones that are branded with their logos are made  by another company that pays licensing for the logo and some of the  patents.  Blackberry sold all their mobile patents months ago.

Third misconception:  No matter how much we ask,  they’re never changing their name back to Research in Motion so that we  can talk about Rim-jobs.  Sorry, just isn’t going to be a thing.

So  what are they?  It’s simple really:  They’re now an enterprise level  software security company.  When you think about it, it’s not such a big  pivot, given that their security encryption in their heyday was so  powerful that they ended up having to set up offices in certain nations  because it was impossible to crack and ran afoul of certain  international laws.

# Let’s take a dive into the financials before we get into the story:

At the time of this writing, BB is a 7 billion dollar  company with shares trading in the $12.50 range.  Even after the meme  war collapse, they’re still worth double what they were when the ball  dropped in New York City with absolutely nobody watching in person and  everybody at home wondering why even Anderson Cooper was using an autotuner.   They generate a hair over a quarter billion dollars in revenue each  quarter over the last year and in 2020 had a negative EPS of about 32  cents a share as they retooled, though they trimmed that to .23 cents a  share for their last quarterly earnings report.  They have about a  billion dollars in cash on hand and receivables, and they have about  half a billion dollars in debt.  It’s not a great fiscal outlook there,  but it’s certainly manageable for a growth company (which is what they  presently are).

# Where do they make their money?

Almost  half of their revenue is legacy income from selling endpoint management  and secure communications licensing.  A third of their revenue comes  from licensing their patents.  Oh, they also own Cylance, for you IT  help desk monkeys.

**That shit’s pretty boring, not gonna  lie.**  Your wife’s boyfriend might find it interesting, but only because  he can use it to laugh at you that you know this shit.  But the rest?   The rest is where things get interesting.  Blackberry Radar is a fleet  management solution, and the most interesting thing is....well, for  that, we have to go back in time for a moment:

# (Wayne’s World flashback/dream noises)….

July 29th,  2017.  Las Vegas Nevada.  50,000 of the world’s most feared hackers  descend upon Sin City for a weekend of debauchery, drinking, and talking  about all the new and interesting ways they found to break shit or in  general cause chaos - aka DefCon 25, which was NOT cancelled, contrary to what you might have been told.  A young hacker from Wisconsin positively stuns  everybody at a panel by revealing how it is that he found he could  effectively hack almost every late model vehicle on the road that  possessed connected features – from range and while the vehicles are in  motion – using.....music  theory.  It’s an absolutely stunning revelation, something matched only  by how terrifying the implications of it are.  And all anybody needed  was a $300 RF modulation tool.  Using this, he found he could take  control of every mass produced  car on the market except those made by Volkswagen Group and Tesla, and  those only because they had randomized frequencies they used.  This guy  fucked.  This process was so dangerous that, for one of the only times  in DefCon’s history, they didn’t publish the how-to publicly.  Oh, and a  team from a then relatively unknown EV company in China called $NIO won  the car hacking capture the flag tournament in less dramatic fashion.   If you didn't hear about any of this, it's because you were too much of a square to be there.  Sucks to be you, chump.  Something had to be done.

# Enter Blackberry

I’ll  spare you all the things that have happened since then, but what you  need to know is this:  Blackberry came up with a solution to defend  against this and a myriad of other problems (not to mention Europoor  compliance in the form of ISO 26262) not to mention autonomous security  - and their security software suite (QNX) is now on almost every new  car rolling off a factory line today.  This software is also critical  for EV’s, because it controls battery management ECU’s (that’s the shit  that makes it so you don’t have to drop 10 grand on a new power plant every 2 years).  Or, for those of you with IQ’s of 60:  Computer make car gooder.

# OK, so that’s cool.  But how does this get me TENDIES, man?  How much can these guys make?

They’re  coy about this and won’t give hard numbers, but there are ways we can  estimate what they’re pulling.  But to do that, we need to go back in  history again, and take a look at a stock nobody cares about

# (More Wayne’s World noises)

Enter:   Nuance Communications ($NUAN).  You’ve probably never heard of these  guys, but you and almost everybody you know has used their products at  some point.  They used to be best known for their Dragon Naturally  Speaking software suite, which your grandparents who decided they were  too old to figure out how to use a fucking keyboard bought so that they  could talk to their computer and send you messages that you hated  getting unless it came with a 20 dollar  bill, but which they thought you cherished forever.   However, at some  point around 2010, IBM – whom the Nuance CEO at the time was close  friends with the management of, literally just \*gave\* about 125 patents  around voice recognition to Nuance thinking that they were worthless.   Nuance took these patents and – for a brief moment – became one of the  coolest techs on the planet, because their tech is what made Apple’s  Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, Samsung’s whatever it was  called and a billion other voice recognition platforms work.  That is,  until Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Steve Ballmer, and everybody else Nuance  was dumb enough to trust to let look under the hood of their secret  sauce came along and all stole the IP to made their own platforms, leaving  Nuance rotting in a hole in the desert.  But one of the really cool  things Nuance expanded into before they went full retard was  they bought a couple of companies around 2013 or so– Tweddle and some  other company I can’t be bothered to look up – and got into the  connected car space.  At one point, Nuance’s Dragon Drive virtual  assistant was in every new car made by 9 of the world’s top 10 auto  makers.  

# OK, dude, my wife’s boyfriend is asking me to bring him a beer.  Can you speed this along?  What does this matter?

It  matters because we can look at what $NUAN was getting in licensing for  putting their virtual assistant in these vehicles, and use that data to  extrapolate an estimate of what $BB is getting for their software.  With  just their 9 car makers at their back, they were generating over 300  million dollars a year – and that was almost a decade ago, and just for  something that would tell you where to pick up your Down’s Syndrome  medication. Add a premium for security, include all the auto makers,  carry the one, smoke a bowl to help you concentrate, adjust for  inflation.....

This  is a market worth about...oh, roughly 750 million dollars a year for  Blackberry on the conservative side once they actually start charging a  market rate for this product.   Right now, they’re adopting the same  go-to strategy Microsoft has been employing with Azure, which is to  basically GIVE it away in order to gain market share and penetration,  and then send Fat Tony to collect once the car maker is reliant on it.  Plus  all the other stuff we already glossed over because it’s boring as  shit.   Applying the average multiple of earnings for cybersecurity  firms out there, their lack of competition in the space, etc. And you  come up with a market cap valuation target of....oh,  roughly between 45 and 50 billion dollars once they’re firing on all  cylinders.  And they don’t have to worry about Google or Apple throwing  10,000 engineers at this to make a competing product, because it’s just  not worth it to them, so they’re largely gonna get left alone.  

Or, by using maths....a  share price of somewhere in the neighborhood of $87.50.  Give or take  10 bucks.  Make it 15 to the downside, just to be safe.

# Yeah man!  Cool.  So I’m in.  It’s gonna go to that by like, Friday or something?

An enterprise level cybersecurity company with a sub 10 billion dollar valuation is basically unheard of in this century.   But this is not a burn play where you’re gonna  get 50% gains every day with no work.  It’s a company that’s going to  have to melt up to that.  It still won’t be to that point this time next  year. 

BUT....that  doesn’t mean it doesn’t have a great story.  It just means that this  isn’t something you do a 0DTE YOLO on and expect to get something out  of.  And making an Avengers meme about it isn’t going to send it to the  moon.  This is something you buy and stash in a musty corner of your  portfolio so you can tell your Boomer parents that you’re being  responsible with your investing and you were just joking about betting  your inheritance on weekly FD’s for shitty online dating sites where the women have to talk to your sorry ass first.   Oh, and it’ll make the lambo you buy with the money from this safer.

Because I know it matters, here are 69 rockets so you apes understand what all this meant.

.....no, there aren't going to be any rockets.  I lied.

Disclosures/Positions:  I am long $BB, holding 100,000 shares @ $7.67 average and another 5000 January 2022 5c’s.

I like the stock,0,25,2021-02-12 16:15:05,"🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 This isn't financial advise, I'm not an advisor of any kind. I just like this stock and rocket emojis too. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 TLDR: SKM is undervalued. It's wireless business should worth 10B(or more) and it's 20% stake in sk Hynix is valued at 15.4B. Shares should be 40$ to reflect that. Spin-out catalyst could bring that value to shareholders.

SKM has a 20% stake in SK Hynix which equates to nearly 2/3 of its market cap. Which means it's wireless business is SUPER undervalued, or you can get super discounted exposure to SK Hynix. Either is bullish.

Rumors of spinning out the non-wireless businesses from SKM would bring that value to shareholders.

Insiders are buying more, not unloading. Which means insiders at SKM also like rocket emojis 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Risk and catalyst: Spin offs could be unwelcome or difficult to achieve, keep the value discounted. Catalyst: south Korea updated its fair trade act making spins offs easier to achieve.

Had to check a few times because I couldn't believe it. The 20% ownership of SK Hynix is supposedly valued at roughly 15.4ish Billion usd. The entire market cap for SKM listed shows 15.75B usd.

It seems pretty crazy to discount the wireless business they run to only 0.35B. it's probably worth at least 10B? 13B? Let's say 10 for discount sake. For the sake of being lazy, and you probably stopped reading already anyways, let's completely discount all their other retail businesses to 0 and ignore the deal with Microsoft they made for Xbox sales and streaming.

10B + 15.4 = 25.4B I think that will be reasonable for a market cap.

Skm share price would be somewhere near $40 if the wireless business and the 20% ownership of SK Hynix were not discounted. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Downside risk... Lost opportunity somewhere else. It's already discounted and the risk I see is the spin out not happening.

Sideways price action would be the risk (unless you're thetagang)

I like this stock because it's undervalued. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

These last few weeks have been bizarre in terms of the stock market and it has left me at a complete lost as to what ""up & coming"" companies to put my money on at the moment. I am feeling that I would like to outline my running thesis as to what has been going on.

The GME gamma squeeze has changed a whole lot. Probably this is just a short term distrubance, though it could be a continual change, I really don't know.

\*\*So what has happened?\*\*

\*\*Part 1 - Gamestop\*\*

Gamestop and its prophesied gamma squeeze awoke the hoard. Tens, if not hundreds of thousands of newby traders exploded out onto the freshly burgeoning retail trading platforms to take advantage of the promise of riches beyond belief.

You see a rumour began to spread that the ruling financial elites had gotten greedy, they had over extended, and trapped themselves in an unwinnable situation. How lucky we all now were. We simply needed to buy up these shares and we would soar to the moon carried by a rocket, powered by the elites lost money. It was irresistible. It was a promise not only of immense wealth, but also of destroying those that had destroyed others so many times.

This, of course, didn't end as most people expected. The elites escaped their fate. The early traders made millions, most won minor amounts and some lost more then they could.

\*\*Part 2 - The Fallout\*\*

So, suddenly the market had become open to a hoard of fresh traders that had gotten a taste, a teaser of what they could make from a hobby in stock trading. They had only two questions on their mind ""What stocks are the next GME?"" & ""Which of these winning stocks can I afford and win the most?"".

These two questions inevitably led them to one place... THE PENNY STOCKS! (also stocks under about $30) Though, most of them couldn't access all penny stocks, just those penny stocks that are avaliable on most standard trading platforms.

\*\*Part 3 - Thesis\*\*

I am doing away with the story like tone of this now, though I hope you enjoyed that.

Essentially, A ton middle class people that don't have ridiclous amounts of money surged into the market and have all been trying to guess the next GME/Big thing and many have just been following trends on mass. The issue with this is there is currently ""seemingly"" high quality DD posts being made of virtually every widely avaliable stock under $10, and of many stocks that are a bit higher than $10.

I imagine, because of this, many people might be experiencing the same problems as me now.

1. It is much harder to tell which low cost stocks are actually potentially good long term investments and which are riding the hype wave and new trader wave.
2. Many of the potentially good long term stocks have shot way past what there forecast long term gains had been. So, I am left wondering how far they will recede back, if at all, and when should i buy back in.

I am curious what the take of other traders on here are about handling this situation?

Personally these are the steps I have taken.

I have benefited with a small amount of winnings both from GME & from weed stocks as well as some of the other penny stock gains. I have taken all of my money out of these sort of plays temporarily and moved most of it into safer long term investments. Most into a few different ETF's, some into SQ, Microsoft, Apple.

Though I have kept a small amount ( an amount I have no problem loosing) and I chucked it into a Tanzanian gold company stock, ""why"", you may ask, ""have you moved stocks into a strange unimpressive tanzanian gold mining company?"" simply because it was one of the last widely accesbile(that is to say avaliable on most amatuer trading platforms) penny stocks under $1, I suspect it may move up simply because of how cheap it is. Stocks under $1 seem, at least temporarily, to be soaring for the simple fact of being under $1."

The GME squeeze was a once in a lifetime opportunity, but all the newcomers that have flocked to our beloved short bus don’t seem to realize this. They are like crack whores giving blowies in the Wendy’s parking lot just looking for their next hit.

 As a result, we have been flooded with absolute dogshit DD and dogshit stock picks. This weed and penny stock pump has “retarded new investor” written all over it. This was shit I thought of 4 years ago when I was still in high school beating my dick to porn on iFunny. 

These speds would never survive another Lumber Liquidators dump, MSFT 3/13/20 210c, another Rona Crash, the Quad Witching Hour, or PRPL earnings plays. 

They lose $10 of their allowance and blame the hedge funds like we give a shit. I just want my old retarded safe haven back and I miss being able to call people autistic. This new influx of sensitive smoothbrains is destroying our sub’s culture and I say we call for a new Paper Trading Competition. 🚀🚀🚀

# [4 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-11-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to add to Wednesday’s record high close

> * Dow futures rose Thursday, one day after the 30-stock average hit an intraday all-time high in a volatile session and closed at a record. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Wednesday were unable to hold on to their all-time intraday highs and closed slightly lower.

> * The Labor Department is out at 8:30 a.m. ET with its weekly report on new jobless claims. Economists expect 760,000 filings for new unemployment benefits for last week. That would be down 19,000 from the prior week, which at 779,000 was the lowest initial claims reading since late November.

> * Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday monetary policy needs to stay “patiently accommodative” to support the economy that still faces challenges in the labor market. The employment picture is “a long way” from where it needs to be, the central bank chief told the Economic Club of New York.

*****

> # 2. PepsiCo beats expectations; Uber delivers mixed results

> * Earnings were once again a focus for investors. Disney leads the list of major companies reporting quarterly results after Thursday’s closing bell. Before the market opening, PepsiCo reported a fourth-quarter profit of $1.47 per share, a penny better than estimates. Revenue rose 8.8% to $22.46 billion, also exceeding expectations. PepsiCo shares fell slightly in the premarket.

> * Uber shares dropped 4% in Thursday’s premarket, the morning after the company reported a smaller-than-expected loss of 54 cents per share in the fourth quarter. However, revenue fell 16% to a lower-than-expected $3.17 billion. Uber’s ride-hailing business slowly recovered, while its delivery business boomed.

*****

> # 3. Cannabis stocks jump in a Reddit-fueled trade reminiscent of GameStop

> * Cannabis stocks were soaring as the Reddit crowd that spiked GameStop jumped in. Tilray shares surged nearly 51% on Wednesday, pushing the stock to a year-to-date gain of more than 670%. Not nearly as bet-against as GameStop, Tilray’s short interest was still equal to 22.5% of the shares available for trading, according to FactSet as of the end of January. Tilary added another 10% in Thursday’s premarket. Tilray is no stranger to a short-squeeze rally. The stock spiked more than 1,400% between July and September 2018, but those gains did not last.

*****

> # 4. Dating app firm Bumble set to begin trading after pricing IPO

> * When 31-year-old Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd takes her dating app company public Thursday, she’ll be noted not only for her youth but also as one of the few female founders to lead her firm to an IPO. Bumble, whose board comprises 73% women, priced its offering Wednesday evening at $43 per share, raising $2.2 billion and valuing Bumble at around $8 billion. The stock market response will act as a litmus test for companies founded by women, who account for just 7.4% of Fortune 500 CEOs. That’s an all-time high but still a staggeringly low.

I've been a longtime lurker on this sub since it was <1m degenerates, finally clicked the join button around Dec/Jan. It's great to see many new redditors take an interest in WSB, but for the love of Elon Musk, **READ THE POSTING GUIDELINES AND STOP MAKING THINGS UP!!!**

There is a case for GME, given the new CEO/CTO, console cycle, and massive short interest/short position (even at the real 42-43% SI and 21m SP). Those are factual events and numbers. What isn't the case are bagholders who have less of an understanding of the stock market than u/1r0nyman. It's one thing to hype up GME as a resurgent mecca in retail. It's another thing to **not understand how certain metrics are calculated, when/how data is reported, and blatantly make up numbers** because it fits a delusional reality where GME is going to be $10000/share. I'm not saying GME isn't ripe for another squeeze, but be reasonable. Think about what certain share prices mean and the odds it could ever reach such a height.

# Let me put it into context:

We all have opinions, and we can think the other degenerate's opinion is flat out dumb. But if your DD doesn't hold water, then it truly is dumb.

Some of you might remember me when I told you to hop on this tendie train at 9$ [when MSFT deal happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j7i28q/gme_launching_right_about_now_microsoft_agreement/), by [my DD about why GameStop is worth 138$](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jcjqba/gme_long_thesis_why_40_target_is_actually_a/) or by my other posts I've made here for months. As you've noticed, I LOVE THE STOCK.

I've held through -90% at the lowest to +10,000% at the highest and I continue holding. I'm down $300k from the ATH at this point and I don't fucking care because this whole thing is far from being over.

Now get these points through your thick head:

    
* **This is a fucking volatile stock.** 

This is how it goes: it shoots up, GME gang rejoices, a bunch of retards buys at the top. Then it crashes down for a while, 🌈🐻 keep blabbering about how the squeeze has squoze. Rinse and repeat. Every time it shoots up it does it more violently, the amplitude getting larger and larger. And every time it does there is a number of dickheads whining about not buying earlier:

""I wish I bought at $9..."" - when it shot up to $13, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $11..."" - when it shot up to $20, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $17..."" - when it shot up to $70, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $40..."" - when it shot up to $150, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $60..."" - when it shot up to $450, and them came down

**Being in GME gang was always about not caring about temporary swings, because in the end, the price always sets a new ATH**

I've seen this shit happening so many times since October that I just sit there and smile while history repeats itself and my porfolio swings 5-6 digits.

    
    
* **GME was never a squeeze play**, despite what a lot of you retards think. 

Read any DD more than a month old, the whole company is massively undervalued . Read about Ryan Cohen, a person who made a dog food company worth $45bn and who is a fucking shark, once he sets his mind to something he will never back down. Thanks to him we now have a star team assembled at GameStop formed of [Matt Francis, CTO, former Engineering Leader at AWS; Kelli Durkin, Senior Vice President of Customer Care, former Chewy’s Vice President of Customer Service; Josh Krueger, Vice President of Fulfillment former senior fulfillment roles at Amazon, Walmart, and QVC](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2021/02/03/gamestop-announces-three-new-hires) (do I need to mention Reggie Fils-Aimé of a fucking Nintendo?). I am a firm believer that Cohen will manage to grow GameStop at the very least to the size of Chewy ($45bn market cap). Guess what GME has? $4bn. That's 12x bagger and I'm being very conservative here.

**This is not about squeezing the hedge funds, this is about the company establishing it's true share price with wild swings along the way thanks to the 🌈🐻s**. The true price for me is (conservatively) the size of Chewy, which translates to $650. I know I said $138 in my previous DD a few months ago, but it was before all the recent news of Ryan Cohen taking over with his star-team.

MOASS was a cherry on top (and still is on the table), not the main play

Also, GameStop had a $6bn in revenue in 2019, Tesla had $24bn. Think about it for a moment
    
    

* **Short interest is still through fucking roof**. 

I know you're used to 100%+ SI and the new 41% number does not quite gets you off, but it's still fucking abysmal. VW, OSTK happened on less than 20%. Also keep in mind that this number is for 1/29, literally the top when a lot of shorts covered. It does not account for all the shorting that happened on the way down to $50 which I guaran-fucking-tee you was massive. Just wait and see the next report with increased SI, the shorts never learn.



**TL;DR:** GameStop is still undervalued. Conservative PT is $650, ambitious - $1200+ (assuming Ryan Cohen's success, which I don't doubt for a single moment). Short squeeze will last for a long time similar to $TSLA squeeze, with wild swings along the way - old shorts will cover, new ones will pile in because the bLoCkBuStEr narrative is still strong. This is still a risky gamble, no such thing as a sure bet, but the risk\reward is massively skewed to the upside

If you have short-dated calls you might be fucked, might be not. If you have shares or LEAPS, just get away from screens for a while if it's unbearable for you, but ultimately you'll be fucking loaded. This is one of those situations when in a year or two the price is $3000+ and you post your cost basis of $70 and all the paper-handed bitches in the comments scream ""WOW HE FUCKING HELD GRATZ""

**Positions:** some Apr 40c, some Apr 200c and a shitload of Jan 2023 950c. Will dump the remaining cash into 2023 calls at open"

lg5kmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg5kmw/umc_and_other_less_glamorous_semiconductor/,$UMC and other “less glamorous” semi-conductor manufacturers will likely do well in the coming months,120,40,2021-02-09 23:22:26,"With stock shortages on many different nodes from the likes of Samsung, TSMC and even Intel (which has a very dominate position in the server-space), there have been problems getting various products to market. Entire automative factories have been shut-down due to constraints on on getting chips in their vehicles. This phenomenon was predicted to be less unrelenting, but recently, many manufacturers (particularly Microsoft regarding the Xbox Series X) have basically admitted that they simply can’t sell their products due to the limits on chips designer’s limits of wafers of a given process node.

As a rundown, Intel, TSMC are the “big fabs” that you hear about in advanced computing technology. AMD uses TSMC, but AMD is on a 4-front battle with its console, desktop CPU, server CPU, and GPU market, as well as mobile chips. Essentially, any company in the position of AMD (even Intel and Nvidia are facing this problem) that can sell its products like hotcakes, but can’t get the nodes they need for their top-of-the-line products is bound by what they ordered months or years in advance. It is very likely that this will resonate as a prime reason to use lesser-utilized nodes by other companies for various other components (Internet-of-things, 5G etc...)

Essentially, chip *designers* are being constrained by their ability to gain access to various chips. But the fabs behind these “big-name” computing technology companies that you’re used to hearing about are essentially bidding with eachother for these same advanced process nodes, kicking smaller (and by *smaller* I don’t mean *small*, I mean literally anyone that isn’t trying to +1 extremely advanced computing products).

TSMC is producing process nodes that perform very well. Except, their supply is very limited. Keep in mind, Chip *designers* will often times outsource their designs to be made on different nodes. Intel uses TSMC, even though it has its own fabs, for instance. And Intel also rents out their own fabs.

This is where $UMC and various other lesser-known semi-conductor manufacturers come in. They will likely fill the massive demand for *any* process node that chip designers can get their hands on to fill the unprecedented shortages which seem to be pushed back farther and farther.

Eventually, your average, run-of-the-mill devices will need chips in them, and they are likely to have difficulties working with more well-renowned chip-makers to actually put their architectures on a given node. In general, chip-manufacturers have had the lion’s share of consistent performance over the past year due to increasingly innovative products from high-profile designers. It’s quite possible many device-manufacturers will opt not to use larger semi-conductor fabs as big-names like AMD, NVidia, and even Apple are competing for the same nodes.

At the very least, a lot of the previous success of semi-conductor manufacturers and chip designers may potentially trickle down to lesser-utilized and less glamorous fabs.

There’s already a precedent that very specialized chip designs will often go to these manufacturers, and now that the big names literally are fighting for these advanced nodes, many chipmakers have used Global Foundries and other “less sexy” fabs to meet demand for chips that they *need* now.

In general, companies with semiconductor fabs are likely to do well, simply due to the fact that the world in general needs more wafers, substrates etc... as infrastructure becomes more complex, digitally.

I recommend researching semi-conductor manufacturers who have long been underdogs.

**This is not financial advice, I am 🦍 and I am currently sauteeing crayons in a pan**

EDIT: [semi-wiki](https://semiwiki.com/) has very in-depth descriptions of various companies, many of which you’re familiar with. If you’re new to learning about computer hardware, and chip-manufacturing, it’s a great place to due your own research to learn the mechanics of chip-design, material sourcing, architectures, photolithographic techniques, recent innovations, etc..."

Sherman started a turnaround of Gamestop when he first took over April 2019. He cut the dividend, began consolidation (cut some fatty stores), and began debt reduction. COVID threw a wrench in this because he didn't move online nearly fast enough. 

When Burry first invested in GME, there was a reason. What reason? He spoke with Sherman about his plans and thought they wouldn't just survive, but thrive. Cohen also had a similar situation, and later of course he got involved. Sherman listens to both, and in their letters to him they basically tell him where he fucked up and how to move Gamestop forward. 

Fils-Aimé the Nintendo guy that likes to turn companies around is added to the board. He turns stuff around as a hobby and is an insanely good marketer. This is shown in particular with his Nintendo of America endeavors. u/kitrosreddit told me not to forget about Reggie so I didn't this time (sorry to the 100ish people that saw this a few days ago) 

Next up we see the Microsoft deal. Although exact numbers aren't available that I can find, Gamestop will be receiving a royalty from gaming equipment sold via Microsoft. Microsoft is also expanding Gamestop's inventory on the inside and employees will use Microsoft software to run the stores. Microsoft doesn't want Gamestop to fail, nor will they let them. With 27% of new games bought at Gamestop and 40% of used games bought there, Microsoft saw an excellent way to try and compete this console cycle. 

We recently saw Gamestop's holiday earnings. With a yearly revenue of roughly $7 bil, they were unprofitable this year. The current P/S ratio makes no sense unless it is expected to go out of business (good luck) or that it will not grow significantly over the coming years (lol). However, this is expected to change with earnings starting in March. They are expected to continue to be profitable moving forward as well. Gamestop still has roughly $500 mil in debt. How are they going to pay this off!!!??? Liquidating stores and consolidation. This was a Cohen continuation idea that Sherman had started, just without the vision to make it succeed. A small stock offering (let's say 2%) would also leave them in an excellent financial situation. Additionally, we have the 300% YOY online sales increase, which accounted for over 30% of total sales. This is only expected to increase moving forward. While overall sales decreased by 3% YOY, inefficient stores were cut out of the picture. Comparative store sales increased by 5% YOY, but this was even stagnated due to state restrictions on 'nonessential' businesses. Places that had significantly fewer COVID numbers had over 30% YOY growth. 

Next, we have the Chewy powerhouses joining the board of directors. Out with the old, in with the new. Even though most directors were acquired in 2020, these new additions add incredible value to the company. Sherman listens to Cohen. Cohen and friends had some focuses at Chewy that led to insane amounts of profit. They focused on cutting costs and maximizing efficiency. Expect the same for Gamestop. This was something that can be effectively implemented with all the new leadership. All ears are on Cohen and his ideas to make Gamestop a 1 stop gaming shop. 

Most recently were the adds on 2/3/21 Francis: That AWS engineering guy that's now heading technology!? Nice. Durkin: Customer service VP from Chewy is now in charge of Gamestop's customer service!? Fuck yes Chewy has insanely good customer service. Krueger: Big filler boi from Amazon et all now running e-commerce fulfillment!? Dope.

Conservative price target: $200 by mid 2021 with little hype and absent a short squeeze

Tldr: Idc about a squeeze or hype but I like the stock. 

But what do I know I'm literally retarded and not a financial advisor... positions 5200 shares GME, 52x covered calls sold exp 2/12, 50x calls bought exp 2/26, a few bucks in cash waiting for a drop if it happens. Tell if I'm wrong somewhere with sources linked please and thank you.

Edit: As requested, my average cost is roughly $60 after buying back in late last week. I had original shares at an average buy in of about $30 assigned to covered calls on 1/29. I believed the company had too much downside at those prices.

GME is a game at the casino. You should have learned the rules before you sat down to play.

We quad witched and GUH'ed a lot of money down the drain without blaming the cabal of global imperialist hedge funds for illegal activity.

A short squeeze is TA activity, not DD. It is fast and unpredictable and volatile. A lot of squeezes last less than a day. 2 main ingredients:

High short interest.

**Positive news.**

Positive news changes the DD, causing shorts to cover scaring other shorts into covering creating a TA event.

It lasts until enough scared shorts have covered.

This is what a short squeeze looks like:

https://centerpointsecurities.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Short-Squeeze-Trading.jpg

GME had:

A large short interest. (140%)

Positive news. (new leadership, new consoles, microsoft interest, pivot to e-commerce, positive articles on cash flows, etc)

Shorts started getting scared, and began to cover. Lenders recalled stocks to sell at the inflated prices, but at over 100% short that could actually briefly further increase prices as they unwind.

Here is what the GME stock looked like.

https://i.imgur.com/siP9YfZ.png

The short squeeze lasted an unusually long time, due to a long dtc and FOMO retail investors extending it. (That's you, diamond hand bag holders @300)

There may be a large amount of new short interest generated from it.

There still needs to be NEW positive DD to create a second short squeeze. 

Shorts interest is just short interest until there is positive news.

""The most entertaining outcome is the most likely."" - Papa Musk

This is not financial advice, I just made this up with my primitive ape brain. This analysis is not based on any financial wisdom and you should always do your own diligence and research for any personal financial decisions.

I am basing my analysis on a theory based on the quote above by one of my favorite guys Elon Musk. So what long term outcome is the most entertaining in this case? How about TSLA decides to buy a heavy portion of GameStop? Sounds crazy? Good, let's see where this goes. This is what I'm dubbing the ""Planet of the Apes"" theory.

The case for why TSLA can and should acquire GameStop to make a lot of money.

Long Rant:
So there are two conflicting realities right now, retarded geniuses have crippled big hedge funds while not really doing any damage, they got really rich while losing it all. Gamestop is a worthless company that is actually fundamentally able to pay their bills, has locations all over the country and unlimited loyalty and PR from a massive online fanbase through a once in a lifetime event like this. The price shouldn't be so high but we need to restrict buying volume to deflate the momentum. The shorts have already covered their positions while also doubling down and digging themselves deeper.

One of these realities will become true at some point soon. You may have already made up your mind but I'm still holding and waiting. I'm not a fanboy, I've made risky moves before. Actually read headlines about companies that I had thousands in announce bankruptcy and get delisted. With diversification your gains are still more likely to outweigh your losses in the LONG RUN. Meaning investment doesn't happen over the course of days but rather weeks, months, or even years.💎💎✊✊ 

We all know Musk is a visionary who is unafraid to enter a new, risky venture. He's done it all, payment platforms, electric cars, outer space, even UNDERGROUND! The man is the the king of chasing big ideas in unlikely markets and that's why he's so cool. He makes EV-ATVs and flamethrowers for fun. And he hasn't been shy about supporting us during this time. I think it's fair to say he likes the stock.

Now let's compare TSLA and GME. TSLA has a $800 BILLION market cap. GME has a $4.7 BILLION market cap, currently down from over $20 Billion a few days ago. So they could be bought right now at a 20% discount from their all time high. Now, I'm more retarded than most apes, but to me, that sounds like a pretty good deal for an opportunity to turn around GME by logically pivoting to e-commerce, e-sports, cloud gaming and start to compete with Microsoft and Sony and every other big name in this massive market space, while gaining a massive amount of customer loyalty and support for their other products. This would further diversify TSLAs revenue sources and allow for a lot of really fun marketing opportunities like Tesla racing video game, or console for example.

Now of course, this is fiction. I made it up. But let me tell you a retarded reason why that doesn't matter. This is a real thing that happened to me a while ago and no amount of doubting from anyone will change this totally real experience I had. Here goes, I was sitting in a taco bell and I ordered a $2 meal deal for my broke ass which was an awesome deal because you got a 5 layer burrito, a drink, and a bag of Doritos. And as I was sitting there in my favorite restaurant, admiring the genius that came up with Baja blast mountain dew, and how genius ideas like that are worth millions. And as I was eating a Dorito I realized, this is just a taco shell, broken into a small triangle, with Dorito powder. They should just partner and make a Dorito taco, people will go crazy for it. And then I immediately went about my life as normal. Over a year later Taco Bell announced the Dorito loco taco and completely saved the company with that one idea that I had and never shared with anybody.

What does any of this mean? I have the power to make up crazy things and they actually come true on at least one or two occasions in the past. 

TLDR: I like the stock. I like Elon and I think he likes the stock too. TSLA buying GME potentially means big gains for everyone and is the most entertaining possibility which makes it the most likely. I'm actually a savaant as proven by my totally real taco bell story. Holding GME 25 shares avg cost $198. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕🌖🌗🌘🌑🌒🌓🌔🌕"

GME has the potential to hit the Pros we wanted. Its still there and Ill show you why. Im no financial expert but the game is always going to change. 

PROS:

\-Gamestop has a new board, 

\-Gamestop isnt going bankrupt.

\-Gamestop has made a deal with microsoft on digital sales

\-The people on the board of gamestop are part of a successful company!

\-Its low now, but things are probably going to change by a standard especially with gamestop going into new directions as a buisness.

\-Theres no expiry date

The Cons

\- You sell, you will lose the money you put into it.

\-The stock wont hit the value you hoped it would hit

The Pros here: Hedge funds counted on gme to go out of business but its not, its still in buisness. Im holding because I believe in the community even if people are being toxic, this is my first stock I think Personally right now holding is the best move on the table right this moment. and as it gets low buy up some more. Because as it stand gme has a lot to gain for the unexpected turn of events its facing. With a new board of people and people who have held success as well."

I feel like I need to say something so people don't $ROPE thinking they have no other choice but to pray for a squeeze.

I need people to understand that not selling (depending on the stock) is also losing because of OPPURTUNITY COST. I am not telling you to sell if this was fun money for you, but I see people taking out fucking loans to play a momentum run that prior to this only ranged between $3-$25 per share for the last 4 years. 

Yes I understand Cohen can make changes to make GME a successful businesses, but understand it can take years. If you bought at 300-500 you will basically NEED a short squeeze to get out of those positions.  If your paper loss is already -75%, than ya, probably just hold, but do what is best for YOU.

The heavy realized loss that I took from my last GME trade hurt a lot, but I took my remaining capital and made a good chunk of my loss back up already (BA and MSFT). Sometimes you need to be proactive and not wait/pray for a short squeeze to happen. 

For example: If I have a position in AAPL and for whatever reason it drops 30%, I wont sell it since I know it will eventually come back and just collect dividends during the wait because of AAPL's FUNDAMENTALS. 

People need to understand that GME was a high risk high reward play. If you believe that this stock was manipulated, then what makes you think they will stop now? If you are confident in your position then hold.

I pray that a short squeeze does happen since I sympathize with people that lost their fucking life savings on this play, but at the end of the day you need to do what is best for YOU."

Recap. 

•Melvin/hedge funds short GameStop. Twice. 

•Xbox/Microsoft GM becomes acting GME CEO- 

•Chewy founder CEO buys in/submits prospectus to Board regarding GME transformation Microsoft/GameStop collaboration is announced

•➡️ *it was held back that they get revenue from partnership with Xbox game pass* ⬅️•

Now-we also have Elon and Mark weighing 
 in with expert advice (hey-I’m not a millionaire so they know more than me) 

And add in the market crashing, silver spambots, margins canceled, social media shut downs and all of a sudden limit buying in shares the day after all time highs. 

Very. Suspicious. To say the least. 

next?  

We know what’s next. 

GME magically recovers as the darling of Wall Street while we got manipulated again. 

But. The story takes a turn. Billboards start appearing across the country. Melvin can’t take a drive to the local Wendy’s anymore without seeing “GME to the moon”. Finland buys in. Saudia Arabia buys in. Japan buys in. The mother f@cking Times Square has GME to the moon lit up for the world to see. 

This is uncharted territory here folks. I know what Wall Street wants to happen. The media is pumping it right now. They have DFV in their beady sights. They want to see us fall. Again. 
But. It’s a new world. 2008 and the VW short squeeze didn’t have Twitter. 2008 didn’t have an army of the working class sitting at their computers figuring out that Wall Street is not the God like money figure we have been told to be believe. The reality is that the Hedge Funds that “protect” peoples retirement are really just going off of insider knowledge and the ability to manipulate the market in mass. 

It’s not 2008 anymore. I think the world has it right and they see that WSB/DFV made a damn wise call. They are the ones trying to hold the share price up every day facing down the hedge funds with sheer determination to be validated and paid. 

What they have attempted to do is criminal. It’s not 2008. 
The world is legitimately watching and showing support in this in a way I don’t think anybody expected. Especially in 2021. 

I’m holding. I don’t want to. This isn’t an example of my normal trading-having every single trick used against you.. to the point that it’s simply pure lunacy that we are witnessing.

To actually want to question a member of WSB for market manipulation. Seriously.

I cannot in good faith sell and leave everyone standing alone trying to do the right thing. Ive already lost the money. 
My retail money did the DD. They just cheated.

One missing piece of the puzzle. The company (GME) didn't talk at all on what happened in the stock market. Although large majority of [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) apes are gamers, the company preferred to stay silent. I would like to talk about it also here. (Edit: I thought it was well know, [Microsoft Official Partnership with GameStop from the official website](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/))

# GameStop didn't say a word about the stock market events, why? Can it be a very tight contract for a future acquisition by Microsoft?

**Their silence** is the main point here. **Why they didn't talk?** They were in the simple position to make a simple interview that was going be seen by all the world in stick and say: ""*we are looking forward to innovate. We can adapt our business bla bla new technologies and bla bla new directors*"". That's it, and that's obvious. What kind of company is not going to believe something like that?

Why in the hell GME didn't talk at all? they were surely able to say something vague and rhetorical in case they didn't really want to support us. They were also surely contacted by the press, and invited in some cool TV show. **It was their choice. They actively chose to not talk**. Maybe they thought that this is a bubble and they didn't want to make it bigger, still they were totally able to say bla bla innovation bla bla Cohen bla bla future. Or they were preparing some financial report and they were obligate by some boomer law to not talk at all. Or, maybe, they have a contract, an agreement with some other more powerful entity that is forbidding GME to talk on certain topics / under certain circumstances.

Let's imagine the last one. **Let's imagine that** **GME cannot talk due to some contract boundaries**. Contract whit whom? I would say **Microsoft**. Microsoft is powerful, big, rich, and they are partners already. Better: **strategic partners**. *What if this partnership is the first step for an acquisition?*

I know, anti-trust regulations can have something to say about it

That is what I see:

* **Blackrock** (I love Blackrock, high growth + 2% dividends annualized? lovely), **Michael Burry** (yeah, the guy of The Big Short), and [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/), all of them purchased a big chunk of GME. Why? did some of them hear some interesting rumour? Did they smell something that we didn't smell?
* New CEO. **Ryan Cohen** join the board to innovate the business completely. Why? someone else suggested this? He wanted to do it by himself? Press is pushing the narrative that Cohen put one foot out of his bed one morning and said: ""*I wanna be the CEO of GameStop*"". Randomly?
* Strategic **Partnership with Microsoft**. I don't know which one comes first, if this or Cohen, I guess some ape can check meticulously. You know how does it sound to me? It sounds like the first step to do an acquisition. Among all the solutions Microsoft chose to partener with GameStop. Ok. And if the partnership goes very well, what will happen? they will keep staying just partners?
* The value of GME shares just skyrocketed and **GameStop didn't say anything about it.** With no reason? They decided to not support the internet riot made basically by gamers or people in target (age / income / demography / interests / lifestyle). From a Marketing perspective doesn't sound right to me. Press, journalists, social media, TVs they wanted a comment from GameStop. Everybody was screaming for the official point of view from the company, and GameStop decided to stay silent. *Usually companies pay good money to go on TV*, this time it was going to be free advertising. So why they refused free advertising (free money)? For one good reason surely. What reason can it be? Must be a good one. A contract maybe? Yeah, it can be. And with whom? a contract with a big one. A big one like Microsoft? Maybe.
* The **average gamer** is getting older, and richer. Every guy born in the late 80s now has a job (should have one I hope). Good customer base, growing in numbers, growing in income, cannot go down = secure income for a company. ***How would you get them all (all gamers in the world) if you were Microsoft?*** Acquisition. The acquisition of a gaming company I would say can be one of the easiest, safest, fastest way available to get a big piece of this customer segment (gamers).

The euphoric feeling you had when you saw GME hit $500 intraday, with dreams of it hitting  $1,000 while yelling,”I’m gonna cooom!!” and the depression accompanying it when it hit $80 yesterday, while you glance at those big, heavy fucking bags in your diamond hands, are nothing new for GME gang. 

It happened in October when it was halted based on MSFT news and then promptly fell back down to earth.  It happened in November/December RC penned the letter to the BoD, run up to earnings where it dropped so hard after omnichannel.  Then RC made a filing to up his stake mid December.  We all know when he tweeted 🥜 around 1/15 opex week.   

After every major drop, GME or RC drops something to quell those doubts. Case in point, they announced 3 new hires today. 

Most of the GME DD prior to the squeeze was that the catalyst for the squeeze would most likely occur in late March/April.  I still stand by that.  

The run up to 1/15 and the subsequent para move was mainly driven by the incredible amount of GME options exp then and the gamma squeeze initiated by retail subsequently sustained by the larger hedge funds.  It always felt inorganic, which was why most current bag holders expected more.  Yes it could’ve reached $1000, 2000, 5000 even - had RH and other brokerages not royally fucked up and fucked every retail trader. Shorts may have covered through redemptions from ETFs with high concentrations of GME shares, they might have covered in other ways.  Who gives a shit.  The fact exists that there are still shorts.  We’ve learned and seen all the dirty tricks in the book thrown our way.  We now know what to be wary about.  We’re not missing our second shot.  
 
Short Squeeze has always been the cherry on top of the GME DD.   The DD was always that it was an undervalued company.  How undervalued is anyone’s guess.  

If restrictions get lifted, and volatility drops a bit, who’s to say gamma squeezes can’t happen again and ride the tendie train every Friday? We seen how TSLA went.  I understand two different industries, valuations, etc.? But gamma squeezes are real and both have asymmetric forward return profile. TSLA rode our FDs like a motherfucker to the moon all last yr. 

If you’ve lost money, you can cut your losses and do what is best for you and your family.  I’m not here to tell you to hold or sell or whatever you want to do with your money/financial decisions.  You can also hold to see how it will play out - you don’t lose if you don’t sell, because there are more catalysts to come (March earnings, 100M shelf offering, share buyback, expansion, LT roadmap).  Again, you do you. 

Just remember, for every high that GME has hit, it’s gone even higher than that in subsequent peaks.  I do think it will go higher than $500 at some point in the near future.  Gut feeling. Call me retarded. Call me crazy.  But that’s what everyone told me when I went in on GME in October."

I know I may get downvoted for this... but at this point honestly **fuck the squeeze.**

This could be a lifelong hold into some serious generational wealth. I'm in it for the qualitative now.

**For all you retards who can’t read and are just 💎🙌 🦍🍌... 🧠= 💎🙌∞**

Look at what’s happened today alone...

Matt Francis, new GameStop Chief Tech Officer formerly from AWS, lead engineer. Think about that for sec... The guy who is responsible for Amazon's web services. Amazon IS fucking web services, well, it's also fulfilment of course. This is still retail we’re talking about.

Josh Krueger, new GameStop VP of Fulfillment formerly from Amazon, Walmart, QVC. I shouldn't need to tell you why this is a big move. Looks like the guy has literally been growing in the same exact fucking direction as the industry. Next in line for him, Gamestop

Kelli **MF** Durkin, new GameStop Sr VP of Customer Care, previously from CHEWY. Everything people love about Chewy that made it such a lovable brand comes from their customer service dpt. They'll leave the UXUI up to Matt and his team while Kelli’s team keeps on making the customer’s come back to buy more. Don’t underestimate the power of good customer service. I’ve straight up switched ISP’s because of this.

Now, combine this dream team, with the (un)expected possibility of Ryan Cohen becoming CEO. This really is some Avengers End Game shit.

This fucking super team could really turn GameStop into the one-stop-game-shop everything gaming related. I’m talking build-a-pc centers with the next-gen GPU’s/CPUs hitting exclusively GME first (re: fulfillment), online streaming community (aka Twitch/Amazon), sharing revenue on cloud-based game streaming platforms (like MSFT GamePass), combined with a dedication to their customer. **That’s fucking YOU, YOU RETARD!**

Okay, now for a very light amount of quantitative speculation. Imagine holding your current amount of shares, the stock eventually hits $400 and it splits 8:1. Now, with 8x more shares you slowly climb up to $1000. Maybe it splits again along the way, who fucking knows, you do the math. Yeah it’s that same hypothetical math you’ve been doing the past week only... 1x your current share amount. Kinda makes you want to get more shares.

Obligatory, I am most certainly a retard, so this is not advice so please don’t listen to me. Only a fool on a rant."

Last quarter, CRSR doubled expected EPS amidst a run from $20-$51. CRSR has been consolidating for months between mid 30s and low 40s, with a break out last week touching $50 before the market slide. They priced a secondary offering from an insider lock up at $35, providing a strong floor (thus my short puts at $35. Shout out theta gang.) 80% of the float is locked up til March, short interest is fairly high, and Corsair should have its best quarter ever.

Hope to see more DDs instead of cultposting. Love you guys 🚀,344,74,2021-02-03 20:15:09,"TLDR: Brief recap - fundamentals are still fun, and may be getting better. Upgraded Ryan Chewy + Reggie Nintendo, MSFT deal with rev share, pc building kiosk 1.5 store, console cycle, e-commerce growth and pivot. Probably missed some. Now with free worldwide exposure.

I am not trying to gatekeep whatever you guys want to post, but remember the time when people actually called GME stores to ask about pc kiosk (with recordings even)? Those type of posts are probably more useful if we want GME to moon. I think we all prefer the confirmation bias from more detailed fundamental DDs like those than posts about people holding the line. Maybe it's just me, but I would prefer people from all over the world knowing about how GME is a value play than a short squeeze play. Anyway, here's a brief recap on the 'fundamentals' to hopefully bring more fundamental DDs back.

**Upgraded Ryan Chewy + Reggie Nintendo**

I think we know who Ryan is. In short, Ryan grew Chewy by like, a lot, using little capital. Now Chewy competes against AMZN, etc. I don't have pets since I can't even take care of myself so I have not used Chewy, but an edge Chewy has against AMZN is apparently their customer service. All these growing Chewy means Ryan is now more experienced and has more connections than his Chewy days aka upgraded Ryan with bigger rockets.

You know who else is all about the customers? Reggie Nintendo. If you tards don't want to read, there are videos out there about Reggie and how his customer-oriented approach is pretty critical to Nintendo's success in freedom land. 

Note: I have seen some people saying how they did not really like GME in the past. Maybe Ryan + Reggie can change that.

**Microsoft revenue sharing**

GME will share revenue from all digital content: DLC, full games, microtransactions, xbox game pass, etc. This applies to both new and pre-owned systems. If someone bought the xbox at Walmart and then sold it to GME, GME would get a share of revenue on that system once it is resold. That's a pretty big deal itself, but here's a bigger implication: This is an incentive for GME to push MSFT systems. Will Sony, etc have a similar agreement with GME to mitigate this preferential treatment for xbox?

**PC building kiosk**

Know microcenter? I don't, because there is not one store near me. But from other DDs, apparently to get high end pc stuffs you need to either buy them online or drive hours to a microcenter. With the spread of GME stores, it doesn't take much to see how much advantage they have. Older DDs have people literally asking GME employees about pc kiosk 1.5 store. Now imagine this:

\- All the used parts they could offer to people wanting to upgrade frequently

\- Ease of building a pc + all in one package. The thing about building a pc is you really need to make sure the parts are right for each other and right for you or risk getting ripped off. PC building kiosk means you don't have to know about ALL the specs to get a suitable pc. Combined with purchasing games, accessories, special deals for powerup members, collectibles, third party exclusives, etc all in one application or location for sYnErGy and you get 🚀. Why go elsewhere when you can have everything in one place? Best part is you don't even need to build it yourself. Someone else can eat that thermal paste for you. Worry about bending a CPU pin? Not really your problem at the pc kiosk.

\-  Want further synergy? Logistical advantage with having a store near you and knowing what's popular. With the right data, they may really cut down on the waiting times for a buyer on popular parts if not outright branded as 'never out of stock'.

**Conclusion**

GME's turnaround story has not changed. GME just got an added worldwide exposure. Is $500 a fair valuation based on fundamentals alone? Maybe not, but with the focus on digital growth, it wouldn't surprise me if GME gets a tech-like valuation. Like one of our favorite analysts once said, GME is a disruptive EV company after all. Anyway, I got lazy and left out lots of other good stuff. If you want more, just look into older DDs. The sources are in those, too.

Position GME @ $30+. Never sold. Also holding some CRSR.

What about the squeeze?"

I love ford, my first car I personally bought was a Ford Fusion. Microsoft wanted to partner with Ford ($F) but had to go with General Motors ($GM) because Ford already was talking to Google ($GOOG).

Position Disclosure: 20 $F 11$ calls for 2/5, 6 $IDEX 5$ calls 3/19

There's a fireside chat this Thursday where they lay out their EV strategy but here's why I'm in safe calls

1. Ford outsells NIO and TSLA byyy farrrr!
2. Partnership with Rivian isn't forgotten and a team committed for a futuristic EV design (more people like how the All-Electric Ford F150 looked compared to the Tesla Cybertruck (and won it in a tug-of-war battle recently) 
3. GM is trading at more than 4x the price of F (buying Nikola and faking a EV Hummer video)
4. Back in 2014, the Ford navigation was using $MSFT Cortana's voice for their entertainment / engagement. I'm sure $MSFT wanted to partner with Ford but had to settle something like $GM because it was already talking with $GOOG (which has most chance of creating driverless cars).
5.  Ford unlocked it's CANbus that year and let developers go to town with their apps. For a moment their cars were used by $UBER and some private researchers in their driverless fleet

It's not gonna move to $50 but it definitely has potential to reach $20 imo. The price action is slow so many of the contracts (at the money) are cheap."

NASA selected Nokia exclusively to build the first cellular network on the moon. 

[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/20/talking-on-the-moon-nasa-and-nokia-to-install-4g-on-lunar-surface](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/20/talking-on-the-moon-nasa-and-nokia-to-install-4g-on-lunar-surface)

First, in regards to Nokia’s business. Nokia, unfortunately, doesn’t manufacturer phones anymore. Nokia sold the right to produce Nokia branded phones to HMD Global while retaining the right to have some input. Nokia’s current business concentrates on mobile networks such as 5G, network infrastructures, and cloud services. In other words, Nokia business pertains to the most basic component of our modern civilization. Especially so the Post-COVID world where networking is even more important than before. Think of the Tesla cars. They are connected to AT&T cellular networks which are built by Nokia. Nokia will be leading the networks that would eventually enable automation. And when that happens, Nokia will have a continuous revenue stream. 

[https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g](https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g)

Nokia is leading mobile networks with 27% of the world (excluding China) market share of 4G and 5G. It currently holds more than 3000k patents for 5G. Nokia other major competitors are Ericson, Huawei, and ZTE. Some countries of the Western hemisphere and the G7 banned Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE from operating in their countries. I suspect this will continue in the future. Leaving us with only Nokia and Ericson. But couldn’t a Mega-Cap such as Google or Tesla somehow eliminate NOK and ERIC? NOK holds more than 3000 patents already. So there is a strong barrier of entry into such a business. That won’t happen unless Nokia licences a patent for such a company. In this hypothetical scenario, the Mega-Cap would have to acquire Nokia. Which in turn will raise the price of the stock. I think this is the case that is similar to MSFT under Ballmer’s where the stock price was stagnant for many years. But slowly surged under Nadella. Though given the catalyst of COVID-19, I think the surge will happen quicker with NOK.

At 4.53 a share. NOK P/E ratio is 30.81x. Which is a small discount in comparison with the S&P 500 which has P/E ration of about 39x. This establishes Nokia not only as a growth stock but also as a value stock. The lowest that NOK dropped to was 2.34. Which happened back in March. At the current price, I believe that NOK is well within the margin of safety. 

With that being said, there are some problems that should be addressed. The income trend in the past few years is problematic. But this can offset by the fact that NOK has contracts well into the future with many nations states and private companies that should generate ample income until NOK is able to eliminate Huawei and ZTE and in turn, dominate the market (With Ericson). Also, Nokia is spening billions on research 

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-proximus/nokia-wins-5g-contract-from-proximus-luxembourg-idUSKBN28P0WJ 

The second complication is that Biden or other G7 leaders could potentially reverse Trump’s ousting of Huawei and ZTE. I don’t think this is likely. But it’s certainly a possibility. But even if it happens. Nokia will still have a big market share. And 100% market share of the moon and will always have a priority over Huawei and ZTE for government projects for reasons of national security. Also, there is a substantial amount of money spent on R&D which will I believe will be a catalyst in the future surge in NOK.

It should be worth noting that just one day after RH banned NOK, Blackrock released an amendment to their ownership of NOK. Increasing their shares by  21,140,777 shares.

Even though at this point Blackrock owns 5% of practically everything. The increase is a good question. 

Now you might ask me why not Ericson? ERIC is also a good stock. But I see more value in NOK. Also, the fact the NOK is working on 1 Terabit per second internet, and that it will bring 4G to the moon, and the fact that Nokia is #1 by patterns give it an edge in innovative growth. 

Final words: GME to the moon and pigs get slaughtered."

*Redefining gaming, eSports, and streaming*

Company Overview

Corsair Gaming is an American computer hardware and peripherals company founded in 1994 and headquartered in California.

They acquired Elgato Gaming in 2018 to expand to the streaming gear market, Origin PC and SCUF gaming in 2019 to expand into the custom-built PC systems and console controllers markets, respectively, and during 2020 they acquired Gamer Sensei and EpocCam, and partnered with Pipeline to grow into the gaming and streaming coaching market.

Corsair went public on September 23, 2020, with its IPO priced at $17, valuing the company at about $1.3B.

Understanding the Business

**Value Proposition**

Corsair provides specialized, high-performance gear for gamers and streamers. Their products are designed to provide speed and reliability for competitive gaming, high quality content for streamers, and powerful PC components that allows gamers to run modern games smoothly.

**Revenue Streams**

Currently, Corsair groups its product offering into two segments: gamer and creator peripherals and gaming components and systems.

Gamer and Creator Peripherals:

which represents around 25% of net revenue, includes gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets, streaming gear, and high performance console controllers.

Gaming Components Systems:

which represents around 75% of net revenue includes computer cases, power supply units (PSU), high performance memory products (40% of net revenue), and custom-built gaming systems.

Acquisitions and Partnerships:

During 3Q 2020 Corsair acquired Gamer Sensei, a gaming coaching platform, EpocCam, an app that allows iPhones to serve as a webcam, and partnered with Pipeline, a course-based education platform for streamers.

Industry

**Market Size**

According to Jon Peddie Research, the global gaming and streaming gear markets is expected to reach $40B by the end of 2020. Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1.05% CAGR until 2022. However, during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10% year-over-year.

Additionally, DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video-game coaching market surpasses $1B.

**Industry Fundamentals**

Growth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals.

Popularity of gaming is increasing:

According to Newzoo, there are an estimated 2.7B gamers worldwide, which are expected to spend $159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.3% CAGR to exceed $200B by 2023. PC and console gaming represents 51% of the total market, and mobile gaming 49%. Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market.

Tech-driven improvements in game quality:

Advances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences. This in turn, places increased demand on high-performance computing hardware.

Increasing gaming and streaming engagement:

Some interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks’ State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include:

* On average, video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games
* More than 38% of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves
* Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming, missed sleep is the most pervasive
* Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18-25 year olds.

**The eSports and streaming flywheel**

The rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers, sponsors, advertisers, team owners, and leagues to the eSports industry. Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high-performance gameplay, which in turn brings more viewers.

Competitive Landscape & Risks

**Competition**

The gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition, constant price pressure and rapid change. Competition across Corsair’s product offering includes:

**Gaming keyboards and mice** \- Logitech and Razer

**Headsets and related audio products** \-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX

**Streaming gear** \- Logitech and AVerMedia

**Performance controllers** \- Microsoft and Logitech

**PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases** \- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake

**High performance memory** \- G.Skill, HyperX, and Micron

**Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs** \- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower

**Competitive Strategy**

The company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.

**Market Share**

According to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.

**Growth Strategy**

Move into the Asia Pacific region:

The Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.

Complimentary acquisitions:

Corsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.

New Markets:

Uses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.

**Threat of New Entrants**

Because of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).

**Threat of Substitution**

A significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair’s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.

Cloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user’s system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.

According to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.

Additionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.

**Moats**

There does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair’s market share across their product offering.

**Other Relevant Risks**

Due to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.

By the way - There's been a ton of great technical analysis posted on the others in $BANG. the short squeeze on GME was real and a once-in-a-lifetime catch and i respect the hell out of it (and am also a sad bagholder of a few shares). It's just that the reasons for liking each of the stocks is different.

For better or worse - There was a post, I can’t find it but somebody else can, that showed the Robinhood dashboard that basically said the three most commonly held shares in any given account was, you guessed it $BB, $AMC, and $GGME.

As you know, Mark Cuban took a break from his busy calendar of being the least retarded Sharktank (No offense Daymond John, I have a soft spot for FUBU but my wife’s boyfriend no longer lets me rock it) and touching tips with Luka Doncic to [answer some questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey_everyone_its_mark_cuban_jumping_on_to_do_an/). Somebody asked why $GME was taking a nose dive off of Mt. Everest. Per Cuban -

*Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand. They created a RobinHood Dive. No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers. Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.*

*Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls. When that margin call happens, its brutal. They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.*

So. Two things re: $BB’s volatility.

# #1 Stopping buys (but allowing sales) tanked $BB, just like it tanked the other meme stocks. The tin foil apes can keep hawking about citadel etc. but the truth is likely that RObinhood is a tech-focused firm with shitty financial controls and even shittier risk management (GUH). Never ascribe to malice what is usually (and always with that shitshow of an excuse of a company) incompetence. Those dumbasses had a liquidity problem and solved it in the worst way possible. I hope their IPO fails and Vlad steps on a lego.

# #2. The current free fall of $GME / $AMC is still dragging $BB down. Why? What happens when people get margin called? Their entire account sells off some or all of a portion to satisfy the account. For those of you more discerning retards you know that the same thing happened to the hedge funds last week.

**It’s called** [**degrossing**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-30/a-reddit-army-descends-on-hedge-funds-chained-by-risk-models?sref=NJllTNWZ)**,** and is what caused the broader market to perform **inversely** to $BANG.

*BTW - It was really fantastic for me to watch my MSFT calls get fucked because of the morons of this sub. Satya Nadella daddy dicked earnings and the stock (along with the whole fucking market) was down…Live by the retard, die by the retard. But look at the bounceback this this week, when all the hedge funds looked around and said – Wait, J. Powell is still printing money like Zimbabwe and stocks only go up.*

***What do you think will happen once things calm down, the stimulus checks hit, and retail investors start looking around again for stocks they might like?***

So now what? Well, I REPEAT, **wrinkle that smooth brain of yours. What does #1 and #2 have to do with the** [actual reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4ehan/blackberry_dd/) **that #BANG GANG likes $BB?**

If you said – ""Huh, not much"" then congrats you’ve evolved slightly beyond a retarded monkey playing at a slot machine and shitting out sub-par memes.

**TLDR - $BB WENT DOWN TODAY BECAUSE OF FACTORS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO ITS STATUS AS A MEME STOCK. $BB $BANG GANG EATs WILD DAILY PRICE SWINGS FOR BREAKFAST. THE BIGGEST LESSON OF GME / AMC IS THAT RETARDS TOGETHER STRONG. ON THE OFF CHANCE THAT ENOUGH RETARDS BELIEVE, IT EVEN HAS A CHANCE TO ROCKET AGAIN IN THE SHORT TERM.**

**TLDR the TLDR - $BB #BANG GANG IS IN FOR THE LONG HAUL. WE’RE TERRAFORMING MARS, AND TAKING MATT DAMON WITH US.**

POS – balls deep in $BB shares, planning to buy more today

To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or ""counterfeit"" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.

Much of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.

One thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**Methodology**

I'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.

**The Code**

    from collections import defaultdict
    import time
    import requests
    POLYGON_API_KEY = '<ADD YOUR API KEY HERE>'
    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY
    
    data
    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))
    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm
    for line in f:
        parts = line.split('|');
        date = parts[0]
        ticker = parts[2]
        try:
            fails = int(parts[3])
            price = float(parts[5])
            value_of_fails = price * fails
            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)
        except ValueError:
            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')
            pass
    
    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():
        day = int(date[-2:])
        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))
        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])
        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] > 10000000, sorted_stocks)
        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:
            val_of_fails = data[0]
            num_fails = data[1]
            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))
            res = req.json()
            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':
                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))
                continue
            else:
                try:
                    volume = res['volume']
                except KeyError:
                    print(res)
            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)
            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100
            print('{: <6} ${: <5} {: <9} / {: < 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))

Here's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.

If everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value > 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.

I'll let y'all discuss what this means in the comments. Have Fun.

EDIT - Someone pointed out a mistake in my script. Fixed, and added a bit more data

EDIT 2 - For those without enough brain wrinkles / attention span to interpret this - There may have been shady shit in the first few days of Jan, but doesn't look like anything went on in the second week. Will need to wait till Feb 15 to see data in the last few weeks of Jan. I'll probably do some more analysis when that time comes"

QNX is generally regarded among engineers as the most advanced, stable and secure operating system in the world. As such it is trusted by the likes of NASA for mission critical operations, large nuclear power stations, factories, high-speed train control systems, and an endless array of embedded systems that require 0% downtime. QNX has earned its reputation and many in the computer industry believe that if QNX had chosen to compete with Microsoft and Apple and pursue a consumer sales route rather than an enterprise route, the world of computing would be generations ahead of where it is now. 

So what makes it so great? QNX is built on a micro-kernel, which means that the core component of the OS (the kernel) only contains the bare minimum amount of code that can provide the mechanisms required to run an operating system. The remaining functions in a typical kernel (Monolithic OS) such as the filesystem, device drivers, application IPC, etc. are instead run outside of the kernel in the user space. Essentially what this means is that the kernel is the only software executing at the most privileged hardware level and is therefore infinitely more secure and stable. Bad drivers, software or executions can’t bring it down.

Micro-kernels also allow for RTOS, which simply means an operating system with guaranteed consistency for how long it takes to accept and complete a task. For a real-life scenario, think about the ABS brakes on a car – they require mission critical specifications to occur in real-time or someone can die, so the system running them has to be able to guarantee the delivery, receipt and execution of messages in X amount of time or it does not qualify at RT.

The benefits of this architecture are too numerous to get into here, but one of the main benefit to RIM is its ability to execute multiple platform runtimes at the same time with high efficiency – this is why you can write an application in C/C++, Adobe AIR, Webworks HTML5, and Java and have them all run natively on BlackBerry 10. The benefit to developers and consumers here cannot be understated. Basically ANYONE with any amount of programming experience can make an app, from high-level web based UI’s to low-level 3D games.

QNX takes their design one step further by also offering POSIX support, which is a family of IEEE standards that helps maintain OS and software compatibility. Being a full POSIX system, and not partly POSIX, ensures it’s a lot easier to develop software for the QNX platform."

Imagine you’re John Chen. Sauntering down the hallway, with your 50 pound dick grazing the velveteen carpet with each step. You hear the guttural screams coming out of sales. You walk by the engineers, and gaze upon the latest widget as they kowtow before your bespecled grandeur. You hear about the customers who sing your praises, and the (much fewer) ones who tell you your product sucks donkey balls... But we (the retards @ WSB or frankly the dubmasses @ seeking alpha and even JP Morgan equity coverage) don’t know the details any of this, only dry ass reports that come out every quarter.

So, other than hacking into John’s brain (not recommended), what can we do? We can suckle at the teat of Twitter announcements, and sometimes that’s fun but usually it’s PR driven (unless it comes from Papa Chen’s account in which case suckle away).

But boy oh boy wouldn’t it be great if we could know the things P. Chiddy does. What new things are in development. Big new sales in the pipeline. Whether the company is hiring (or shrinking), and in what areas….Wait. For the last thing we actually can!

thanks to the grotesquely fat (and very rich, no offense Gabe) founder of a soul-crushing professional network called LinkedIn. Linkedin, very kindly, takes employment related info from companies and displays it for all the world including competitors of those companies and bored autists like me. So let’s see - What Can headcount trends @ $BB tell us about the company?

To start, I took a look at Job Postings / Total Headcount. If you’re a shrinking company, this should be a low number. If you’re growing, it stands to reason this % would be higher. No company deliberately hires people they don’t think they need, and last time I checked $BB’s CFO wasn’t completely retarded. Now, it’s important not to read too much into this, but as a general matter companies that are growing have high stock prices (b/c they’re growing, duh) and vice versa.

FANG isn’t a perfect comp (I’ll get to the others in a sec), but **serves as a good proxy of a “baseline growthy” tech.** No super saiyan rocketships at this point, but nobody is accusing $AAPL of shrinking. See below.

&#x200B;

# IMPLICATION NUMBER #1 - $$BB COMPARES FAVORABLY TO FANG IN TERMS OF HEADCOUNT-IMPLIED GROWTH. IF YOU SAID “$BB IS HIRING MORE RELATIVE TO ITS SIZE THAN THE AVERAGE FANG”, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AND THROW BANANAS AT YOU, BUT YOU’D BE RIGHT!!

“But wait,” you say. “growthinvestor123 you fucking idiot, [didn’t you just compare $BB to CRWD, ZS, SAIL, and PANW](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/) to justify a **$60 / share** price target for $BB? I want to see the ratios for those.” Ok you, got me. See below, headcount-implied growth is higher for endpoint security comparables.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eaz3begzize61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d01221903b3c50a6838710f32daa173035eb9e92

“Hah,” you say smugly. “Those other endpoint security businesses blow $BB out of the water, $BB sucks”.

No, you fucking idiot. If a simple headcount ratio without context was all it took I’d be rich instead of handsome like mommy tells me.

$BB went through [**round**](https://channeldailynews.com/news/layoffs-hit-blackberry-in-waterloo/28015) after [**round**](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=blackberry+layoffs&atb=v224-1&ia=web&iai=r1-3&page=1&sexp=%7B%22cdrexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22artexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prodexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prdsdexp%22%3A%22c%22%2C%22biaexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22msvrtexp%22%3A%22b%22%7D) of painful layoffs as it shifted from being a handset business to what it is today. Despite what the trust fund communists on this site would want you to think, firing people is never easy, and a lot harder than even hiring them. No manager wants to see his team shrunk,and no CEO wants to be painted as a chainsaw wielding asshole. $$ BB has a **history**, and that is a blessing and a curse.

**Remember**, Daddy chen’s primary focus for the past almost-decade has been driving a turnaround. The handset team? Gone. Money-losing International operations? Gone. But the smart monkes and useful apes who might be able to do more than throw feces at each other??? And these smart monkes who were retained – Well, no need to make a job posting for that role anymore, right?

# IMPLICATION #2 – BLACKBERRY HAD > 20K EMPLOYEES. UNTIL RECENTLY THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CUTTING, NOT GROWING, AND ONE OF THE FEW BENEFITS OF ITS PAST SHITTY HISTORY IS THAT THE COMPANY CAN NOW GROW VS. HAVING TO FIND NEW EMPLOYEES QUICKLY LIKE CERTAIN COMPETITORS

This brings me to the final part of our headcount analysis. Let’s look at those endpoint security comparables again. Headcount is one thing, but of the quality of that headcount? Let’s look at two two non-retard quotes –

***""I have my own theory about why the decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The product starts valuing the great salesmen, because they're the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company."" Steve Jobs***

***“If your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it’s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.” Peter Thiel***

I was curious and did comparison of the ratio of $BB’s Engineering / IT monkeys to its sales. See below

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6nog6m62jze61.png?width=524&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb26266cbef428abb3152f1b9077c1a0daee07b0

Even as a $BB bull, I didn’t expect the discrepancy to be so large.

# IMPLICATION #3 – BLACKBERRY ACTUALLY IS MORE OF AN ENGINEERING / IT FOCUSED COMPANY RELATIVE TO ITS PEERS. IN MANY WAYS IT IS MORE OF A “START-UP”. EVEN WITH FINANCIAL PRESSURE, JOHNNY CHEN RETAINED TECHNICAL TALENT. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE COMPANY’S FUTURE, AND VALUATION ???

**TLDR: BB IS NOT A ROCKET SHIP. IT IS A LONG RANGE SHUTTLE, CAPABLE OF BURSTS OF SPEED, PACKED TO THE GILLS WITH RETARDS AND TERRAFORMING EQUIPMENT AND HEADING TO MARS.**

**Thesis:**  
With the advent of online gaming and e-sport, Gamestop is prime to make a turnaround and grow again assuming it will change direction and adapt post Covid. The support of Ryan Cohen, a e-commerce marketing guru, has brought hope to a once-beloved brand and ignited the flame of this reality.  The stock is also enticing because of its 138% short interest which is the highest percentage in the market. Thus, a remote chance of a short squeeze could occur. *Majority of investors do actually believe in the company and is not in it for  just the short squeeze opportunity. *    
&nbsp;

--  
**Background:**  
Gamestop was once the most prolific gaming retailer in the brick and mortar time period. They made their profits by rebuying used games/gaming paraphernalia at low prices and marking them up greatly. They relied mainly on foot traffic due to a subpar online presence and they were slow to change. The low price and convenience of online shopping had won over shoppers causing the demise of brick and mortar. Large brands started disappearing left and right and now it was Gamestop's turn with a boost from Covid. Investors wrote GameStop off as a dinosaur company with its shares eventually dropping to $2.5 dollar.

--  
**Results:**   
Hedge funds saw this and decided to go short on them, betting on their demise like all the others. The funds abused the mechanism of the market to cause a large selling pressure onto the stock, forcing the stock price down and accelerating the demise. Could this be manipulation? If a hedge fund were to short a company out of spite, they could very possibly bankrupt a company.  

--  
**How did Gamestop survive for so long?**  
Even though they weren't raking in e-commerce profit, they were still profitable. It was just that that profit stream was shrinking. The profits were also concentrated at a fraction of their stores. As they closed unprofitable stores, they were able to offset cost slightly. Investors were also holding on to the imminent release of the new console super cycle. Investors noted that the golden days were right after the new consoles were released and Dec 2020 couldn't come quicker. Gamestop was patience and managed their financials well with a strong balance sheet. Investors had underpriced the real estate of theirs. They were not valued for growth anymore so they weren't in a situation to raise capital risk free. They have several billions in short-term and long-term debt but  they had 600 million cash in hand to cushion with. Lastly, the Nintendo switch had just came out and was the best selling gaming console ever. Gamestop rode the tailend of Nintendo success all through 2020 with Switch sales offsetting losses in the other gaming segments.  
https://www.evernote.com/shard/s406/res/8832d8fd-2fda-68ce-77ac-5ab3f362f936  

--  
**The turnaround:**  
A new management team had join in August 2019 that set to slim down the company. They were much more aggressive and sought to aggressively close stores. A comprehensive turnaround plan called GameStop ReBoot  was announced with 4 elements:   
  
1. Optimized the Core Business  
	Reducing unprofitable stores and focusing on what works  
2. Become the Social / Cultural Hub for Gaming  
	Turning Gamestop into a experience center and not just a store  
3. Build a Frictionless Digital Ecosystem  
	Revamp the supply chain to be e-commerce focused  
4. Transform Vendor Partnership  
	Rekindle and make new partnerships   
  
Like all new managements, this one needed time but unfortunately Covid complicated the plans. Investors became increasingly doubtful and even bearish. However, they had underestimated the future of gaming. 

--  
The first significant move was bringing Reginald Fils-Aimé onto the board of directors. Reginald was known for his market prowess bring Nintendo to what it is today. Investors loved that. 

--  
As Covid happened, working from home and home entertainment exploded. Logitech, Corsair, Bestbuy exploded. Online gaming was projected to be very ludicrous in the next decade and Covid had shorten this timeline. Online gaming took off. Activision, Electronic Arts, Zynga, Tencent all exploded. Apple app revenue from their gaming segment exploded. Investors had repriced these stocks higher taking advantage of the first player advantage. One notable company that changed in valuation was Logitech, they were a value company but relabeled to growth. What was missing from this list was Gamestop. The bullishness in gaming was there and everyone else profited. If there was hope of a GME turnaround, their valuation model would certainly flip to a growth model at higher PE multiples. It was only fair.    

--  
The next big event that occurred  was in October 2020. Gamestop announced a partnership with Microsoft which was the first real tangible milestone on the turnaround plan. Investors started to give the company a second look.  Microsoft Partnership caused shares to rally 30% in a day. A bullish sign that the big players haven't given up. However this was short lived as shorts continue to drive the price down as there was no concrete details on the revenue sharing partnership, only that ""for every Microsoft Xbox console that GameStop sells going forward, GameStop will get some percentage of the revenue from every digital full game download, DLC, microtransaction, and any subscriptions as well."" To me this sounds very bullish that Microsoft still believes in Gamestop.  
 
--  
Next came news that the well-respected businessmen Ryan Cohen released that he had bought up 13% of Gamestop shares, becoming a minority owner. Ryan Cohen was the founder of Chewy, a Petsmart online branch that outcompeted Amazon. Investors labeled him an e-commerce guru/genius. He had bought shares at $4.81 and slowly gobbled up more as the price increased. Rumors started speculating that Cohen would takeover and transform Gamestop and it was materialized when Cohen sent the management a very aggressive letter.  

--  
""GameStop’s leadership should immediately conduct a strategic review of the business and share a credible plan for seizing the tremendous opportunities in the rapidly-growing gaming sector. GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences – not remain a video game retailer that overprioritizes its brick-and-mortar footprint and stumbles around the online ecosystem.""  

--  
It was a do this or else there will be a hostile takeover. The letter was sent three weeks before Q3 Earnings and investors were now watching intensively for details of a roadmap or of a Cohen reference during the earning call. ER came around and management was mute beside the announcement of a shelf offering of 100mil. Company performance wise, they were negative on profit but had still beaten expectations. The expedited closure of unprofitable of the stores helped. The stock would have soared had not an offering been announce (offering dilutes shares) so instead GME dropped 17%. From the conference calls, many bull investors felt reluctantly weary of this turnaround while some even dismissed management consideration of Ryan and piled on to the shorts. A week later, a filing by Ryan Cohen showed that he had continued to believe that the stock was undervalued and bought even at $14.83. This news rekindled the speculation that Ryan Cohen was going to do a takeover. Stock bounced and soared to $22.35 dollars for the next few weeks before dropping to $17.35.    

--  
**Jan 2021 - The first squeeze:**  
Shorts were still convinced that Gamestop would not be turn around and so they held steady with a short interest above 130%. Some short sellers had left while new ones piled on.    

--  
Monday, Jan 11th, Gamestop decided to drop bombs to the short:  
- First with an announcement that there was 309% increase in e-commerce sales from 2019 holiday season, 4.8% increase in comparable store sales, 3.1% decrease in total sales.  
	- The biggest takeaway was that their new e-commerce strategy was working. 309% increase is massive. Also this followed their original plan to concentrate on their core. Rise in sales of profitable store was also shown. The closure unprofitable stores hit their total sales but it was not much and implied that these stores were dead weight. They slimmed their bleeding cost segment and increased their profit. This was super bullish.  
- Secondly, a board of advisor switch up was announced. Ryan Cohen and two main Chewy guys were hopping on, replacing 3 other people. 
	- Ryan essentially brought Chewy Management to Gamestop. They know have 1/3 of the company's vote.  
	- GME Management knew that a takeover was happening, hostile or not and so they opened the doors. They also expanded Ryan Cohen's ability to buy up to 20% of the total shares  
	- Permit And Hestia Capital also align more with his vision so that would put them at a 5/9 majority  
Result: Even with the news, the stock price stayed range bound at 20.5 and volume was extremely low for that Monday and Tuesday.  Shorts were once again depressing the price. However, Wednesday came and the first of the shorts closed their position while bulls bought calls. The stock soared. This catalyzed into a gamma squeeze to kick off the huge rally.  

--  
The analysis stopped dead of the gamma squeeze as these recent events have been a gray area of interpretation. Enjoy.

l9p1xu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9p1xu/shkreli_on_gme_131/,Shkreli on GME - 1/31,843,520,2021-02-01 07:29:44,"Gamestonk. Gamestop. GME. My thoughts are on Reddit, under my u/martinshkreli & subreddit r/martinshkreli. Those are authentic and discuss why GME is one of the most unprecedented events in market history. Here, I'm going to discuss the populist attitude that is creeping into this odd situation and add some thoughts on short-selling in general.
  
Let's cover my own unique angle on the concept of a 'short squeeze'. Most would define it as an erratic upward change in price driven by short-covering. I believe short-squeezes defined this way are usually a fictitious idee fixe that aggregates a number of discrete market behaviors and dynamics into a convenient and pithy moniker. The image of python-like buyer constricting some hapless speculator into a higher stock price is evocative but misleading. Many knew me as a short-selling specialist on Wall Street, focused on 'binary events' of biotech stocks. I think I've seen it all: I was once short more than 75% of a company's shares outstanding (I do not recommend this). I bought 75% of a company on the open market, etc.
  
Short-sellers are governed by the same market dynamics as longs. They get nervous when positions go against them and consider exiting. Like longs, they can double down if they wish. The only difference is that, of course, short positions grow when stocks rise. And they can rise infinitely, while long positions fall asymptotically to zero. But both get, theoretically and assuming no fundamental changes have occurred, more attractive as they move against the trader.
  
Short sellers have to pay borrow fees to longs (typically tiny, but sometimes massive). They have to locate stock to short, again usually easy, but sometimes difficult. Both are perilous when those rare adverse times arise. Why? Despite the possibility of a growing cost of renting stock, the ultimate fear of a short-seller is a ""buy-in"". It is nightmarish and has only happened to me once or twice, excluding options-related activity. A buy-in occurs when a broker decides to forcibly exit the short position on behalf of the trader because the broker and trader cannot secure the 'locate' which is supposed to underlie the short sale. The buy-in order is typically violently disruptive: a market order for the whole position near the closing hours of the market! The SEC published a list of stocks at risk of buy-in: the fail to deliver list.
  
My point is that a 'short squeeze' can only practically affect the trader for two reasons. The first is that the trader digs in, doubles down and doesn't exit as his position grows. That's bad trading, and will eventually blow the trader up. But, if the stock is a 'good short', that short will be replaced by more traders with stronger hands/a better entry price/smaller position. What's more is the average investor can't tell if this is happening! The second is the buy-in. I haven't heard GME shorts being bought in, but again, how would you know, other than the grapevine? My point is most of the disruptive, exciting trading here is simply long speculators banging away at the stock.
  
New longs are sometimes attracted to rising prices, speculating they'll increase further: that's called momentum. Those buyers are typically offset by the existing longs who are excited to exit at higher prices. But, if there is a large short position in the stock, a speculator may feel that those covering (buying to get out) short-sellers will provide additional fuel to the momentum. That's sometimes the case, but higher prices should lead to more supply from both long and short sellers. My feeling is the actions of large long holders probably have more influence on the stock price than shorts who dart in and out, and typically in smaller size. Remember that shorts who capitulate are often just replaced by new shorts who are attracted at the new lunar prices.
  
In essence, 'short squeezes' become a self-fulfilling prophecy as new long investors pile in trying to 'squeeze' this sometimes phantom of a short seller, and existing long investors may hold off selling for the same reason. With some Popperian skepticism you will easily see that the same dynamic can exist without the short boogeyman, or with a short boogeyman of any size. Speaking of which, where is Chanos and his slavish groupie, Carson Block? 
  
Speculative momentum can occur for any reason. Let's not forget that the 'trapping shorty' strategy is an awkward idea for a few reasons. Short sellers are often sophisticated market participants who are betting on the decline of a stock. You usually don't want these type of traders sniffing around your favorite longs: I recall writing a 'short report' on a stock to watch it fall 50% that day. If you do a study of stock returns of highly shorted stocks, they are pretty awful. The reason there is 'no arbitrage' is the borrow rate. 
  
But even if you got this poor short to capitulate and squeeze, the amount of buyers who are now holding stock at absurdly high prices put way more energy (and money) into the stock than the short seller's white towel ever could. A sledgehammer killed the fly: now what? Alternatively, are you the host or the parasite?
  
On populism. I don't really think most investors or speculators should go into any investment thinking that there is 'an enemy'. Concentrated (big) investments (bets) give rise to emotional behavior, typically the enemy in trading and investing as it clouds rational thinking. It's a lot better to be Socratic with your 'opponent' and understand what they're thinking. If your position were to be half the size it currently is, would you be as emotionally interested? Try it! You'll lower your risk and feel better.
  
Some of the behavior going on at WSB sounds more jihadist than speculative. The idea that there are some investors who are 'good' and others who are 'bad', or that there is an 'establishment' is BS. Everyone has the same goal: I have a pile of money, I'm trying to make it bigger, fuck your pile--I don't care about it. Anything other goal is contrived, foolish and won't help you win. You can't 'fight the rich' by trying to become one of them. Don't you see the irony? A related thought experiment: what if this trade continued to work really well? And another, and another? Then some WSBers are billionaires. Aren't they the new 'enemy/establishment?'
  
Who do you think hedge fund managers are? They're typically the anti-establishment. Things have changed a bit, but the most successful HFMs are actually the WSBers of the past. These are guys who didn't fit in well at i-banks, often got kicked out for having big mouths or not wearing the right ties, or just wanting to wear jeans at work and not fill out TPS reports. When they started their firms, people like Soros, Icahn, Steinhardt, Robertson, Cohen, Griffin, Loeb (who has posted anonymously on boards), Samberg, even Cramer were fish out of water and had very tiny amounts of capital, often begging for investors.
  
The need for an enemy. To sustain increasingly insane behavior, it isn't uncommon to use a straw man or a scapegoat. Oppressive regimes used this technique in the past, and the media uses it today. Retail investors don't have much power individually. With your $5k RH account, you can't day trade or even qualify for margin. It's pitiful. So, it's understandably quite exciting to finally feel like a 'player' that you read about. To be a part of 'something'. The problem is the media is goading you to be somewhere between a lemming and a life-agnostic but impotent jihadist. Blowing yourself up won't impress anyone, and there is no afterlife here, other than a minimum wage career and mom's sofa. GME and shorting in general is small potatos in the scheme of the Wall St. machine. Don't worry about getting 'even' with the rich. That's jousting at a windmill that will waste your energy.
  
No one here, hopefully, wants to be a lemming. Those willing to 'die on this hill' have to realize something: Wall Street doesn't care about its speculators. The new traders who vanquish the old simply replace them. Nothing changes. When LTCM blew up, or Amaranth, Visium, Galleon, or anyone else, it is 'out with the old and in with the new'. So, perhaps WSB can blow up 1 hedge fund or maybe 5, but so what? Eventually, the tables will turn and it will blow up. The leveraged, fast-money trading markets are a violent place and the only people who care one whit are the brokers charging fees (directly or indirectly). They only care to make sure the sorry carcasses can pay their bills. They know there will always be another speculator lined up, ready to shove his money into the lotto machine. There is no pride here. There is no credit for being a good solider. You either survive or you don't. Your job is to survive and thrive. Becoming a lemming will guarantee failure as per the statistical truism of gambler's ruin (enjoy the proof in measure theory). With enough time, anyone playing a game with <50% success rate (equal payouts), will lose all their money. Get that number above 50%. Add the Kelly Criterion to your trading strategy.
  
You might ask, ""(that's all well and good OR we'll agree to disagree) but, Mr. Shrek, isn't this a good trading strategy? (ganging up on shorted stocks)?"" As long as you're not a lemming/jihadist (willing to walk over the cliff, whether or not you have a ""cause""), and you ignore a somewhat slimy ethical/market manipulation question, I don't see anything wrong with it. There are better ways to make money, since you're asking. Stoking (or worse, participating in) a buying frenzy that is akin to a forced musical chairs game is a little crazy. Once a stock is absurdly valued, you're just hoping the sell-off doesn't happen while you're holding it. If you have enough lemmings or jihadists 'helping you', that's a good thing. They will hold your bag--someone needs to. 
  
Of course, if you've found the ""next"" Microsoft or Apple, no one needs to hold any bags. But, no company can increase its objective (aka fair) value quickly enough for this... phenomenon? situation? absurdity?... to make it reasonable. Those things take years, go slow and steady, and this frenzied buying/""short squeeze"" phenomenon won't let value play a factor. That's why WSB GME longs have shifted theses from ""well, Gamestop was/is cheap"" to ""the gaming cycle"" to ""Ryan Cohen will save us"" to ""...jihad?!""
  
Each member of the herd has its own financial parameters, too. Some may have $500, some $50,000,000 or more. Some may be willing to lose their entire stake (and even more) on an out-of-the-money or levered trade. Some are not. Some were in the latter and somehow end up in the former. Some are in one column at one price and another column at another--some are switched from column to column by force. Today's lemmings/jihadists are tomorrow's sellers. When you're hanging off the mountain, pay attention to the guy holding the rope.
  
Loosely 'coordinated' buying can certainly affect stocks. Heavily shorted stocks and small cap stocks are the kind that require less capital than typical to 'move' a stock. The irony here is when putting on a position, the trader's goal is typically NOT to move the stock with his actions!
  
I still think GME is wildly overvalued, but that doesn't exactly mean I'm 'bearish'. One funny idea here is reflexivity: GME stockholders may become serious GME customers and the company's fundamentals improve that way! Excluding some such miracle, eventually GME stock will trade at <50 again. I still think it will trade at 1,000 or more BEFORE that happens, and that the decline process will take a long, long time (several years). Keep in mind, anything can change. GME can do serial secondaries that destroy its stock. Management's job is to create value for their shareholders--but perhaps they will avoid pissing them off. There's a strange loop! Finally, the stock could be halted by the SEC or completely banned by brokers. Don't overdo it. Watch the borrow rate. Keep your positions at less than 25% of your capital--live to play another day. 
  
Disclosure: I've never traded GME stock and do not intend to.

Posting this article here as it seems like information worth digesting prior to the Robinhood mass exodus. Not advocating one way or the other, simply interested in the truth. To those of you that actually know... is this true? Article below:

A little-known intermediary in the process of buying and selling equities forced Robinhood and other brokers to restrict trading in several securities on Thursday, including GameStop , AMC Entertainment , BlackBerry , and Nokia . All have been swept up in the WallStreetBets-fueled short-squeeze phenomenon and have seen intense volatility in recent days.

Theories abounded online about Robinhood—a mobile-first, low-cost brokerage founded on the idea of expanding access to trading to more people—being in league with the “men in suits” at hedge funds on the losing side of those trades. Politicians on Twitter from across the political spectrum condemned the broker’s move. But Robinhood’s provided reason that it needed to restrict trading in those stocks until it could increase its collateral with the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation, or DTCC, holds water.

Explaining that requires getting into a bit of market plumbing and elements of the trading process that usually don’t get much attention.

When an investor orders their broker—Robinhood or E*Trade, for example—to buy or sell a security, the broker accepts the trade and sends it to an exchange like the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. The exchange then matches buyers with sellers, and from the investor’s perspective, the transaction is as good as done. But there are still some mechanics that need to be worked out behind the scenes.

Investors may have noticed that the cash proceeds from selling a stock aren’t immediately available to withdraw from their account after a trade is completed—that usually takes a business day or two. Back in the day, that time was spent physically exchanging stock certificates between brokers. Today’s trading volumes make that an impossible task.

Today, after a stock exchange completes a trade, it sends the information to the DTCC, which keeps track of brokers’ books. The DTCC is a clearing house, an important part of the financial system. Clearing houses not only process and complete trades in an efficient manner, they help limit systemic risk. The clearing house promises to make good on all trades that happen regardless of what happens to an individual broker.

The DTCC is responsible for transferring ownership of the stock from the seller’s broker to the buyer’s broker—and vice versa for the cash involved. Rather than doing that after every single one of the trillions of dollars of trades each day, the DTCC waits until it can net several trades into “one position per security, per client, per settlement date,” according to its website. The settlement date is the day when the cash and securities involved in a trade actually change hands.

At the settlement date, which falls two days after the investor places their trade, the seller’s broker must deliver the stock being sold and the buyer’s broker must provide the cash. The DTCC guarantees that the transfer will happen and eliminates the risk of a single broker going under rippling across the market.

In exchange, the DTCC collects a fee per trade and requires some collateral from the brokers to ensure they have the assets to complete the transaction. It’s like putting a refundable deposit on a purchase that reduces the middleman’s risk while the package is in the mail, with full payment due once it arrives. The DTCC’s collateral requirements for brokers are calculated by a much more complex formula, based on the specific shares’ notional value, volatility, and other variables.

For a relatively risk-free transaction—in liquid, less volatile stocks like, say, Apple (AAPL) or Microsoft (MSFT)—that collateral requirement could be around the order of 10% of the transaction value. For a stock like GameStop this week, the DTCC’s formula might spit out a collateral requirement several times higher than that because it takes on greater risk. That’s because the DTCC could be on the hook to deliver an asset that’s worth a materially different amount on the settlement date than the trade date if one of the brokers involved can’t complete the transaction.

When traders are using margin to buy, the broker needs to come up with the cash on its own. And when there’s a large imbalance between a broker’s buy and sell orders for a given security, it doesn’t net out as cleanly at the end of the day, meaning more collateral is required.

All of those factors applied to Robinhood and Gamestop on Thursday. The stock traded in a wide range from $112 to $438 on heavy volume, its users were predominantly placing buy orders for the shares, and many were using margin.

And those are the reasons the DTCC asked brokers for more collateral for each such trade. The clearing house didn’t want to be caught with brokers not having the funds they need to settle. Therefore, Robinhood and others restricted buying on these highflying stocks until it could come up with enough cash to pay collateral. Robinhood allowed users to sell the stocks because the selling broker puts up the shares as collateral, not cash.

Since then, the brokerage has drawn down its credit lines at several banks and brought in $1 billion from existing investors to fund additional collateral requirements. On Friday, Robinhood reopened buying of Gamestop and other recently popular stocks.

The DTCC says it processes trillions of dollars of transactions a day, including equities, bonds, mutual funds, and derivatives. It said that collateral requirements for all of its broker clients were $33.5 billion on Thursday, up from $26 billion the day before.

What I found is actually super interesting, to me anyways. But dont forget, past performance does not equal future performance and this is all just speculative, but then again banks and people do have patterns, so if it is as highly manipulated as they say it is, maybe this is something. Anyways heres my retard document I spent far too long on.

https://imgur.com/gallery/gA6gbZP

So bassically we have a batman pattern in 2008 and were curently on the right ear of a batman patern right now. Whats interesting is the VW infinity squeeze happened in October 08, just to the right of batmans ear. We are currently in the middle of a GME infinity squeeze, and are currently, on batmans right ear. The difference is what side of batman the crashes are, in 2008 the crash is to the right of batman, in 2020 the crash is to the left of batman. So that kills the pattern right? Wrong, in 2008 The fed didnt start the quantiative easing until 3 months after lehman brothers went bankrupt and the worst that could happen, happenned. In 2020 the fed Started QE as soon as possible, thus the reversed sides of batman make complete sense.

With all this said, this could mean that SLV will finish it's batman ear and the gme squeeze will crash SLV and then a recovery to ATH, it could mean that because of the reversed crash patterns SLV will start climbing to ATH without finishing batmans ear, or, the most likely scenario, this means absolutely nothing and I just wasted a couple hours of my weekend.

EDIT: I think I should clear this up, I'm not advocating to dump gme and buy slv. SLV wont start rising to ATH until after the GME infinity squeeze. We need it to happen 

Its sad to see wsb die as a comunity"

**MOST TICKERS BEING SPAMMED ARE NOT PRIMED TO SQUEEZE**

Get one thing straight idiots...GME is truly a unicorn right now. It was bet to basically go into the ground. I hope it keeps rising but let’s be real, the restriction on share count and removal of fractional shares on RH could slow this down. 

But.

These other tickers that are being harpooned into space are not without cause. Why are they being harpooned?

Because we LIKE these companies.

Because these companies have been beaten down during COVID or the current tech onslaught.

And...because they are not OVERVALUED.

Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Netflix, etc. are at or near ALL TIME HIGHS. Their ongoing innovation is by buying up companies like GME to put under their umbrella.

We're ""advised"" not to buy at the peak but when we switch to tickers that are on the bottom floor...we're told not to do that too?

Fuck that. And Fuck Wall Street.

#TL;DR (even though I literally have single word lines you lazy fucks)

Robinhood's baby gloves ticker list are the next wave because they're all severely undervalued. Wall St wants to continue to inflate big tech to screw us when they ride the wave back down.

The broader market took a nose dive today as volatility resume in earnest due to, of all things, fucking meme stocks. As GME, AMC, KOSS, and others continue their large swings to the stratosphere much to the grief of short sides, chatters are now about that sell-offs are partly a liquidity issue as funds close out their long position to cover (and prevent a margin call) on their decimated short positions in GME et al. VIX continues the spike from Wednesday and was up as high as 19% as systemic risk to the market are now fully in the spotlight.

* During intraday low, the DOW was down as much as -747 pts while SPX was down -94 pts and Chadsdaq was down -352 pts. Almost all sectors are being punished while a few medical products company in SPX escape into the greens due to a strong ER and an overall strengthened demand - cuz there's a fucking global pandemic. TMO is up 2.93% for the day to $511 while DHR is up 4% to $237. Conversely, big tech are big fucked as AAPL, FB, and MSFT are all down significantly. AAPL closed down -3.74%, FB down -2.52%, and MSFT closed down -2.92% (despite a strong ER result earlier in the week). AMZN, GOOGL, and NFLX are all down around -1%.

* GME swings to a strong green opening after RH relents being a shill bag for Citadel, allowing limited GME and AMC trading (to one or five fucking shares? what a joke). Turns out when the product is free, you're the product? In yet another volatile session, intraday high was at the opening $413 and intraday low was at $250 (a 40% intraday move) as MMs clear out their delta and escapes a total gamma squeeze to live yet another day. The short squeeze, however, is still in play as GME closes up 68% to close at $325, thanks to a reversal of movement shortly before power hour. As of writing, short sellers are at mark-to-market loss of almost 20 bil. You gotta feel for them as they might need to downgrade from a super yacht to a pleb boat. Such shame.

* Congress critters, media pundits, and everyone's moms continue to give their 2cents on the GME and gang episode - and while consensus is usually in favor of the little guys, being a cynical F - you should expect regulations and further restrictions from regulators/industry moving forward. One likely curb to help save MMs would be restricting options trading to a certain account size, or further restricting access to 0dte, particularly for volatile underlyings. Expect all this to come out with messaging of ""helping to protect our customers.""

* RoaringKitty AKA DFV gets [nice profile from the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/roaring-kitty-reddit-gamestop-markets.html) and if you are one of the few millions who are new to the story + sub, the piece does a good job giving a history of how DFV got started. Yours truly somehow got quoted in the piece as well and while the quote was decisively retarded as F, no cap it was an accurate description of most of our mindset. (Of all the fucking quotes to pick out from DFV's updates since 2019...). DFV posted his [latest YOLO update](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l846a1/gme_yolo_monthend_update_jan_2021/) minutes after market close. Don't click thru. Guess if he's still in?

* If you're unhappy with your broker due to restrictions, select veteran brokerages such as Fidelity, Vanguard, ETrade, has placed zero restriction (short of whatever that is already existed) on meme stock trading. As it turns out companies with decent corporate value are actually NOT dick bags, even in the face of market volatility. (Sure their UI might be stuck in the 90s and early 2000s). Things are especially helpful as these brokerages do their own clearing and aren't beholden to Citadel and others. While brokers who use Apex as a clearing house has had limited time restriction (Ally, TDA, Tasty etc.) they are definitely far better than whatever RH has done to their customer.

* Notable upgrades and downgrades: Despite receiving a strong upgrades this AM, BA couldn't handle overall macro pressure and its green opening of +2% swung to red as the day chugs on. Morgan Stanley double upgraded Boeing to overweight form underweight with a PT of $230, up from $165. BA closed the day down -1.54% to $194, further contributing to DOW's demise. SFIX, who rode quite a bit of the short squeeze mania in recent days (from $55 to $100 within two weeks) was hit with a downgrade by Baird as they notch the shares down to neutral from outperform with a PT of $85. SFIX closed the day down -4.44% to $95. GM, who's looking more and more likely to be the next strong EV contender receives another PT hike to $80 from $57 by Morgan Stanley. Shares remain unchanged given the recent run-up and closed the day flat at -0.7% to $50.68.

* After a decent rally from ER, AAL immediately sets out to offer another round of 1 bil in stocks, further fucking over their long term boomer shareholders. Already selling 1 bil in stock back in Oct of last year, the new offering will be selling up to 1.12 bil in more. Shares of American Airline close the day down -5% to $17. Others in the sector are also down, particular as UAL warns that thousands of job are at risk again - despite a 15 bil handout from the recent stimulus package. UAL close down -6% to $40, DAL down -5.29% to $38. Meanwhile JBLU and LUV handles the sector news a bit better given their management isn't complete trash.

* In WSB meme stock land, everything is a fucking meme stock now. AMC close the day up 53% back above $13. BB, a stock without the short squeeze factor closed the day down -3.75% to $14. If you like the previous DDs and plays on BB - you can always regrab $15c or $20c leaps when IV has cool down some more after VIX has retreated. As of writing Jan 22 and Jan 23 leaps are still looking at 140-150% IV. Which is a bit too expensive in premium. ICLN retreats yet again, down -3.3%. MT is down -3.8% after running up almost 7% the day before, and PLTR close the day down -1.35% to $35 ish. TSLA took another haircut of -5% to close out at $793, furthering yesterday's decline after an ER profit miss that didn't impress the market. Yeah, you almost forgot about all these tickers, didn't ya?

* Looking for a bullish meme stock play but just can't stomach the IV or premiums level and shares are too boomer (or out of reach in the case of GME lol)? Thanks to crazy high IV, you can join theta gang sell GME puts (cash covered or spread) at strikes of $25p to $35p for April, netting you premium of around $7 to $11. This bakes in one Q4 ER which GME should do well in, and with IV at +400% and delta of under 0.02 and lower (heh), the odds are stacked in your favor to come out ahead of the play. If assigned, you'll be paying only $18 for GME for the 25p and $24 for the 35p. Another company that will likely be a decent hold if assigned: BB puts are also going for decent premium. Feb 19 10p is going for around $1.75 with a delta of 0.2, or you can go further out to March 10p which nets you about $2.5 with a delta of 0.2 as well.

* **Noteworthy ERs:** With most of the big bois ER behind us (and overshadowed by meme stocks), earnings season continues next week with a few more market movers. On Feb 2nd, BABA, PFE, and UPS all reports before market opens. Later that afternoon, AMZN will report after market close. Further along the week, PYPL reports on Feb 3 after market close while PINS reports Feb 4 after market close. (PINS doesn't really move market but its noteworthy enough).

* **Notable econ numbers** includes the usual boys with Monday PMI at 9:45 AM ET, ISM manufacturing index at 10 AM ET, jobless claims on Thursday at 8:30 AM and the big daddy employment situation (nonfarm payroll etc) on Friday at 8:30 AM ET. 

* The DOW closed down -2% or -622 pts, Nasdaq down -2% or -266 pts, SPX down -1.93% or -73 pts, and RUT close down -1.57% or -32 pts.

**TL;DR:  the GME shorts made one of the most braindead plays in market history,  and should have seen this coming from miles away. GameStop is a VALUE  play beyond the squeeze and is fairly valued at $200-500+ per share in a  stable market.**

***Full  disclosure: I have an IQ equal to the number of employees at Citron  Research and a diet consisting of mostly Crayola crayons.***

This is for everyone who is catching up with the story of GameStop.

GME  was removed from the S&P 500 in April of 2016 in the midst of their  slumping performance in a gaming market shifting away from physical  media and retailers. At that time, GME market cap was just over $3b and  steadily shrinking.

The company’s  bleed continued into late 2019, eventually bottoming out with an  8-figure market cap. Digital competition was rapidly increasing and  GameStop was not able to move quickly enough to adapt its business  model. They were getting bent by Amazon, bent by Microsoft, bent  by Sony. Gay bears were gleefully jerking each other off on the massive  piles of put and short tendies, but something was brewing.

Even though the losses were piling on, GME was able to reserve cash *above*  its own market cap: around $500m in August 2019. This cash, and their  international brand name, were really the only two things the company  had going for it at the time.

Enter Dr. Michael Burry, The Holy King Autismo. **Bull Bomb #1** \- [Burry wrote a letter](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190819005633/en/)  to the GME Board recommending massive share repurchasing with the  company’s existing cash. Burry’s thesis was that repurchasing would  greatly increase EPS and position the company extremely well ahead of a  future sales boost from the 2020-2021 console cycle – consoles which  would indeed have disc drives. Buybacks would give GME more capital to  utilize, decrease their dividend burden, and allow a true transition.  Burry was in it to the hilt.

GME  had already begun buying shares back, and they took Burry’s advice to  buy back even more. In 2019, the company repurchased a total of $178.6m  in shares, representing about 34% of the company. Short interest was a  whopping 63% in mid-2019 with bears refusing to believe that any future  was possible for the brand. 9000-grit sandpaper couldn’t make their  brains any smoother.

Enter [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/),  helicoptering his throbbing bull cock from the top of Mount Olympus.  Burry’s letter generated some chatter on the sub but the sentiment  around GameStop remained mixed at best.  As far as I can remember DFV  was among the first on WSB to take a long position, and fuck he took a  big one: $53k on calls with various strikes. Almost every single comment  on his original posts was very gay and very bearish. [u/j1187064](https://www.reddit.com/u/j1187064/)  captured it best: “Oh, right, I forgot shit companies that are barely  clinging to life always come roaring back from terrible earnings.”

GameStop’s  most critical moves came in 2020. The board got a big shake up in early  2020 with a focus on pivoting the business model to something slightly  less retarded. COVID fucked their retail sales squarely in the ass but  accelerated what was a much-needed expansion of their e-commerce arm.  **Bull Bomb #2** \- digital sales jumped over 500% YoY, and this was **not** just for the new consoles. Still, short interest was increasing.

Enter Ryan Cohen, one of the few men on earth who might win a dick measuring contest against King [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/).  RC had been accumulating shares in multiple purchases throughout 2020,  eventually positioning himself atop the list of stakeholders. Rumors  were flying on the sub about a Cohen takeover of GME, and sure enough,  this materialized on January 11th, 2021. **Bull Bomb #3, nuclear  edition**. The board underwent another massive shakeup, now with Cohen,  Alan Attal, and Jim Grube from Chewy. This was the moment. Ryan Cohen,  founder of the now $43b e-commerce titan Chewy, with Board seats on  GameStop. GME was $20 per share at the time, with around 140% short  interest.

We’ve all seen what has  happened in the 17 days since Chewy took the Board. WSB piled in and  DFV’s balls experienced a condensed millennium of carbon pressurization  into the largest diamonds on planet earth. My only wish is that one day  he fucks my wife.

So why is  GameStop a value play, you ask? I don’t like to estimate the nebulous  value of the gaming industry because it can be cut in so many different  ways, but it is a whole lot of fucking billions and the industry is  going to be booming for a long time to come. GME now has an incredible  fuckload of capital to work with, and the right people to deploy it.  This is what I think we will see in the near future:

* **Subsidiary expansion**.  GameStop has been playing this game for a long time with varying  degrees of success (aka none), but I think they will continue this  strategy as they pivot their business
   * **Game developers**  – there are innumerable great targets GME could acquire to build a  portfolio of games to offer in competition with larger players in the  space. See Microsoft’s 343 Industries, Sony’s 989 Studios, etc.
   * **Streaming**  – there is room to grow in the streaming market, even with behemoths  like Twitch and YouTube out there. Streamers themselves aren’t shy to  voice their complaints about the platforms that exist now, and I am  confident that streaming has a lot of room to develop
* **Strategic partnerships**. The [Microsoft partnership](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-multi-year-strategic-partnership-microsoft)  is something I don’t think has gotten enough attention yet. This is  industry demand for retail partnerships is there, and this deal shows  that it is there in a big way. GME is in a fantastic position to supply  infrastructure and stand on the consumer side on behalf of the largest  producers in the gaming industry. MSFT was the beginning of what I think  will be a massive expansion into these type of partnerships
* **eCommerce**.  Cohen already proved to the market that Amazon is not the end-all for  web sales - see Chewy. Gaming has fucking yacht loads of product to move  – consoles, controllers, accessories, discs, hardware, branded merch,  you fucking name it. Check the credit card statement your wife’s  boyfriend uses in your name if you’re wondering how much people spend on  this shit. If you think Cohen isn’t going to move them into dominance  on this you are dead wrong

Hot industry. Brand value. All-star board. Massive capital to deploy. Large infrastructure in place. Partnerships forming. This sounds like a many-billion dollar company to me.

I  bet there is are a lot more potential moves to be made for GME here,  this is just what I am thinking we’ll see in 2021. Let me know where you  guys think this rocket will take us.

Buy high, sell never, fuck Citadel, fuck CNBC.

Or because there was a coordinated circle jerk to fuck the shorts.

Personally, I got into GameStop because of big daddy Cohen and his proven track record. Do I even need to mention that legendary letter he sent to boomer ass Sherman and GME’s Board of Directors!? And now he has going to be a member of the board with his former chewy executives! Should I mention that deal they have with Microsoft too? Or the muthafucking OMNICHANNEL capability!? Or the reliable revenue cycle when new consoles are released? 

Big daddy Cohen has a vision to transform GameStop into a staple in the e-gaming world, which is worth BILLIONS and growing everyday! As an avid gamer myself (for the horde bitches), investing in GameStop was a no brainer. 

Yea, the squeeze is nice, but it was just a huge cherry on top of the Cohen sundae for me. And now Wall Street has pissed me (and THE WORLD) the fuck-off interfering with our tendies.

Only in July did I really begin paying serious attention to the GME talk, but never did I imagine that this would culminate in a historic moment led by a sub full of foul-mouthed gambling addicts.

**Feb 4, mid-market:** Thank you everyone for your support. I really don't know what to say. The company keeps getting pounded because GME is having a sell-off, which doesn't make any sense. But that's the market for you. It doesn't always make sense.

I still believe 2021 will be a big year for Nokia, although it doesn't look like there is any way we'll manage the crazy play anymore. Still, it was nice to see something that was impossible become possible, even if it was for only a few days.

And remember, we can still do it any day. All it takes is for us to work together. If you want. Make up your own mind. 

I'm still holding. NOK will recover from this. Fair value is at least 4.81, and way more when 5G really gets going. So if you can, I would buy some more now. You'll thank me later for the tip. It may not be the most exciting play, but it is what investing is all about. Slow and steady growth that compounds to make a big change.

One of these days I'll be able to post again, when the mods lift the restrictions on new posts and things get a little less crazy around here. When I post again about NOK, I'll post the link here too. Thanks everyone!

**Feb 4 premarket:** Earnings out! They beat expectations a bit, their revenue was a little smaller than expected. Overall, good quarter, good year. Here it is: [https://www.nokia.com/system/files/2021-02/nokia\_results\_2020\_q4.pdf](https://www.nokia.com/system/files/2021-02/nokia_results_2020_q4.pdf)

**Feb 2, end of da**y: It's getting pretty crazy out there, but here's what you should know. The NOK chart is following the GME chart. It's got way more shares so the bumps and dips are more stable, but that's the main trend.

**What that means**: GME has no underlying value at this level. It is a gamble on the short squeeze. It might pay off, or it might not. If people panic sell like yesterday, it won't.

NOK is very different. It has underlying value. So if someone dumps it below its target price, the best thing to do is just to buy and wait for the value to go down. Thursday NOK reveals its earnings, and they are likely to be good based on what Ericsson revealed. Ericsson is one of its main competitors and a very similar company currently trading at twice the NOK price.

Feb 1, end of day: Told you it was a value share! Still trading at target, still low risk.

Either dumping has stopped, or normies are piling in because of the results. Either way good news, hope you made some money today!Vol today 190m, still way above average. Normal average 30m before we changed it lol. That means since Wednesday over 2bn shares have changed hands. Hope you got em!

Ericsson (NOK competitor) results suggest NOK will report good numbers this week, NOK upped to BUY on market watch: [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nokia-upped-to-buy-after-ericsson-results-2021-02-01](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nokia-upped-to-buy-after-ericsson-results-2021-02-01)

Unless my math is retarded (which it is cos ahmsodumb), if everyone (7m) on this sub spends $3000 at current price ($4.55) we BUY THE FLOAT. The more they keep dumping, the more shares we get cheap. Think about it.EDIT: buying the ENTIRE float is NOT the point of this play. I know share price goes up when supply is restricted, just read the play. This is just an example of what happens when they dump a value share on millions of retail investors.

Added new summary (30 Jan), and Q&A.

FIRST OFF: This post is not financial advice or anything except the rant of some idiot retard who is an idiot. I tell you straight up that there is a normal investment side to the NOK play (STILL MEANS RISK, which YOU will have to decide!) and that there is a CRAZY side that is PROBABLY IMPOSSIBLE. If you want to play the crazy play then you’re also a crazy retard idiot just like me.

I don’t know shit, I just look at graphs and go WOW. Do your own due diligence, I am not a financial advisor. Don’t ask me if you should buy, I don’t know, can you afford to? Are you comfortable with the risks? I don’t know these things. You do.

**NOK PLAY:**

Here’s how it works. YOU DECIDE if you want to take part.

1.It’s **not a short squeeze like GME**. Get that out of your head.

2.It’s a **value/momentum** play. The value part is just normal granny&grampa investing. See a good company going cheap, buy and hold. Tell your mom, dad, granny and grampa, cousins, relatives, friends.

3.The **momentum part is the crazy part**, and if it works the share will SKYROCKET as long as YOU DON’T SELL. GME is the biggest short squeeze in history, the NOK play could be the biggest value buy in history.

4. The beauty of it is that **it works because Wall St is dumping NOK irrationally**. That’s why the price is going down (slowly). They think they’re attacking us and slowly winning, but they’re giving us a value share cheap = their money, our pockets. By the time they realize what we did, it will be too late.

5. **Don’t panic, and keep buying the dumps (if you think the company has value)**, and if we hold the line **you could see a miracle.**

3310 HANDS

&#x200B;

**Value Part (crazy part in Q&A):**

The company is healthy, has good financials, it’s a market leader in 5G (it’s main competitors are Huawei and Ericsson, they have about the same market share share of 5G) a lot of potential to be the company that builds 5G for a large part of the world. NOK is currently trading at a standard price for the value it holds. It is not a bubble.

Here’s Nokia’s 5G contracts: [https://www.nokia.com/networks/5g/5g-contracts/](https://www.nokia.com/networks/5g/5g-contracts/)

Here’s Bloomberg shitting bricks that we’ve realized that Nokia is a value bet: [https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-28/gamestop-may-be-a-reddit-wallstreetbets-game-but-nokia-sure-isn-t](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-28/gamestop-may-be-a-reddit-wallstreetbets-game-but-nokia-sure-isn-t)

Nokia also just unveiled new 1tb tech, the thing AFTER 5G. First on the world. They have it, they’re showing the world it works. Here is their press release from Wednesday: [https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/nokia-and-elisa-push-network-boundaries-with-worlds-first-1t-deployment-2021-01-27](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/nokia-and-elisa-push-network-boundaries-with-worlds-first-1t-deployment-2021-01-27)

They are so trusted that NASA got them to build a cell network on the MOON. Literally. If you’re NASA, would you hire your retard uncle Earl to build cell towers on the moon? No, you hire someone who CAN ACTUALLY DO IT. Imagine what it takes to build something really big and complicated on the moon? Now imagine who’s the likely guy who can do it. That’s right, NOKIA. Here they are, going to the moon: [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/)

If the Huawei 5G war continues, who do you think US and Europe is going to back, especially since NOK already has the next tech, owns a bunch of patents, is from FINLAND that has never tried to take over the world and has a brand that EVERYONE who lived in 2000s remembers?

Here’s a guy who’s been doing the numbers for a while now in case you want to see them: [https://www.reddit.com/user/Jimming/comments/l7f6ua/part\_iv\_option\_chain\_analysis\_on\_nok\_and\_why\_you/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jimming/comments/l7f6ua/part_iv_option_chain_analysis_on_nok_and_why_you/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I don’t know him, I don’t know the numbers as well, but looks pretty good to me. Amazing due diligence. But what do I know, I’m an idiot. So is he. So are you. We’re all fucking retards, just ask Wall Street. I poked myself in the same eye twice yesterday. We’re “dumb money”. They have other names for us too.

So, worst case, you just bought into a good company at a fair value. If the crazy play doesn’t work, you just hold on to them and let them become the world leader in 5G. Unlike GME (NOT SAYING SELL!), NOK will not fall 99%. Or if it does, I'M BUYING THAT SHIT because if a HEALTHY COMPANY FALLS 99% you make some CRAZY MONEY on that when it bounces back.

**Q&A**

**Q: You retards were tricked by bots to buying NOK, there’s no short**

A: This just full on doesn’t get what the play is about. IT IS NOT A SHORT SQUEEZE. THIS IS NOT GME RINSE REPEAT. GME IS A DIFFERENT PLAY. NOK IS A VALUE PLAY. How many more ways can I say it? Not sure. How many more do I have to?

**Q: Stop taking attention away from GME you retards**

A: Nobody is saying sell your GME. Nobody is saying that. GME is too expensive for a lot of people, and GME is VERY RISKY and NOK has genuine value behind it. If the NOK play works, those people who couldn’t afford GME can still get on & get rich. If it doesn’t, they most likely still make money on a good company.

**Q: This play is impossible / crazy / it’ll never work / there are too many shares you retards**

A: This is ALMOST true. This play WAS impossible until 1/27/2021. That is why nobody has EVER tried anything like this. But it’s NOT impossible anymore. Look at this graph. Look at it. See that spike? What the fuck is that? I’ll tell you my fellow autistic space boot packin 3310 using NOKSTER.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v473xl00ghe61.png?width=2182&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf5aac455156dbadb919b80afacb5232af0a05b5

That spike was them running out of shares for half an hour. Trade was stopped until they could find more, to avoid an artificial spike in the price.

Proof? Look at the volumes. A small sale (red) causes a small dip. Two small buys cause a MASSIVE SPIKE. They ran out, and had to call their friends to liquidate more shares so the price wouldn’t skyrocket ""artificially"".

But that’s IMPOSSIBLE for NOK. NOK has 5bn shares. Nokia should be much more stable because it has so many shares, having a crazy demand spike is crazy. I saw it, and fell off my chair and since I’m such a retard it took me an hour to get back up.

So it **was** impossible, and that’s why Wall Street won’t see it coming. They think this is their attack and they’re about to break through our ranks, but they’re actually playing right into our hands.

Wendnesday, we moved 1bn shares. Thursday, when nobody could buy, we still moved 500m. Yesterday, we still moved 360m. We’ve moved so much NOK in the past three days, the average volume of the share has MORE THAN DOUBLED in THREE DAYS. The play is not impossible anymore, but Wall St thinks it is, which is how we can use their own strength and mass against them. But the value buy still makes sense WHENEVER you see someone dump a valuable share. Someone sells you a 100$ bill for 90$? Buy it.

They attack? We absorb. They dump, we buy, they run out of shares, we hold. They’re fucked, and they just handed us a bunch of value shares at an undervalue = they just gave us their money. They are just giving it to you. When they realize they can’t buy them back at a lower value, what do you think is going to happen?

**Q: We don’t do value plays, we do short squeezes you retards**

A: Go back to April. Look at u/DeepFuckingValue’s position. **GME was a value play**. It’s only in April that the Short Squeeze became possible. Look it up yourself.

Will a short squeeze also happen with NOK? It’s unlikely. Hedge Fund Assholes have been increasing their shorts in NOK in the last few days, but they won’t go over 100% on 5bn shares because they're not as stupid as me. But it doesn’t have to happen. We just need to buy the dumps. If they short, great. More money for us as long as we don’t let them drive the price down with the dumps.

**Q: Why is NOK not rocketing?**

A: Because Wall Street is dumping, just like I said they would after the Wednesday spike. That’s the whole plan. They dump, we hold the line, buy the dumps and keep the price steady.

The GME short squeeze guys waited for this for UP TO TWO YEARS. I saw it in April. I thought it was crazy. I didn’t jump in back then. If I did, I’d have about as much money as u/DeepFuckingValue. On a value share, you can afford to wait. GME was originally a value play. That’s what I should have realized in April.

SO JUST WAIT AND HOLD (if you believe and idiot like me, which you shouldn't, no need to message me about it). It’s been two days since this play even became possible.

**Q: How do we know it’s working?**

A: Look at the volume of shares traded. Nokia has 5bn shares. In the last three days, nearly 2bn have been traded. The price is still up from last week. That’s how.

This has already been a giant dumping campaign. How come the price hasn’t floored? What happens if we just buy it all up?

What happens if they run out, and then their shorts blow, the price bumps up, CNBC tells the world we broke another short wall, everyone piles on, Wall Street realizes they just gave us their shares at an undervalue and try to buy back, we don’t sell, we have all the shares? The Wednesday spike is what happens, except this time there is no stopping it. If they stop trading again and try to dump some more, you just buy up the dump and keep the spike going. Spike stops being a spike and becomes a floor.

&#x200B;

**Q: Where will this max out and when?**

A: What do you think I’m from the future? I just saw an impossible thing happen on Wednesday, and we need to make it happen again. Look at the graph. Look at it.

Set your targets to $3310, that should do it.

**Q: When should I buy? What should I buy? Should I buy?**

A: Be your own person. Buy when you feel like it, if you feel like it.

**Q: Wall street bots are promoting NOK.**

A: I don’t give a shit. If they are, and we keep buying, they are promoting giving us money.

&#x200B;

Part 2: (29 Jan)

First off, much as I appreciate the love, I can’t play your hand for you. You have to make your own decisions. Do I know where NOK is going to be tomorrow? Nope. Nobody does. All that I have for you is the news from Wednesday that this play is no longer totally impossible:

1. I think the assholes are going to try to dump you out of the market
2. It won’t work if we keep the demand up.
3. The way we keep demand up is we buy, and others will follow us because the company is good.
4. When they realize it won’t work, they’ll need to start buying back in.
5. Then it’ll be too late, cos they dumped their shares on US and we are RETARDS who HOLD. That means that when their shorts start to go bust, the price will jump up (a little bit, not like with GME at first – this is a different play based on the health of the company, not a straight up short squeeze. The short position on NOK is much smaller).
6. When the price jumps up, and the GME guys start cashing out, they need somewhere to put that cash. Some of them pay off student loans, or buy cars or whatever, but the smart ones will go NOK.

How you play it is up to you. I can’t tell you if you should buy, what minute to buy, what app to use and so on. All I can say is I buy the dumps. You need to decide for yourself if you want to do it. You can see the dumps on any app, or even yahoo finance. I buy NOK on NYSE, and I buy straight up shares (so they can’t lend out mine for shorts) but you’re free to do what you want. I’m a retard, you’re a retard, we’re all autistic fucks, we make up our own mind and stick with it.

Secondly, what I said yesterday morning would happen, did happen. And it happened exactly like I said it would. So don’t get scared off, just buy the dumps. And they know that they’ll be fucked if we keep buying the dumps. That’s why they stopped us from buying NOK.

NOK hasn’t bubbled, stopping us from buying NOK was because they know we’re on to them. They know the dumps won’t work if we JUST KEEP BUYING and HOLDING. The play works, they’re scared, we caught them with their pants down, they’re trying to get ahead of us.

OK, so about what happened yesterday with RH and others. I’m so fucking angry about this.

What RH and others did is completely insane. Their argument is “you guys are throwing your money away on a bubble, we’re just protecting you”. Bullshit. I won’t comment on GME, I’ll let u/DeepFuckingValue or one of those guys do that. I’ll just say, that short squeezes happen with hedge funds all the fucking time. Why is trading not stopped for them? They have people’s fucking pensions that they’re playing with.

But for NOK, it’s TOTAL BULLSHIT. Here’s why:

1. NOK HAS NOT BUBBLED. Look at the graph. Look at it. It is still down from 2016. NOK is well within normal variation. Long term, you barely see the spike from a couple of days ago. There is nothing to “protect us” from. They’re protecting themselves.
2. The NOK play is not a straight up short squeeze. The play is HELPED by the shorts that are there, as long as we can keep the demand up and keep the price up against the dumping, but that’s all.
3. NOK is a healthy company, with new and important tech, a great brand, a lot of potential. You want to see why, read the original post. ANYONE who sees a company like that being dumped for NO REASON would buy. So should you. They are only dumping it because they’re trying to fuck up our play.

Ok that’s enough for now. I’ll see you all when I’ve got my space boots on, in my house on the FUCKING MOON, next to a NOKIA Comms tower, or I’ll see you in VALHALLA with my broke ass. If this doesn’t work, then at least you TOOK ON THE MOTHERFUCKERS and EARNED A PLACE at the table with FUCKING ODIN.

UNBREAKABLE 3310!

**ORIGINAL POST (28 Jan):**

I get it, it’s not the play. I’m not saying sell your GME. I’m not a bot or a spy or a wall street asshole. I’m a regular guy who’s got a couple of bucks in his bank account and plays videogames and wants a fucking house to live in like my parents had when they were young. If you don’t agree with me, just say so.

I’m also not a financial advisor, so make up your own minds you autistic fucks.

But, BUT, yesterday we did something they’ve never seen. Yesterday, we made them run out of NOK shares. That’s what that big spike was, and that’s why trading was stopped for 2h. If we keep doing that, it will be the biggest wall street wealth transfer from assholes to retards in history. Because they will keep dumping it until it’s too late.

Impossible, you say. Too many shares, you say. Well listen up. Yesterday, in ONE DAY, we traded, or caused others to trade, 1bn shares of Nokia. That is 1/5 of all the Nokia shares in the world. That’s never happened, *EVER*. Not even when Nokia was the biggest phone company in the world.

3516.16% of average trading volume.

Do you get it? They’ll keep dumping their stock, we keep buying them cheap, and then they won’t be so cheap anymore when they try to buy back in. We can move 1bn shares IN A DAY. ONE DAY. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Why do they stop trading in NYSE? Cos they ran out of shares temporarily and they don’t want “artificial” spikes in the prices. So they made us retards wait a couple of hours while some assholes called some other assholes to unload their shares into the market, and once they had enough, they started again. That’s why that spike went down right after the freeze.

But then we did it again. And they had to stop again. The price just wouldn’t go down. The assholes who’d just unloaded shares were probably back on the phone with the other assholes who’d convinced them.

Everyone is watching us. What we do, millions of normal folks do with us, and every wallstreet asshole does against us.

What did the asshole brigade do? They started shorting NOK. They will continue to do that, because they think we’re retards (they are correct).

But how come the price didn’t go down? It’s got 5bn shares, and everyone whos ever held it was dumping it. How could we ever keep up the demand when there are so many shares out there? How is this going to work?

Because the retard brigade was buying it. There’s 3m of us and counting. If we each put 600 bucks on NOK, we get 100 shares, and that’s 300m shares.

Now imagine what happens if we put 6000 on it. AND. FUCKING. HOLD. And every dip you see, you buy more. AND. FUCKING. HOLD. They'll keep dumping, we keep buying, until they realize the price isn't going down. Then they start buying, we keep holding, the market runs out of NOK. Price skyrockets.

And normies outside were following us. They can see that the stock is still LOW, lower than 2016. This means they don’t think it’s a bubble that’s going to crash on them.

So why do the normies follow us on this, and not on GME? (I’m not saying sell GME).

Because GME has never, ever been anywhere near where it is now. That scares a normal guy who’s just trying to put in some savings for his family. They think this is some Dutch tulip market shit.

Not so with NOK. Even with the spike from yesterday, NOK is still *DOWN* from 2016. Remember 2016? Remember that being a really big year for Nokia? No, me neither. And let’s not even get started on where it has been in the past. Yesterday's spike barely shows on the graph.

You know what is going to be a big year? 2021 and 2022. Why?

What else did NOK say yesterday? Well, they revealed that they have a new kind of 1 terabit data transfer networks shit, what do I know, I’m not a techie. But it IS a new kind of technology that’s going to kick 5Gs ass. And my fellow retards of the most honorable retard brigade – Do you think we’re going to need more data this year than last year?

Remember how Netflix had to downgrade its picture quality in March because the networks couldn’t handle the amount people were streaming? What do you think is going to happen with the company that solves that?

But why would NOK be the company? Well, remember the 5G war with China?

US and Europe can’t buy 5G from China, because then China has our networks. But guess who US and Europe aren’t afraid of? Fucking FINLAND. Finland, the land of NOKIA. So tiny that some people think the whole country is a conspiracy theory and doesn’t really exist. Sorry Finnish people, nobody gives a shit about you. Good thing for you, cos you get to build the 5G network on the moon and shit because nobody is scared that Finland will take over the world.

Want proof? They are literally building one on the FUCKING MOON: [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/)

And we’re going to send them there. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

But hang on, why is NOK so low in the first place if it’s so great?

Answer: because Microsoft fucked them. That’s right, they sent one of their own assholes to infiltrate the NOK, leak a bunch shit to drive the share price down, and then buy the phone part of the company. These assholes wrecked the company, the Finnish economy, and every middle class shareholder who was just trying to put their kids to college. Imagine everyone who’d be fucked if someone did that to Apple now.

Worked like a charm. Firesale. Business restructuring. Lost their phones. NOK never recovered.

The asshole they sent from Microsoft? Went back to work for Microsoft, and was paid a shit ton of money for what he did. His name is Stephen Elop. Look it up.

So they have tech that nobody else has and a brand that everyone recognizes. But what don’t they have? Money. That’s why they’re building this 1tb magic network thing in tiny fucking possibly fake Finland to show everyone it works.

But if we drive the share price up, do you think that’s going to change?

So FUCK IT. I’m in for every penny, and I am HOLDING. I’ll see you in my house ON the MOON next to a NOKIA Comms tower, or I’ll see you in VALHALLA you BEAUTIFUL RETARDED MOTHERFUCKERS.

TL;DR: NOK is literally going to the moon. Go there with them. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Nokia is now a market leader in networking and enterprise level technology, essentially providing infrastructure for all types of networks. They also manufacture telecommunications equipment and engage in licensing. The most exciting opportunity in their current business model is 5G, which could be the main catalyst for this seemingly boring stock to finally break through resistance and become a valuable asset in portfolios. I'll give some key updates and price targets below. 


Partnerships and beneficiary of 5G rollouts


For starters, it's been a common thesis that 5G will be the greatest investing opportunity of the decade, yet Nokia remains in a flat/downward pattern on the chart. They've recently earned several contracts that will give them a stronger moat in the 5G domain as well as steady revenues and growth opportunities. Recent contracts come from a very diverse group of partners, including: 

-A 5 year deal with T-Mobile, in which T-Mobile will power it's 2.5GHz mid-band spectrum using Nokia's AirScale Radio platform. In addition, Nokia will facilitate T-Mobile to upgrade it's mid-band LTE network to a 5G network. 

-Secured a government contract via the National Cybersecurity Center for Excellence. Nokia was selected as the tech provider and collaborator for the 5G Cybersecurity Project. The federal agency plans to utilize Nokia's technology for the transition to 5G from 4G. The project intends to identify 5G use cases to highlight the efficacy of the components of 5G architecture against security threats as part of a government initiative to beef up it's cyber security and anti-spying tools.

-Partnership with Google Cloud in which the 2 firms will work in unison on businesses' digital transformation at the network edge through both 5G connectivity and cloud-native applications and capabilities. The partnership's purpose is to develop solutions for communication service providers to modernize network infrastructure and ensure smooth transitions to cloud-native 5G-core. This will likely build an ecosystem of services that deployable anywhere, from network edge, to public clouds, private clouds, and carrier networks. 

-Nokia has also recently announced partnerships with M1 for 5G solutions in Singarpore, as well as TeleZ to deploy key infrastructure solutions for TeleZ subsribers in Sweden, Lativa, Lithuania, and Estonia. They were also awarded a contract by NASA for $14.1 million to build 4G infrastructure on the moon. 


Nokia has more than 220 large enterprise customers across industries worldwide, of which at least 30 have deployed 5G. They were also in a geopolitical battle in which the U.S. expressed interest in owning a piece of the company, and in response Finland built it's stake in Nokia via Solidium Oy, the state's equity-asset manager, to 1 billion euros($1.2b usd). Nokia also intends to repurchase 500 million shares in the coming months, so demand for the stock is picking up on all levels. 


In addition to infrastructure, licensing is a huge part of Nokia's business model that will benefit from 5G. The ""Nokia Technologies"" Arm handles patent licensing, technology licensing, and brand licensing. This includes an industry-leading patent portfolio including ~20,000 patent families including ~3500 5G standard essential patent families. 


So why is a company with so many valuable assets and recently announced deals/partnerships still trading flat and so seemingly undervalued? The short answer is the former CEO made several bad choices which gave Nokia's competitors an upper hand on the current 5G landscape and put NOK share price in a long term downtrend which has gave it a reputation as a boring stock with an ugly chart. However, with new CEO Pekka Lundmark's expertise in driving returns to shareholders, as well as the scrutiny and subsequent bans of Huawei opening the door for competition, Nokia now has a much needed breath of life and a chance to gain market share to become the biggest beneficiary of the 5G revolution. The new CEO is determined to get Nokia to the top and pull in solid returns to shareholders, as evidenced by the slew of recent contracts/partnerships along with his plans for spending aggressively on R&D, as well as developing a leaner business model by cutting unnecessary expenses and unprofitable endeavors. 


Nokia is primed for growth as they plan into several emerging, high growth markets including 5G, IoT, Edge computing, Network Encryption, Cloud Radio Access, Software Defined Infrastructure(SDI), Cloud Managed LAN, Optical Communications and Networking, as well as established high growth markets such as Smart Wearables, Defense/Security, and LTE. 



Despite the slew of positive news surrounding Nokia and their partnerships/contracts, the stock is still very undervalued, even at today's price surge. 

That may soon change, as the stock's chart is beginning to signal incoming volatility. The implied volatility(IV) and volume for NOK call options are indicating big moves in the coming months. Open interest is on the rise as well. 




NOK is trading at a Price/Book ratio of 1.3x, compared to it's peers average of 4.0x and the sector average 2.2x 

NOK is also undervalued in terms of Price/LTM sales. It has a ratio of 0.9x, it's peers trade at an average of 3.9x, and the sector average of 1.8x

To establish the Fair Value Estimate, we'll use 2 models taking input from previous NOK financials, as well as data from competitors. (Competitors include: CSCO, ERIC, MSI, MSFT, and AAPL.

P/E Multiples: $14.94 target 

Earnings Power Value: $15.64 target 

The average for the 2 models imply a Fair Value Estimate of $15.29 




These estimates are based on historical data, therefore are fair values for the current price and past performance, not taking into account the market share and recurring revenue recently secured. I believe over the 3 months ad beyond the fair value will be much higher as earnings begin to reflect the value and growth from 5G contracts and recurring revenues. 


Even currently, those estimates are a bit low as Nokia's closest competitor, Ericsson, has a market cap that is nearly 70% higher than Nokia, despite the two having very similar financials and even trailing Nokia in several key metrics. 



At NOK's current share price of, it remains undervalued as ERIC is only ahead of NOK in 2 key categories, EBITDA and Profit Margin, and ERIC is only outperforming NOK by a slim margin in these categories. I believe NOK should be valued much higher, than ERIC since they are gaining contracts MUCH faster than ERIC and also Huawei, which would imply a share price of $7.11 before any buybacks place shares into the treasury, which would increase the price even further. 


Nokias Fair value is over $25

This is based on competitor ERIC who is valued 68.4% higher despite having trailing NOK in almost every key metric for valuation, and the valuation of Huawei who is losing tons of revenue and contracts in favor of Nokia"

This is why since forever they've stuck with Microsoft - when one thing works once and its cheap enough to do twice then they just keep doing it. Its just science. Thats exactly why they're not going to drop SWI contracts. The infrastructure to their servers exists and they're too big to remove. Furthermore Fagamir Putin's hack wasn't as seriously consequential as everyone expected. The stock is going to recover as it already is, having climbed $2 since the hack was discovered. $200b is getting put into their field by the government, who we already have scientifically proven will keep using them because they always do the same thing.

MSFT cloud just blew out and accelerated their Azure biz. This is good for LLNW. LLNW is more exposed to AMZN but if cloud biz is on fire, this is great for them

They have a new edge business which is growing 100% and was 15M in 2020. This will be closer to 30M in 2021 and has better margins than the core biz. Big bear thesis on this stock has been margins and edge biz should allow them to hold them up. Throw a 15-20x multiple on this biz, and you get the whole stock price, meaning you get the rest of the CDN biz + $1 in cash for free. Stock could be worth $10-15 realistically. If for some reason it starts being valued like FSLY or NET, then moon is the limit.

This will be the trough quarter for growth and revenue will accelerate on easier comps throughout the rest of the year.

&#x200B;

today i want to introduce you to Nokia #NOK. 🚀

The year is 1865 in Finland – NOK was founded. Our beloved God Elon didnt even exist as a sperm back then; nor did your boomer grandpa. NOK took vegetables and made paper out of it. Then they decided to make phones and computers. 

In 2014 NOK sold their phone business to Microsoft for billions. Microsoft sold it to HMD global. NOK still receives royalties for their name. So NOK is not a phone company anymore (do not confuse the 2 when researching). 

Today, NOK is far more advanced than making paper from paprika or selling undestructable phones. By taking over a joint-venture from Siemens in 2013, Alcatel-Lucent in 2015 and continuous work, aquisitions and research, they now pose as a major player in hardware and software for critical communication technology. More about this later.

5G - The economic future outlook is looking very juicy compared to NOK’s share price: 

NOK has a market share of 22%. Sure, Ericsson has 26, Huawei has 28.5%. But Huawei is kicked out of Europe, North America, and now many more.The list of countries banning Huawei is growing fast. Who is happy to take over, even in asia? (look at Singapore, partly Thailand f.e.) NOK, Samsung, Ericsson. NOK will have a pie of it. 🚀

[https://www.channele2e.com/business/enterprise/huawei-banned-in-which-countries/](https://www.channele2e.com/business/enterprise/huawei-banned-in-which-countries/)

EV with autonomous driving will need 5G to be connected perfectly. Also autonomous traffic such as drones will rely on this heavily. Guess who produces infrastructure for this, and offers safe communication infrastructure solutions already tested? NOK. 🚀

The finnish, norwegian and swedish governments already bought into NOK. 5G with secure critical infrastructure is a big deal.

What else? NOK is involved in cyber-security slightly similar to #BB BlackBerry. 

Nokia Smart Grid for securing power stations; Network security in general; IOT security and Railway infrastructure security.

5G will be developed faster than you think. According to Ericssons 2020 mobility report, 40% of all mobile internet subs will be 5G – 3.5 billion users in 2026. You might think thats 6 years still, but remember that its 40% of all mobile subs, and where are 3.5bn of subs? Except EU and NA – think China, India, South america, africa, south east asia. Massive numbers.

I didnt look to far in research and development; NOK has claimed some 3000 patents for 5G, but Huawei is the leader right now. What seems interesting though is that NOK is ahead in confirmed patents. 

https://preview.redd.it/0m0suzawnwd61.png?width=815&format=png&auto=webp&s=635e3eeb409ada0404f6caae272b77066224c523

&#x200B;

The discussion about the patent leaders are diffuse. TwoBirds said that Ericsson was leading, with Huawei questioned as to if their numbers were legit. Qualcomm is also a major player. 

**My point though is that NOK’s stock is still flat,** while Qualcomm and the others significantly gained. (Except Huawei, political risk)

**Conclusion:**

NOK is worth a buy IMO. Traffic of tomorrow will rely heavily on secure 5G infrastructure. NOK’s basic revenue is solid, cash flow positive. They will pay dividends, and are a big competitor in a growing sector. They will need their time though, they wont skyrocket next month. 

This is not a YOLO play. As u/ST_McD pointed out, NOK is not the next GME. I see good upside on this stock though, around 100% until next year. 

For 2 other good DD's on this, check u/ST_McD and u/zepherance. Special thanks to u/zepherance, I used some info from ur DD.

On April 2, 2020 they hired Craig-Hallum to help them find a strategic investment (which include M&A).. They signed Mark Spitzer, and Judy Curran to the board to help them facilitate this strategic investment.

 Microvision is the leader in MEMs Laser Beam Scanners (LBS). A key technology which could unlock consumer grade near eye displays, and long range automotive LIDAR.  (Explain like I’m 5) – The lasers work in coordination with the mems mirror. A current is applied through the silicon, which produces a “wobble” as seen in the gif. ASICs (basically a chip) controls the lasers, and the wobble of the mirror to be able to paint a 1440p image at 120hz (in the Hololens 2). The same method is applied with an infrared laser to be able to track objects, and provide 20 million pts/s.

Microvision allowed Microsoft to double their field of view (surface area), by switching from Liquid Crysta on Silicon Panels (built by Himax), to the laser scanning system without increasing the volume of the Light engine, while reducing the weight, and power found in the Hololens 2.   The doubling of field of view, does not mean less pixels per inch either.. As Hololens 2 has been able to maintain their pixel density, allowing user to be able to still read fine print through the near eye displays, unlike other components. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0qgqb8hglwd61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1a255a3e202a3e33dd328094bdb52dbe402d635

The basic concept of why Microsoft switched from a “Panel” type display like Liquid Crystal on Silicon, and decided not to use more expensive, and less mature technologies like MicroLED or MicroOLED is that with the panel type displays, the panel needs to proportionally get larger as the field of view expands. This makes it a challenge for designers and engineers trying to make a light weight consumer near eye display for augmented reality and mixed reality.  The beauty of the laser scanners is by adding a mirror, and a RGB module, they can change the angle, and create a larger FOV without proportionally getting larger. 

&#x200B;

Sharp / Socle (Foxconn) have already roadmapped a smaller RGB Laser Module to be used for near eye displays. Their mass production of these modules will only make it cheaper to use, as the technology accelerates. This also solves other issues regarding how much power the lasers draw (barely already), being able to create even greater efficiencies in immersion by creating wider field of views and something called “foveated rendering” which reducers graphical processing power by up to 70% in some cases.  High definition, wide field of view, low cost of processing. Holy grail of near eye displays. This is another reason why we believe Dr. Mark Spitzer come out of retirement, to join Sumit Sharma on the Board of Directors of Microvision.

 The estimated increase in the market is going to be a total of 41.3% more each year.  

 2021 - 8.6 Billion  

2022 - 12.2 Billion  

2023 - 17.2 Billion  

2024 - 24.3 Billion  

2025 - 34.3 Billion  

Or an estimated market market opportunity of 96.6 Billion dollars total of potential in the next 5 years. Now if a purchase of MVIS can capture even 30% of that potential, a purchase of the company, even with the associated yearly operating expenditures of many million dollars a year, the potential market share would be nearly 29 Billion dollars of value. How much does a prospective buyer pay for just the AR related MVIS tech when they could control 30% of a nearly 100 Billion dollar market over the next 5 years?

There is no confirmation that Microsoft is utilizing Laser Beam Scanners for their Integrated Visual Augmentation System contract for the US Army.   We only have Microsoft patents that show how they plan on achieving wider FOV’s, and that the Hololens 2 was used as the platform to create the IVAS device. Currently Microvision has not given guidance for finances in 2021, which we assumed is because of ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) regulations and NDAAs.  Most evidence we've compiled is circumstantial, but it's the same kind of information that allowed us to realize Microsoft was utilizing Laser Beam Scanners from Microvision in the first place.

Microvision is leveraging their 28 years of experience to create small (size of a VHS tape), powerful (OVER 200m range), and wide FOV’s (dynamically changing).  Re: How this is Solid State-  The weight/mass is so minimal, it is considered part of the chip... impervious to vibration. If I understand it correctly. From a physics perspective, imagine a brick and a tiny piece of fabric sitting on the passenger seat next to you when you drive. The brick is going to jump around with every bump. The fabric will be unaffected. Too small and light.

Low cost, small size.  Think of how Microvision was able to create an interactive laser projection system in a smart speaker with an MSRP of $199. One word: “Scalability”

Luminar, the market leader for LIDAR with it’s recent SPAC, is currently using a Mechanical MEMS system utilizing a polygon mirror the size of your eye, that spins aong with a planar mirror.  Their “Solid State” Lidar solution called IRIS doesn’t have very much published information, but a dive into their patent holdings shows the use of DMD style MEMS (solid state) which is owned by Texas Instruments.   This is the same technology used in Laser Projectors for theatres, that have excessive heat, excessive price, and excessive sizes (due to the heat sinks and fans required to manage the heat).   Had to look up the Luminar patent to find the vertical FOV, 120degx45degx300pts per squaredegree = 1.6 Million points... and we can't even complete the calc because hey maybe it refreshes a bunch of times a second...

Craig-Hallum and Microvision are currently focused on finding a strategic alternative, which incudes the possible sale of the company. It’s a dragged out process, but we’ve found multiple Tier 1’s that have shown they plan on expanding into the space Microvision currently holds large IP for (near eye displays and Lidar) which would unlock Consumer grade products for these OEMs.   Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook is just a small sample… which would include companies like Amazon, Google and other large whales.

Helllooooo Autists! It's me, ya boy. Back to talk some more about my favorite play right now, Microvision! **I have used this dip opportunity to more than double my previous position. Positions at bottom.**

As you all know from my [post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5hwiu/microvisions_macrovision_the_story_of_an/), Microvision is unbelievably undervalued in the marketplace right now. They have not only have **best in class LiDAR** for consumer and automotive (TWO verticals!), but they also have **best in class MEMS** displays (MSFT Hololens 2 and IVAS display, another vertical and **MSFT with a gov contract!**)!

# WHY I'M BACK AGAIN

Mainly for two reasons then we can jump in

1. **A POTENTIAL MAJOR CATALYST COMING TOMORROW**
2. The current formation of the chart looks **IDENTICAL TO THE LAST RUN FROM $3 TO $9+**

# Reason 1 - System Plus Consulting full Hololens 2 teardown and report available tomorrow

This is could be a **MAJOR** catalyst tomorrow when this [full report is released](https://www.systemplus.fr/reverse-costing-reports/microsoft-holographic-lens-from-hololens-2/). As we already know, thanks to the guys over at r/MVIS [(LINK TO THREAD)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/l61w3p/microsoft_holographic_lens_from_hololens_2_system/), the Hololens 2 **IS CONFIRMED TO USE MICROVISION MEMS DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY -** [SOURCE 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/gm1i2f/hololens_2_teardown_the_hunt_for_mvis/)(8 months ago) **+** [SOURCE 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/kxf2to/microvision_mems_mirror_in_the_hololens_2_the/)(12 days ago)**. This should finally lift the veil on Microvision and start getting more institutional and retail investors jumping in.**

&#x200B;

# Reason 2 - Crayon drawings look IDENTICAL to last 300% pop!

**Please forgive me for my awful crayon drawing, I had to use an old box because I ate all the new ones.....but check this out!**

[🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/ufmg7qbwfwd61.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=789b3ba55ccf39d855024c41039eabd31b5e2902)

Wow! What a chart! If you want a **more in-depth look,** [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck7IvrgglDw&feature=emb_title). But Look at all those circles! I've even color-coordinated them, to help our smooth brains. All I'll say is, compare the circles. See how each one looks like it is setting up to be identical?

1. Green circles - The first one is the first 3 days of upwards movement towards the boom, looking like we have the first few bars of that setup already
2. Red circles - the second one looks like it is going to finish today with a lot of indecisiveness in the direction and suppression from the resistance line right there. **This is playing out the same exact way as last time**. Last time we fucked with a heavy resistance then broke it and started the major run the next day.
3. Blue circles - Check out those increasing volume trends. If you can see the faded brown circles in the blue ones, check out the low ass volume coming in on those days followed by a **BOOM**
4. Black circles - RSI, you probably haven't read this far but looks like we can run up and out of the purple again

**IF HISTORY HOLDS TRUE, WE CAN SEE A 300+% PRICE MOVEMENT IN THE COMING DAYS.**

# CONCLUSION

To wrap this up, let's take another quick look at the LiDAR competitors in the market...

**Luminar (LAZR)**

* **Stock Price - $39.39 (+$3.07, +8.25%)**
* **Market Cap - 12.731B**
* **Float - 177.19M**
* **Shares outstanding - 218.82M**

**Velodyne (VLDR)**

* **Stock Price - $26.23 (+$1.08, +4.22%)**
* **Market Cap - 4.433B**
* **Float - 55.52M**
* **Shares Outstanding - 168.71M**

**Wow!** Look at those market caps! Now let's see how Microvision compares...

**Microvision (MVIS)**

* **Stock Price - $7.79**
* **Market Cap - 1.02B**
* **Float - 145.69M**
* **Shares outstanding - 151.31M**

Just looking at the pure numbers and math of how this works out, **MVIS SHOULD SEE A PRICE TARGET OF AT LEAST 3X, IF NOT 4-6X!** And that is just looking at the **ONE AUTOMOTIVE LIDAR VERTICAL**. **If you add in their other verticals? Holy shit can this baby start to FLY**🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

**TL:DR - MICROVISION IS STILL EXTREMELY UNDERVALUED BY AT LEAST 3X, CHART LOOKS IDENTICAL TO LAST 300% RUN, THEY ARE BEST IN CLASS IN MULTIPLE VERTICALS**

**TL:CR - $MVIS**  🌙🌚🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

l4az1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4az1a/gamestop_could_become_the_leading/,GameStop could become the leading subscription-based multi-platform digital game store,229,27,2021-01-25 07:53:09,"These are my thoughts on one potential option GME has to make a significant pivot and leverage its current market place position as the leading multi-platform video gaming retailer into a digital future. This model allows for a lot of optionality and diverse revenue mix.

**Note:** I do not think this is the only option available to GameStop, nor the right one, just throwing it out there as it shows how much potential there is to re-think this business, on a fundamental perspective there is a lot of upside if they can execute on something compelling.

## Summary

A digital platform that offers both a subscription service for all-you-can-eat cross platform titles plus a digital games store where you can purchase cross-platform titles that are able to be traded-in for a credit.

## What revenue would it create?

At the moment, GameStop has over 50 million PowerUp Reward members. This program is largely limited to USA, whereby this digital platform can be global. As a benchmark, Xbox Live Gold is over 90 million subscribers, World of Warcraft has somewhere around 10-20 million subscribers (@ $15/month) - that's just 1 game. GTA 5 has sold over 120 million copies and Take Two makes $350m in micro-transactions in a quarter.

If this service cost $169 per year, cheaper than Microsoft's GamePass Ultimate, this is roughly the recurring revenue it would bring in. Maybe they could charge a lot more than this. $19.99 per month or $239 pa. $24.99 per month or $299 pa.

This service may just sit alongside GamePass, or Microsoft may choose to just integrate into GameStop's service so they are getting their Microsoft owned studio titles on more systems. See this article: [Microsoft wants Xbox Game Pass on PS4.](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-on-ps4/)

|Subscribers|50 Million|100 Million|150 Million|250 Million|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**$169 pa**|$8.5 Billion recurring|$17 Billion recurring|$25 Billion recurring|$42 Billion recurring|
|**$239 pa**|$12 Billion recurring|$24 Billion recurring|$36 Billion recurring|$60 Billion recurring|
|**$299 pa**|$15 Billion recurring|$30 Billion recurring|$45 Billion recurring|$75 Billion recurring|

It's possible too that this model does not simply provide a catalogue of games, like Game Pass does, but could work more like a library system where you can check-out something like a few games at a time. Any games. And turn them back in. Given the potential for license revoking, the opportunity of how the model could work on a subscription basis is only limited by your imagination. This kind of new approach would be different to what we've seen to date out there.

## Digging deeper: More like Spotify for Games

In some ways this model could operate similar to music and movie streaming services (e.g. Spotify & Netflix) where you have the ability to choose from the entire catalogue, and the publishers are paid based on what is being consumed/streamed/used/played. Play hours could be monitored and factored in.

Benchmark: Netflix has around 200 million subscribers, Spotify around 150 million, Disney+ around 85 million.

## Classic Buy/Trade-In model

On top of this, purchased games would be sold in full, generating more classic sales revenue. These digital purchases could work in a number of ways:

1. Games sold generate commission/profit per sale (just like selling a retail disc now) and could be integrated into existing digital stores across Xbox, Playstation and Nintendo eShop.
2. Games purchased through the console stores or other stores could be ""traded-in"" with GameStop for a small credit. It would be some minor work to integrate ability for the existing platforms to disable/transfer the digital license.

Traded-in games would encourage more purchasing than what happens currently where they rot in your catalogue never to be played again, so publishers are incentivized to be involved and contribute to this.

DLC and other digital purchases in-game could generate a similar commission for GameStop, in the same way that the current Microsoft revenue share model has. See below.

## Couldn't _________ do this instead?

Maybe. But, GameStop has advantages over every other player who might want to become the ""Netflix"" of gaming, if you will. They are neutral compared to other companies in the gaming sector, and neutral to the other major tech companies such as Google/Amazon/Facebook when you put them up against Microsoft in particular.

||Microsoft|Sony|Nintendo|Steam|GameStop|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**PC**|X|||X|X|
|**Xbox**|X||||X|
|**PlayStation**||X|||X|
|**Nintendo**|||X||X|

## GameStop is well connected across the gaming world to act as the global carrier for digital gaming

1. Steam might be able to pivot into this area, but GameStop has something Steam doesn't have: the console market. Primarily this means capturing Nintendo & Sony into this future.
2. GameStop has Reggie Fils-Aimé (former President at Nintendo of America). This is a huge card in terms of getting Nintendo of Japan to agree to some kind of involvement.
3. Game streaming is something that can be built in now or down the track. Again, being platform neutral is a big bonus here, as the offer they provide would not be limited to other ecosystems such as what would be through XCloud or Stadia. Microsoft may even want to develop a deeper partnership to provide the technology/infrastructure (e.g. license/transfer XCloud - like an AWS style relationship) and allow GameStop to operate it as a neutral party. At the end of the day, Microsoft may get slightly smaller cut of a much larger pie through a model like this - and not be accused of anti-trust/monopolization.

## Understanding the Microsoft Digital Revenue Share

>Domo President Justin Dopierala told Ars that GameStop Investor Relations representative Eric Cerny sent an email with the statement: “We are allowed to state we will receive a portion of the downstream revenue from any device we will bring into the Xbox ecosystem.”  
>  
>Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba confirmed what Dopierala said, adding that **GameStop will get a percentage of the revenue from every full game and DLC download, every microtransaction and every subscription made through an Xbox Series X or Series S it has sold through its stores.** And since the original line in the PR mentions “lifetime revenue value,” it means the retailer will be receiving money from Microsoft throughout each console’s lifetime.

1. Microsoft want to do these things, but know they would never get Sony onboard. They probably wouldn't even get Nintendo onboard.
2. Sony has been known to bow to pressures in the gaming industry, so would come on board with something like this if Microsoft and Nintendo are hooked in. [Sony caves to the fans: Fortnite cross-platform play coming to the PS4](https://www.nintendoenthusiast.com/cross-platform-play-fortnite-ps4/)

## Plus all the other options available for revenue

1. Physical media will likely still exist for a long time. Case in point: We're still buying up Vinyls. Hell, there's probably still a case for retaining some stores over the next 2 decades in some capacity.
2. There's a waft of physical items that GameStop can continue to sell: Collectibles, hardware, pc parts, consoles (both outright and subscription based hardware), apparel, peripherals, toys, books, etc.
3. eSports: Tournament platforms, leagues, streaming.
4. Private label brands: GameStop can expand into its own house brand of gaming accessories.
5. Game studio development: They can start to make their own games, ala. what Netflix Original Content is all about. There's billions of dollars of potential here.
6. Leverage the data: 50 million members and growing. What else can it do with it?

As a long on Nokia, I have been lurking this sub and I see a lot of the same misconceptions about Nokia and well, I believe its time for me to bring some clarity to the reality that is $NOK

**Myth #1 Nokia is a phone company.**

This is wrong, Nokia is not a phone company. They sold their phone business to Microsoft back in 2013 for over 7 billion dollars, later it was sold by Microsoft to HMD for 350 million dollars in 2016, who currently makes the phones. Nokia just gets royalties for the use of their name.

**Myth #2 Nokia has been under the same failed management for 25 years.**

Correction, Nokia hired on a new CEO Pekka Lundmark in August of 2020 and took full leadership in September. He previously worked for Nokia between 1990 and 2000, when he helped oversee the company’s emergence as the world’s biggest mobile phone manufacturer and a significant player in mobile infrastructure.

**Myth #4 Nokia is losing market share due to competition**

While yes, there is strong competition in the 5G market, Huawei the global leader, is facing bans across the United States and Europe, ZTE who makes up a small fraction of the market share is also seeing geopolitical pressure. Current estimates of market share show the following Huawei 28.5% Ericsson 26.5% Nokia 22% Samsung 8.5% ZTE 5% and others 9.5%.

Here is an updated list on each countries stance on Huawei and ZTE. The list is growing as more and more countries decide to venture away from Chinese telecommunication equipment.

[https://www.channele2e.com/business/enterprise/huawei-banned-in-which-countries/](https://www.channele2e.com/business/enterprise/huawei-banned-in-which-countries/)

With more countries joining on the list, there is an increase demand on the others within the market to pick up the lost market share.

**Myth #5 Nokia isn’t a cyber security company like BlackBerry**

Nokia actually is involved in the cyber security field in many important ways. Nokia Smart Grid for example, is designed specifically for one of our largest threats faced by modern nations, Power Utilities.

**Myth #6 Nokia isn’t doing anything to make itself more profitable**

Nokia Cuts Jobs in France

Staying in Europe, Nokia said it was cutting 1,233 jobs in France, largely impacting research and development positions at its Alcatel-Lucent subsidiary.

Nokia has been slashing jobs amid a global cost savings program originally announced in late 2018. “Nokia is reinforcing its efforts and has earlier launched a global evaluation of its \[research and development\] operation that has led to significant adjustments globally,” a company spokesperson said in a statement.

The Finnish vendor, which is trying to cut $556 million in costs by the end of 2020, announced plans to cut about 180 jobs in its home country at the beginning of the year and hinted at more to come.

-somebody rushed a bunch of calls through EOD. My best guess is imminent space launch or something 

[NVAX](https://i.imgur.com/ebyj4B7.jpg)
-saw deep OTM calls coming in towards the end of the week. Could be big news coming, or could’ve been an assumption based on all the weird vaccine news about PFE and MRNA that came

**Edit**: there were some I forgot to mention because I didn’t have screenshots. ZNGA going absolutely apeshit, FSLY with quite a few calls after an upgrade, and INTC very bullish call volume and OI on the heels of a few upgrades after their ER plunge. There were tons of PT upgrades for tech last week, seems like names can 🚀 next week with earnings season here. 

Many more to be added Monday probably since it’s statistically the best day to follow whales. Some of these already had decent AH pops yesterday.

PLTR is experiencing a heavy strong trend with a bull and flag. It's broken support this morning and is back up. PLTR has had positive momentum, tons of new contracts and lots of volume. It's been in this pennant and is due for a breakout. PLTR's Demo day is the 26th of Jan and earnings is Feb 11. Demo day is gonna showcase new Palantir products and outline what PLTR has in store for 2021. 

**A case for longs:**

Palantir aims to put together software that compiles data that provides insights into potential problems, solutions to these problems, and help solve complex, real-world problems. This data and analytics is fully interactive, and machine-assisted. So far, Gotham and Foundry are Palantir's products. Gotham is the military/government grade software and Foundry is the commercial equivalent. Apollo is a program that essentially removes the need for support teams when Gotham and Foundry need an update. Apollo gives Foundry and Gotham users the luxury of updating their software like it's an IOS update. These three products are the fundamentals of PLTR

Palantir's goal in the commercial and govt space is to grow in scope and scale. This prepares them for a horizontal integration. They are trying to build a wide moat for themselves in order to secure an opportunity for vertical integration as well. By preparing themselves for both vertical and horizontal integration, they are going down a road not dissimilar to that of Standard Oil. There is not a doubt in my mind that this company is run by people who know what they're doing. 

PLTR is now the biggest company involved in government data. The US cannot afford to have PLTR go under, and thus it will never go away- the only way is up. The real question is, how fast is it going up?

""Looking ahead, Palantir is poised to become the default central operating system for data across the U.S. government and its allies. The company also aspires to be the central operating system for data at large businesses and even entire industries. To appreciate Palantir's ambition with regard to B2B big data, it may be helpful to recall how much economic benefit has been captured by Microsoft (MSFT) after Windows OS took the lead over MacOS of Apple (AAPL) in the PC era, and by Google and Apple in the consumer mobile phone age with their respective Android and iOS operating systems.""

Competitors in this niche tech field are quickly swatted away. BAH and ACN lack the technical power and can't compete with PLTR pricing. Even defense contractors such as RTX, BAH, SAIC, and BAESF cannot compete with the costs and user-responsiveness of PLTR. You might ask why a big shot like google isn't stepping in to work with the government, to which I would chuckle and remind you that google stated they think the pentagon is ""unethical"" and prefer to work with the Chinese government on Project Dragonfly ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly\_(search\_engine)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly_(search_engine))). 

I'll go ahead and rattle off some quick deductions of mine. They have an aggressive merger and acquisition campaign. To grow into adjacent verticals, they absorb companies that are already there, quickening the speed they grow at. They are Capital-light and operationally efficient. Their ROI is very high and they can sell their product with existing hardware for as long as they are the best program to use. Meaning their software needs to be installed once but can be sold as many times as they like, as long as they keep their shit together. They are seriously dominating domestically in their niche. Their wide moat due to the M&A campaign and good management for vertical + horizontal growth gives them a monopolistic outlook. They are in the captains chair. 

**Forward thinking**

PLTR's last Q described sales growth of 46% in international sales. They want to move into Canada, Australia, UK, France and other allies of the U.S. They will very likely establish themselves there as well. They have a Foundry Joint Venture contract in Japan with Sampo Holdings for the wellbeing of the Japanese people. It was $500M. They are likely looking for a contract with Japan's government as well. 

My short-term PT for PLTR is $34, passing ATH. This pennant is a strong trend and it is gonna break out hard. All signs point towards a bullish breakout so I'm loaded up on calls, overexposing myself three times with what I'm usually comfortable with exposing myself to. 

Long term, I can imagine PLTR breaking $100 within 2 years. With a growing need of govt software and national security, *PLTR's value can only go up*

**TLDR: PLTR $34 by early Feb.**🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"

Spurred by zero-commission trading and COVID tailwinds, this booming segment of stock market traders has reshaped market behavior. 

I've been scraping discussion on WallStreetBets for several months, and tracking how often different tickers are mentioned every day.

The graph below visualizes yesterday's discussion on the forum. Size represents the number of times a ticker has been mentioned, whereas color brightness represents the performance of the stock. GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) had the highest discussion count with 495 mentions and returned 10.89% for the day.

[WSB Heat Map](https://preview.redd.it/48jg1izvjic61.png?width=1119&format=png&auto=webp&s=089b824acc9dcd7f89689c71d661f0d127d164ee)

A quick look at the above graph shows that many of the companies listed have experienced parabolic stock growth and volatility over the last several months. This begs the question: **Has WSB discussion been a leading indicator for stock performance?**

To test this question, I backtested a simple strategy that buys and holds the 5 stocks that were most discussed on WallStreetBets in the previous week. We ran this backtest using data from 2020.

The graph below shows the portfolio holdings by week (click for full-size image):

[WSB Portfolio Holdings](https://preview.redd.it/smkp7dualic61.png?width=1119&format=png&auto=webp&s=c95d1d4bbc1047a2c76b26fbfc3305143dc39d6d)

Tesla, Apple, AMD, Nio, and Microsoft were among the stocks that most frequently cracked the weekly top five most-mentioned tickers.

Over the last year this simple strategy was up over 61%, with especially strong returns in the last quarter of 2020. The ""WallStreetBets Portfolio"" was more volatile than the S&P 500, but outperformed even during the downturn at the start of the year.

To take a look at the relationship between WallStreetBets discussion and market activity at a stock-level, I’ve picked a couple stocks that were among the most popular on WSB in the last 120 days and examined them to determine if there is a correlation between WSB discussion and share price and volume.

**Palantir Technologies Inc (NASDAQ: PLTR)**

Big data analytics company, Palantir Technologies Inc, had its highly anticipated IPO on September 30, 2020 trading at $8.20. Shortly after, on October 14, the discussion volume of PLTR tripled to nine counts as well as achieving a 4.65% gain on the day. WSB count and share price activity continue to share a positive correlation coefficient of 0.592 as the stock reached a 52-week high of 33.05 on November 27, 2020. *\[Note: A value of greater than 0.7 is considered a strong correlation. Anything between 0.5 and 0.7 is a moderate correlation, and anything less than 0.4 is considered a weak or no correlation.\]*

&#x200B;

[Palantir Price vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/f8p41x1jkic61.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=2090f0fba5f9ee39cf7f3ed21932d31d6a0e1264)

WSB counts and PLTR volume for the same dates recorded a correlation coefficient of 0.803. This could indicate a large amount of individual-investor interest driving the recent valuation of Palantir which features a low proportion of institutional ownership at 14.41% (3Q20), compared to the industry average.

&#x200B;

[Palantir Volume vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/4qiik9ekkic61.png?width=1354&format=png&auto=webp&s=074100895bb7e99da71462126ed7f972d5763948)

PLTR received three downgrades from investment banks between October and December 2020 but added a price target increase to $30.00 (from $18.00) by Jeffries on January 11, 2021, well above its current price of $25.64. Risks still linger as 2Q20 to 3Q20 EBITDA losses increased by 83% to an $848.1m loss and, as of now, positive investor sentiment continues to support an uptrend.

**GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME)**

GameStop Corp. has experienced financial stress in recent years as the retail trends which had worked in its favor continue to decline globally. Total Liabilities climbed 12.18% to $2.26B from 2Q20 to 3Q20. Before May 5, 2020, WSB activity on GME had been dormant averaging 3.83 counts daily YTD.

Shortly following this, several threads on WSB began to speculate on a GME recovery due to increased gaming activity and a large existing short position of 57 million shares at the time. WSB counts would be amplified after an investment from activist investor and founder of Chewy (NYSE: CHWY), Ryan Cohen.

Since May 5, 2020, GME has rallied 755.33% and WSB discussion counts averaged 55.34 a day making a positive correlation coefficient at 0.688.

&#x200B;

[GME Price vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/g8xj575nkic61.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b458e40d9866fbecbedc224b5679ba885463f5d)

The WSB counts and stock volume also shared a correlation coefficient of 0.628. This was exemplified on November 30, 2020, when stock volume spiked by 31.3m and discussion counts followed suit at 227 for the day.

&#x200B;

[GME Volume vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/3d3xn8dokic61.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=af618e9f2ea29d71d69d86dc1884a44ec42bbf24)

The mainly optimistic speculation of a GME recovery in May on WSB contrasted with most major media outlets at the time, which appeared to focus on store closures due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The rally and enthusiasm behind GME since that time was in stark contrast to many other corporations, 630 of which filed for bankruptcy in 2020 marking a 10 year high.

## Summary

There is no universal method of finding actionable insights when analyzing WSB, but discussion on the forum can serve as a useful estimation of retail interest. Companies that have had exponential growth with help from forums such as WSB are more likely to become transition to an organic growth phase with more institutional investors and less volume. Keeping an eye on rising companies on WSB could help identify an opportunity that many may have overlooked."

I tried to make it as retard-proof as I could, but I'm sure I'm underestimating you guys.

I use my template to see the gains/losses i've made on stock that I have sold.

Some quick info: You will need to copy it to your own google drive. Some functions won't work when downloading to Microsoft Excel. Also I have protected the formulas and titles, so you can't change it on accident.

[Click here for to open the template.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ndAyqLq0rD6iE7LMKdpKiyNUFQ2wDDEs9A7C8nn5H4/edit?usp=sharing)

On sheet 'Investment 1', you can individually add your orders. (I recommend this sheet, as this one is way easier)

* Under 'Purchase', you should fill in the price/share, amount of shares, fee, exchange amount (Enter  
1 if the stock is in Dollar) and purchase date (the last 2 are needed for formulas).
* When you sold that stock, enter the sale in the 'Sale' section after the purchase of that stock. The  
spreadsheet will calculate the gains/losses you've made.
* When running out of lines you can add lines by rightclicking the second last visable row and select  
'insert 1 below', then press ctrl+D (when the added row is still selected) to copy the formulas from  
the cell above.
* In row 27 there is a sum of; the total you have currently invested, the total you have purchased and  
sold, and the total you have gained/lost.

&#x200B;

On sheet 'Investment 2', it is the same principle as the previous sheet, but here you can group the stocks.

* This sheet will also calculate how much you currently have invested in each stock.
* It's a little trickier to add rows in this sheet. You will have to be carefull not to add a row after the bottom row of a stock (for example row 11), otherwise the formula that calculates the total of that stock will not calculate those rows. Instead add rows at the first row of a stock, or the second last. You can always hide the last row of a stock to prevent that from happening, as I have done with Tesla and To the moon.
* When you want to add a new stock you can add a few rows at the second last row(Row 12, Row 13 is hidden so the formula doenst get fucked) equal to the amount of rows a stock group has, so you can copy those rows into the new rows. For example Tesla has 3 rows (row 3 to 5,row 4 is hidden), so add 3 new rows behind a stock group, then copy those Tesla rows and paste them into the new rows. Now you have the formulas so you can delete the data in the new rows.

&#x200B;

On sheet 'Strategy', you can keep track of how much you want to invest in stocks, options, etc.

1. Add the total budget you have into cell C1
2. Decide what percentage you want to invest in each section (Cell B2, E2, H2) and give it a name in the cell to the left
3. Decide what percentage you want to invest in each row of a section (Example: Cell B3, B4) and give it a name in the cell to the left.
4. The sheet will calculate what the budget is for each stock or whatever.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Hope I didn't miss anything. Also hope you guys find this usefull, if not, then buy GME stocks right the f\*ck now. F\*ck Melvin, all my homies hate Melvin. 💎✋

# DJ GameStop Stock Is Soaring. It Could End Badly. -- Barrons.com

https://preview.redd.it/t5f3zdu6lec61.jpg?width=1151&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b68789578ac91a585a227c02e5b0fe37c9ad17f

GameStop stock continues to soar amid interest from retail investors one analyst called ""rabid."" Now the stock now has the attention of a notable activist short seller.

Citron Research's Andrew Left wrote in a Tuesday post on Twitter that he plans to host a livestream discussing five reasons those buying GameStop (ticker: GME) stock at recent levels ""are the suckers at this poker game.""

""Stock back to $20 fast,"" he wrote. ""We understand short interest better than you and will explain.""

Left did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Barron's asking him to expand on his thoughts, as well clarify whether he's taken a short position himself. But around the time of Left's post, GameStop stock pared back from a $45.52 intraday high. The stock closed up 11% to $39.36.

On Tuesday, 74.6 million GameStop shares were traded, the stock's fifth-highest volume on record, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Last Wednesday set a record volume for the stock, when 144.5 million shares were traded.

GameStop shares doubled last week following news that three former Chewy executives, including co-founder Ryan Cohen, were joining the company's board. Cohen's RC Ventures has a 13% stake in GameStop, and has urged the company to close more stores and embrace e-commerce.

The day of the announcement, the company pulled out of a planned appearance by executives at last week's ICR investment conference. A GameStop spokesman had pointed Barron's to the conference for commentary on the company's long-term plans. GameStop representatives haven't returned repeated requests seeking comment in the week since.

After the pop last week, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter pointed to the stock's massive short interest, recently at 138% of shares available for trading, according to FactSet data compiled by Dow Jones Market Data. Short-selling analytics firm S3 Partners, which adjusts its short-interest calculations, estimated short interest of about 58% earlier this month.

Such bearish bets have left the stock primed for a short-squeeze, a short-term event where short sellers bid up shares, rushing to cover their positions. Pachter said such short sellers were ""squeezed by rabid retail investors."" He didn't think the pop would last, and has a $16 price target on the stock.

Left's post signaled he'll discuss the technical factors related to short selling at play during his stream, set for 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday. In recent weeks, Barron's has outlined a long-term bearish case. The company is struggling amid broader shifts to free-to-play games and digital downloads, both of which cut out physical game sales.

Despite new consoles from Sony (SNE) and Microsoft (MSFT) that were forecast to drive stronger sales in the broader games industry, GameStop said last week its sales were down 3.1% from last year during the nine-week holiday period. The company pointed to store closures, limited console supply, and the impact of Covid-19. But comparable sales, which strip out the effect of store closures, were only up 4.8% from a rough 2019 holiday period.

Many of the most popular games, like League of Legends and Fortnite, are free to download and play. Instead, publishers offer in-game cosmetic items directly in their online store. For those games, GameStop is often limited to acting as a middleman, selling gift cards for in-game points.

And as more players opt to download games directly on their consoles, it's the gatekeepers of such systems -- Sony, Nintendo (NTDOY), and Microsoft -- that stand to benefit. Meanwhile, PC game distribution is a crowded space. Valve's popular Steam online store is facing some competition from platforms offered by Fortnite maker Epic Games, CD Projekt (CDR.Poland), and Electronic Arts (EA). It's unclear how an old-school retailer like GameStop can make sustainable headway in this already competitive landscape.

Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are also leveraging their cloud infrastructure to offer cloud gaming-streaming services akin to Netflix. Adoption hasn't yet been disruptive to the broader industry. Microsoft, another major cloud player, and Sony have such services that are backed by their libraries of in-house content. GameStop has a profit-sharing deal with Microsoft for its Xbox Game Pass, but Credit Suisse analyst Seth Sigman noted at the time that he was skeptical that such a deal would offset the decline of physical game sales.

Add it all up, and it's clear GameStop will need to execute a radical turnaround plan to stay relevant.

Shares of GME closed $39.36, up 10.87% as shorts continue to be squeezed, though the momentum has clearly be snapped a bit.

* Over at BB land, shares of BlackBerry Ltd. pumped another 25% as the market continues to shift the company's valuation as the Canadian company chugs on with their focus on enterprise security software/service. BB closed up 25.51% to $12.35. 

* NFLX reported stellar numbers as sub count tops 200 mil. New net sub numbered in 8.5 mil, an uptick of 2.2 mil from the previous quarter and beats previous projection of 6 mil by 2.5 mil. NFLX sees Q1 additions of 6 mil. While Q4 EPS was $1.19 vs $1.39, NFLX sees Q1 EPS of $2.97 vs consensus of $2.10, further propelling the stock. Implied move was about 8% for weeklies so for those who YOLO'ed you're gucci as long as you didn't buy some retardedly OTM strike. NFLX is up 12.5% as of writing in AH to $564. DIS is up 2% AH and ROKU is up about 1.6%.

* GM pumped more than 9% today on news of MSFT 2 bil investment in GM's self-driving startup Cruise, valuing the side hustle at 30 bil. The boomer stock has low-key been killing it in the past few years and as Model 3 replaces the entry-level 3 series and C class in various neighborhoods, you'll likely see GM EVs replacing various Hondas and Toyotas in the coming years as well. GM closed up 9.75% to $54.84.

* Bank/financial earnings continues with BAC and GS reporting this morning. Both reported strong quarters tho the run-up may have been a bit too much as both underlyings faced the same sell-off pressure their sector faced last Thursday. BAC authorized a 2.9 bil repurchase plan, shares closed the day down slightly -0.73% to $32.77 while GS closed -2.26% to $294.

* Incoming Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urges Biden to act big to further help the rona punished economy, but also made some notes on raising corporate rates eventually (once the US overcomes rona). With Yellen set to replace Mnunchin, those who enjoyed Mnunchin's various stimulus phone tag with Pelosi will no doubt miss the ""stimulus talks are going well"" pumps.

* Shares of home builders reacted favorably to Biden's $15,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit proposal, though it will likely face an uphill battle in Congress given the various scope and size of the overall stimulus package. LEN is up 2%, DHI up 2.8%, PHM up 3%, NVR up 3.74%, and KBH up 5.5%.

* In WSB meme stock land not named GME and BB, ICLN closed up 2.75% as the cleantech pump resumes, while MT took a beating of -4% to closed at $22.96, despite a slight PT raise of .5 Euro by Morgan Stanley. Surely metal gang won't be another tanker gang situation.

* In recent IPO land, DASH is up 6.20% to $198 (yeah this 60 bil market cap makes tote sense), AFRM is down -5.14% to $110, AI pulled back -5.46% to $126, and ABNB closed up 2.61% to $173.

* The DOW closed up 0.38% or 116 pts, Nasdaq up a strong 1.53% or 198 pts, SPX up 0.81% or 30 pts, and RUT is up 1.32% or almost 28 pts.

* Notable ERs and numbers later this week: UAL, DFS after market close on Wednesday and INTC on Thursday after market close. Housing market index on Wednesday morning at 10 AM ET, jobless claims at 8:30 AM on Thursday, and on Friday PMI at 9:45 AM ET with existing home sales soon to follow at 10 AM ET.

All this Blackberry pump got me hyped and I want to get some action too. BB has potential to moon, but I think a lot of you will still manage to lose money, because you are picking wrong strategies.

**The problem**

I know this sub is obsessed with short term OTM calls. However by buying these you are doing no justice to yourself and this community.

Let me explain. Have you ever wondered who sells you these calls? I'll tell you. Big guys and by big guys I'm talking billion dollar financial institutions that we call **market makers**. Market maker does not care which stock, what strike, how many 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 we put here - all they care about is to **make money by selling you calls.**

Market makers are very good at managing risk. Whenever they sell calls, they make sure they have the underlying stock. That way, they essentially sell **covered calls** instead of **naked calls**.

When you look at the option table, you will notice a column called **Open Interest**. It basically tells you have many option contracts are out there in the wild. Think about this as a number of retards holding these in their Robinhood account, hoping to get rich quickly.

Market makers love when there is a big hype around certain stock, especially certain strike and date. They sell these calls to you retards, and all they have to do as the expiration date nears is make sure **the stock stays below the most popular strike**, aka **strike with the most open interest**.

Why would they do that? Because they **make free money** by selling you these worthless gambling short term tickets.

How would they do this? By shorting the stock. Remember they are so big that they can afford to short the stock and suppress the price of the stock **in the short term** just in time for **your short term calls to expire worthless**.

I know some of you geniuses will tell me that market makers can't manipulate the stock in the short term; sure keep telling yourself that while you ride in your 2010 Toyota Corolla.

**You are easy targets**

Over 11,000 of you idiots, bought $12 February calls. Don't believe me? Check it yourself: [https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350903153433128967/photo/1](https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350903153433128967/photo/1)

All market makers have to do now, is make sure BB does not moon past $12 by February 19 and they are set. You lost your stimulus check money and have no means to play again.

March is even worse: [https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350910637451468801/photo/1](https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350910637451468801/photo/1). All of you piling into $15 strikes. Why are you making yourself easy targets? You are disclosing your strike and your date! What if BB moons in April? Can you sustain wasting money on these monthly calls with your minimum wage jobs?

**The solution**

Buy shares. They do not expire. There is no pressure to be right. You want to be on the 🚀 when it starts taking off, instead of being broke on the ground.

With worthless calls, no one will like you - even this sub will make funny of you.

Believe me. I've been here long enough to remember MSFT 03/21/2020 C $200 and PLTR 12/31/2020 C $30.

**TL;DR**  
Buy BB shares, not short term OTM calls."

Y'all need to read this cos this is the whole fucking thing.

this is also basically my magnum fucking opus so upvote retards. Dont give me awards, legit go buy a powerup membership for a year. Cant tell you to buy shares because we gonna get closed down by SEC somehow.

im also not some fininacial advisor or whatever just read this and make your own conclusions degenerates. Im not fucking liable lmao but i am balls deep 125 shares @ 19 average now, its literally all I have on this earth.

TLDR: GME DD sumarized, Margin wont affect longs the same way as shorts right now. Dont buy shares on margin though and get ready to supply collateral regardless. Short interest is up and some smart retards are on our side. Read the post to raise your IQ from 8 to 9 though. **🐻 🌈s  mega fuk and even posting high level bear shit to scare us.**

Compulsory 7 rockets so you autists dont start having a seizure or something:

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Basically been seeing posts about ""blah blah margin this, short interest this, WS to clever blah"". Going to split this post into distinct sections but im no english degree so dont expect any bear bloomberg  level shit or something

# 1. GME is a fucking steal regardless of squeeze. Buy now or be left on a dying planet while we head to alpha fucking centauri.

So basically everyone here knows about Ryan cohen and his horsemen of the apocalypse coming to steal melvins lunch money. This man bought apple stock in 2017. Hes fucking rich. Hes also an eccommerce wizard, taking CHEWY from a measly 100k co-founded company to a $4 Billion company in 2017 at which point he sold it to petsmart or something. Its now valued at $40 Billion, granted anything eccommerce now gets money thrown at it like a stripper in a high flying strip club or some shit , so dont listen to me, so it may well be a bubble. Regardless the thing grows its revenue like bacteria doing binary fission on agar jelly 🚀🚀🚀🚀.

THEY SELL FUCKING PET FOOD. the market for that is like what? $1?. Gaming is going to the moon and is basically recession proof because of how cheap game is compared to other things for how much you get out of it. Any bears saying that Gamestop cant compete with digital or with amazon. Ryan cohen already slapped amazons head in with a no name brand. Hell fucking do it again. About digital everyone here already knows, microsoft deal, Ryan cohen also mentioned the possibility of having ""Digital game exchanging"" or something, image below.

[Online trade ins. It says online.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/2ba9j5d2zvb61.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b6f3f26c3588fdb8cc779aee8a3b1ce42859f33)

He also mentions streaming, digital content etc and aside from all the digital stuff wants GME to move to a community centric structure where big stores operate with VR centres, Internet cafe, table games like Dungeons and dragons and  40k (rapidly growing somehow will boom post covid) and as we now might know due to this post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme\_dd\_buildapc\_kiosks\_coming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/)

BUILD YOUR OWN PC KIOSKS. This is the literal smell of money. Go to your Gamestop to build your PC with your kid? Gamestop is already the goto place wher your parents go to get you your latest digital fix so now they can go build PC's and it cant go tits up?

**Now for some pussy boomer talk (aka fundametals or something).**

The expected Q3 EPS was -0.84$ or something close to that. The actual loss was -0.53$ but boomzoids only talked about the revenue drop. No shit sherlock its closing all its dead weight stores.

In the holiday report I will talk about a bit more below, 11% of stores were closed and revenue dropped only 3%. Comparitive store sales increased nearly 5%. They cant get enough consoles to sell so expect the momentum to carry on for the whole year I expect. Eccommerce is up 300% over holidays. In Q3 they reported 800% to date. In 2020 Gamestops eccomerce went up 24x. YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT. Online sales now account for \~33% of Gamestops sales now. This is literally gold dust for ryan cohen.

We are still trading at 0.38 P/S at this price. The average P/S for the SP500 is 2.753. Massive upside on these two numbers alone.

Burry got in this for the MOASS and the intrinsic value. At the time intrinsic value was like $22 and this will pump up as RC takes it to new heights.

GME in Q3 somehow halved the expected loss. Big Bad Boomer sherman somehow didnt fuck it up that bad by saying ""omnichannel"" at the speed of light. Yes the revenue dropped 30% but thats covid for you. As the PC kiosk post above shows GME now sells small items basically so fast they have to have fake stock lmao. The new console cycle always spikes the share price sky high too, as youll see in a crayon drawing later. The potential revenue that this console cycle brings in could be huge. Biggest ever is potentially a true statement and Gamestop sells every fucker they get. Combine the fact that they share game pass ( a massive hit) revenue from the xboxes they sell, something no other retailer has, revenue could be sky high.

Now I know you autists are starting to develop short term dyslexia or something but keep reading. This could be the most important piece of shit you read in your life. How do you think I feel? My brains overheating just trying to write coherent sentences.

Holdiay report was a bear trap imo, saw people saying the decrease in revenue was bearish blah blah blah. Lies. Comparitve store sales rose 5% and thats with some towns having like 4 gamestops. When the leases dont get renewed and these stores get liquidated (Also in Ryan cohens letter) they can just get this influx of cash and pay down debt and invest in logistics and marketing and new growth. Gamestop realistically needs like 1/2 the stores they have now and just need to improve efficiency.

[https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890) this article the messiah himself wrote. In it he states:

>At Chewy, we had maniacal discipline when it came to how we spent money. The company-wide culture of frugality came from his example. Free cash flow was our unwavering governor of growth. We grew Chewy from $200 million in sales in 2013 to $3.5 billion in 2018 while spending only $130 million in capital, all of which went into opening distribution centers across the country and acquiring new customers.

Maniacal. Thats all I need to say. The guy is going to get to mars before papa musk and he wont even break a sweat. When FCF starts to catch up to WS expectations every analyst who donwgraded them is gonna get ditched and upgrades will start to happen.

So in the heading i said its a steal. That implies some future higher price target right? Well here is my guess for a conservative price target based on the information above and also some more I probably forgot cos im a retard.

[The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares \(another reason shorts are fuk\)](https://preview.redd.it/dehiug393wb61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=f198773c36d5109382eb2beba6fade3c059121df)

>The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares (another reason shorts are fuk)

This alone means if for not inflation adjusted terms we reached 9.8Bn or whatever the crayon chart says we should reach:

9.8/2.48 = \~3.95   3.95 \* $35.5 = \~$140. The share price now to reach old mkt cap is $140 fucking dollars. Thats a 4 bagger from now. It gets better.

from [statista](https://statista.com) :

>Considering the **annual inflation rate in the United States** in recent years, a 2.24 percent **inflation rate** is a very moderate projection.

If we take 2.24% inflation, the this share price target in todays money means we should reach $182 because of $140 \* 1.0224\^12, = $182 in adjusted. Thats more than a 5 bagger. basically we could see $10 GME price from short manipulation and buying more is basically a lottery ticket!

I really dont understand the bear thesis. The only bear thesis ( short term this one) was that margin would affect longs more but I looked at it on ortex and its basically bullshit. Buy shares with cash though dont use margin. Own your piece of GME dont borrow it. Bears just spout ""DigITaL"" or ""BlOCKbuSTER"" so much Ryan tweeted a shit emoji at them. All the bears think theyre clever. What the fuck makes those guys special? How are they different now than the ones from $2, or $4, or $10.

**Bears are betting against:**

Ryan fucking cohen, buisness legend CHEWY from 100k investment, now 40 billion

Michael burry, Investing legend, predicted the housing crisis and is in GME since april

u/DeepFuckingValue , the new WSB god chad, now basically a whale

Reggie Fils-Aimé, gaming and buisness legend, former COO of nintendo

Senvest, a mega fund thats actively managed

Norweigan sovereign wealth fund

Fidelity, Vanguard and blackrock own this shit and are never selling they literally dont give a shit

All of WSB has now formed a shield wall against the bears

Microsoft gave GME highly discounted azure deals and free office use for all employees and a revenue sharing agreement. Bears are stupid if they think MSFT didnt vet GME.

&#x200B;

Some valid bear thesis left now (the only ones left) ----> Ryan Cohen dies.

# 2. Now some analysis on the short squeeze and some technical data on puts and calls and ortex data.

Ok everyone on here and their cat, dog, bedbugs and wifes boyfriend  knows about the squeeze. Jimmy chill aka cramer even talking about it. Gamestop is literally the most shorted stock of all time and space. The squeeze makes every autist salivate because its basically free money while cucking big money out of like what 1% of their fund.

Although I know all you cucks hate shares, and hate holding, if the squeeze doesnt happen selling is probably the most retarded thing anyone could do. Its literally buy high sell low and you fucking disgust me. STONK ONLY GOES UP.

This squeeze is so monumental that its been sucking sharks in like fresh blood. Most of the funds where shorting this from 30-15 dollars before this year so they didnt really care. It all changed with 2 people. u/DeepFuckingValue and Dr. Michael Burry. These guys are as OG as it gets with GME. I think u/DeepFuckingValue may have even sniffed this trade out before the legend himself. Since then funds will have churned this through their rules and started jumping on this train. Ive been in since $13 with 125 shares. If I had more money Id be buying but im just some stupid student ok. Im merely a medium for this money made information.

**The stats for this stock now short wise are, from ortex:**

*Concrete* short interest as of 31 December 2020: **71 Million**.

*Estimated* short interest, *January 11th data:* (This isnt predicted, this is from data in flow, has margin of error) : **77 Million**

Short shares on loan 7 days ago: **50 Million**

Short shares on loan *now* (This breaks the bearish margin calls affect longs more thesis): 54.2 Million

% of known float short: **147%** as of 31 December 2020

% of know free float on loaned shorts: **108%** as of January 11th.

Some [guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyocql/updated_potential_holdings_of_gme/) on here took into account extra buying on wednesday, Institutions, Burry, RC's extra 7% and WSB ownership (something so stupendously  retarded no serious firm will do it) that float on short could be in the 100s of %. Total short float now I would say could be **200-400%** if the numbers are correct.  This pisses on all other short squeezes. Some countries ban shorting above 100% cos of how autistic it is.

The recent hike in interactive brokers available shares is probably a mix of sell off on friday (remember  some guys are now buying lambos with GME money. If they held they could buy 10), calls exercising and puts being covered and brokers ditching the shares. Nakedshort even reported 5 million naked GME shorts on friday. This is bullish as fuck because the best the shorts could do on a red market day was **-10%**.

Gamestop is still on the SECs threshold list for 27 days now.

[This shows naked short selling and downwards pressure hasnt capitulated](https://preview.redd.it/xsetax08pwb61.jpg?width=1083&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=172439b81f509ba01ed3e6489671d6f009298e84)

Need rockets 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀:

Ok so now if WSB owns an estimated 6-8% of the stock and we all know to move over to cash accounts now to avoid margin calls, we should be minimizing longs getting margin called. Every bear on stockwits is a clueless cuck who spouts ""blockbuster"" and these guys dont even know what margin even is so my bet is the colossal **54 Million** shares short on loan are gonna be affected by the margin calls more. Why? Because every long on margin is in the green, and now a true zealot/extremist/autist for ryan cohen so will supply their account with collateral to avoid margin call. Shorts are in the massive red zone. How do I know you ask?

Ortex data from Jan 4th 2021:

[This is the data from ortex for short interest for Gamestop for Jan 4th](https://preview.redd.it/urqb3c3zbwb61.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=d874cd908bad7fe3e8aa4486b5a294f5c1d5724e)

So this shows for jan 4th the estimated short interest is 66.98 Million shares. From the exchange reported 71 Million on december 31st this makes a lot of sense because the share price fell from \~21 to \~17 so shorts took profits. The shares on loan arent for longs too. This is all purely short data, and 47M  shorted at $17 this shows.

These shorts are in a circle of hell we cant comprehend and makes satan scared.

SHARES ON LOAN HAVE GONE UP.  BUT 87% OF LOANED SHORTS WHERE SHORTING AT SUB $20.

Cost to borrow is also up, estimated short interest is up to a cataclysmic amount.

Longs on margin need to supply collateral, but we are in the massive green zone, shorts are underwater. Margin calls will ravage the shorts and sting the longs. We also have the uptick rule in place until the end of the day, so shorts can only short on the way up.

**Seen a lot of talk about Gamma hedging and delta.**

You realize that the fucking bankers and brokers dont understand gamma hedging right? That shits up their with the black-scholes equation and feynman-kac solution. Forget about it. The retards claiming to understand it are either payed by hedge funds or lose money. The guy who took out outs thinking options exercising and gamma hedging would lead to a collossal sell off on friday lost money on his puts because **no one** except some quants in a goldman sachs server room know this shit. The idea is simple about neutral delta on options that people take out, but the simple system interacts with every other thing in the stock market, and wow who couldve guessed it, like nearly any other element of the stock market predicting something by the day is nigh impossible. That guy talking about Gamma , Delta and margin calls is on weeklies. Hes no more autistic and equally retarded as all of us. Hes a chill guy though so dont berate a fellow brother.

**Now weve established the likelihood of longs getting margin called is far smaller than shorts, on to the options distributions**

**Two images now: Top one is before the end of the 15th, the other one is after market close:**

These two graphs, show before market close and after. As we can see the massiver 51000 put contracts didnt get rolled over and the chances that those were melvins july puts rolled up is very high. They expired worthless. Lots of calls are printing big time while huge amounts of puts are worthless and bleeding money.

Something else we can extrapolate from the charts is that massive options trades are not present on the scale we saw before (tens of thousands).

We are seeing a discrepancy in the number of puts/calls opening up at the higher prices with calls gaining fast. This could show that some funds are now becoming optimistic on the long or short term prospects of gamestop. There are also more puts than options and if we assume this for shorts vs longs on margin (without even taking into account that all shorts are borrowed shares and pay interest further bleeding cash) then shorts are likely on more margin than longs.

Regardless fellow autists my main point is two show that the bears are underwater and the bulls are flying high with regards to options.

**Now lets compare this possible squeeze with others.**

Bear in mind this is the most shorted stock of all time, but differences in free float change the share price differently.

Kodak went from **$2.16 to $33.2**

Volkswagen went from **\~200 euro to nearly 1000.**

Overstock went from **\~$21 to $123**

Blue apron went from **$2.31 to $18**

Ive been seeing some estimated that 1 million shares is roughly a dollars move in share price. This maths is about to be pretty autistic so bear with me degnerates.

$1 now is 2.81% of the share price. Everything in the markets is exponential and based on percentages. So if we assume a full squeeze of ortexs estimated short interest (This assumes no sell off and no new shorts, new shorts can be positive or negative depedning on when in the squeeze they happen) **$35.5 \* 1.0281\^77 = $299.** GME to moon. 🌑 .

This shit can happen. Hold on.

**GME has squeezed and been manipulated before and it always happens around the console cycles. Shorts never win and they wont win now.**

&#x200B;

[This post right here I found months ago and got me in the squeeze from the honourable and valiant u\/Uberkikz aka Rod Alzman](https://preview.redd.it/4ysv7bzclwb61.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=27ac6ac58b6366f81b53fa75966733b8a8d61d3c)

Basically the crayon chart shows green (outstanding shares) orange ( short shares) purple (Market cap) and cyan (Share price). In 2006-2008 the share price rose in tandem with short interest ( Like now ) Until console releases when you can see an abrupt squeeze happend mooning the share price.

This happend to a degree in 2013 with the xbox one but worse conditions for the company and a worse console launch lead to slow short covering but the share price still mooned.

Now we get to the best part. History is repeating itself for the third time and the shares sold short are literally higher than the outstanding shares, which have been decreasing since 2010. Short shares are also at the highest point ever and GME hasnt had a brighter future, well ever. Ps5 and Xbox Series X. are the two most hyped consoles since the Ps2. This is setting up the foundations for massive price movements weve never seen before. This shit has literally never happend, ever. Uncharted waters and we are the captain.

**For the insurmountably retarded autists who think that the squeeze has happend look upon this and despair:**

IHOR IS A MEGA WIZARD

Ihor I quote:

>**A long-buying tsunami ... is the primary factor for the price move**

Ihor Dusaniwsky is managing director of predictive analytics at S3 a firm similar to ortex. He told bloomberg that the squeeze hasnt happend yet and that this was long buying. If someone knows this shit its him. He was talking about the tesla squeeze in january 2020. He has access to resources we can only imagine. Barrons cut his comment that the squeeze hasnt happend yet out it was that fucking bullish. All the media ramming down ""Short squeeze has happend"" down peoples throats because bears are fucking scared.

The bots on stocktwits spamming bearish sentiment should show how rattled they are.

Edit: **You fucking degens just enlightened me that cramer pump is real, funds are ruminating over the long weekend, and stmmy bills pumps stonks and that stimmy bill buys many an xbox. See you at andromeda! Also more rockets.**

>There’s also the chance of a ratings upgrade. Moody’s and S&P have GME at B3 and B-, which is rated “highly speculative”. Ratings are reviewed every quarter, and a review might be due this month (i.e. this coming week or next). Good chance that the agencies might upgrade GME to a B2/B, or even better to the next higher band (Ba/BB).

Edit 6: We are scraping 42 in frankfurt. Granted its low volumes but pre market should open at these prices I think?

**Conclusion: Buy shares with cash not margin.

**GameStop (GME)**

**Bear Thesis**

* Game console cycle in 2020
   * Boost in revenue due to new console cycle is temporary
   * Low margin on distributing game consoles
   * Main profit margin comes from software and virtual goods
* Brick & mortar is dying due to digitalization of gaming
   * Largest profit center for Gamestop is pre-owned and value video game
   * High revenue but low profit on new video game hardware and software sales
   * Gaming market is moving towards online game download instead of physical discs (Steam, Riot, Gaming Consoles)
   * It’s a matter of time game console manufacturers do not need them for distribution or service centers for their hardware
* Microsoft deal
   * A share of Microsoft Xbox’s digital revenue goes to Gamestop
   * Revenue share unannounced
   * What’s next after the multi-year deal end?
   * Revenue share does not include pre-owned console sales
* Continued closing of physical stores
   * Signifies accelerated closing of business
   * Directors taking profits after record week
   * Older board members sold part of their shares to profit after the record week
      * /u/Invisible0815 pointed out "" board members most likely sold because they will not stand for re-election in june. AND they didnt sell all their shares. one member had to sell because of his own funds regulations. i bet u, he didnt want to sell (hestia capital, he should be on cohens side cause he hates old management). ""

&#x200B;

* Bull case counterarguments from /u/baystreetdegenerate
   * Nintendo next game console in 2022
      * Okay, what happens in the downtime between console releases
      * **OP's reply**: Current generation of consoles are still being traded at GameStop, which is one of their revenue stream
   * Data is a key asset as the company can use it to analyse new trends in gaming Data can be monetized by selling it to gaming manufacturers or developers
      * Outside of tracking customer behavior on their website and sales and trade-in data what else can they even collect? Developers and manufacturers have multiple, and probably better ways of collecting data already and I don't think whatever sort of data GS can gather will be worth much
      * **OP's reply:** Yes, I agree with you that developers and manufacturers have their own way of collecting data. However, GameStop will be able to provide data on the market overview of the gaming industry if they manage to pull of being a centralized e-commerce giant
   * Turning physical stores into a showcase vendor’s games or new concepts
      * That's what youtube is for...
      * **OP's reply:** I believe there's a market for people who prefer physical roadshows or showcases compared to online videos.
   * Possibility to create a neutral platform for trading digital goods and charge a small fee for facilitating transactions
      * Like Steam's marketplace? Aren't most tradeable items on Steam from Valve games? This idea would require games from unrelated devs to have tradeable digital goods and that they would sign it over to GameStop's trading platform, but why would they do that? What would they gain out of it? Or are you talking about digital goods like digital copies of games? No gaming company would allow trading/reselling of digital copies of games. This idea is a non-starter.
      * **OP's reply:** I do agree this idea seem far-fetched, but there is a possibility that it can be pulled off.
   * E-sports tournaments/leagues to be held at physical stores
      * This idea of turning physical stores into social hangouts like the Warhammer DnD game stores is a little sketchy. Because 1) it requires investment into physical space and 2) it essentially turns the store into a PC bang which only really works in Asia due to costs and culture. Furthermore, why would I go out of my way to play games with a bunch of sweaty nerds at a GS store when I could just do it at home without smelling their BO?
      * **OP's reply:** They may convert several stores into PC shops for the purpose of E-sports leagues/tournaments only but not operate a PC shop business. There's definitely money to be made in the growing e-sports scene. E.g. advertising, streaming, etc.
   * RYAN COHEN: e-commerce
      * How does his expertise in pet food ecommerce translate into brick and mortar gaming stores?
      * **OP's reply:** We are speculating that the management are going to announce their plans between Apr-Jun 2021.
   * Low price to sales ratio at 0.4476 as at 15/1/21
      * Well, yes, because there's no clear path to long term revenue

**Bear case conclusion**: Business turnaround fails and trend towards book value at a price target of $5.

&#x200B;

I don’t do options or techincal analysis so please refer to other posts for that info.

$GME had been on my radar for quite some time but I finally dipped my toes in two weeks ago.  The basis for that wasn’t the potential for a short squeeze or short interest but the underlying fundamentals behind $GME.  I had posted a long comment in a previous thread and will expand on that to explain why I’m bullish long term for $GME.  I hope this helps.  This post is meant to be a personal opinion and not advice to buy or sell Gamestop.

🐻 Case: 

1.  Digital sales will make Gamestop the next Blockbuster.  

The digital game sales argument, like all 🐻  arguments, are weak.  The shift to digital will possibly occur in the next console cycle.  So maybe the 🐻 are right, but they’re right in 8 years which means they’re wrong now.  Additionally digital sales growth has decelerated and are returning to pre-covid levels as more
people go back to stores.  This trend should continue if the pandemic improves.  Additionally game publishers don’t care about the fractionally
larger margins from selling digital direct.  They only care about moving as many units as quickly as possible.  If they could sell the games on floppy disks they would.  Go read the public filings for any game publisher and they will tell you that they only care about selling what customers want and guess what, they still want physical. 

Blockbuster died because Carl Icahn got involved, killed Blockbuster’s attempt to pivot to a Netflix model by offering an online rental service and Blockbuster’s old business model relied on late fees.  Icahn insisted that Blockbuster's greatest asset was its physical location and late fees, killed the pivot and forced them to triple down on their old strategy.  Carl ended up losing 98% of his investment in Blockbuster.  There continues to be demand for physical movie rentals as evidenced by Red Box locations and Netflix still has a few million dvd by mail subscribers.

Gamestop has also recently started to pivot away from software sales into other areas and now software sales now make up large minority of Gamestop's total sales.  They're pivoting more towards physical goods and not just Funko Pops but also plan to expand more into new areas like PC gaming and hardware.  

Everyone knows that they signed a revenue agreement with Microsoft where Gamestop will get a cut of the lifetime revenue from Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.  This shouldn't sour the relationship with Sony or Nintendo.  If anything, Sony and Nintendo should be compelled to offer a similar revenue share agreement because Gamestop will inevitably push Microsoft products if Gamestop stand to profit more from it.  This will be a bigger deal in later years as console availability increases and consumers actually deciding to cross shop consoles as opposed to getting whichever new one is available right now.  Sony and Nintendo won't stop selling products through Gamestop because of this agreement with Microsoft, it's too large of a sales channel to give up.

2.  Gamestop will go bankrupt

This is highly unlikely to happen.  Gamestop managed to survive the single worst brick and mortar retail sales environment in modern history and ended the year with a cash surplus of a few hundred million.  Now its the new year and the beginning of a new console cycle.  This console cycle should last as long as the previous ones which is close to a decade, plus or minus a few years.  During that time, they will be printing money hand over fist selling consoles, new games, used games, accessories, protection plans, etc.

3.  Brick and mortar retail is dead.  Gamestop locations are shutting down left and right, this must mean they're going bankrupt.

Gamestop's average lease durations are actually quite short.  A lot of brick and mortar shops have lease duration lasting a decade but the average lease duration for Gamestop is just 2-4 years.  This allows them to close underperforming stores and open new ones very quickly.

Gamestop's saw e-commerce grow by 250% last quarter.  The company has been and continues to pivot towards a ""digital-first, omni-channel ecosystem for games and entertainment""

🐂 Case

This MOASS could be long and protracted like Tesla in all of 2020 as many continue to bet against Gamestop, instead of a sharp spike like Volkswagen, where Porsche played a large role in spiking the share price.  Keep in mind that at 1x sales, the share price should be $80-100.  Compare that with another retailer Chewy, which has a p/s of 6-7x.  Pet products also has a much lower TAM than gaming.  

This isn’t even factoring in a complete turnaround that RC has to be planning.  Look at the newest board composition.  Newest members are Reggie (my body is ready), the head of cloud 9 esports, and the current president Petsmart and Chewy. board member.  Ask yourself, are these the people that would join the board of a company that is expected to die in 5 years due to digital game sales.  

This has moved beyond a short squeeze yolo to a long term hold.  If RC succeeds in transforming this into the next Chewy, you’re looking at a 20x multiple.  This is based on fundamentals and industry tailwinds.  I added 10k shares weeks ago and added 20k shares at $38 because this thing is going much higher and idgaf about a few bucks in share price right now.  Also don’t attempt to time the market because you could be left behind at the launchpad.  

Simply put, if I told you there was a business that served a $200 billion total addressable market with very discerning and loyal customers with a lot of disposable income to spend on this market.  They have over 5,000 retail locations all across the world.  Last quarter, they saw Ecommerce grow by nearly 300% and ended a year where many other brick and mortar retailers went bankrupt with hundreds of millions of dollars in extra cash.  This company has a database called PowerUp consisting of tens of millions of customers that pay them a yearly premium membership.  They're starting a multiyear pivot into several new growing areas and have new board members that are industry leaders in each of those respective areas at the start of a new product launch cycle that will last a decade.  A young visionary founder who made his billions by creating a customer centric experience that defeated Amazon, who is well known to focus on one idea to the point of obsession, just became this company's largest shareholder and now controls the board.  I tell you this company trades at .5 sales.  Would you short or long this company?


TLDR:  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 But not because of the MOASS.

[*Obligatory do your own research and draw your own conclusions statement.*]

**POSITIVES**

- Both Sony and Microsoft are using custom AMD APUs in their latest consoles. (APU = CPU + GPU combined into one.) In case you've been living under a rock for the past 8 weeks, both the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X have been selling like hotcakes, with fresh inventory being depleted within minutes. 

- AMD has been the underdog vs Intel in the consumer desktop CPU space for as long as I can remember. But for the first time in 15 years, [AMD is winning in terms of market share](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-overtakes-intel-in-desktop-cpu-market-share-for-the-first-time-in-15-years). Intel has been able to stay competitive with their latest generation of CPUs by offering significant discounts. Despite this, AMD's CPUs still remain in higher demand and sell out almost instantly (at MSRP). 

- AMD owns Radeon, which is their brand of Graphics Cards. These compete directly with Nvidia's RTX GPUs. Performance wise, they're up there with NVDA, but still lagging a bit in the ray tracing department which most will agree is the future. Key word being future, it's not a big deal *yet*. And thanks to the pandemic these too also sell out super quick. 

- AMD's next generation of mobile CPUs will be launching soon. Just like their desktop lineup, you can expect these to outperform their Intel counterparts as well. AMD's previous mobile generation of 4000 series chips crushed Intel - the biggest problem was availability. People wanted the AMD chips but for whatever reason, they were found mostly in the mid-range and lower end gaming laptops. I expect the availability issue to improve greatly this year. As we can see, certain manufacturer's like Asus are already featuring the AMD SKUs in their [top of the line gaming laptops](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-ROG-Strix-Scar-17-ditches-Comet-Lake-H-for-an-unlocked-Ryzen-9-5900HX-with-liquid-metal-and-RTX-3080-Mobile.514702.0.html). 

**RISK FACTORS**

- While speaking purely from a monetary standpoint, overall I think the pandemic has been a net positive for tech companies like AMD. However, AMD's own fearless leader Lisa Su recently said: [""...the COVID environment has increased shipping and freight costs, which are hard to avoid. As we get into a more normal environment, this should improve. This also matters for our planned graphics updates through the first half of the year, as we have a lot of product coming to market.""](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16409/amd-ceo-dr-lisa-su-interview-on-2021-demand-supply-tariffs-xilinx-and-epyc)

- Unable to keep up with demand: [AMD and NVIDIA confirm that GPU stock levels will remain non-existent for the foreseeable future](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-and-NVIDIA-confirm-that-GPU-stock-levels-will-remain-non-existent-for-the-foreseeable-future.514957.0.html).
[Microsoft has asked AMD for help in combating Xbox Series X stock shortages](https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-has-asked-amd-for-help-in-combating-xbox-series-x-stock-shortages)

- Apple has already started producing their own in house ARM processors for both their laptops and desktops. This doesn't really affect AMD (yet) because [Apple has been using Intel chips in their laptops and desktops for the past 15 years.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/why-apple-is-breaking-a-15-year-partnership-with-intel-on-its-macs-.html#:~:text=Menu-,Apple%20is%20breaking%20a%2015%2Dyear%20partnership%20with,on%20its%20Macs%20%E2%80%94%20here's%20why&text=Apple's%20new%20laptops%20and%20desktop,can%20improve%20laptop%20battery%20life.) And despite being a massive company, Apple only makes up about [13% of the PC market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/576473/united-states-quarterly-pc-shipment-shareapple/#:~:text=In%20the%20fourth%20quarter%20of,the%20fourth%20quarter%20of%202020.). AMD is still Apple's partner for discrete graphics, but that could change soon. This is definitely something you'll want to keep your eye on though because other titans like [Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/article/microsoft-processors-int/microsoft-working-on-in-house-chips-for-its-servers-pcs-idUSKBN28S2Y1), [Google](https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2020/04/google-is-making-its-own-chips.html), and Amazon are all either working on, or producing their own in house chips. In my opinion, this is not nearly as bad as it sounds. Let's break it down by company.

 - [Microsoft currently uses Intel-based processors for the majority of its Azure cloud services, and most of the company’s Surface lineup run on Intel chips, too.](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189450/microsoft-arm-processors-chips-servers-surface-report#:~:text=Microsoft%20has%20worked%20with%20AMD,move%20away%20from%20just%20Intel.&text=Microsoft%20co%2Dengineered%20an%20ARM,a%20couple%20of%20months%20ago.) Only some of Microsoft's laptops run on AMD hardware.

I probably would not recommend trying to play off of that though as ERs can be quite unpredictable, especially if the news is positive. Personally, I think AMD is going to 🚀🚀 after ER, but I'm not betting on that. Which is why my current position (30% of my portfolio) is LEAPS: (x2) Jan 2022 90c.

Profit taking and volatile swings brought the shares down to a modest close of ""only"" up 57% at $31.40. u/DeepFuckingValue, who has titanium alloy diamond hands (now known as DFV hands) posted an update and to the surprise of no one, is still holding his 1,000 contracts of Jan 15 $20c on Wednesday afternoon. (Note: He took gains on the contracts today though I'm not sure at what point in the day while keeping his April $12c).

* The pump action resumed for GME this Thursday morning with premarket pushing the underlying back to $38 once again and commenced to another wild session of large movements. Initially trading around $34 to $36 in morning, GME started to rip once again when noon struck and ran as high as $43 for the day. GME closed the day up 27% to $40. If you're STILL not in GME, these back-to-back days have pushed IV to new highs and even OTM contracts months out will be commanding large premium (~160%+ IV for April and 140%+ for July). Proceed with caution (who am I kidding just go all in).

* Morning economic numbers: jobless claims continues its dismal trend, with first-time claims hitting 965k last week vs the consensus of 800k (oof). Last week's total was 784k. As with before, market did not react to the numbers cuz its PrIcEd iN. Import prices rose 0.9 in Dec vs 0.6 expected.

* Jpow spoke at 12:30 PM today in a Princeton Uni session and reaffirmed what everyone has largely expected: rates will continue to be low and while the Feds will raise rate eventually, Jpow says that its ""no time soon"" given economic situation.

* Are they big tech or big cuck? The market reversed course and big tech continues their sell off, with MSFT, AAPL, NFLX, and AMZN all retreating more than -1% as yet another sector rotation commenced. Payment providers got an extra dose of sell-off with V closing at -3.43% and MA closing at -5.25%, despite both having positive PT from Deutsche Bank today with V having a PT increase of $270 from $220 and MA PT increase of $420 from $383.

* Small caps performed strongly today as money flow throughout the day into ""value"" grabs. RUT/IWM closed the day up 2%. Notable underlyings beyond GME are BBBY (up 18.77%), MIK (up 9.6%), M (up 5%), WSM (up 4%), and KIRK (up 9.58%).

* In WSB meme stock land MT continues in its channel, gaining 2.95% today to close at $24.81 PLTR got hit with another downgrade, this time via Citi as the analysts believes the stock is vulnerable to a few upcoming catalyst, including lockup expiry and an deceleration in growth. PT for Citi is $15 (don't worry tho surely WSB is ""in control"" with this stock too). PLUG drilled more than -5.74% during intraday low as JPM initiated with a neutral rating and downgraded sector competitor FCEL. PLUG closed the day down -4.26% to $64.63 while FCEL closed the day down -8% to $17.60, fending off intraday low of more than -12%. ICLN, the clean tech ETF continues its range bound trading and will likely require a clear catalyst in terms of what the $2 tril stimulus actually entails to move further. Buckle up, loser.

* Despite being green most of the day, major indexes retreated to red as power hour neared. Indexes went red and lost all its morning gains as the sell-off accelerated into closing hours. DOW closed the day down -0.22% or -69 pts, IXIC closed down -0.12% or -16 pts, SPX closed -0.38% or -14 pts, and RUT closed up 2% or 43 pts. While the retreat was modest compare to yesterday's close, the intraday reversal was quite jarring esp if you're trading FDs (and let's face it, you definitely were loading up on those Jan 1/15 calls).

* Earning season will soon be upon us and the first wave are starting later this week. Tomorrow morning financials kick things off as WFC, JPM, and C are all reporting before market opens. If banks shat the bed, expect a pounding for the Dow given how large of a component they are still to the stupid index. Expectations are fairly high as JPM has had a flurry of upgrades in the past few days with PT of $150 from Piper Sandler, $152 from Jefferies, and an upgrade to buy from neutral at BofA.

* Biden will unveil his $2 tril stimulus package/plan in a speech later tonight at 7:15 PM ET. Please pump those green tech cuz I have an embarrassing amount in SPAC/EVs.

Hi everyone, thanks for coming back for Part 2. I’m excited to bring you more research and insights on Smartsheet (NYSE: SMAR). Let’s dive in.

**Can we 10X from here?**

For someone like me that is on the younger side and with a longer investment time horizon, and probably you if you are reading this, an important question to ask yourself is “Do I think this investment could 10x from here?”. In other words, could this investment one day be 10 times what it is worth today? To try to answer this question, I will work through a pre-determined framework that I believe gives us the best path to find out.

The framework includes:

Leadership – Desire, Purpose and Ownership

Risk Considerations

Price Considerations

Explosive Business Growth

**1. Leadership – Desire, Purpose, Ownership**

For a company to do something as spectacular as 10x, we are going to need to see really strong and talented leadership. In Chris Mayer’s excellent book “100 Baggers”, he dedicates a part of the book to talk about the importance of what he calls “Owner Operators”. By this he means that the CEO of the company owns a substantial amount of stock in the company themselves. Why is this important? If the CEO has their own personal wealth at stake in the company’s stock (just like we do as shareholders) their interests are more aligned with shareholders and maximizing returns for shareholders than they would be if that CEO had no skin in the game. It’s also better in my opinion if the CEO of the company was also the founder of the company. For these founder-CEO’s that have money invested in their own company, it really is like their baby. Would you rather have your money invested with someone who views the company as their baby or with someone who was just hired to watch this kid (the company)?

In the case of Smartsheet, we check all the boxes when it comes to leadership. Mark Mader is not only an Owner Operator, he is also a co-founder. I touched on this a little bit in part 1, but Mark co-founded Smartsheet along with Brent Frei in 2005. They both played football (American football) for Dartmouth College, an Ivy League School. They met in the fall of 1988 when Mark was a freshman on the team and Brent, who had graduated the prior year, was serving as a Graduate Assistant for the team.

After that season, Brent moved on to begin a career in computer engineering. Mark quit the football team after 1 year. In an interview with Forbes, he said that after his freshman season he thought it was too much to juggle Ivy League academics and being a NCAA Division 1 athlete. Mark started focusing solely on academics until a tragedy struck. One of his best friends from his high school football team got into an accident and was critically injured. His friend would never be able to play football again. This had a profound impact on Mark. He said in the interview that knowing one of his friends would never be able to play again made him realize that if he still has the ability to play football, he needs to go do it. He went to his old coach, told him the story about his friend and asked for his spot on the team back. The coach accepted and Mark went on to finish his career in the fall of 1991 as a 6’4”, 245lb offensive lineman.

Mark said that this experience with his friend and re-joining the football team taught him not to take anything for granted. He said ever since then he tries to do his best with everything and make the most out of every opportunity. That mindset has served him well as he now sits as a CEO of a $8.5 billion company. But he’s really just getting started. That mindset lives on today. The day that he took Smartsheet public, April 27, 2018, he was asked if he plans on celebrating the achievement, he said “We have 74,000 customers that don’t want us to party, they want us to work on the product.” How did Mark get to the point where he was CEO of a tech company with 74,000 customers that raised $150 million during their IPO? I’ll share with you a little more history behind the company.

After Brent Frei left Dartmouth, he started his career in computer engineering as I mentioned before. His career started with Motorola in 1989, then he went to Microsoft in 1991, and then he founded his first company, Onyx Software in 1994. It didn’t take long before his buddy from college, Mark Mader, would come join him at the start-up. Mark joined in 1995 and eventually worked his way up to an Executive role within the firm.

The focus of Onyx was Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. Brent was the CEO and Mark became the SVP of Global Services. Brent led the company through an IPO in 1999 right before the tech bubble burst. It was really unfortunate timing because a lot of their customers were dotcoms that went out of business. Brent was still able to lead them through stiff competition with Salesforce in the early 2000’s until he hit a plateau in 2004. He decided to step down from the company he had founded 10 years earlier. On his last call with investors, he was quoted as saying “I believe it’s the right time for me to turn over the reins to a new CEO who can take Onyx to new heights over the next decade,”. All the while, Mark was there in the background learning and observing. He saw what went right – they built a large publicly traded company from scratch. And he saw what went wrong – their growth stalled as they lost market share to Salesforce.

Only a year after resigning from Onyx, Brent was on to his next big move and he again recruited his friend Mark to help. They were going to found Smartsheet, a company to help improve the way people work. This time, Mark was a Co-Founder along with Brent and had a much bigger influence on the company. His influence got even larger in 2017, 12 years after the founding, when Brent left to found his 3rd company, TerraClear. Brent left to go back to his roots in Idaho where he grew up on the family farm. His new start-up TerraClear seeks to solve one of the largest unsolved problems in farming today – clearing rocks from farming land. As crazy as that sounds, apparently it’s a big issue. Hence the name, TerraClear. Brent is still on the Board of Directors of Smartsheet.

Going back to the IPO date (April 27, 2018), which was only 4 months after Brent had left, Mark was asked by the press what he had learned from being at Onyx when they went public. Mark was very clear in his response and said that one of the main lessons from Onyx was to “not get too enamored with your product”. With Smartsheet, he wants to make sure they’re always improving the product and the user experience. He also said that investors don’t buy a stock based on what you’ve done in the past, but what you plan to do. “If you are always looking at the rear view mirror, then you are not running the business” he said. This is exactly how I want the leaders of companies I invest in to be thinking. He is very forward thinking, customer focused, and humble. There is a lot of evidence to corroborate that he has followed through on the statements he made that day.

One of the first pieces of evidence I found that supports my thesis of Mark being very focused on the product and user experience is the incredible ratings that the product has received from its customers. I use a tool called Net Promoter Score (NPS) which is one of the most reliable and unbiased ways to find out what a customers true experience with a business is and how likely they would be to recommend it to a friend. For Smartsheet, their NPS is extremely high. It’s on a scale of -100 to 100 so anything above 0 is considered to be good. If the rating is above 0, it essentially more people would recommend the product to a friend than they would tell them not to use it. Smartsheet has an NPS of 80, which is honestly one of the highest I have ever seen.

Further evidence to support Mark and the rest of management’s commitment to product quality and user experience is the exceptional ratings the product has on the Apple App Store. This is just for the mobile version of the product, the app that you can download on your phone just like you would download the mobile version of Outlook. The rating in the App Store is 4.8/5. That’s very impressive as well.

Based on how customers are responding to the product, I think it’s fair to say that Mark was not [B.S.ing](https://b.s.ing/) his way through that interview on IPO day. He and his management team really have been focused on creating a stellar product and the results are showing. When I say that “Desire and Purpose” are important traits of a leader of a company it means that I want to see a leader who has a real desire to do what he/she is doing as the CEO of the company, believes in their product(s) and services, and has a real purpose for why they want to do that. I can tell that Mark is committed to the mission of improving the way people work. Being one of the founders, and having written an E-Book on the “Productivity Paradox” that I mentioned in Part 1, I think this mission is very near and dear to his heart and that he has a desire to see the impact and scale of his company grow well into the future. As shareholders, that’s what we want.

Another way to see if the leader of the company has “Desire and Purpose” is to see how his/her employees perceive them. Do the employees look up to this person? Do they feel motivated to work hard because they know what they’re doing is meaningful and can make a positive difference in people’s lives? One way I have of gaining insight into this is to look at the company’s Glassdoor ratings and specifically the rating of the CEO. In the case of Smartsheet, the positive story continues. The company has a 4.1/5 rating on Glassdoor and Mark has a 90% approval rate from his employees which is well above average. To me this shows he’s communicating the company’s purpose to the employees very well and is motivating them to actualize that purpose.

There’s one other piece of evidence I stumbled upon that gives good insight into the culture that Mark and his management team are building at Smartsheet. They were recently (12/17/20) awarded “Best Company Culture” and “Best Companies for Women” by Comparably. Below you can see a screenshot of the headline from a Business Wire article about this. It’s one thing to be awarded for “Best Company Culture” but to also be a “Best Companies for Women” when you’re in a heavily male dominated industry such as computer software, that really says something. It speaks to the culture of diversity and inclusiveness that Mark is building there which goes a long way in the year 2021 when social issues are at the forefront of people’s minds more than ever. The modern enterprise has to build a culture of diversity and inclusiveness if they want to retain the most talented employees and keep them motivated. Smartsheet is doing a good job of this.

Source – Smartsheet making headlines for their outstanding company culture.

I think we’ve found a lot of evidence to support that this leadership team has a strong desire to fulfil their purpose. It’s evident that they want to help improve the way people work and that they’ve invested heavily into making this happen while keeping employees motivated and focused on the goal. The last piece I look at for leadership is ownership. Does the CEO have a personal financial stake in the company? This is such a key thing to look for because as I mentioned earlier in the article, if leadership themselves owns a substantial amount of shares, then their interests and motivations will align with us, the shareholders. They essentially are a shareholder too, just like us. On top of the desire and purpose that we’ve established is present, there’s also a financial incentive for Mark and the team to lead the company to success, and ultimately, a higher share price.

Currently, Mark holds 490,267 shares which comes out to a value of $34 million as of this writing (1/14/21). I’d consider that substantial for an individual person. Even more noteworthy is that Brent owns 3.2 million shares which comes out to a value of $218 million. Brent owns that much of the company still and he’s not even involved beyond being on the Board of Directors. I think that’s a testament to how much confidence he has in Mark to lead Smartsheet to new heights. Also, it’s important to keep in mind that he left Smartsheet to help with his family business. He saw his 80 year old Dad picking up rocks on the farm with his bare hands and realized he wanted to help solve this problem in the farming industry. Leaving Smartsheet was not like when he left Onyx because the business was plateauing. As a matter of fact, Smartsheet was rapidly growing at that time and was about to go public. The fact that he still has $218 million worth of shares in the company shows he still believes in the company and what Mark can do with it now and in the future.

This concludes Part 2 of my Smartsheet deep dive. Hope you enjoyed and be sure to subscribe so you can stay tuned for Part 3, our next pick, and news &amp; updates about existing picks.

My sermon today is an examination of why some of our fellow autists have become millionaires while I continue to live in a cardboard box. 

I was an early-ish follower of the $GME faith, but when tribulations came my faith was shaken. I still went to church, but my heart wasn't in it like those we look up to. We must reflect on our failures to grow as followers in Cohen. 

This testimony is long (sorry). I needed to force myself to actually examine things so I don't fuck up the next opportunity for tendies. This is my penance.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**: Retard examining why I made small gains off $GME despite being in months ago. I keep track of all my trades. $GME has been a rollercoaster of emotions and opportunities in a very short time, so lots to learn. 

&#x200B;

# Takeaways

1. I never truly committed or believed in the position. It remained a small % of my portfolio and I was always hedging because being down even a couple % hurt, let alone -20% swings. To find 20X return you have to invest in companies that have significant uncertainty (and volatility). That  means persuasive arguments on both sides. If you lack conviction you won't be able to stay in.  
2. Follow those charts and imagine you don't know where we end up. Put yourself in that moment. Holy fuck. **Am I buying the dip or catching a falling knife**? This has been bumpy and uncertain. We can all pretend this was a sure thing, it wasn't. It still isn't.
3. We've all heard Fear and Greed rule the market. Its one thing to say that. Its another to feel it and observe it in yourself. My mood on $GME has flipped from ""This motherfucking boomer CEO is burning all my $"" to ""Fat FIRE, this year, motherfuckers"" 4 times in as many months. I felt intense emotions (still feeling them during the current run). W/o acclimating to balance that out I think its impossible to make good decisions. 
4. I'm very glad I kept detailed notes on what I was doing. Write down your thoughts and reason for taking a position. Revisit these. We're all retards. But that doesn't mean we can't learn our bad habits and improve. I'm stunned looking back by how often I was paralyzed and couldn't take action. 
5. None of this was obvious. There were strong cases that the business was undervalued. It was a good bet. But it was a bet. (Blasphemy you say? The true prophet, RoaringKitty said on yesterday's stream that as June turned into July and August and no PE firm or other investors stepped in he began to wonder if he was right). The business was bleeding cash, it just wasn't hemorrhaging like bears thought. The management is out of touch. COVID could have been worse. The broader market could have sold off, offsetting anything $GME did (and probably making sentiment even worse). 
6. I believe at $30-$40 the core business is reasonably priced and the value thesis is proved out. There are other stories (short squeeze and the business transformation) that remain. IMO these are far less certain, but in this market a good story might be worth $100.

I hear about $GME. The business model of buy kids consoles for pennies on the dollar seems lucrative, video game sales in general are good, but COVID + things going digital are big question marks. The stock is up a lot from lows, but only liars buy at the low and sell at the high. Still seems reasonable, I sold weekly $10P (felt good about this).  Put premiums were good (3.6% for 3 days) and I figured I could get write for a couple weeks before being assigned. 

Also, picked up some 1/15/21 $30C (retard FOMO, I even noted as much ""Getting in w/o doing full research based on Burry and Ryan Cohen + extremely high short interest. Very speculative at this point. Console refresh upcoming + GME while not vibrant is healthy balance sheet wise"").

MSFT news released. No real details. Some people are mocking it saying it is just an agreement to buy MSFT products. Yeah, that's one way to read it. (We're 3 months past this date and still don't know the specifics...). Missed a 40% jump that settled around 20%. The wheel gave me a 7% return instead. $30C bounced up. Continue to do option writing strategies (purchasing for CCs or near the money Puts). Unsure whether I'm being an idiot and should just go long, but things feel speculative and I like the idea of generating returns now (even lower) to buffer against the downside.

We rocket again! Can't even remember their being news. Shorts are getting squeezed for sure. I'm missing out.  I buy 1000 shares at $15.06. I kind of feel retarded so I hedge it by selling CCs against half the position. Weekly at first, but then $16C 6 weeks out. 

$30C still have massive bid/ask spreads but have gone up nicely (150%)

Jesus fucking Christ. So glad I sold those longer dated CC, but still took a bath. Really wondering if I'm just an idiot buying in at the top. I also really start considering longer dated $10 Puts (20% for 2 months was available), but pussy out. 

I dump the $30C as well on the way down ($1k profit off a $1k position)

Cohen sends a letter to the board. Market doesn't seem to care. The embarrassment of holding GameStop grows in me. I do a bit of buying to sell ATM CC's.

Shit runs up again. Intense FOMO. Feeling like an idiot for not buying when things went back to \~10. I'm doing the exact opposite of what you're supposed to do. A week ago I thought $GME was shit. Now I want to back up the truck... I held off buying at $13 (It'll pull back), $14, $15 (c'mon). I finally buy at 500 shares @ $16.01, 300 shares at $17.22, 700 more at $19.10. Watching this run up while holding a small position is ruining my Thanksgiving holiday...

Feeling like a sucker I hedge w/ CC's. IV is thru the roof going into the Earnings call. I expect some detail on the MSFT deal. Hopefully the terms they got were good. Ideally they talk about similar deals w/ Sony and Nintendo (They got Reggie on the board, that's got to be a layup, right?).

Jesus. The numbers weren't that bad, but it'd be hard to shit the bed more if he tried. 

\- No earnings guidance

\- No partnership deal details

\- $100M in possible share dilution via a Shelf offering. 

\- No discussion of Cohen or other large holders who have presented suggestions for a turnaround (but we got ""Omnichannel"" boys!)

I go from feeling like a moron for not having more to feeling dumb for holding any of this POS. How is this stock going to go up when the management has its head up its ass? I'm fucked. Holiday #s are the next big news item and these idiots will downplay them. Fuck. FUCK!

There was serious talk of Cohen walking away. He had a low enough cost basis to make a good profit.  He re-affirms and ups his share. 🚀 back on the menu. Why don't I have more of this? I missed another golden opportunity...

I sold some CCPs near the top, pretty far out of the money. Would have been assigned at $18. Instead, I close the position for a small profit on the premium, don't want to up my $GME holdings. Already feels like too much exposure.

Cohen and the board were added Monday. Mild move up (10%). TBH I'd barely processed that news when the 60%+ day occurred. 

I had 1500 shares w/ only 3 CC's written against them. Proceeded to sell CC's (8 contracts) at $25, $26, $29. I was expecting the move to stop at 15-30%. Obviously misjudged that but that's been my experience. I also really wanted to do the smart thing for once and take profits (relax, not selling shares, just writing contracts) on the upswing vs my normal retarded MO of buying high hoping to sell higher. 

Was eye-balling selling the $40C when it hit 600IV ($6 premium for 3 days...), but by that point I was so gunshy (every call I'd written to that point was blown by) and convinced this was going to infinity. I'm resisting the urge to buy, but its hard. Instead I sold some CCP's at $15k worth of $25 (4% return over 3 days). Those 1/15/21 $30C, even w/ massive theta decay, are selling for 3X what I got. 

As confident as the market re-affirming my beliefs makes me $GME still isn't turning a profit yet. Details around the turnaround are scarce. I'll ride it up since my cost-basis is much lower, but I think I missed the opportunity for obscene gains."

My last post on PERI (Perion) from about a month ago when it was trading at about $10 got a little bit of love, and it has been a wild ride on this low-float bastard since then. Hit $17.85 a couple weeks ago before a massive short attack drove it down to sub $12, and it has since settled in nicely at the $14.00 to $14.50 range on decent volume everyday this week. They just presented at the Needham conference this week and put out a nice little investor presentation that confirms their current growth is looking primo. Check it out [here](https://www.perion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/perion-IR-deck-20210112.pdf) 

Bottom line: 4-year $800 million Microsoft contract is confirmed, nice expansion into the CTV space with 232% quarterly growth in revenue since Q3 in that sector, and expected revenue of over $100 million in Q4 (they report earnings on February 9th). 

Yes, that's correct, this company has more revenue than MGNI and APPS right now, and is trading at 1/8th the market cap of MGNI and 1/13th the market cap of APPS. Sure it may have a lower potential growth rate compared to those two, but its trading at a market cap of essentially 1:1 revenue, which is absolutely unfucking heard of in this sector. It has run up about 100% since early December already, and it's still trading at that big of a discount. That's how much room this puppy has to run.

And guess who else knows how much of a steal this valuation is? Aunt Cathie and ARK have added over 120k shares since early December when I last posted. They currently have 286K shares as their #1 largest holding in their IZRL ETF. Check it out [here](https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/ARK_ISRAEL_INNOVATIVE_TECHNOLOGY_ETF_IZRL_HOLDINGS.pdf). 

In my opinion, this thing has a lot of gas left in the tank to run in 2021. All analysts following this thing (which, granted, ain't a ton) have a buy rating and one just upgraded the target price to $18. Yeah yeah, analysts don't know shit (yada yada yada), but it tells you where a few of the wall street boys want this thing to go.

Anyway, it's late in the day and I need a beer, so I'll finish my rant, but if you are into digital ad plays and want something that isn't trading at its peak yet, check this one out (or don't, doesn't matter to me). Remember boys and girls, this thing has a microfloat of only 21 million tradable shares (comparable to CRSR), it's volatile, it swings like a mofo on a daily basis, and it runs into the occasional short attack. But if you love this daily volatility and long growth prospects heading into 2021 (like I do), then take a look.

tl:dr: read the post, it ain't that long. ARK loading every week, $800 million contract with microsoft, Q4 revenues looking spicy.

My Positions: 40 contracts of April 10c (up over 300% and the thought of selling hasn't even crossed my mind). Also shares."

The above is over a year old. So what is Fitbit, and why am I posting this now, then?


Fitbit is an American electronics and fitness company which focuses on health-related metrics, tracking, and data analysis. For you, what you need to know is that it sells smartwatches. 

Anyone who cares about watches or fashion at all, you might have heard of Fitbit. As someone who used to be big on high fashion about 2-3 years ago, Moncler was a suave yet not over-the-top brand that a lot of rich Asians and Khabib Nurmagomedov wore. https://i.imgur.com/tiONi3I.jpg. Personally for me, Fitbit has a lot of resemblance - popular enough for the cool kids wear and know, and still good for the boomers due to the functionality. 


Fitbit is ranked 5th worldwide in shipments for watches, behind notably Apple, Samsung, and Xiaomi. https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS46122120


Back in 2019, some of you boomers here might recall an announcement by Google, with plans to acquire Fitbit at a 2.1 Billion dollar USD transaction, which was halted by various legislative and activist communities due to the ongoing battle vs. FAANG+M (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, GOOG(Alphabet) + Microsoft). See: Facebook vs. US of A currently. Let me give you the spoilers on this stuff for the upcoming Biden Administration and the near future: it doesn't matter. 

https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22158271/googles-fitbit-deal-eu-regulator-approval


Big techs rule the world, that's why they are boomer stocks at this point, that's why they are blue chips. Stonks only go up? None of this exists to today without the big tech companies starting the trend and movement into this digital era, into this technological boom. Your teachers use Google to find their sources despite telling to you keep your nose in the books. Your very own senators representatives and law-makers, voting about the 25th Amendment, revisit the constitution thru Google, while actively voting against big-techs taking over the world, using... Google. 


The very same Google is bent on acquiring Fitbit, and has received a conditional-yet-final approval from the EU commission, and will be soon to follow in the USA, I presume not long after the transition of power on the 20th. Google will acquire Fitbit due to their previous failure to breach into the smartwatches market, which exploded some ~4-5 years ago. Apple currently dominates the market, and Google wants a piece. Do you think Google will sit by idly and watch one of their prime competitors claim the throne without contest?


Google recently filed a patent for a smartwatch-design which includes a heartrate tracker. It's very unlikely that after their past attempts at breaking into the watches market, that they will go ahead and just, ""TrY aGaIn"" without the proper measures taken. Fitbit is that proper measure, it's the acquisition which will get them the entry footing they need, to grow. https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-fitness-band-design-revealed-uspto/


But the biggest reason why I'm in Fitbit right now, is because it's a tech-involved product maker coming out of the COVID pandemic, consistently beating earnings expectations for the last 2 quarters of the pandemic, about to report yet another earnings in... ~3 weeks, speculated 1st/2nd week of February. Premiums are beyond dirt cheap also, the stock's been sideways for a year since Google's acquisition announcement over a year ago. Get in before the holiday earnings in early February.


**TL;DR**
- $FIT is a watch company being acquired by Google, after long halts from various legislators and committees.

- Earnings are coming up, have consistently been beat during the pandemic, smart watch market grew ~80% YOY in 2019 and Fitbit's revenues grew during pandemic.

- Premiums are dirt cheap, stock has long to run. If $PTON can grow into 2021, $FIT will certainly rise from the ashes.

Down on all, been in for over a month on all of them, some longer. Will be burnt for January calls. Time your calls to the ides of February or after - earnings are definitely not priced in.

Dejected, you sell your GME shares and head over to [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) to find some boomer stock that pays you 5 bucks a year in dividends.

Basically, it's Econ-101 supply and demand. Too much demand? Buyers will have to raise their prices so that sellers sell.

Second, the types of market participants. Active and passive participants.

Passive participants are like, buy buy sell buy sell buy sell buy buy buy sell buy sell sell buy. This is almost completely automated and determined by the weighting of the stock versus the index or the methodology that it is following.

The bots of VOO, for example, don't give a damn if an accounting scandal has happened or if a new breakthrough has been reached. Every day, it will buy and sell stocks indiscriminately, following the algos.

And increasingly, newer assets under management are coming mostly under those passive investment vehicles such as passive ETFs, passive mutual funds etc leading to them having a larger and larger share of the market. (I am coming to active participants later)

Thirdly, you gotta understand hedging. Which is basically an investment position to offset losses. Example, you sell a naked call. You see the stock moving closer to the strike price. You immediately buy shares to ensure that you don't take a loss.

# Ok, now why do individual stocks move?

They move based on events (plain old news, market-related movements etc). Now, let's go back to active participants such as retail investors, hedge funds, fund managers etc.

Suppose, there's a quarterly earnings report coming out for ASML. Almost all active participants have somehow figured from various news reports that the earnings report will be good because of the huge demand for ASML's product.

As a result, an active fund manager takes a big position on that stock. The stock moves a bit. Hedge funds and other firms also take their positions.

A retard post about the company's upcoming good earnings on the internet and all early retard investors quickly get in.

The stock moves up. In the meantime, the passive funds are adjusting their position in the stock, realtime. If it's going up. They are buying more to adjust their position.

Now, don't forget. Those passive ETFs or funds have other semiconductor stocks in their ETFs and shits. Which means, even if only ASMLs quarterly earnings were supposed to be good, other stocks of the same sector will benefit. As there are tons of both active and passive algos that don't trade individual stocks but ETFs and similar stuff due to liquidity reasons or other reasons.

Edit: for clarification, this is not the only type of passive investment ETFs. In fact, some will sell if the stock rises.

This gets even better. Suppose, lots of retail investors are also buying call options of this stock. If the underlying continues to go up, the delta could keep on rising. Suppose it went from 5% to 10% to 20%. This would force the option sellers to keep on buying more and more shares and could lead to gamma explosion where the market makers create a violent feedback loop due to hedging.

It gets more fun than that. Remember the various HFT firms and scalper bots? Well, they know it all too well that some firms are busy at hedging frenzy. They also join in on the feeding frenzy that is this stock.

After said earnings release(or most likely, just before it), most of the active participants like retail traders and hedge funds may well start taking profits. And the stock generally runs up more than the expected in the first place.

This leads to the violent unwinding of the positions that we generally see after the earnings release. Because everything happens in the exact reverse order I just described here. That's why it's a terrible gamble to buy options in hope of a good earnings release or similar news.

It feels euphoric if you are on the right side of the tide and equally depressing if you are on the wrong side of the tide.

The same thing can happen in the opposite direction if a piece of bad news is expected or happens.

Here, earnings release is just one of the events that I described. It could be any event like index inclusion, regulatory shifts, stock splits, analyst upgrade-downgrades, some fund manager or hedge funds buying the stock etc.

Also, don't forget that all this is also affecting other stocks in the same sector/region etc due to them being connected through passive investments and active participants exploiting the passive participants.

A very recent example of this happening would be the stock PLTR. Remember, they signed a contract with FDA for $44M but the stock moved almost $10B or more(I haven't calculated) or about 20%. Two weeks ago maybe, Citron declared short attack and a violent unwinding of positions happened and the stock went down about 15-20% after climbing 10-12% that day. Or the day before that when it climbed 20%+.

Now I have sold calls on PLTR (yeah, I like it that your 12/04, 12/11, 12/18 expired or will expire worthless).

**This is not how all stocks move.**

But a large portion of the stocks that are mentioned here in the sub move this way. This is why it sometimes feels like to you folks as KINDA pump and dump. But whether you retards accept it or not I know you guys are the cream of the crop. While most of you act as if you know nothing, I know very well most of you probably make money.

You guys are like people who watch tech reviews to buy a smartphone.

Ok, I completely went out of topic. Sorry.

**This is not how all stocks move.**

Some boomer stocks like MMM, JBT etc may have low retail interest. In those cases, the stocks are almost absolutely up to the mercy of other active participants, who or which may as well not care that much leaving those stocks to the hands of the algos of passive participants.

But in those whole processes, there's almost no price discovery that's actually working. Passive algos are buying and selling (but mostly creating buying pressure) completely arbitrarily, HFT bots buying and selling because, reasons.

The participants who are using traditional valuation metrics, analyzing the good and bad of stocks are getting outnumbered by all the other participants and generally speaking, the volume of their trades are also declining in the overall market. Think of big participants like Berkshire(which is undoubtedly the most powerful active participant in the market), pension funds, sovereign funds etc, they barely buy or sell any stocks they have if they have entered on the right price.

Sure, I am kinda underselling the influence of big institutional investors, but it is not completely without any merit.

**So you are saying there's no price discovery in the various stocks?**

Absolutely not. Even in the greatly flawed system I described being used by most market participants there's plenty of it happening by newsflashes, sell-side analyst recommendations, retail fomoers etc.

Only the stocks that have heavy institutional ownerships, with a healthy retail interest seems to me to be less volatile(this is my intuition speaking really, so this statement is probably false in the first place) such as MSFT etc and they probably have better price discovery.

**What about those stocks doubling the day they IPO?**

The reason behind that is very simple. Tons of retail investors place Market Orders. This means they are ready to pay whatever the price this thing will go for. In those scenarios, investment banks can hardly control the price of the stock as there's just too much demand to satisfy. In short, it's a feeding frenzy. And this is one of the things that's primarily driven by retail interest.

**What about those SPACs and low-float stocks?**

Well, this again needs no explaining. Too low float, too much interest. Various whales also know this and use this for their benefit. After the merger is complete(or slightly before it) retail investors and whales leave for the next thing in the line. So the stock tanks and the stock price never recovers.

If the company that's being pumped is actually any good, the stock would likely later get the attention it deserves after the sell-off.

I hope all those points are good enough to explain most of the funky behaviour an individual stock would make. I know my explanations are not exhaustive and there are many angles I haven't covered, but it is what it is.

Now, to the MORE IMPORTANT STUFF. Individual stocks also move due to numerous macro reasons. When the entire market is in a euphoric phase, you can throw a dart and that stock would move up. The opposite and the stock would go down.

# Why and how does the market move?

Liquidity. This is probably the most important thing that drives the market as a whole.

Excess liquidity that's circling around will inevitably try to enter into the economy in one way or another. Either through purchasing more assets or any other way.

Now, we all know it pretty well that this trend is being exaggerated by the low-interest-rate environment that's present in the current developed markets. People are being forced to participate in the market in the hunt for return.

Also, almost every investor from every country seems to be more interested to participate in the US stock market, even more than their home markets. And the recent trend of commission-free brokerage services and easy flow of capital has helped to provide even more participation in the stock market than usual.

Options trading is also at historic highs and probably most of you buy call options and put options is probably mostly bought by institutional investors(like it always were). As a whole, this frenzy can move the market very quickly.

Remember, SoftBank bought billions in options on very concentrated tech names? That along with retail call options purchasing mania lead the market to a euphoric state. The S&P 500 has become so heavily influenced by those tech names that if they move, the entire market moves. If they fall, the entire market falls.

But we haven't probably addressed a big elephant in the room. Volatility suppression.

Futures traders, algos, our central bank etc all are participating in the dangerous game of volatility suppression. 

This all can unwind though. And it can unwind fairly quickly.

If we take the case of February or March. If you remember, Mr Ackman was screaming fire, fire, fire(he have had his intentions) but the market was barely paying attention.

But with the lockdowns and everything, suddenly everyone seems to have gotten caught with their pants down.

And you know how quick all the things were. Active investors, retail investors everyone suddenly flocked for put options, VIX etc. A Minsky moment has suddenly come.

Margin calls, longs are burnt left and right, market makers have completely turned their positions etc, you know the usual deal but exactly in the opposite direction.

Suddenly gold, treasuries, cryptos etc whatever are being sold to cover their positions. Institutional investors are suddenly visited by their risk managements and they suddenly become net sellers.

Passive investments vehicles also sell stocks that are being kicked heavily.

Literally, everyone's a seller. No one wants to buy. And the situation doesn't change until the Fed comes in and says, ""Brrrr"".

Liquidity suddenly becomes available in the debt market. Retail investors jump. Buy the dip, they said. Money keeps flowing in from everywhere.

There are many other things that I probably needed to say to complete the story. But it is what it is.

Also, interest rate trumps over everything. Every valuation metrics, pricing schemes are dependent on it. So that's super important.

Let's say suddenly interest rates rise the market will immediately collapse along with your meme stock. Because of two main reasons. Every company is loaded with debt and the risk free return has just increased resulting in more money chasing treasury bonds and other instruments.

# These pieces of information any useful?

Yes and no. As they say, hindsight is always 20/20.

Let me tell you my short story navigating the market this year.

February. News of the virus and everything. I see VIX, S&P, bond market, foreign markets etc and I keep sucking my thumb thinking nothing's going to happen. Being burnt by two trades and market starting to freefall almost. I realize my mistake and change my strategy.

Fed says, ""Brrr"". I fail to change my strategy. Something even worse could be coming. Lol. After almost a week passing I realise my f\*\*\*ing mistake. Again. At least I can say it's not just me.

The information is almost always there. Problem is we(not everyone of course, some of you are much more flexible) fail to act upon it. 

Ok, one more story about an individual stock.

Remember AAPL's third-quarter earnings result? I sold calls before earnings thinking the stock will go down after earnings report.

There was overwhelming evidence that this is not going to be true. And I read almost all of it (WFH and everything). Yet my monkey brain somehow decided to trust the analyst estimates and the overall news cycle surrounding the economy.

AAPL then reported a literal blow away quarterly earnings report.

For me 2020 was a year of reckoning and I learned to remove my directional assumption from the market and to just go with the flow. But I am pretty sure it wouldn't matter, cause when it's time, I just wouldn't remember.

I posted this one before but it got removed by votebots."

I know this week has been hard, but I think we all know this will pay off. Hopefully you all took this week as an opportunity to average down, if you got caught buying at $20 a share. Also I got my dad to purchase 1000 shares right before close, and he said I’m getting the belt if this goes tits up. But on to the important part...

Basically I was browsing the internet, bored as shit with the markets being closed, and found this gem of a detail, that I was completely unaware of. I’ve been long GME, mostly because of daddy Cohen, but this is just one more reason why I’m 💎✋🤚s on this beautiful stock. 

This news might be old, but as someone who looks at all the DD, I was surprised to see it. 

To keep it short, (hahaha fuck Melvin) basically GameStop has a partnership with Microsoft, and gets a percentage of digital game sales, and other digital purchases, if the console was purchased at GameStop. That means that all these new consoles that just keep on selling out at GameStop, will keep generating revenue for years to come, even if customers don’t come and buy games. 

Article: https://gamingstreet.com/hold-or-sell-gamestop-the-digital-shift-vs-a-new-microsoft-partnership/

TL;DR GameStop can still capture digital sales through partnerships.

I think I found another trade that I put on my post history to be proud. GM's EV telecast is live on Tuesday next week starting at 9 am.

[GM Exhibit Zero](https://www.gmexhibitzero.com/?ppc=MICROSOFT_700000001963580_71700000075931055_58700006613608784_p59796139135&gclid=0398ece7322f170eaf94b31008ca084e&gclsrc=3p.ds&&d_src=313715&d_adsrc=4137267&d_campaign=71700000075931055&d_site=MICROSOFT&d_adgroup=58700006613608784&d_keyword=%2Bexhibit+%2Bzero&gclick=) \- It will dramatically introduce the next wave of electric vehicles for GM moving into 2021. The CEO there and it's being pumped pretty intensely by GM. GM's current options are the Bolt and it's selling incredibly well.

"" Sales of the electric Chevrolet Bolt jumped 26.4% to 20,754 for 2020 compared with 2019 and the brand has ""very aggressive goals in 2021 with both the Bolt and the Bolt EUV,"" Majoros said. The 2022 Bolt EUV compact SUV will be on the same second-generation Battery Electric Vehicle architecture as the Bolt.""

You take a look at the option chain, and there is incredible levels of call buying deep down the chain. The 48 call has massive volume. That's over an 11% increase in appreciation in a week. Granted, that's probably retail, but the point stands. It is wildly speculated that they are going to introduce a completely EV Silverado, which is it's most popular car. Best of luck out there. I personally bought an Equinox this Q, so there's that.

before anything, this is not financial advice, go fuck yourself you autists. I am a degenerate with a hypothesis. Now that that disclaimer is done

Man blackberry, who the hell thought I’d be investing in you after the fall of BBM and Brickbreaker. Well, strap in folks as I take you through one of the most bullish stories in stonk history, and it all starts with one statement. Everything you’re thinking about with Blackberry at the moment, is wrong.

It is not a phone company. It is not telling you to use BBM. It is a software, automotive, and cybersecurity company that is about to make a killing. Let’s begin:

BB stock price, 6.71 as of Close on 1-6-2021. 

Technically, this thing is a fucking beauty. MACD flip, Stoch RSI cross, volume died on the sells and the thing is pushing up just the market died twice while it had solid momentum. This is going to move soon, but let's go away from crayons and into the magical land of make believe: news events, conferences, and fundamentals. It's not just two letters, it's a business. https://www.tradingview.com/x/uI3Cl51F/ 

**Recent Earnings**

Fiscal Quarter End| Date Reported| Earnings Per Share* | Consensus EPS* Forecast| % Surprise
---|---|----|----|----
Nov 2020| 12/17/2020| 0.1 | -0.04| 100
Aug 2020| 09/24/2020| 0.1| -0.02| 600
May 2020| 06/24/2020| 0| -0.04| 100
Feb 2020| 03/31/2020| 0.06| 0.01| 500



Surprises along the board.

* Revenues last quarter, $224 MM.
* Revenues projected for Q4, $246 MM.
* Full year Guidance 2021, $950 MM. 
* Mkt cap, $4 B. 
Total company non-GAAP revenue of $224 million; total company GAAP revenue of $218 million. Non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.02; GAAP loss per basic and diluted share of $0.23. Net cash generated from operating activities of $29 million.



Saw this cute image of CRWD PLTR and SNOW, all with similar or lower Revs but SNOW is half but worth 20x BB, CRWD has less revs but is operating at 11.75x, PLTR (WSB fav) has 50M more projected annual revs and is worth 11x. Alright who cares about revenue, that's only today. If only it accounted for the big event happening in the next 9 days (see news events below).

**NEWS EVENTS**

*FB settlement*

I’m not going to go into deep detail here as it is quite intricate and all I know is that BB won a suit against fuckerberg $FB related to messaging, whatsapp, and something else. $FB has till January 15th, 2020 to settle, see here: https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.331602/gov.uscourts.cand.331602.144.0.pdf 

This FB settlement is not included in earnings expectations, meaning THAT SHIT GOES UP or will be in analyst projections.

*BlackBerry IVY - Intellectual Vehicle Data Platform*

The big kahuna that will change BB for the next few years. Per BB website: “BlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.”

What does it mean to the end consumer (the automakers?)

**IVY Fueling Business Outcomes**

BlackBerry IVY will help automakers and automotive suppliers:

Fuel Innovation by supporting rapid development of new customer experiences
Drive Revenue by unlocking new revenue streams and business models
Reduce Costs by moving processing to the edge & reducing raw data transmission
Improve Operations with enhanced data visibility and access
Expand Ecosystems by unlocking the broader app developer community

Want a TL;DR? Automotive, cloud, cybersecurity, IOT, electric vehicles, every bubble on the planet. And this shit got all of it. Want more info? https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws Read this and watch their conferences coming up.

**Partnerships with big companies**

Blackberry partnered with Zoom (link: https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/10/blackberry-and-zoom-together-secure-your-virtual-enterprise-meetings), Microsoft Teams (link: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management-301147559.html) and some other company that I forgot. Cybersecurity adding onto big big platforms that exploded this past year. MORE MONEY you dumbasses.

Patents
BB started offloading old patents but have one that will be important as of recent, with the sexiest one being this: https://uspto.report/patent/grant/10880812 

Very pretty stuff, big sex.


**Business Implications**

BB makes their money from licensing, cybersecurity (one of the only companies that have not been hacked in this SolarWind shit), BB QNX is already in 175 MM cars worldwide, partnered with XPEV, and is in talks with multiple Tier 1 automakers, 20 different OEMs, and will be in vehicles by 2023. Does that mean anything now? Yes, you dumbass. Per CEO John Chen, my new president, #DidYouKnow @BlackBerry has been selected by 19 of the top 25 #ElectricVehicle manufacturers, and they represent 61% of the Electric Vehicle market?

Bubblicious and sexy. Expect some of the big tier 1s like Nissan, Toyota, BMW, and others to jump on this train. Think TSLA doesn’t have competition? Bitch they cant even make a billion dollars unless they sell stock (which since MS just upgraded their price, I bet they offer at least $5B in stock in the coming days).

**CONFERENCES**  

BB is speaking at the following conferences:

Citi’s 2021 Global TMT West Virtual Conference - Thursday January 7th, 2021 at 1 PM with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) 

JP Morgan 19th Annual Tech / Auto Forum
Tuesday January 12th, 2021 at 5:45 PM ET

Needham’s 23rd Annual Virtual Growth Conference 
Friday, January 15th, 2021 at 1:15 pm ET 
With Ryan Permeh, Blackberry Chief Security Architect & Co-founder of Cylance and Eric Cornelius, Blackberry Chief Product Architect 

This was just announced and you bet your ass this will pump this stock up.



**Conclusion:**

This stock will generate a lot more cash in the coming years, will gain in the short term by offloading old patents, settling with FB and getting some moolah, growing in their partnership with Bezos gang, roll out to more EVs with Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive companies, and compete with Tesla on this as well. This shit trades at $6.70 and is so close to going up if the market just doesn’t crash in the interim. They already are used by big companies for Access and other Mobile applications, so that someone can securely use their dinky iPhone to work. Think big whales aren’t interested? Look at 2022 2023 option OI. 

I think this goes to lower PT of $10 by May, more likely $15. uThInKitWiLLdOUbleINmKTcAp???? Yes you fucking idiot, this is trading at 4X sales only, will be profitable this year, and has so much shit coming up. This is UNDER 4B!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just buy the stock and sit on it. Want options? Buy them too. Have fun guys, I hope you all make money.

* Dems clinched the GA Senate run-off election as Warnock defeats Loeffler while Ossoff defeats Perdue (the first millennial Senator). As the results became more clear last night, futures took a deep dive particularly for NQ, while conversely small caps enjoys a favorable bump. The market opened deeply red for QQQ as big tech retreated with renew fear on antitrust probes  and overall an unfriendly corporate environment as Democrats will control WH and both chambers of Congress. 

* By early morning, the sell-off quickly reversed and big tech recovered most of their red, with big tech such as AAPL going from -3% to just shy of yesterday's close during day's high. In contrast to big tech, clean tech and weed soared on Dems securing the Senate. ICLN was up almost 4% during pre-market and as high as 9% during intraday high and HASI was up 10% during intraday high. Weed stock such as TLRY was up as high as 21%, ACB as high as 11%+, and APHA as high as 14%.

* Things quickly pulled back and tech started fading in earnest at 2:15 PM ET when protestors [cosplaying as revolutionaries](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106820104-1609961746992-gettyimages-1230453313-AFP_8YA6MW.jpg) stormed the capitol and Congress had to quickly pause their certifying of the Electoral College votes. Shit got real when a lady got shot as these protestors attempt to storm the [barricaded House chamber](https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1600/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F210106150417-03-house-chamber-0106.jpg) while Reps were still in the building.

* The sell-off accelerated for AAPL, AMZN, FB, MSFT, and NFLX as most drilled back to opening lows by EOD. AAPL closed the day -3.37% to $126.60, AMZN -2.49% to $3,138, FB -2.83% to $263, MSFT -2.59% to $212, and NFLX -3.9% to $500.49. Thanks to overall negative sentiment of all things tech, QQQ closed the day red at -1.39% to $307 (retreating quite a bit more than IXIC given the weigh of big tech in QQQ).

* Morning economic numbers had ADP reporting payrolls dropping to 123k in Dec, slightly below consensus of 130k. PMI was at 54.8 while consensus was 55.3, while factory order was up 1.0% MoM. Thankfully, none of these number fucking matters as the Dow, SPY, and IWM proceed to sky rocket with the market looking forward to stronger spending and stimulus from a Dem controlled govt.

* Beyond weed, clean tech, and infrastructure - financial sector killed it today in particular mid-cap banks such as ZION (up 11.24%), CNC (up 9.81%), and KEY (up 9.73%). You'll find a similar story for large-cap bank stock with JPM closing up 4.70%, BAC up 6.25%, C up 5.75%, and WFC up 7.08%. It's a good thing I've already dumped my reopening [WFC leaps play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kftjzt/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/ggarcbi/) of $25c and $30c which are now fucking ITM by $3~$8 and still have a year left to go on them. Nice.

* In yet another confusing about-face and showing a real Karen spunk, the NYSE is *really* delisting the three Chinese telecoms this time. The real kicker though came in at 2:25 PM ET when news broke that US officials are considering *more* Chinese stock delisting, adding Chinese big tech Alibaba, Tencent, et al. to the potential list. A sea of red soon followed to compound the sell-off as BABA crater to the Earth's core and closed down -5.32%. Following suit, PDD closed down -5.58%, JD down -7.66%, and the same goes for Chinese EV NIO at -5% and XPEV at -2.62%. LI escapes semi-unscathed and closed the day up 2.48% thanks to a new BofA coverage with a Buy rating and a PT of $42.

* In WSB meme stock land, GME was on track for a solid 8-9% day until the storming of the capitol occurred, PLTR's fade accelerated further while MT stays modestly flat, bouncing back from the overall market sell off. GME closed up 5.70% to $18.36, PLTR closed down -4.31% to $23.54, and MT closed up 0.32% to $24.70. ICLN, a new WSB favorite due to new balance of power in Congress might be added to future roundup if it continues to pump. Imagine that, a clean energy boomer ETF becoming a meme stock. The iShares fund managers are probably wondering why their alerts going tits up with social media mentions and sentiment brewing.

* Random trade ideas (these are not financial advice and if it goes wrong that's your own gdamn fault):

    1) FSLY leaps Jan 2022 90c or 100c+ for eventual TikTok climbing back fully onto the service as ByteDance pointedly makes a political jab at outgoing administration. Headwind on this retarded play: cloud/stay-at-home stock continues to take a beating as rona gets under control as vaccine roll out picks up. 

    2) Sell AAPL cash secured puts Jan 15 120p to 122p if the big tech fade continues rest of the week. These ~0.18 to 0.24 delta strikes are likely safe enough and if assigned, you'll have an upcoming ER on Jan 26 to sell IV pumped covered calls to get out of the trade intact. Feb 19 puts are likely okay to sell as well given you'll receive much more premium from the ~43 dte chains. Headwinds on this retarded play: its CSP and CC. As boomer as it gets. 

    3) BABA leaps and/or March debit call spread for another bounce in a wild trading week for BABA. March 230c/250c is probably a sufficient spread while baking in a bit of IV via ER which is on Feb 11. Jan 230c to 250c if you're not poor. Headwind on this retarded play: Jack Ma really is missing and the US govt really will delist a 600 bil market cap Chinese ADR, forcing out all major US institution holders. Yeah, right.

* The DOW closed up 1.44% or 437 pts, Nasdaq down -0.61% or -78 pts, S&P up 0.57% or 21 pts, and RUT closed up 3.98% (!!) or 78 pts. Stay in school kids and avoid storming federal buildings or Twitter will start banning your fucking account. (TWTR locks POTUS account for 12 hrs and is down -1.99% AH).

It's been about 5 months of GameStop continually rising, and from those skinny orange lines the short position has not decreased at all. During this time, GME bulls have been blessed with a sleuth of positive news. Before we start cookin let me get all the ingredients into the pot for you guys:

# Tendie Recipe

[Provided to you by GME shorts](https://preview.redd.it/sg8apugjsm961.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=17bb70cb3f0a0c5c4bf91e8505e7655177ef15c5)

# Ingredients

1 **DIGITAL** revenue sharing agreement with GameStop  [(certified fresh by Domo Capital Management)](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/microsoft-will-give-gamestop-a-share-of-xboxs-digital-revenues/)

Xbox Game Pass subscriptions to taste [(15 million subs at $9.99 / month as of Sep 2020)](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449219/xbox-game-pass-15-million-subscribers-microsoft-growth).

1 acquisition of one of largest private game developers in the world for $7.5 billion dollars  [(responsible for elder scrolls, fallout, doom...)](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/09/21/welcoming-bethesda-to-the-xbox-family/)

# Cooking Instructions

You have to have a chef's vision to see all this come together - the goal is to stew enough Game Pass subscriptions to make more and more tendies later on. How do we stew more Game pass subs?

* Bullets below - More Game Pass subs = 🚀🚀🚀
   * Take the acquisition above and put some of their best games on Game Pass letting anyone on the subscription play it on Console or on PC.  Steam is on PC, and developers are starting to protest them.  Sony doesn't have a gaming subscription for cross PC-Console play. The digital future will have one master race there will be no console or PC - only game.
   * Partner with the only worldwide gaming focused retailer so they can push your products over competitors.  Sony has a bigger market share globally right now, but with GameStop, Microsoft sees its partner in crime.

Above you see how much money Microsoft can make ANNUALLY if they get more subscriptions.  Now back to the whole point of this, we need the last ingredient, that spicy Microsoft deal with GameStop.

GameStop get's a cut of Microsoft's digital Xbox revenue. Here is a quote from the article I linked above:

*""Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba confirmed that same basic outline to Ars Technica based on his conversations with GameStop management. ""The way it's going to work is for every Microsoft Xbox console that GameStop sells going forward, GameStop will get some percentage of the revenue from every digital full game download, DLC, microtransaction, and any subscriptions as well.""*

How much of a cut? No one really knows. After July I'll pay one of you paper hands to find out because you're most likely better at that then making this tendie recipe.  Let's speculate though assuming GameStop collects 3% of the revenues.

50 million annual subscriptions = Additional $6 billion in ANNUAL revs for Microsoft

Let's say that GameStop, because they're chummy with Microsoft, sell about 35% of ongoing XBOXs moving forward, allowing them to access the digital revenue share.

This works out to be additional $63 million dollars at almost 100% margins. And this is just from **subscriptions alone**.  How much are the rest of the DLC, microtransactions, and full digital game downloads worth for GameStop?  It's hard to know because Microsoft doesn't release detailed stats.  But let's take a look at their competitor so we can extrapolate [from Sony Quarterly earnings.](https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/20q2_supplement.pdf)

**Why Intel is doomed**

Intel have missed their own deadlines for delivering newer manufacturing methods and their CPUs are falling behind AMD in terms of cost and performance for a while. That is not the news. The stock is already hit by AMD performance. Intel is doomed because our industry is moving to Arm. Arm processors are performing way better at a fraction of cost. See [this report](https://www.anandtech.com/show/15578/cloud-clash-amazon-graviton2-arm-against-intel-and-amd/9) if you're not convinced. What I'm seeing in the industry is that a lot of cloud computing customers are finding it super easy to switch to Arm. Developer computers are mostly Macs and the M1 Macs are just the tip of the iceberg on what's going to happen. Once developers can easily develop on Arm machines, they most likely will deploy their code to an Arm cloud server. Amazon's AWS Graviton is performing well enough to switch.

**Microsoft will kill Intel**

Apple is doing their part with M1 and Amazon is balls deep with their Arm chips but what makes a huge difference is Microsoft's energy for fucking intel in the ass by making Windows Arm friendly and pulling a fast one on Intel by developing their own chips.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**

Amazon, Apple and Microsoft are going to gang bang Intel's wife. Short this stock if you like free money

The goal of this analysis is to see if the 'smart money' is worth following or if they are just as good or maybe even worse than retail.

The criteria for this analysis is option purchases where the total premium is over $100,000. This helps me filter out the noise created by some of the larger retail traders. Additionally, I removed contracts where the expiration was last week as I think it will be more interesting to follow contracts that have a future expiration. This left me with a total of 735 positions entered between 12/23 - 12/30 where the premium was over $100,000. My data is collected over multiple sources and I do my best to make sure there is no redundant or false information.

The Columns to pay attention too:

* EXP: Expiration of the contracts
* Strike: Strike Price where the contract can be bought if it is exercised
* Option Price: How much premium paid per contract
* Premium Paid: Total amount spent (option price x quantity)

# Call Flow

[Call Flow](https://preview.redd.it/asn0bkz3de961.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=3365d254c4a27fe89e48f04324a8f46666459e5f)

To start I looked at call option flow. To simplify things I looked at the top 25 option call flows based on premium. Its worth noticing how many times TESLA is on the above list (8/25). Beside TSLA none of the call flow is really so reaching and for the most part pretty safe. The tickers in the above list are 'XPEV', 'CRM', 'TSLA', 'NKE', 'BABA', 'GM', 'PINS', 'BIDU', 'ZM', 'EEM', 'PLNT', 'MSFT', 'EBAY', 'SPX', 'MA', and 'DIS'.

# Put Flow

[Put Flow](https://preview.redd.it/ncsrdwq6de961.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=012a637965c0b17d98d990119d052ec22933efeb)

Some worth paying attention to on the above list are the SPY 2/19/21 354 Puts, QS 2/19/2021 80 Puts, CDLX 4/16/2021 PUTS as these expire relatively soon and would require a decent pull back to end In The Money. The tickers in the above list are 'PLUG', 'AAPL', 'SPY', 'ARKK', 'IWM', 'UAL', 'QS',  'LMND', 'CDLX', 'OLLI', 'GLD', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'QQQ', 'TAN'.

# Target Flow

The targeted option flow is calculated based on specific criteria I have used to trade over the last year. I call it Targeted Flow because this is typically where I find the best results. Essentially it is a mixture of volume, open interest, premium, expiration date and % move required. Interestingly out of all the options flow my algorithm picked up between 12/23 and 12/31 all of the ""Targeted Flow"" was Calls. As you can see all of the EXP below are for 1/15/2021 meaning the option flow buyers expect a big upwards move quickly.

Once again 8/25 Targeted Flows are TSLA. This really shouldn't be surprising, but I am amazed at how truly bullish TSLA is. Contracts on this list that I think are worth investigating are CSIQ, GSX, IQ, TSM and FDX, but do what you wish with this information. One thing that stands out to me in this Target Flow is that 69/69 of the option flow my algo picked up were all calls (as I said above). Typically when the market is leaning so far in one direction the opposite happens so it will be real interesting to see how the next two weeks play out. Based on how today is going I think we see lower over the next two weeks into the 1/15/21 exp.

Just for fun here is the TSLA call flow with over $100,000,000 in premium.... CRAZY

kqdbhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqdbhy/ncino_analysis_nasdaq_ncno/,nCino Analysis (NASDAQ: NCNO),7,17,2021-01-05 01:28:51,"**Industry Overview**

Financial institutions are known for their lackluster online/digital experience. Many processes inside of these companies are done manually with paper and can take weeks to process and receive approval. Financial institutions are one of the most risk-averse sets of customers.

Banks and other financial institutions will always be around. Although these companies may look different from today, this industry will always be around. That’s why Buffett invests in banks. As cloud software and the regulatory burden becomes more expensive and time-consuming, financial institutions are looking to improve their processes to be more efficient and please customers.

Simple processes can drag on for weeks in financial institutions. Cloud software, nCino, and nCino’s competitors are helping solve this problem. nCino aims to change these manual processes and make financial institutions more nimble while still being compliant with all regulations.

According to Gartner, banking had the highest global enterprise IT spending of all industries with approximately $376 billion spent in 2018. Although nCino only defines its serviceable addressable market at $10bn, the broader IT industry gives nCino a long runway of future potential growth.

nCino has a number of competitors. My initial research shows that nCino competes with Fiserv, Oracle, and other small companies. In order to invest in nCino, a deeper look into the competitive environment will need to be completed.

**Business Overview**

nCino was founded in 2012 by a team of bankers. These founders built a software company solving problems for banks. The founders knew the struggles that often occur inside banks and used their knowledge to solve these problems. nCino is a bank operating system platform. It helps provide banks onboard, originate loans, open accounts, and many other processes. The CEO stated in an interview that “he wants the software to do everything from operations, ranging from treasury management to mortgages (coming soon), to tracking employees’ efficiency.” nCino already has relationships with over 305 financial institutions that use the nCino bank operating system, which is their main platform, and then nCino has another 920 financial institutions that use the portfolio analytics solution tool that was acquired in the acquisition of Visible Equity.

nCino has already signed some of the largest financial institutions in the world. nCino boasts Bank of America, Barclays, TD Bank, and many regional community banks, credit unions, and challenger banks as customers.

nCino sells its software on a per-seat basis. This gives it room to continue to expand within its existing customer base. nCino also stands to benefit from capturing more financial institutional clients and expanding their average contract value.  \`

Here is a list of nCino’s offerings: loan origination, portfolio analytics, compliance and risk management, digital customer engagement, customer relationship management (CRM), client onboarding, deposit account opening, business process automation, and enterprise content management.

**Total Addressable Market**

nCino’s S-1 touts that there are more than 28,000 financial institutions worldwide. Gartner also lists banking as the industry with the highest global enterprise IT spending with approximately $376 billion spent in 2018. The financial industry is one of the largest industries and if nCino can help power even a sliver of this industry, it will be a good future for this company. Of course, I have to caveat this by saying that starting a t-shirt business and capturing 1% of the apparel industry may seem plausible, but it is impossible. I make this statement because nCino already has a strong base of customers and has done the work to capture this pie. This gives it the possibility to capture more market share, not all of it, but more.

The bull thesis for nCino is to be the main software operating system for banks. As banks become more reliant on technology, nCino will prove to be a critical piece of infrastructure. nCino will also develop more product offerings that help their customers. This enhances the stickiness of nCino and leads to upsell opportunities.

nCino’s management team lists the total serviceable market for nCino’s bank operating system at more than $10bn. I believe this is within reason and management is likely underestimating (on purpose or not) the addressable market they believe they can capture.

**Competitive Advantages**

Although I like to be optimistic about companies when researching them, I do think nCino is quite an attractive company based on my research on the qualitative aspects of the business.

* **Mission-critical product with high switching costs.**
   * The solutions that nCino provides are for mission-critical processes that banks want to be done right. Financial institutions would rather have a manual time-consuming process than an automatic process that goes wrong. Switching costs come into play once customers are comfortable with nCino’s product. As customers rely more and more on nCino, these customers are unlikely to switch.Switching from nCino (or any company) to a competitor may lead to outages, issues, and lots of problems that financial institutions will not risk having to deal with. Even if financial institutions attempt to build out their own bank operating system, it will be costly, prone to error, and not worth it! That’s like trying to build out Stripe if you’re an e-commerce company (@Shopify). Allocating capital to build out this function will make zero sense for financial institutions. It’s better to stick to what you know and what you’re good at. That’s why nCino will have high switching costs.
* **Economies of scale.**
   * The cost of building out a suite of software products and deploying it to a large customer base is much cheaper for a large company than a small company. Just like no startup would try and compete directly with Amazon, Shopify, Salesforce, Stripe, etc, as nCino grows, no company will come close to competing in the same fashion due to their scale benefits.As nCino looks to expand its product offering, the attractiveness of nCino’s products to financial institutions will only grow. Financial institutions, a very risk-averse set of customers, want products that have been vetted by other financial institutions and have offerings that solve critical problems.

**Financials**

Like many SaaS companies, nCino has two primary revenue lines. The first is recurring revenue similar to most SaaS companies. The second revenue source is professional services revenue. Subscription revenue accounts for the majority of revenue and gross profit.

**January 2020:**

Total revenue = \~$138mn

GAAP Gross profit = \~$74mn

Subscription revenue = \~$103mn

Subscription revenue growth = \~60%

Subscription gross profit margin = \~70%

GAAP EBIT margin = -20%

**January 2019:**

Total revenue = \~$92mn

GAAP Gross profit = \~$45mn

Subscription revenue = \~$64mn

Subscription revenue growth = \~69%

Subscription gross profit margin = \~69%

GAAP EBIT margin = -25%

**January 2018:**

Total revenue = \~$58mn

GAAP Gross profit = \~$28mn

Subscription revenue = \~$38mn

Subscription revenue growth = N/A

Subscription gross profit margin = \~67%

GAAP EBIT margin = -32%

Although nCino is not profitable on a GAAP basis like many of its software peers, the attractiveness of the growth story is compelling. More research into unit economics may provide an even more compelling story.

**What’s Interesting**

The financial industry is a risk-averse industry and usually, one of the last industries to adapt to change. This is changing with the increasing adoption of technology and software. The innovation occurring in FinTech and in financial institutions is growing. If nCino can be one of the main companies to be the operating system for banks (just like Microsoft/Salesforce is to most companies) then nCino may be an attractive investment opportunity.

Salesforce also owns a large portion of nCino. nCino relies on the “Salesforce Platform.” Also, this may initially seem like a concern, Salesforce also owns 11.6% of nCino. It wouldn’t make much sense for Salesforce to stop nCino from using the Salesforce Platform if they own such a material stake in the company.

Some of the hedge funds that I follow ([Link](https://twitter.com/StratusYoung/status/1327453755583893505)) have positions in nCino which is what initially attracted me to this business. Hedge funds like Dragoneer, Tiger Global, and Durable Capital have a position in nCino. Sure these positions may just be small positions to take advantage of the tech IPO pop, but future quarters will show if this is a long-term position for these funds.

**Future Questions**

* **Competition**
   * In order to be more confident in nCino, I’d have to know more about the banking industry and the various competitors and similar nCino product offerings. Through my research, I found some competitors, but little to no information on these companies because they are private or are just not in the typical VC crowd.I also am not sure how hard it would be for Salesforce, Microsoft, or another well-funded company to try and launch similar product offerings to nCino. It seems from first glance that nCino has a strong suite of products, but not sure if this is something they’ve built over time or is from the founders’ background in banking. I doubt Salesforce would try and compete directly with nCino but may form some type of ongoing partnership.
* **Ownership**
   * I like to see management teams with large ownership stakes in the businesses they run. With nCino, I don’t see a large ownership stake. Although there were a number of founders and thus each founder has a small stake in nCino, the largest positions by far are owned by Insight Partners, Salesforce, and Wellington. I will need to do more research on digging into the ownership structure and see whether or not management is being incentivized alongside public investors.

**Conclusion**

I think nCino is a strong company and in my opinion, it’s one of the more attractive investment opportunities from the companies I’ve outlined in the past. The financial industry is huge and if nCino can continue to innovate, build products, upsell existing customers, and sign contracts with new customers, I think nCino may be a stock that people will be talking about in 3-5 years.

It’s had very strong growth thus far and likely will continue. Of course, the valuation is a key point with some concerns over the high multiple, but relative to similar high growth/high margin comparable companies, nCino fits into this bucket."

Once the narrative stuck that it’s a “tech” company, BAM, valuation goes up $550B. And please don’t be an autist and say something retarded like “if Tesla is a car company then Apple is a phone company”. Yes, over 50% of apples revenue is from phones, but they also have huge revenue segments in Mac, IPad, Audio, Services, etc. So, if Apples revenue was 90% phones then yes that statement would be true, buts it’s not so please don’t try and justify it with that stupid brainwashing comment (which I know someone will post in the comments and get 1k upvotes). 

Now, Tesla is a phenomenal company with a visionary leader, don’t get me wrong - but they are being priced like the next Amazon. One slip up and they will tumble - or if they can’t find that one thing that will essentially print money for them (Apple iPhone, Google ads, Microsoft Azure, Amazon web services), then valuation will get cut in half. The first 6x months will be about value stocks, and I predict Tesla hits $500 before it hits $900. I think this year makes millionaires first from Tesla puts, then calls in the second half of the year. 

The only thing I can think of that makes this not happen is the amount of cash they have on hand from selling more shares. That amount of money is dangerous in the hands of Elon. But let’s see what happens - I think puts are the way to go early on, could net some new millionaires."

E2open has disruptive AI / Cloud technology for the supply-chain industry. They are widely used by big name customers including Google, Microsoft, Boeing, Walmart, Coca Cola, UPS, AMD, NVIDIA, Abbott, and dozens of others.

What differentiates them from other (more boring) supply chain management companies is the way they use AI to predict changes in supply and demand. Basically, E2open allows companies to see 10 steps ahead into the future to forecast how much inventory they will need based on hundreds of variables (geopolitics, resource availability, etc). This saves companies hundreds of millions in waste. CEO Michael Farlekas  compares it to working at a lemonade stand and being able to know ahead of time exactly how many lemons you will need. Obviously this will save you from wasting money on lemons that would spoil. E2open is the only company that integrates this type of AI technology with a vast data Cloud network.

E2open uses a subscription model to make consistent sustainable revenue from their 1000+ customers. There are multiple services they offfer, but over 50% of their customers only use 1 service. What's nice is that existing customers go on to utilize more and more of their services as they realize the value it adds to their companies. Google for example paid E2open twice as much over the course of 2 years. E2open makes additional revenue from new customers, and also by strategic value-adding acquisitions. The SPAC deal is allowing E2open to clean up their balance sheet so they can add value to their software portfolio (and charge higher premiums to existing customers) and continue making acquisitions.

E2open has been growing at a rapid clip since they were taken private in 2015. In 2015 they made $80M in revenue and in 2020 they made $335M. That's 420% growth in 5 years, or roughly +84% growth per year.

In the last 5 years they increased their revenue +420% by value-adding acquisitions they've made over the last decade --- Icon (2013), Serus Corp (2014), Terra Technology (2016), Orchestro (2016), Steelwedge (2017), Zyme (2017), Entomo and Birch Worldwide (2018), Inttra (2018), and Amber Road (2018) --- and integrating these different services to create a beautiful comprehensive end-to-end platform.

Somewhat surprisingly, their projections for 2021 are much lower at only +10% estimated revenue growth, which is the main reason most would argue P-C-P-L is trading so close to the NAV. However, 10% growth is actually really solid when you look at their margins and consider that 80% of their revenue is recurring with excellent customer retention. Institutional investors especially will appreciate E2open as the reliable revenue generating machine that it has  become. 

I'm also still optimistic about valuing E2open as a growth stock and feel the 10% is a low-ball estimate based on comparisons to the median growth of other supply chain management companies. I'm suspecting E2open will consistently  outperform expectations on a quarterly as the SPAC capital equips them to capitalize on their services, continue making acquisitions, and ultimately tap into millions in white space opportunity.

Even if E2open maintained a 10% growth rate  and if this were factored into its valuation, $11/share is still too damn low. E2open compares itself to Descartes, Kinaxis, Manhattan, and Spscommerce. With a median of 10.7x revenue, E2 was only at 7x, and with a median of 34.7x, E2 was only at 21.3x, meaning E2open has a much higher upside than its peers.

Institutions will bring the stock price up to par with it's peers and I believe the low ball projected growth is a conservative number that they will completely destroy when you consider their growth of +400% over the last 5 years. While 10% is perfectly fine for a company like E2open, I'm expecting the trend of the last 5 years to continue in 2021 and we'll be seeing some exciting numbers. 

My PT pre-merge is 15 and 25 EOY assuming their projected 10% revenue growth. If E2open surpasses 2021 expected revenue as I'm suspecting and they have major quarterly beats, I'm holding until 50.

Disclaimer: This is my largest position. I'm in 2500 shares at 10.87."

If you are pretty sure about what the trajectory of the Georgia Senate Runoffs will be, you can make money. Scroll to the bottom for the plays.**  




**Introduction:**  
Recall the price action of QQQ (the tech etf we all know about) around Nov. 3. If you can't because you're that guy from the movie [Memento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(film)) , pull out your Robinhood app and follow along with me kid:

On the eve of the general election, when most polls indicated that it would be a Democratic sweep, **QQQ sat at $269.** The next day, with the election contested, **QQQ rocketed to $294.** It remained steady on Friday, before declining the next week. 

Why did the election affect the price the way that it did? It is because Biden's legislative agenda depends on Democratic control of Congress. **In particular, a simple majority in the Senate allows President-elect Biden to raise corporate taxes to 28%, which [he has promised to do](https://joebiden.com/two-tax-policies/)**. These corporate taxes would heavily affect tech companies.


  
To explain, the institutional whales (the folks who actually move markets) believe that:

- Companies that benefitted bigly from Trump's tax cuts (tech companies especially) will be hurt by Biden raising taxes.
* Companies that would benefit from fiscal stimulus (green new deal, infrastructure) will be helped by Biden's plans, and even more if Biden controls Congress.  
* Regardless of who controls the Senate, the divided nature means some companies are guaranteed to benefit.



Don't take my word for it. Read this report from Goldman Sachs (p.15-16): https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/beyond-2020-post-election-policies-f/report.pdf  



Originally, tech companies (facing more regulation and tax increases under the Democratic Trifecta) were trending down. But when it seemed that the Republicans would hold the Senate with a 51 seat-majority, tech stocks made a sharp U-turn

Yet, there was a small blip downward the very next week. This was not a circumstantial correction. It happened because David Perdue (R) in Georgia fell below the threshold to prevent a Jan. 5 runoff, leaving the Republican majority at 50, and injecting the slim possibility for the Democrats to still fully control Congress.  

Now let's jump to the week ahead:

**Right now, Democrats control 48 seats in the U.S. Senate. If they can win both Georgia Senate runoffs on Jan. 5, they will have 50 seats.** With Vice-President Harris as the tie-breaker, they would be able to pass Democratic legislation like tax increases. **In other words, the outcome of this election would have a huge impact on certain stocks.**
&nbsp;

**Which stocks are impacted, and why**

If Democrats gain control of the U.S. Senate, that means Biden can pass his legislation.

* Some companies will be helped bigly (e.g. Renewables)
* Some companies may be hurt (more taxes) but also helped (more fiscal spending)
* Some companies may be hurt bigly (more taxes, regs, and less gov't subsidies)

To make this a pure election-related play, we want to trade:

* companies that benefit bigly from Democratic legislation (and don't have short-term non-political risk)
* companies that are hurt bigly from Democratic legislation (and don't have short-term non-political risk)

So what companies benefitted the most from Trump's tax cuts? (Source: Goldman Sachs Client note)  

* Tech companies like Netflix, which saw its effective tax rate go from 23% to 7%.
* Railroad companies like CSX, which saw its effective tax rate go from 37% to 23%.
* Healthcare companies like HCA, which saw its effective tax rate go from 32% to 20%.
* Pure financial companies like CME, saw their effective tax rate go from 36% to 23%.

Obviously, pandemic-related questions muddle price-action on healthcare. At the same time, there is still some policy uncertainty to what will happen to railroads regardless of the outcome of the runoffs (they will have higher taxes, but that may be offset by stimulus/infrastructure spending). That leaves two sectors as our pure election plays:

* Tech companies will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate
* Financials will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate

Out of those sectors, specific companies may be overvalued or undervalued, and other concerns may matter more than legislative impact by the U.S Congress. For example, BABA is a tech company in QQQ, but as a Chinese company it sure isn't going to impacted much by U.S. tax legislation. We can just ignore it.

However, a U.S. company like NFLX which is a bit overpriced and very exposed to a tax-cut rollback, is an excellent bear trade for a Democratic Senate scenario (especially if corporate tax increases start being mentioned). While MSFT, which is slightly under-valued and also exposed to tax increases, may be a good trade against a Democratic Senate.

&nbsp;
  
**Information about the races to consider:**

* In the November General election:
	* Perdue (R) won **49.7 percent** of the vote, while Ossoff (D) won **47.9 percent**. In other words, Ossoff substantially underperformed Biden.
	* The Republican candidates (Loeffler + Collins) won a combined **49.4 percent**, while the Democratic candidates (Warnock et al) won a combined **48.4 percent**.
	* **These are both substantial leads for the incumbent Republican Senators.**
* What the ""reputable"" polls say about Jan. 5:
	* Republican-leaning **Trafalgar Group** (""most accurate pollster of 2016""), which had Trump up 3-4% in its November poll, has now pegged **both the Democratic candidates leading slightly in its late December poll.**
	* Democratic-leaning Survey-USA (which has pretty accurate polling) had Biden up 1-2% in its last general election poll, is now predicting **a Democratic sweep** of both Senate seats
	* Poll to Watch: AJC/UGA, with polling by UGA Professor Trey Hood (the most accurate major poll for Georgia this year). **This will be released soon.**
* Trump has been calling the runoff ""invalid"", which might mean some of his supporters could boycott the election.
* The Rev. Raphael Warnock is currently in divorce proceedings, and was recently accused by his wife of running over her foot with his car. Watch for whether this gains any traction (or at least enough to sway swing voters)


**The plays:**

- If you expect **both Democratic Senate candidates to sweep** (both 2%+), then AGGRESSIVELY short QQQ, NFLX, CME, and long green energy + industrials (e.g. etfs like TAN and Solar stocks like ENPH). I would buy weekly Jan. 8 FD puts.
* If you expect **both Democratic Senate candidates to win** (both 0.5%+), short QQQ, NFLX, CME. I would buy puts for Jan. 15/22, since the counting might drag on a few days.
* If you expect **Republicans to comfortably hold at least one seat**, long QQQ (specifically NFLX, FB, and MSFT) for Jan. 15. An OTM bear put spread is recommended, but calls should be fine.
* If you expect **Republicans to sweep**, long QQQ and short green energy for Jan. 15. Use synthetic long options strategies if you can, as those are not affected by vega contraction.
* If you expect it to be **nail-bitingly close**, and unclear whether Republicans can hold at least one seat (think month-long recount), long vega on QQQ, e.g. NFLX with a bearish tilt. This would be buying OTM puts, or buying a medium-term strangle. 
* If you expect Trump to still be President on Jan 22 following the events of Jan. 6, aggressively short SPY and long MAGA because a civil war is probably coming.



**FAQ:**

**Q: What is the expected outcome?**  
A: Republicans win, but there is enough uncertainty that you can definitely make money.

**Q: Why bother trading an election?**  
A: This is largely a binary event. A candidate either wins or they don't. This beats trading earnings, as often we could get the earnings result right, but still get cucked by guidance. Moreover, as shown by what has been happening in recent years, the market is often no longer sure of the outcome.

**Q: Why is NFLX a particularly good short in the event of a Democratic sweep?**  
A: Netflix has a fairly simple business model. Its value is dependent on the expected number of subscribers, the monthly price they pay minus the server cost per subscriber, the amount of its business costs to produce shows, and the tax rate. So let's go through these one by one:

* Unlike when it was still a growing company, or at the start of the pandemic, it's unlikely for NFLX to suddenly see unexpected explosive increases in its subscriber base in the short term. 
* Moreover, they only recently increased prices a while back, so it's fairly unlikely for them to announce price increases within the next two weeks. 
* Their costs are unlikely to change drastically, since show production budgets are generally fixed. 
* As a company with a low worker count, you won't see any Congressperson arguing for tax carveouts or subsidies in the way automakers or airlines would. Sure, when they produce shows, there is an economic benefit to certain communities at places where shows, but shows are always temporarily (~3 seasons) and tax subsidies are generally done by local governments, not federal.
* As a largely B2C company, they can't structure their revenue to take advantage of tax loopholes that companies with B2B segments can. Indeed, this was why the corporate tax cuts benefitted them so much, and why a tax raise will hurt them."

\*\*\*I do want to clarify that some of the timing of iOS 14 changes could get changed and Facebook could push back against certain parts of the change. I did my best to explain the basics of what I think is going on, but it is possible that I miscommunicated or misunderstood some parts of the iOS 14 update, so digital marketers, feel free to let me know in the comments and I'll edit accordingly\*\*\*

\-------------------------------

# TL;DR - Apple's iOS 14 - ""Get Zucked, Zuckerberg,"" Said Tim Cook

For reasons that will be explained below, it is possible that Google and Facebook will begin seeing their duopoly slowly diminish over the next several years (probably >7 years, based on how ""fast"" Turtle Mitch is able to get anything done). I do believe that Google and Facebook will continue to be the top two players in the game for the foreseeable future **(SO I AM NOT RECOMMENDING SHORTING THESE AT ALL YOU 🌈 NOOBS).**

The core problems that these companies will soon face, especially Facebook, is [anti-trust law suits from the FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization), more distrust of their platform due to the most recent election, censorship across both platforms, a complete failure of Facebook to properly address the negative side effects of social media on the youth and actually do something about it, and, most importantly, **Apple upgrading to iOS 14 (explained more later).**

* [The Anti-Trust Law Suit from the FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization) talks about Facebook becoming a monopoly and buying all the competition such as Instagram and WhatsApp, instead of competing against them.
* [iOS 14](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2020/08/30/ios-14-facebooks-apple-nightmare-keeps-getting-worse/?sh=3029be574cfe) update will roll out early 2021. This will hinder the collection of iPhone identifiers for advertisers ([IDFA](https://www.appsflyer.com/mobile-attribution-glossary/idfa/)), one of the primary things used to track users online.

\-------------------------------

Primary Issues For Facebook From The iOS 14 Update

1. **Bidding Issues:** As I stated above, Facebook is going to lose more and more data points as  time goes on, making it so that they aren't able to bid appropriately on someone like Johnny Bravo when he is scrolling through his insta feed. What does this mean? Insta may look at Johnny Bravo as a Joe Schmo and decide that he's not worth bidding up on, so Johnny Bravo will never see those ads of Playboy and Whey Protein that he would have bought if he got an ad for it. (Example for this: with the iOS14 update, Facebook loses its data points to Johnny Bravo's workout apps, so they had no way of knowing he would have been more likely to convert.
2. **Creating Audiences:** Facebook is going to lose thousands of data points on its users, effectively making it harder to match these audiences into their appropriate buckets. Before, if someone had several golf apps on their phone, you could assume they were a golf lover more easily. Without being able to use that app data sharing, it will be much harder to know they like golf unless they follow several golfing pros / shows in Facebook.

\-------------------------------

With the expectation that Facebook will become less efficient as time goes on and that certain lawsuits could negatively affect the company, many advertisers are looking for other viable options to put their ad dollars. There have been several social media competitors working to monetize their app and become the third wheel of digital marketing. Some of these companies include:

* PINS - Pinterest 🚀🚀🚀
* SNAP - Snapchat 🚀
* TWTR - Twitter 🚀
* Twitch - (Owned by Amazon aka AMZN) 🚀🚀
* LNKD - LinkedIn (Owned by Microsoft aka MSFT) 🚀
* Hulu Ads - (Owned by Disney aka DIS) 🚀🚀
* TikTok - Not sure if correct, but you may be able to get shares [here](https://www.ig.com/en/shares/ipos/bytedance-tiktok-ipo) (ticker tbd, but pretty sure it will be ZOOMR 🚀

The name of the game is trying figuring out which of these new channels will be the next to gain 5-10% more market share of ad spend from clients and which will be nothing more than moneyless pits since they do a terrible job at monetizing their app and creating engaging ads that lead to conversions for clients (looking at you SNAP and TikTok).

\-------------------------------

MY RECENT BACKGROUND (aka why should you even bother listening to this autist):

* **Worked in digital marketing and finance for the last 5 years**, also took on several side jobs doing digital marketing for companies
   * **I managed >$10 million in ad spend across various digital marketing channels (Google/Bing/Facebook/Shopping) over the last 30 days** and over >$40 million in ad spend over the last year
   * I work with a team of Managers and Directors at my agency to help talk about new opportunities and keep up with digital marketing trends across all channels
   * Using our >300 clients data, our company is able to look at macro trends at a faster rate, so we can quickly identify which new channels to focus our efforts in (Pinterest/TikTok/Snap/Twitch/etc.)
      * This was highlighted over the last year or year and a half when we noticed a huge spike in companies using Pinterest as a primary channel for digital marketing. Only more and more companies are going to join into the race, this is just the beginning.

\-------------------------------

# Any of these stocks or multiple could improve throughout the following years, but my money is on PINS 🚀🚀🚀

* Even with PINS recent run up in stock price, I think there is still plenty of time to buy this stock now.
   * Our clients are continuing to spend more and more on the Pinterest ad platform and it is returning better performance metrics (ROAS/ROI) than most of the other mentioned channels.
* Pinterest also relies on on targeting people based on boards they visit/follow/create, combined with using a search query method for ads, somewhat similar to Google's. **This means they don't have to rely as much on pixel data, like Facebook does, to create their audience targeting.**

&#x200B;

# I think the safest way to make money on PINS is to buy stocks for the long term, but I know that doesn't get some of your little schlongs hard enough.

* Their next earnings are on 2/4/21(after hours) and ***I fully expect them to smash expectations just like McConnell's dad smashed that turtle to give birth to Mitch.***
   * Look at PINS options that make sense to you for a little after earnings, preferably not 2/5, literally the day after earnings. But you do you boo.

One is for you to understand what Salesforce and SAP really do instead of just ""cloud"" and ""software"" and why Salesforce will become like SAP. The second is to tell you what to expect with CRM price and how to make tendies.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First you gotta understand what exactly SAP does and what happened with their stock. SAP is one of the largest software companies which focus on ERP. What the fuck is ERP you might ask? ERP is what other businesses use to track business resources. This ranges from everything such as planning and optimizing manufacturing capacity to dealing with payroll for employees. Basically companies don't want to create their own software for handling these wide range of tasks and pay SAP a shit load of money to do it for them. Where's the problem you might ask? Unless you are involved with one of these companies that use SAP, it's difficult to understand what the experience is like.

&#x200B;

[https://preview.redd.it/htsfvr8uro861.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=db3b665c95ce5d62639a4dc0e5d9469a08510cbd](https://preview.redd.it/htsfvr8uro861.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=db3b665c95ce5d62639a4dc0e5d9469a08510cbd)

Basically a company pays SAP to use their software for dealing with one of these areas of ERP. This generally works fine since SAP has used their business management software with a lot of companies for the same tasks. The issue is when one of these companies want to [customize the software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning#Disadvantages) to meet unique demands for the company. This re-engineering process to fit the ERP system for many tasks ends up costing more for a company and wasting a lot of time and money. Interestingly enough, you can ask almost any business about their experience with SAP and they will all say that they're unhappy even though they use their software. So what you might ask, wouldn't SAP still be generating tons of revenue? Well yes but more of these companies are moving away from this way of doing ERP as it is an inflexible approach. This is becoming replaced by more loosely connected systems utilizing cloud instead of having a one solves all solution.

&#x200B;

[https://preview.redd.it/ugj07ez0to861.png?width=984&format=png&auto=webp&s=c45c19bcdd0e10bd643286730aa3a2beeec0ae20](https://preview.redd.it/ugj07ez0to861.png?width=984&format=png&auto=webp&s=c45c19bcdd0e10bd643286730aa3a2beeec0ae20)

Let's look at how their financial earnings and stock price have reflected this. In the past two years this stock has traded relatively sideways with some really bad drops. Around May to August their stock price went up 60% do to the hype around cloud companies benefiting from COVID. However it has obviously taken a really bad fall when October earnings were announced. They claimed that there was slower recovery than anticipated for many of its clients. However I suspect that many of these companies have been looking to shift away from SAP as the pandemic has shown the importance of the flexibility of these systems. By looking at their past quarters, you can see that their quarterly revenue has been flat around the 8 billion range and the company is clearly having a difficult time changing their business model. Other cloud companies are replacing their solutions as SAP's clients move away from their software even though SAP is trying to shift to [modern cloud technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP#Corporate_restructuring). Generally though companies have a hard time changing their business approach from the old way of doing things to the new way of doing things.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now the important part. What the fuck does SAP's troubles have to do with Salesforce. As you may have guessed from the ticker Salesforce provides CRM or customer relationship management. [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) is a specific area in ERP dealing with customer services. For example a company may want a software for their call center or to automate a marketing effort. Salesforce provides software to do this along with analytics of this data so that these businesses can make informed decisions.

As you may have already guessed Salesforce is facing some similar problems that SAP deal with. When a company decides to expand their CRM software to deal with more parts of their business, the inflexibility and costs quickly become apparent. [For example, many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial basis and less than 40 percent of companies have high end-user adoption rates.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management#Criticism) Again if you are not familiar with software development and companies using these software vendors it is difficult to fully understand these troubles. I would strongly recommend researching the issues of customizing ERP or CRM software for a specific company if you are not convinced. While Salesforce tries to provide an all in one solution for their clients, customization becomes complicated and prices become costly. These customizations become difficult to do and take a lot of time, planning, and money. Companies are becoming more inclined to take a different approach for building these systems. In a lot of these cases it is easier for a business to build their own system in the cloud using products from companies such as Microsoft or Amazon for more customizability.

Another big issue is the concern over customer data with CRM systems. A company might opt to develop their own CRM systems where they can ensure that customer data is obeying customer privacy laws and allows them to have more control over private data. This can help build a better relationship with the customer. Privacy issues over customer data has obviously become a big issue in 2020.

Furthermore, Salesforce has been trying to get into more areas with [recent acquisitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce). Similar to SAP, I suspect that Salesforce will crush over their own weight as they try to expand their company. One good example of this is their recent acquisition of Slack. Slack does not really fit any of Salesforce ecosystem and is really just an attempt to expand into a different area. Slack has a lot of competition from Microsoft teams and other companies which can do what Slack does but better.

Business will start to move away from Salesforce similar to SAP. This is not to say that they be completely independent as Salesforce does make some parts of the businesses easier. However there seems to be a strong resemblance to SAP based on what I know from inside of a corporation using both SAP and Salesforce and the many issues they face when they try and customize their solutions.

Edit: Just take a look a the reviews for salesforce [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/salesforce.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/salesforce.com)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So how can we use this information to print tendies? The expectation is that Salesforce will eventually slow their growth down while stock is overhyped due to being a cloud company and start to fall or go sideways like SAP.

&#x200B;

[https://preview.redd.it/vl629rb14p861.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&s=4282ffef17bd83b9a62a7f196974d0113511b1d5](https://preview.redd.it/vl629rb14p861.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&s=4282ffef17bd83b9a62a7f196974d0113511b1d5)

Basically the idea is to try and play puts, especially around earnings. If Salesforce misses their guidance then the stock could be in a serious reversal especially for a cloud company with a lot of hype. The next earnings will be late February/early March.

You can also try and play longer term puts but the stock is fairly volatile like SAP and I would only do this if you see the price go up significantly.

&#x200B;

tldr; buy puts for late February/early March

**Thesis 1:** In 2021, Salesforce will use slack as a major integration tool to marry internal conversations and workflows with automation. 

Slacks customer base (start-ups and small to medium size businesses) may adopt the Salesforce CRM platform.  

**Catalyst 1:** By putting Slack in the middle of business processes, you can begin to eliminate friction that occurs in complex enterprise software like Salesforce. Instead of moving stuff through email, clicking a link, opening a browser, signing in and then finally accessing the tool you want, the approval could be built into a single Slack message. 

“If you look at what people are doing with the Slack platform, it’s essentially incorporating workflows and bots and all these things. The combination of the Salesforce platform where I think we have the best automation intelligence capabilities with the Slack platform is incredible,” Taylor said.

### Assuming that Covid and new mutations will be the new norm. 

**Thesis 2:** In 2021, as Covid vaccine deliveries ramp up, more and more hospitals and local governments will adopt the Salesforce platform and the Salesforce Health Cloud to help schedule vaccination appointments and manage their COVID-19 vaccine programs, including vaccine inventory management and administration, notifications, outcome monitoring, and more.

**Catalyst 2:** More than 15 international, federal, state, and local agencies, including the State of New Hampshire and the City of Chicago, use the Salesforce Platform and Work.com for Vaccine distribution. 

## What is a CRM?

Customer relationship management (CRM) is a technology for managing all your company's relationships and interactions with customers and potential customers. The goal is simple: Improve business relationships.

Some of the major players in this space include: SAP, ORCL, MSFT, ZEN, and HUBS. 

## About Salesforce

# Quarterly Report - Dec 4, 2020 Breakdown (10k SEC Filing)

## Earnings:

*Bullish Statements*

“Our professional services and other gross margin was break-even and positive $15 million during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, and positive $10 million and $27 million during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019, respectively.”

“Earnings per Share: Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.15 as compared to a loss per share of $0.12 from a year ago. Third quarter diluted earnings per share benefited by an unrealized gain of $1.1 billion associated with the initial public offering of one of our strategic investments.”

## Revenue from Product: 

*Bearish Statements*

“For the nine months ended October 31, 2020, the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase of $276 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $37 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $220 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, and an increase of amortization of purchased intangible assets of $214 million.”

*Bullish Statements*

“As a result of the financial impacts of COVID-19 we experienced during the nine months ended October 31, 2020 and our current assumptions related to the extent to which the pandemic will affect our business going forward, we expect modest growth in our new incremental business and renewals, total revenues, remaining performance obligation and operating cash flows for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.”

“Revenue: Total third quarter revenue was $5.4 billion, an increase of 20 percent year-over-year.”

“The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our services, our focus on marketing our services internationally and investment in additional international resources.”

“Revenues in the Americas and Europe also benefited from our acquisition of Tableau in August 2019”

“Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 13 percent since October 31, 2019, primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base.”

“In August 2020, Salesforce was recognized by the Climate Group and RE100 as Best Policy Influencer for our efforts in calling for a federal price on carbon, supporting new emissions standards in the state of Virginia, and signing the largest ever UN-backed CEO-led climate advocacy effort to urge governments to incorporate climate action in their economic recovery plans.”

“We also plan to continue to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. As part of our business and growth strategy, we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories, including analytics and integration. We drive innovation organically and, to a lesser extent, through acquisitions, such as our recent acquisition of Vlocity in June 2020 and our pending acquisition of Slack Technologies, Inc. (“Slack”), which was signed in December 2020 and is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2022.”

“Pricing was not a significant driver of the increase in revenues for the period.”

“Marketing and sales expenses make up the majority of our operating expenses and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses and commissions, for our sales and marketing staff, as well as payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead.”

## Cashflow

*Bearish Statements*

“Our operating cash flows were negatively impacted by investments made in our go-to-market efforts, such as the partial minimum commission guarantee provided in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.”

“In fiscal 2021, changes in billing frequency for new business and investments in our go-to-market efforts resulted in a negative impact to our operating cash flows during the quarter.”

“The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant global economic uncertainty, adversely impacted the business of our customers and partners, impacted our business and results of operations and could further impact our results of operations and our cash flows in the future.”

## Debt

*Bullish Statements*

“We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operating activities, unbilled amounts related to contracted non-cancelable subscription agreements, which is not reflected on the balance sheet, and, if necessary, our borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months.”

“We may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Credit Facility for refinancing other indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions.”

## Slack Acquisition News (various reputable tech and news sites).

Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield: “As software plays a more and more critical role in the performance of every organization, we share a vision of reduced complexity, increased power and flexibility, and ultimately a greater degree of alignment and organizational agility. Personally, I believe this is the most strategic combination in the history of software, and I can’t wait to get going.”

“ The company had lost nearly half of its market value since going public in April 2019, and it failed to turn a profit during its last three quarters despite the surge in remote work due to COVID-19”

“The company did not have an obvious path to becoming profitable and no clear way to overcome increasing pressure from Microsoft Teams, making a potential acquisition more likely with each passing quarter.”

“From the Salesforce perspective, Taylor says that the Slack deal was worth the money because it really allows his company to bring together all the pieces of their platform, one that has expanded over the years from pure CRM to include marketing, customer service, data visualization, workflow and more.”

“...by putting Slack in the middle of business processes, you can begin to eliminate friction that occurs in complex enterprise software like Salesforce. Instead of moving stuff through email, clicking a link, opening a browser, signing in and then finally accessing the tool you want, the approval could be built into a single Slack message.”

““When you think about automation, it’s event driven, these long-running processes, automations. If you look at what people are doing with the Slack platform, it’s essentially incorporating workflows and bots and all these things. The combination of the Salesforce platform where I think we have the best automation intelligence capabilities with the Slack platform is incredible,” Taylor said.”

### 12/9

Slack Technologies Inc (NYSE:WORK) has inked a definitive agreement to be acquired by customer relationship management behemoth Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).

The transaction is likely to receive the required stockholder and regulatory approvals, and another offer is unlikely to emerge, according to Morgan Stanley.

The Slack Technologies Analyst: Keith Weiss upgraded Slack Technologies from Underweight to Equal Weight and raised the price target from $27 to $44.

The Slack Technologies Thesis: The cash-and-stock deal implies the company’s shares are worth $44.47 each, representing an equity value of more than $27 billion and enterprise value of around $26 billion, Weiss said in the upgrade note.

Management expects the deal to close in the quarter ending July 31, 2021.

“Given the premium on a growth adjusted basis, we see this as a full valuation for Slack, and therefore don't expect anyone to go over the top, especially considering the limited potential buyers given a deal this large,” the analyst said. 

Earlier this month, Slack Technologies released strong quarterly results, with revenues, billings and margins ahead of the consensus estimates, he said.
