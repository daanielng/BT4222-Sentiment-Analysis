Nonetheless, the Dow Jones Industrial Average remained positive due to reopening beneficiaries such as Walt Disney and Boeing.

Unity Software Inc. is a true FD.

Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Software Inc., ($U), first announced and released in June 2005 at Apple Inc.'s ($AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference as a Mac OS X-exclusive game engine. The engine has since been gradually extended to support a variety of desktop, mobile, console, and virtual reality platforms. It is particularly popular for iOS and Android mobile game development and used for games such as Pokémon Go, Monument Valley, Call of Duty: Mobile, Beat Saber, and Cuphead. It is considered easy to use for beginner developers and is popular for indie game development. The engine can be used to create three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) games, as well as interactive simulations and other experiences.

I can give you insight as a VR/AR engineer who uses Meta's Oculus to $MSFT's Holo lense to develop games in 3D. Unity is much easier and has fewer bugs compared to the Unreal engine. Unity provides a free trial of their pro version to students making them a choice among future VR engineers.

The goal of Unity is not to generate profits but to exile their competition to make them a SOLE PROVIDER of the software tools for Metaverse.

Cerence Inc., (CRNC $72.52) is the market leading provider of embedded voice-powered assistance and artificial intelligence (AI) software for automotive manufacturers worldwide. CRNC enables drivers to use their voice to control internal features in the car such as using the cars navigation system, infotainment systems, and connect to the outside internet via cloud providers such as Google, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft bringing the ability to use third party external services such as sending a text, making a phone call, making a reservation through Open Table or getting a weather update. This is all through voice activated artificial intelligence capability provided by CRNC.  Car OEMs around the world can use CRNC's platform for both voice activated control of internal systems in the automobile and connecting to outside third party service providers via the cloud. Enabling a true connected car to be realized.  CRNC has around 53% market share of the cars with voice activated internal control systems and around 13-15% market share of cars with connected capabilities.

We feel the street's reaction to CRNC's results and outlook were overly negative and this is a case of a good company with a lower than expected outlook getting taken out to the woodshed and beaten.  The stock dropped over 20% the day the company reported September quarter results and has continued to drop in the week since the report and is down around 33% since reporting Q4FY2021 results on November 22nd.  However, we believe this is an opportunity to Buy the stock at a much lower price point with a move back to the $125 level over the next few quarters as automotive production increases as the supply chain of semiconductors or integrated circuits (ICs) improves.  We believe automotive production is bottoming as we speak and will start to get better in 1-2 quarters. And as this happens we believe CRNC's stock will start to move higher over the next few months and we would be adding to positions at current valuations for a move back up above $125. 

CRNC gets paid several different ways from automotive OEMs with the biggest being licensing revenue for the embedded voice activated software shipped with each new car produced which controls the cars internal systems such as stereo, navigation and control systems of the car.  The company typically gets a one-time up front licensing fee for each car shipped with CRNC's embedded software installed that totals on average $4.00-$5.00 per car (more for premium models and less for entry level cars).  This revenue is recognized in a lump sum when the car ships with CRNC's embedded software installed.  CRNC has around 53-58% market share of cars that ship with some form of embedded control systems (73% of cars have voice activated software and CRNC has 80% share of the 73%). with competition coming from I-Fly Technology in China and a US company called Soundhound.

The company also offers voice activated connectivity solutions allowing CRNC to offer drivers to access outside services via the cloud such as checking the weather, making dinner reservations, searching for a gas station or making a phone call all activated by voice hands free.  CRNC generates revenue when cars are produced using the company's voice activated connectivity solutions versus if the user or driver of the car actually uses the connectivity solutions.  This revenue stream equates to around $1.00-$1.50 per car per year for the length of the contract.  Revenue is received up front for the life of the contract and is amortized over the period of the contract in equal amounts each year generating a large deferred revenue balance and great quarterly predictability as over 80% of revenue each quarter comes from recurring revenue streams.  The competition in this segment is mainly internally produced solutions from the automotive OEMs so we feel more OEMs will outsource this capability in the future to people focused on this market with a broader product line such as CRNC.

In addition, CRNC has around a $2 billion backlog of design wins with key automotive OEMs worldwide for cars that have yet to come into production creating an even more predictable future revenue stream if the cars move into production with the company's embedded voice activated software or its connectivity software solutions.  We would expect this total backlog to take another huge jump higher over the next couple of quarters as one of CRNC's European automotive customers is expected to use CRNC's embedded solutions in a wider swath of its cars and brands generating another order that could be worth more than $100 million. CRNC had two orders in FY2020 that added up to over $230 million worth of orders and backlog from the same European automotive customer and total orders in FY2020 added up to over $835 million again suggesting the company's huge backlog of orders should provide strong revenue visibility and predictable results once automotive production normalizes.

CRNC collects up front licensing revenue when a car is produced using its connectivity solutions versus the user actually using the services.  This is one of the key issues on the September quarter conference call that caused investors to be nervous and the stock to drop over 20% as when this revenue source dropped sequentially many investors took this as a sign CRNC was seeing less usage per car of its connected services which is not the case.  CRNC gets paid if the car is produced using CRNC's connectivity solutions, and not how much each driver actually uses the services, so this revenue source dropped sequentially because of lower auto production levels caused by chip shortages and some one-time spikes in this revenue line item in the June quarter making the sequential comparisons difficult.

Another reason the stock got smacked down after the conference call is investors are now more skeptical with the company's FY2024 revenue target of $600 million given the slow growth environment CRNC is currently facing driven by anemic level of current automotive production.  If growth is projected to be in the 9-16% range for FY2022 to $400-$425 million (which was below the street's initial estimate of $440) this suggests growth must accelerate to 30%+ in FY2023 and FY2024 to hit the longer-term target of $600 million in FY2024.

We believe growth will accelerate for CRNC as overall automotive production improves as IC chip shortages slowly subside during 2022 and into 2023.  Increased levels of total production, increasing market share with key auto OEMs for its core voice activated embedded control software, further penetration into connected services with multiple new and current customers, new connected service offerings and new product introductions for new markets such as ATVs, trucks, and elevators should drive the growth required to hit the $600 million revenue target by FY2024.  Having around a $2 billion backlog and a large deferred revenue balance and 81% of total revenue coming from recurring revenue sources helps with the predictability and visibility into future revenue and EPS growth giving us confidence revenue growth will accelerate. We are convinced auto production is or has bottomed recently and will grind slowly higher over the next few quarters.  As investors see the increase in overall auto production CRNC's stock will start to move higher and when overall production gets back to normalized levels the stock should move back above $125.

Even if the fundamentals are golden, why trade these stocks when the public is just going to keep pushing big tech P/E higher? Microsoft has risen 50% YTD despite sup-par earnings and SITS AT A P / E OF 36.6. Apple keeps rising (30.8 P to E) but can they really keep increasing the prices of their products even higher? Do you guys think that big tech p to e will just keep shooting up despite meh earnings like it has in the past 3 years? Keep in mind Microsoft p to e in 2019 was just 25.5 and Apples was around ONLY 16. What is really interesting is that these P/E were stagnant from 2010 to 2018 but for some reason the market just blew up the price earnings of many companies around the start of 2018. This is Walmart for example. See how P/E was normal for years until suddenly 2018? My theory is that many people in the market are new investors so they don't care about P/E and just dump their money into index funds or companies they think are doing well like Walmart. This is making it harder for investors to properly gage the market for good picks because it doesn't even matter how these companies do, they just go up anyways.

Investing In The Roku Lifestyle?
The streaming lifestyle, it appears, is here to stay. If we weren't already glued to our couches before, the pandemic made damn sure that we slowly became integrated into our couch cushions while the dulcet tones of Carole Baskin blared out over the soundbar. Today, there are more options than ever to stream. You have the heavy hitters like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu Live, HBO Max, YouTube TV and Disney+. Then you have the second class citizens of the streaming world like Peacock and Apple TV+ (though ""Ted Lasso"" seems to have vaulted this one to the top of most peoples' minds). You have tier three which includes the dross of the internet on Paramount+ and *shudder* Discovery+ . 

Speaking of shuddering, you also have networks like Shudder for horror movies or Britbox for your favorite subtitled shows where they're allegedly speaking the same language. Next up, dig through 50 feet of shit and then you end up at the bottom of the barrel of streaming services. These are the ones I'm pretty sure not even the employees watch, and I'm looking at you Fubo TV, IMDBTV and Tubi. RIP to Quibi which would have been the shining gold turd in the punch bowl of this class, but luckily that one was dragged behind the woodshed in time to save the dignity of a few founders and even fewer investors. Hell, streaming has been around so long now that it even has a pretty established graveyard. Prayers up to BOOM and TCM Filmstruck, both services I had a personal hand in designing and launching in my 9-5 life several years ago.

But this begs the question: with so many streaming services available to the public nowadays, what's the best way to access them? You could drop $500 on an Xbox and have a horrible user interface to deal with. You could grab a device manufactured by one of the big guys like Amazon with their Fire Stick, but then you risk getting dragged into a custody battle like the only child in a divorce court. So where do you go? Well, plucky underdog Roku might have your answer. 

What Is The Business?
As is standard practice for companies in the streaming game, Roku has a few different segments that drive their main sources of revenue:
Hardware sales

Platform revenue

Original content

Hardware Sales
Roku is a rare breed of streaming service in which they actually produce their own set-top boxes, referred to as OTT (over the top, as in over the television) products. This was the start of life at Roku, and their game originally was to provide low-cost ways to stream other services in your home. Since then, Roku devices have gotten a little more expensive, but have included new features like the ability to stream in 4K and faster chip-sets. They recently got back to their roots, however, when they announced an exclusive deal with Walmart to sell an entry-level $15 streaming stick, seemingly a shot across the bow of Amazon and Google alike. In Q3 of 2021, this segment generated approximately $97.4 million for the business and was their second largest revenue generator. As a fun side note, this business segment also includes the licensing agreements for the buttons on their remotes. They've even figured out how to monetize the remote!

Platform Revenue
This is actually the largest segment of Roku's revenue at present. This segment entails the software partnerships they have with television manufacturers, as well as the advertising therein. RokuOS, named ""Roku TV"" in their consumer facing materials, boasts an impressive 15 television manufacturer partners worldwide, and their OS also powers the set-top boxes I described a minute ago. According to The Motley Fool, the combination of the TV partners and proprietary set-top boxes has seen Roku leap to #1 in the United States for television operating system usage, capturing a 38% market share.

The volume of RokuOS users also begets extreme advertising revenue for the company, as they farm out the space within their app to external ad vendors and partners. This advertising and partnership revenue clocked in at a company-record $582.5 million in their Q3 earnings report, an 82% increase year-over-year.

Original Content
Curiously for a streaming service, this is the newest part of their business. I mentioned the dramatic implosion of Quibi in my intro, and Roku were the direct beneficiaries when they purchased all of Quibi's library (minus ""Reno 911"") for $100 million in 2021. I'll talk more about this in a minute.

The Bull Case
Worldwide Expansion
Roku, despite their impressive market share in the U.S, aren't resting on their laurels. They also boast a 31% market share in Canada and declared themselves the kings of streaming in Mexico. Now, it's time for Europe. The company is expanding with physical offices in northern Europe, establishing the newest building in The Netherlands to match their existing offices in the U.K, Ukraine and Denmark. Roku seems to be building on their position of strength and setting up the foundation to be able to more effectively distribute original content. What's that you say? Original content?

Original Content Production
Quibi nonsense, come on down! That's right, I told you it would be back. Using the Quibi back-catalog as a springboard, Roku is reportedly planning to produce more than 50 original content shows in the next two years to populate their exclusive Roku channel of their OS. This channel is free to users that have either a Roku OTT product or RokuOS in their televisions. But why is it free? The advertising!

We already talked about the amount of money Roku raked in with their advertising last quarter, but the filling out of the Roku Channel only serves to see that number balloon, and they're off to a good start. Their first original movie, ""Zoey's Extraordinary Christmas,"" was nominated for a Critic's Choice Award and set all kinds of internal records for the company in terms of viewership on the channel. The future is looking bright for this segment of the business, assuming they continue to knock the cover off the ball with their content.

Traditional TV Continues to Lose
We've all heard about, and maybe even participated in, cord cutting of some type. The major carriers are bleeding users, with an estimated 52% of American consumers expected to have severed their relationship with the major TV carriers by the end of 2022. That's a massive number, which provides ample market opportunity for the streaming middle-class to move in. Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+ have already asserted their dominance in a majority of homes, regardless of if you have traditional television or not. It's the second tier of streaming providers that have a new opportunity to move in, and Roku is uniquely well positioned to be able to provide that access point to millions around the world, especially in the U.S market. As the rising tide of cord cutting continues to lift all streaming boats, consider Roku the Army Corps of Engineers that open and close the damn at will.

Recent Key Partnership Agreements
Actually, let's discuss some of those streaming partners. In the world of streaming, the participants don't always play nice. In order to allow access to streaming content from each provider, the companies have to enter a contract with each other than can often result in protracted nonsense bullshit. For instance, did you have a Fire Stick or FireTV when ""The Office"" made its high-profile move from Netflix to Peacock? Then you were SOL because Amazon and NBCUniversal didn't have a streaming contract, so Peacock was unavailable to you. Did you want to watch ""Wonder Woman 2"" last December for some reason and you were one of the 55 million Americans streaming their options through Roku? Sorry! AT&amp;T (parent company of the HBO Max service) didn't have an agreement with Roku so you couldn't watch it, which honestly was for your benefit in this instance. WW2 was just awful.

I set all this up to say that Roku has now closed many of those gaps in their partnership agreements, the highest-profile of which is locking up a coveted multi-year deal with Google to continue access to YouTubeTV. This is beneficial from not only a revenue perspective (Roku stock popped 18% on the news), but also a PR perspective as it ends the long-standing feud between the two companies that threatened to boil over in October. PR might seem like a weird thing to highlight here, but a bad run of PR can dramatically affect your direct bottom-line results. Just ask Disney.

They've also secured some non-streaming partnerships which could make their advertising game a bit more interesting, including one with Shopify that allows merchants to build, run and measure connected TV ad campaigns. It's a fascinating partnership that directly takes on a company like The Trade Desk or Magnite, and could see advertising CPM's on Roku's platform explode in the coming years. To get a sense of just how many merchants are on the Shopify platform, you can read my deep dive into that company here.

The Valuation is Compelling (Finally)
For once with one of these things I can finally put valuation in the ""win"" column. Roku, at time of writing, is currently trading at $221. That's a staggering 50% off its all-time highs back in 2020 when the company rode the ""stay at home"" wave all the way up to $490. While the company has come back down to earth like their seat belt broke on Tower of Terror, the new trading levels for this company make it a compelling, albeit very strange, value play.

I'll touch on the infinite money-pit that is original content in a second, but their revenue is accelerating quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, even when they stack their 2021 numbers up against the almost unfair comps of 2020. Their most recent earnings quarter saw revenue jump over 50% and net income skyrocket 432% over the same time in 2020. They're getting more effective and more efficient, but have still seen their shares beaten down over the last 12 months. Well, Wall Street has noticed. 22 Wall Street analysts have weighed in and the company is classified as a ""Moderate Buy"" by analysts with an average price target of $401, implying an 80% upside.

The Bear Case
They're Late To The Original Content Game
So $100 million for Quibi's back catalog is a lot, right? In absolute terms, absolutely. In terms relative to their competitors? Not so much. Let's look at the king of the pride, Netflix.

Netflix has seen their budget for original content balloon since they began taking it seriously in 2013. The now-problematic Kevin Spacey led the service's first flagship series, ""House of Cards,"" adapted from the British series, which was met with critical and audience acclaim. Netflix had proven that original content could be developed, and they inadvertently sparked an arms race that is spiraling out of control. How out of control you ask? Very!

2014 saw Netflix enter the market with an original content war-chest of about $3 billion. Since then, that number has skyrocketed to $17 billion in 2021, as reported by the company during their most recent earnings report. And that number isn't just spend on random content that won't perform. Their algorithm is so finely tuned that they know what works and they absolutely blast it. Netflix is adept at opening the checkbook to a variety of projects, each one performing better than the last. 2020 saw the unexpected hit ""Tiger King,"" as well as award-darling ""The Queen's Gambit."" The Crown"" cleaned up at this year's Emmy's, and the return of ""Stranger Things"" is one of the most hotly anticipated releases of the last few years thanks to COVID-related delays. The company also pumps out critical flops that consumers can't get enough of, like ""Red Notice,"" the company's most watched film. They've also found success with international projects like ""Lupin"" and 2021's out-of-left-field explosive hit ""Squid Game."" The company can't stop, and won't stop, which puts Roku in a weird position.

We've already discussed that Roku's bread and butter is advertising and OTT, but does the foray into original content leave them in a precarious position? Even Netflix, with their seemingly unlimited balance sheet, has seen original content production creep up to nearly 50% of their annual spend. Roku's positioning in the landscape will be relatively minor at best, but the influx of new shows and content could see them setting money on fire unless the Roku TV channel is a smash hit and they can charge through the nose for advertising. It'll come down to batting average: Netflix can afford to bat like a minor league player because of the sheer volume of content they produce, with the success of the lesser number of hits outweighing the higher number of misses. Roku, in this belabored metaphor, will basically have to be Babe fucking Ruth in order to compete. 

So what's the next production for Roku's original content channel? Apparently it's ""This Old House,"" which I could bottle and use as a sleep aid. The only people that show is going to appeal to are those in their 90's and people on hospital beds with ""locked in"" syndrome.

The Bottom Line
Roku, it turns out, is an incredibly strange company. What started effectively as a hardware manufacturer has effectively pivoted into an ad-tech company with a side of streaming. They not only provide the access point to your favorite content, but they sell ads to you on top of that and are now looking to become your favorite source of content, despite some currently questionable content decisions. The company is taking their partnerships and operating system to the next level simultaneously, all while seeing revenue and income accelerate quarter-over-quarter. The company to me is a screaming ""long"" and thanks to those of you that requested this one so I could dig into it a bit more!

Snapchat, its an app all of us (atleast i hope) have herd about or used before ... you know to send nudes and get sneaky links and shit like that . Well  right now at a very strong level of support which is around the 45 dollar mark . Also its about had enough downside as it really cant stay below 45 for much long before rallying from 44-45 back to around 54 bucks where it has strong resistance . Furthermore it has a gap to fill from 77 bucks . It fell due to a miss on its revenue by ... 3 million dollars . WTF instead of making 1.10 billion dollars they made 1.07 billion dollars which is a miss but for it to drop instantly 22% after that is kind of retarded to be honest .

 Revenue increased 57% to $1,067 million in Q3 2021, compared to the prior year.

* Net loss improved 64% to $(72) million in Q3 2021, compared to the prior year.
* Adjusted EBITDA improved 209% to $174 million in Q3 2021, compared to the prior year.
* Operating cash flow was $72 million in Q3 2021, compared to $(55) million in the prior year.
* Free Cash Flow was $52 million in Q3 2021, compared to $(70) million in the prior year.

Its about 44% from its all time high of 80 bucks so its in a good buy zone . Earnings were good just a loss of 3 million from expected revenue is what set it down and with apples privacy updates. But i think it will make up for that apple privacy bs with the meta verse as the years go on , dont forget yall all those snap chat filters and etc are essentially  augmented reality and snap is still investing heavily in  augmented reality .

TLDR-  Snap is primed to the tits , its 44%ish off its ath, apples privacy changes fucked it but metaverse and new users make up for it, it has a gap to fill from 58 to 77 bucks .

Disclaimer- I do own a few calls on snap , its had a lot of nice swings both to the upside and downside

So Jack Dorsey famously tweeted about hyperinflation, which got him mainstream coverage and soon after the stepped down from Twitter. Now he is also the CEO of Block formerly known as Square $SQ so he has insights into millions of merchants and cash app data. He sort of knows what people are buying and whatnot.

Now let's start with what is consensus. CPI is reading 6.8%. Food is up 25-50% for meats. Crude oil and other energies are up. Home prices are up. Stocks are up. SnP500 is up 27% this year. Historical, it usually gives 10% a year. So roughly speaking, 17% above historical averages.

Ok so those are the consensus facts. So what's hiding the hyperinflation? One, covid. Omicron is the latest variant and there will be more variants to slow down the economy if it ever gets hot whenever we reopen. It's really easy to see inflation once you go to eat and sees everyone waiting to get seated and the restaurant is understaffed. They are going to raise prices and only stopping them is covid.

Funny internet money and new ipos and spacs also hide inflation. If those didn't exist, the money would have went to other things and made prices higher. 

We talked about the current hyperinflation, what about the future? Well, the Federal Reserve is going to hike to .75%- 1% by end of next year. I don't think that's enough to slow down the economy. Terminal rate is 2.7% which doesn't stop an inflation of 6.7%. Now the Fed is hoping it's transistory, and they might be right. But the only way inflation comes down is when asset prices come down.

Now let me explain my trade. Why did I buy long term puts on the market and AAPL? Only way we stop inflation is with asset prices coming down. Why not make money on the way down of something inevitable? If we already have hyperinflation, then they have to crash the market to stop it. Therefore you should be hoping for a crash to save the US economy. 

If I'm wrong and the fed keeps letting inflation run another year, I think it's totally worth seeing the collapse of the financial system when they finally hike rates to 10% to stop inflation. So either I'm right and I make money, or I'm wrong and the economy goes into even stronger hyperinflation and crash. I will probably dca into deep OTM puts because the crash will be bigger and bigger until it all collapses. $1 of OTM puts would be worth $1000 or more at that point."

[Goldman Sachs Group Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US)  strategists said there’s little reason to expect a major retreat in  U.S. stocks in the months ahead, even as the breadth of the rally that  has pushed the S&P 500 index into successive records is getting  increasingly narrow. 

**Just five stocks account for 51% of the U.S.  benchmark’s returns since April,** Goldman’s strategists led by David  Kostin wrote in a note to clients. Those same stocks - [Apple Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US), [Microsoft Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MSFT:US), [Alphabet Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GOOGL:US), [NVIDIA Corp](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/NVDA:US)., and [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US)  \- together account for more than a third of the gauge’s returns this  year and more than a fifth of its total market capitalization, according  to the strategists. 

**The S&P 500 rose to another** [**all-time-high on Friday**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/R3X4IXT0AFB4)**,**  after a swift rebound from a post-Thanksgiving slump triggered by the  spread of the omicron variant. The highest year-over-year U.S. inflation  reading since 1982, and an increasingly hawkish tone from the [Federal Reserve](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/13598Z:US), have not [deterred investors](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-10/dip-buyers-scoring-historic-win-in-stocks-that-defy-bond-warning) from buying the dips. 

The difference between the initial post-pandemic  rebound and the recent gains is that the breadth of the rally has  markedly narrowed, and this has been causing alarm, according to  Goldman. “Following periods of sharply narrowing market breadth –  similar to the recent experience – equities have historically exhibited  weaker-than-average returns and deeper drawdowns,” the strategists  wrote. 

Looking ahead though, there are few  reasons to see why history would repeat itself this time.  **“The macro  environment does not suggest drawdown risk is elevated in the coming  months,” the strategists wrote,** highlighting that earnings and margins  continue to surpass expectations, a low risk of recession, and share  prices already reflecting the likely Fed tightening. 

“Nominal and real rates are expected to rise but  remain low over the coming months, supporting the backdrop for both  valuation and equity demand,” the strategists said, **advising investors  to own stocks with high growth and high margins.**

rdhemp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rdhemp/ford_is_the_apple_of_the_car_industry/,Ford is the Apple of the car industry.,19,85,2021-12-11 04:11:31,"I’ve seen it said a few times that Tesla is the “apple of the car industry” and while no such thing exists(no automaker will ever organically match Apple’s divine profit margin) if there was an “apple of the car industry” it would be Ford. 

The reason being that, while Tesla has a lot of brand recognition within the EV space, if EVs are going to takeover(as they would have to for Tesla to even approach being worth what it currently trades at) then the EV industry will simply be the car industry, with the gas/diesel segment being the niche component. This transition will make Ford king. 

Branding:

Although teslas upside down penis has made great strides in recent years, the blue oval itself is a brand Americans know and love, and their individual products also represent some of the most powerful brands in the car industry. If the iPhone is the king of smartphones, then who is the king of trucks? The f150. Just like the iPhone, there’s other offerings, some arguably better and cheaper than the f150, but in terms of brand and market recognition f150 is the top dog. Same story with the Mustang and to a lesser extent the Explorer. All you have to do is look at the bronco sport to see the power of branding in the automotive industry. It’s a rebadged Ford Escape with new stamping yet it sells like hot cakes because it shares a name with the traditional bronco. Don’t underestimate the power of Ford’s brands.
 
Product:

Now, let’s talk product. I am from Tennessee, and around here it’s somewhat popular to make jokes at the expense of electric cars. But I think once the F150 lighting is on the road it’s going to put the kibosh on that. If the Lightning does everything they say it’ll do at the price point they’re advertising now, it’ll be a juggernaut, and since it isn’t a door Tesla’s douche-mobile cybertruck won’t be able to stop it. You simply can’t argue with a vehicle that hauls ass like a sports car and hauls junk like a truck.

And Fords gas cars aren’t anything to sleaze at either. The new Bronco took Jeep behind the barn in record time and their only response is an overpriced, 12mpg box on wheels to compete with the expedition/navigator. Also, they’re slowly but surely rebuilding the Lincoln brand with great interiors and attractive exterior styling. After what they were putting out pre-2017, it’ll take a while to reposition themselves but they will do it if they consistently invest in the brand as they have been. Meanwhile, the normal F150 continues to print money. 

The issues:

It’s often that people who are fans of a particular car manufacturer will fail to acknowledge any possible flaw in their pick, but obviously Ford isn’t perfect. Their main two issues are dealerships and unions. I think at some point they will bite the bullet and start aggressively fighting to get rid of the dealerships. They’ll never lose the unions obviously but it’s only a matter of time before Tesla starts dealing with them and then Ford will be competitive on price or even be able to beat Telsa.

TLDR: be a boomer. buy Ford stock. embrace it. They have the most powerful brands and a great product. The competition is lackluster and their management is strong."

\-AAPL normally trades at 12-22PE during a decade of HIGH growth;

\-AAPL now is expecting to grow at 1-4% YOY and trades 30-60% above it's average valuation (31PE);

\-Demand has been pulled forward years in advance, and its the kind of demand that is not re-occurring. You don't buy a new Macbook every year and the Iphone's hardly change at this point;

\-Even the AAPL car at best would bring in 10 Billion by 2026. The market cap is 3 trillion NOW, it's insignificant and laughable;

\-China is imploding with real estate being 25% of GDP they are going into a harsh recession now that Evergrande has defaulted. AAPL sales will likely decline.

\-WSB has presented Wallstreet with a once in a life time opportunity. Wallstreet invests a massive amount of money in AAPL and FAANG since they have huge market caps that allow them to store a vast amount of their wealth into. Wallstreet knows this bull market is coming to an end and now WSB is allowing them to exit their positions into the hands of retail investors.

\-Since October AAPL is up 30%, one of the fastest increases in it's history on news of no future growth (1-4%), Fed ending QE, interest rate hikes coming sooner than expected, China imploding, what could go wrong?"

52 week high was $12.34, currently trading in the $6.50 range, the lowest it has been since the pandemic started (oversold?). They recently released a harry potter themed game (Sept) which is rated 4.8 stars on the apple app store with over 134,000 reviews. They also have an upcoming Star Wars themed game set for release in 2022 which will be on Nintendo switch as well as mobile. So a lot of hype around them getting involved in popular franchises and expanding from their traditional iOS, Android roots. 

They are also set to release their next earnings on February 9th. 2/18 10c is currently trading at around .12 per contract. Assuming the harry potter game is able to produce decent revenue numbers and with the potential of more COVID related lockdowns/people being at home or inside more, mobile gaming is poised to see a bump during the winter months. 

All of this culminating in high upside leading up to their earnings call. Not even shooting for new record highs, just a modest return to what the stock was trading at between January and July of this year. 

Current position: ZNGA 2/18 9c and 10c"

We know that also in the Q3 earnings call, CEO Wu told us that two new products will be announced in Q1, but this is a lot more information on those released for the first time.

This presentation below is updates from a IRSEC (International Renewable and Sustainable Energy Conference) where the Chief Technology Officer Dr,. Wenjuan Mattis presented a wealth of new information.

I'll leave it all here for you in the detail below, but for some of you that don't want to read and look at the detail that I put together in order to share this with you, here are five of the top things:

1. **Two New Batteries in Q1 2022**Microvast is launching two new batteries starting in Q1 (as per CEO Wu on last quarterly call), and they will be released by the next earnings call.  In the presentation from Mattis talked about two key upcoming batteries, the one that would be launched nearest term, was a Silicon based battery, and she talks about this extensively and in the Q&A goes into some pretty scientific big brain things, which sound crazy to me.  The battery being launched in Q1 2021 is also shown on several slides, and this battery is the one that won them the R&D 100 award, and it will have silicon carbon components, the polyaramid separator, the full concentration gradient cathode, the non-flammable electrolytes with 30% higher energy density then the competition.
2. **Solid State Battery Development and Plans**SSB - Microvast through this presentation really embellished their plans and development of a Solid State Battery, Lithium Metal Battery, and that this has been a project since 2015 of Microvast, they have 12 patents in this area, and that they are working with Dr Amine of Argonne National Labs on this as well.
3. **Competitive Benchmarking**Even the existing batteries since 2019 NMC 2 beats out competition greatly - one slide with side to side comparison of the new battery to the leading EV battery right now, and we are talking 20% greater range (370 miles vs 300), 3X faster charging  (12 minutes vs 30 mins), 3X lifespan (3,000 cycles vs 1,000 cycles, and 4X lifetime mileage (1 million miles vs 270K)
4. **100% Polyaramid Separator**Only Microvast has the knowhow and patents to make this, it is made of the same stuff that bullet proof vests are, and its one of the key components that make Microvast batteries safety unparamount.  Dr Wenjuan explains this in great detail throughout the presentation with third party accredited testing laid out in explicit detail in several slides (including one with pictures of the cells burning).  They also developed a non-flammable electrolyte that will not burn in its liquid or gas state.
5. **Global Innovation Center (R&D Facility Just announced in Orlando, FL)**Their newly announced Global Innovation Center in Orlando FL, an R&D Facility, they will have eight acres 75,000 square feet, over 250 parking spots and over 100 offices.  They already have over 550 patents, and are working in many great areas from the component to the cell to the module to the pack level (They are fully vertically integrated so can control all levels of the battery, and how they interact with eachother and use AI simulations which they show in one slide, and live testing).  Dr Wenjuan invites attendees to come check out the facility so they can discuss the electrification of the world.

Here is the full transcript and all the slides (which have extensive new and detailed information themselves).    There is a lot here, but some real gold for people who want to dig since much of this is all new information.

Host of Event  00:00

Almost 40 minutes if you want to, to start.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  00:03

(Pre-slide introduction Wenjuan) You're welcome. Yeah, let me just can just start screen sharing. Also Dr amine you you may need to. Okay good thinking

&#x200B;

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  00:20

(Slide 1 - title slide)

everyone see my screen at the full screen mode? We can see it. Yes. All right, good. Hey, good morning. Good afternoon everyone, Wenjuan here, I have been working on the development of lithium ion battery technology for over 16 years. I hold 22 papers 81 patents, at Microvast I'm responsible for the development of battery materials, cells module and pack from r&d to production.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  01:04

(Slide 2 - Microvast at a glance)

Thank you, (Dr. Amin) for your introduction and giving me the opportunity to speak at IRSEC 21. It's my great pleasure to talk today about Microvast. And how we work to enable is a competent high energy electric vehicle batteries and mitigate it to safety. Before we proceed, I'd like to ask you \*please refrain from using or posting any information share today without our permission\*. Firstly, to the glance of the company microvast was founded in 2006 in Houston, Texas, we dedicated in developing battery technology for electric vehicles has been working on this for over 15 years. And we follow the market establish the r&d production and the business started in China and was then extended into Europe and now in United States. Today, our batteries are integrated in more than 28,000 vehicles that is running in 160 cities, over 19 countries and with those electric vehicles. Altogether, they have traveled over 3.8 billion miles in the last 10 years. Earlier this year, we raised about $820 million dollars and went public on NASDAQ this year, on July the 26th. Microvast is a fully vertically integrated - meaning that we design develop and manufacture a complete battery system starting with battery materials, cells, module and pack including the battery management system, thermal control, high voltage charging box and \*also the charging station\*. We will discuss more in details later.

(Slide 3 - Development of Advanced)

The three underlining battery features Microvast invented the 15 years ago, were fast charging to ensure the mobility, long life maximize the total cost of ownership and the design for safety from the start, given the critical demand for high energy density. those features are foundational to the innovative technologies and the products that we're delivering to the market.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  03:45

# (Slide 4 - Established Global Presence)

https://preview.redd.it/shqjtl85vu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f70ee37def2252af3d04cd938ce341ad34966bb

Here I'd like to give you a snapshot of our geographic footprint today. We are headquartered in Houston, Texas, and have established the factory in Cujo since 2011. We have a three gigawatt hour from the cells to pack production in Cujo totally have about 1.7 million square feet of the production line, including the cathode, the electrolytes, anode, and the separator production. And we established the module pack production facility in Berlin, Germany, and the whole building can hold about six gigawatt hour. Currently we commissioned the to supplying the Europe right now. And earlier this year, we have acquired this existing facility in Clarksville, Tennessee, which is about 45 minutes northwest of Nashville, Tennessee. Here we have 85 acres and over 577,000 square feet of existing building that is being converted into a cell to pack a production line holds the floor for about a 4 gw hour. The Dr. Amin in the beginning of the in the meeting introduced the Microvast as one of the largest cell producer in the United States. This statement is accurate, being an American company building a four gigawatt hour cell to pack line, making microvast the largest US a battery suppliers in the States.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  05:29

# (Slide 5 - US R&D Global Tech Center - Orlando, FL)

https://preview.redd.it/1sjng5n5vu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=1650d1e4aca3871ce44cb2728dc4c7c37262a00f

And so this was announced publicly, we purchased another existing facility in Orlando, Florida, this will be established as the Global Innovation Center for Microvast. So totally, we have about eight acres 75,000 square feet, over 250 parking spots and over 100 offices and 25,000 square feet of this large working space workshop space that we will establish of from materials to pack development in the States as well. We plan to hire about 150 Researchers yet so this is coming into the city and by the four in the interstate four and very welcome for the attendees of the meetings today come to visit to Microvast we communicate, discuss about the newest technology how to make the high energy density cells and safer cells for the electrification of the world. Not only in commercial vehicles, passenger vehicles, but also in the stationary energy storage, including our consumer electronics.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  06:49

&#x200B;

# (Slide 6 - Complete Battery Solutions)

https://preview.redd.it/9cakna36vu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=026efc01bc1994ddabfbe41477b33788fdb62396

\- Yeah, so on this page that demonstrates the showing cases for the vehicles and the energy storage that Microvast has delivered to the world. \*What's special about this page is in \*\*every single\*\* of this picture, there are Microvast batteries, we took some of these pictures.\* So, those are examples of the 28,000 EVs that the Microvast has been powering, including 1000 Red double decker and all of the heavy duty AGVs in the Port of Singapore, that that are moving heavy containers. We are also supplying passenger vehicles for \*SAIC\* Shanghai motor, the largest OEM in China and Microvast makes the full concentration gradient cathode material has successfully scaled it up to 600 pounds per year to the rate exercise of 20,000 meters and this material can supply for the passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles including the consumer electronics and the Aramid Separator created and industrialized by Microvast is a great choice for the consumer electronics separator since its thinner than the current separator in the battery that we use in the cell phone and can offer outstanding safety. So we will talk about that later in my slides.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  08:35

# (Slide 7 - Microvast Has Best In Class Battery Cell Tech)

https://preview.redd.it/e4dbb3l6vu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=dab8673ea73cdd326f8fd7cf3ddd59c63627e791

\- So this slide demonstrates a comparison of our products with our peers, the largest ones in the world. We are uniquely positioned in focusing on the commercial vehicle space where most of our major peers are passenger vehicle focused. Why do we focus on commercial vehicle because of its earlier EV adoption, a broader range of use cases, more stringent performance requirements. The redundancy due to use under the harsher conditions, such as the passenger vehicles operates a couple of hours per day. Well commercial vehicles need to operate eight to 24 hours per day. Therefore, commercial vehicle batteries need to double to quadruple passenger vehicle battery cycle life and to offer faster charging and higher power capabilities. The total cost of ownership is calculated over longer lives so that heightened the customers focus on performance. The technology for commercial vehicle is more difficult, but more profitable. By the way, the commercial vehicle market is massive. So The CV is our prioritized choice with our current capacity. And as a matter of fact I mentioned earlier we are supplying for the passenger vehicles.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  10:13

Microvast offers all the major chemistries on the lithium ion battery markets, including NMC \*SP, LTO. the products on the top three rows that have been in the production as early as 10 years ago. And each of them outperforms their peers. Those are third party tested and market validated both through the customer wins and extends a real world deployment experience. \*The last row is the next generation battery product to come.\* With this product, we won the R&D 100 award together with \*Dr. Amines\* team. This technology has been validated by Argonne National Lab, it can offer 30% higher energy density comparing with the current passenger vehicle technology and the still yet can offer fast charging long cycle life capabilities. So the components as a key to enable this cell product, which we did use higher than 90% nickel for the  material with the full concentration distribution, and also with the aramid separator, non flammable electrolytes and also carefully designed the silicon carbon components that is patented by Argonne National Lab. So those technology won us this r&d 100 award and to draw the attention from the several prestigious OEMs in Europe. Currently, these are being tested in their factory. \*\*We have more products in the pipeline, such as the \*solid state battery, lithium metal battery\* that can reach a higher than 1000 Watt hour per liter energy density, and also 80 degrees Celsius high temperature cells, which is a highly appreciated by a high end BV company for a sports car application. \*\*

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  12:29

# (Slide 8 - Microvast High Performance Technology)

https://preview.redd.it/5z8g8ca7vu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebef2cd5c564f56add9783811a02906bc19533a7

The next page, like to put these things in perspective, what kind of BV performance can we create with our products. On the right, it listed a general spec of a high end BEV in the market. But if we replace the battery, with Microvast high energy density product that has been in the production since 2019, the NMC-2 that we listed on this page, then this whole car can be fully charged within 30 minutes. And with one full charge, our battery can offer 20% more mileage, and roughly three times of a cycle life with those are parameters together, that can lead to about 1 million miles of lifetime of throughput. This is a cycle four times of a regular EV. But of course we don't need one million miles for a passenger vehicle not yet. \*But that is exactly my point.\* Our batteries are made for more demanding applications and the passenger vehicle commodity batteries cannot meet the lifetime requirements of our commercial vehicle then it would need the multiple replacements that can greatly damage the total cost of ownership.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  13:56

# (Slide 9 - Microvast Tech Powered by IP)

https://preview.redd.it/yqoye4p7vu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=bab71600539b55c6161dfa754b9c450157600707

By immediate question may rise, How could you do it? I would like to summarize our technology success into those three columns. Microvast has the broadest the chemistry, probability of the manipulation all the way into the material level and a whole spectrum of the cell products which have been verified and the benchmarks that are highly differentiating from the end user to the chemistry, we have this complete approach the full customization that can lead to the faster development cycle, higher efficiency and the cheaper development cost at the meantime with a better quality guarantee. And now let's discuss each column in detail. The heart of a BV is a battery pack and all the energy in the battery pack are from the cells. Well, the performance of the cells, fundamentally, depending on battery materials, to build the best highest performance battery, that's what driven Microvast into this vertical integration, just like Apple building microprocessors. Microvast has over one decades of designing and manufacturing expertise in battery components, from the cathode, anode to separator to electrolytes.  We gain an intimate knowledge of how those components would interact with each other and their specific conditions. And this differentiates us from the most of the battery makers who sourced their components from the vendors. But the people may ask well, other battery makers can also make the materials. \*But it's important to note that the cell makers do not have the right to produce the materials, they did not invent or have the license for.\* Well Microvast has invented or licensed the manufactured all of those four key battery materials ensure the unique performance in the cells and that can further lead into the module and the pack product. And with this material technology that can ensure our leading time because the material patents are the strongest patents that are legally protected for \*decades\*. Our success is founded in our deep technology portfolio, which is fully owned and protected by over 550 patents and the 1000s of know hows within the company.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  17:03

Amongst all the battery materials Microvast makes two products that stands out that no one else has in the world, the 100% polyaramid separator and the full concentration grade in the cathode material that I will talk about one by one, the carbon two separator in the markets are mostly made of polyethylene polypropylene, the same material as plastic bags or plastic bottles. Microvast manufacturers one of a kind - the high temperature 100% polyaramid separator that is based on the same material as bulletproof vest. This material has outstanding thermal, mechanical, chemical, and electro chemical stabilities. Polyaramid itself is intrinsically non-flammable, it also does not melt it does not dissolve in any solvent. \*That wouldn't make it extremely difficult to process. But yet Microvast made it into a 10 micrometer thick, several meters wide 1000s of meter long industrial separator products that increase the shrinkage temperature of the PE PP separator from around 150 degrees C to 300 degrees Celsius, that's nearly 600 Fahrenheit\*. But why do we choose the 300 degrees C as the goal as we know the cathode materials, particularly as a high energy density cells is a high nickel and MC which in the fully charged state that's the most unstable most unsafe state, they will start to decompose around the 200 to 230 degrees C and the separator it's only perforates only go into separate the cathode from the anode. But if the separator shrink before the batteries being disabled, then the massive internal shortage could happen and several accidents have happened due to that such as the 787 the recent explosion of the stationary energy storage in Beijing China and also suspected to be as a recall main cause of the GM battery and also the Note Seven. Well we when we have the separator designed we wanted a separator to over last the cathode material if it can hold about 300 degrees C. So the cathode the material would start to decompose and the separator holding its \*portrayed\* and After most of the electrical energy has been released by the chemical energy, the thermal energy, the separator would now be finished at his task of the preventing the massive shortage. And beyond that, the we also have the thermal control the BMS in place to have the whole system have the redundancy of a safety design, so that we also will briefly mentioned later on. But while the temperature rises, the cell could, the electrolytes, it would evaporate, the internal pressure in the cells would increase, the cells could break open. And if at the time, the flammable gas rushed out of the cells, meeting the high temperature high voltage, that could cause explosion. Therefore, that's why we designed this nonflammable electrolytes itself can stay nonflammable in its liquid phase, including the gas phase. So with this design, we aim to increase the safety margin. But still yet it does not solve all the problems because of it's a decomposed product. Well, at this high temperature high voltage reaction, the product could still be flammable. Our goal is to increase its safety margin, the same reason for the aramid the separator and the full concentration gradient cathode material.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  21:36

So another product Microvast produces this are this F CT cathode. So this Cathode material offers all the energy in the lithium ion battery, and also takes more than 50% of the cost in the battery. So Microvast is the only one in the world who can produce F CT Cathode material in the industrial scale. In this illustration, the F CT material differentiates from all the other homogeneous cathode material in the markets. This technology allows us to be specific about the distribution of the transition metal elements, so that we can maximize the energy contained in the particle with the high safety and to the lowest the cobalt accountant minimize the risk and minimize the cost. \*The F CT material we produce can offer 20% higher capacity than what's available in the markets, and yet stays at 10% lower in cost because we minimize the cobalt content. So this material is also validated by Argonne National Lab. And we have won the low cost the fast charging USABC project with this material as well. \* So in the second column, we have this whole spectrum of the cell products that allows Microvast to to access the application of all industry. The broadness makes us less vulnerable to the commercial success of a single technology. So I mentioned about the LFP supplying to SAIC. So in this project, we actually competed with the CATL, the largest battery maker in the world. And we won this project by performance, and also demonstrates that Microvast has the quality control in our mass production line meeting for the most stringent automobile standards. So last but not least, we have the internal builds the vertical integration from r&d to production. So with the vertical integration, that can confer significant competitive advantages to shorten the product development cycle to win the race in tech evolution, by eliminating the need to communicate with with vendors. And that can minimize the cost. Ensure the quality control from the materials to the end product from r&d to mass production, and we can customize the solution to the client's needs. That helps us to build a higher bar to competitors. Because of the material development over decades. It also gave us the flexibility to work seamlessly with any customer. We can offer at the whole power solution level, at the pack level, module level, cell level and \*in the future in the components level\*.

# (Slide 10 - Simulation Studies)

https://preview.redd.it/a7hnv1j8vu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=60ec22aafb3d511c4d18a1138335b454d28f9d8b

another important feature of Microvast innovation and product design is the extensive simulation efforts. That helps to to optimize the battery system, and the predictors of potential issues in the computer before encountering the issues in physical devices.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  25:09

# (Slide 11 - MVs gradient cathode, aramid separator and proprietary electrolyte)

https://preview.redd.it/7ok3ryx8vu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=16908c80fadd9df323ccd57a1b0d201be6e3913c

Yet, so during the fundraising, our investor hired a prestigious third party to do the technical assessment on Microvast - here are their conclusions.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  25:40

We talked about several components in the previous page that enables the high energy density, high safety, fast charging products, each are the gradient cathode material, so 100% polyaramid separator, and to the non-flammable electrolytes, and their contribution on the cell energy density, the charging rates, cycle life, and the safety summarize by the  third party as below. So the black bar showing the industrial leader and the dark blue are amongst the best in class. So the cathode material in their evaluation, for all those four aspects are amongst the best in the class. And the nonflammable electrolytes, its most advantage is in safety. It's an it's an industry leader. And as for Aramid separator, so it only contains less then 1% of the weights in the cells. And so that's not to change the cell energy density much and will not affect the cycle life much. But its contribution is still mostly in the safety, which is crucial for all the applications.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  26:58

# (Slide 12 - On a cell level)

https://preview.redd.it/g2gb78e9vu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=889e7915080a6a40b8247f42d9d51f16ca9ec4fd

On a cell level, MV products Yeah, so the this also coming from the third party to the cell level, oh, every company has published their roadmap, and the compared with the largest the best in the field Microvast products that are leading in both of the volumetric energy density and the gravimetric energy density.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  27:57

# (Slide 13 - Tech Longer op life and increased safety)

https://preview.redd.it/vu4o3hu9vu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c8480032830306dac049e365335251b90fec176

And comparing the performance, we briefly touched in the comparison, and also the means of market applications. And here are two of our products to compare with the leading performer and the standard performer. So as noted here, the leading performer data coming from the LG battery, and the standard performer and coming from the China EV cell maker, and most of the cycle life is ran from zero to 80% SOC. So that's what's coming from the third party database, comparing what's in the market. So that's also that's Microvast product that has been deployed to the market. So that's a fair comparison apples to apples. And as for the energy density, our HnCO, that's that's an NMC-2  is leading the energy density and still yet it can do the fast charging and for a lower energy density product, it can run three C cycling between zero to 100% SOC for over 8000 cycles. So, considering this case, in commercial vehicle, even if we charge twice or three times a day, this battery can last 15 to 20 years. And as for the safety both of this product is way beyond the leading performance

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  28:59

# (Slide 14 - Competitive Benchmarking)

https://preview.redd.it/ktxhoi9avu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=8de5c32d5d5e6592550fc701b0100c2b760f8cb9

and the for the future technology, we proposed such as the \*solid state battery\*, \*\*\*the close one would be the silicon containing product that we are in the would have been in the \*SOP phase\* in the next two years and also would keep improving the energy density by using lithium metal as anode. We're also working on this project with \*\*Dr Amins team\*\* together and also developing the the \*\*solid state battery that has been a project in Microvast Since 2015, we have over 12 patents in this area\*\* and also with a high temperature operating cells so more are being developed with the future technology.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  29:51

We are at the frontier of the innovations

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  29:54

# (Slide 15 - With its current product portfolio) Energy Density Competitors

https://preview.redd.it/gbc7ggpavu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=066dce98d60adecc222f97531ccdca79cf30ef09

so the comparing with competitors as the the timescale of the roadmap have proposed, that's where my Kovacs is standing.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  30:08

# (Slide 16 - Product Development Platform)

https://preview.redd.it/rjr00x4bvu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a911f73260bd7177d63f8b7aa60a8ee96738830a

So, as I mentioned, we internally have the vertical integration from the cells all the way to the final products

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  30:17

# (Slide 17 - On a Pack Level - Higher Energy Density)

https://preview.redd.it/v3e2u6nbvu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=96a2eaef95024809bd5cd751d08d06f1bf28621c

that help Microvast to gain the advantage in development time and also a thoroughly

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  30:28

in control BMS, because the BMS needed to understand how the cell would perform at a different Soh SOC, different temperature, different power requirements, power requirements and we have developed from the cells, our R&D has been going through the intensive testing for over 3-4 years before its getting into the mass production and how to apply that in the module, the optimal thermal control the pressure to be added the pack design, so that's all in this the vertical integration designing and the BMS have the intelligent control and we also have that in the digital twin that it can run a simulated virtual vehicle out of the cloud, well, on the road, you have this actual the vehicle operating and you can always comparing the predicted and the tested can send out early warnings. So that again, as the advantage gains a pack level, so, we are winning in both the volumetric and gravimetric energy density as well.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  31:45

# (Slide 18 - MV Batteries Best in Class Charging Speed)

https://preview.redd.it/t9nsfz3cvu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4ec0350ffc410b1cb2b02a0b54872db298126c9

So comparing the charging speed thats what Microvast is leading by far so that would offer more mobility to all kinds of applications and even the stationary energy storage wouldn't require such as the wind storage that would require a fast charging occasionally and that can also accommodate to this application.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  32:13

# (Slide 19 - Mutilayer Safety Measure)

https://preview.redd.it/vcckxyicvu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=56b7c6d2da465a5e66f516d9a8a75ac0e6ba625f

Yeah, so, the Microvast safety design as I mentioned, so, first of all, that has demonstrated good safety performance for the last 10-11 years. And we have a multi layer of safety design from the materials which is fundamental that can prevents the mass recall from happening and beyond that by fully understanding the cell performance

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  32:46

the pack design, the thermal propagation insulations, the pack design, and the most crucial is a BMS that it needs to take in place by separating the responsive time we also work closely with the OEM on the vehicle design the vehicle control unit as well. So the vehicle need to respond, the first to send out to the most of the early warnings, and then followed by the pack with a separated our responses time, to the packet cell to the materials that will go through the core of this, the whole technology there. And for the BMS we are having the ISO 26262 certified to the c level both on the software and the hardware.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  33:39

# (Slide 20 - Rigorous Cell Safety Test)

https://preview.redd.it/xov8xchdvu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f392a56a55f9f440c4fafe8dc4999740f32f0b49

The cells has been through the most rigorous test by all standards, the GP, the EU car including the US ABC, we are working on a test project.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  33:51

# (Slide 21 - Rigorous Pack Safety Test)

https://preview.redd.it/r1shkw0evu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=47f4bf174ba2f8391d5a026e3cd96280a365a86f

And even on the pack level, it has been tested for the electrical abuse and mechanical thermal environment. This one is impressive. \*\*So the whole pack is sitting on the external fire for over 10 minutes, and the pack remains safe\*\*.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  34:09

Yeah, so here I want to give you a glance at Microvast mass production line from also four key battery materials to standardize the cell module and the pack. There are videos available online if you want to review more of our company facilities and our business on this right corner, there are two examples of the power system solutions offered for delivery trucks and the commercial buses. We have invested.

Organizer   35:28

yeah. So, alright, so let's see if we have any questions from the audience don't see any obviously, this is more of an introduction of the of the the impressive technology that Microvast has. So, if there is any question regarding automotive Battery, I think she is the right person Okay, let's see that can we can answer these these questions. So.

Organizer  36:00

So, do some questions, some questions, okay. Can

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  36:06

you read them on my behalf.

Organizer  36:08

So, thanks for the great talk and your presence is LTO like a lot for lithium ion batteries, please any insights about using mixture of graphite and silicon

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  36:21

I'm sorry using mixture of graphite and what?

Organizer  36:25

yeah, graphite and silicon.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  36:27

\*\*Oh on the silicon yes, Yeah\*\*. So, so, for the safety material generally to families. So, pure silicone, and also the silicon mono oxide, silicone mono oxide as a smaller expansion, but I mean with the lower capacity that it can carry with larger particle size. And what we observe is this material per cycle efficiency is lower, but afterwards you can have a flatter decay. So, if you have the amount of the previous supplements that would have good be a good material to use, but again need to look closer into this material would just be the simply the mixture of silicon oxide. So, you can the oxide instead of a mono silicon oxide right and in the other class silicon material because of a four times extinction, this material needed to nanosized so that it can hold this integirty and that it comes in different formats, it can be the particles, it can comes in the silicon nano fibers all of those materials needed to have the surface to be quoted binds a carbon to avoid first cycle efficiency consuming too much lithium and in \*\*Dr. Amin\*\* actually have a patent published on this using the deposit grow silicon in between the graphene layers, that we have tested the material it shows a good performance in the lithium battery. So, really need some company to commercialize this material to be more massively used in the high energy density cells.

Organizer  38:14

So, I just look at the question now. So, there are two quick question that on silicone it seems to be the audience is interested to silicone. The first one is what is the ratio of silicone to carbon that is usually used by the industry and in your case, the other one is what is the strategy to stabilize the capacity or secondary in cycling?

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  38:34

Yeah, so,

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  38:34

depending on the energy density requirements also correlated with the cycle life. So for the cells about 300 to 330 watt per kg, the silicone components in the total anode material, if that's 100% silicone that would have been about a five to 10% and come in the silicone carbon composites and that is a composite content about 15 to 30 or 40% of the silicone and then if you want to reach a higher energy density above a 330 then the cycle life would reduce. So then the components total silicone components in the anode material would be about 18%. But if  applies silicone mono oxide and that can compost about 20 to 30% or even achieve 350. Yeah, so the key to apply the silicone material well is to accommodate its volume expansion from the beginning. Therefore, with such as the CNT above the conducting carbon, would be helpful so that it would stay in contact with the material even with the large volume expansion. But as then the key is to the well dispersion of this contraction of the carbon. And of course as the doctor \*\*value\*\* has been studying, the panders that to better can also help with the conduction conductivity. But it's still yet it needs to be resilient, better have the self healing power, but at least the goal to bind the  material tightly, and they kind of grow with the expansion. And you know, also, that you've actually designs a policy of actually design is also crucial. And beyond all that, the ?previous eviation? is a key technology and how to industrialize with a high safety low cost is also another focus. Excellent.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  38:41

So the last question is from Mohammed Czechia.  is one of our analysts,

Mohammed  40:49

the one? Yes, thank you. Sorry. Thank you much for your presentation. I have just one question related to inefficiency, volumetric energy density, especially, you claim that in your in your pack, your energy density is higher than your competitors. And you mentioned so that you show that you're indigenously at cell level, it's it's comparable. Question is how we can explain this high performance pack level, you maybe design or your use, for example, easy to pack or can you say some more in this way, please? Yeah, so,

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  41:36

the practicality density, energy density, those can can be very in because of the cell format. So cylindrical cells would have really high volumetric energy density on the cell level, but not necessarily on the pack level, because you cannot pack really tightly, right, they can only use about 68% over the volume. So the pouch cells and the Prasmatic cells would have a higher packing efficiency Microvast makes the pouch cells, and comparing between this, the prismatic cells would have even higher efficiency, because it's already kind of like in the confined space, with the good mechanical protection already stability. But for the pouch cells comparing with prismatic cells on the cell level, it actually can advantages in both volumetric and prasmatic, energy density, because of existing skin. So even those who are in the fair competition, almost similar in the pack level, but what Microvast, again, on the pack level offers the energy density is by doing close to what c to p. So in each of these module, we have about 72 cells. So that's a big module. And to control this big module that would requires a thorough understanding of how this thermal field is designed, how to prevent the thermal propagation. So with all that, the know how and the knowledge base that we can minimize the components while at the same time maintains a uniform the pressure field, the thermal field, and also with the high safety design. So that's how we can get the advantages in the whole pack level. And also the in the pack we have the the bottom housing and the cooling plates, all in one that also using composites as as the cover of the housing that also reduced the weight. So with multiple levels of measures. Okay, well, thank you,

# [Dow futures rise 100 points as travel stocks get boost following omicron sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Dow futures rose in early trading Thursday despite the arrival of the latest Covid variant on U.S. shores and as the White House tightened travel restrictions.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 120 points. S&P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.4%.
*****
> The Biden administration reacted to the news that an omicron case had been reported in California by asking businesses to proceed with vaccination requirements, even though the administration’s mandate was halted in courts pending review. The White House also tightened travel rules, requiring inbound passengers to be tested within 24 hours prior to departure.
*****
> Airline, casino and energy stocks led the gainers in premarket trading.
*****
> Dow component Boeing’s shares jumped 3.6%, cruise line Royal Caribbean was up 3.6% while MGM Resorts International moved 2.7% higher, with Covid-sensitive companies benefitting amid early evidence showing the new strain may be less severe than earlier versions.
*****
> “We remain cautious on S&P 500 amid a hawkish Fed tightening into an overvalued market,” said Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Securities head of U.S. equity & quantitative strategy.
*****
> Still, Bank of America noted that December has historically been the strongest month for the S&P 500, with the average gaining 2.3% on average since 1936 and positive 79% of the time. However, December has not always been immune to sell-offs, Subramanian added.
*****
> “Another risk is an inflation-led consumption hit, especially as fiscal/monetary stimulus run out. Fed Chair Powell’s comments on accelerated tapering and retiring the word ‘transitory’ indicate that the Fed’s focus is now inflation rather than employment.
*****
> During regular trading on Wednesday, stocks posted strong gains earlier in the session, but fell on news that the first omicron case had been reported in California. The Dow fell about 460 points, after the 30-stock benchmark had advanced 521 points. The S&P dipped 1.18%, giving back an earlier gain of about 1.9%. The Nasdaq Composite slid 1.83%, after earlier trading 1.8% higher.
*****
> “Investors are increasingly cautious about the Omicron variant as well as the likelihood of faster tapering,” TD Securities said in a note to clients.
*****
> Wednesday’s whipsaw continues a highly volatile streak for stocks as the market digests what the new variant means.
*****
> “We’ve seen this movie before and Wall Street will likely remain COVID-variant headline driven until a clear assessment over this wave can be made,” said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “The next couple of weeks will likely see risk appetite take a cue from incremental Omicron updates, supply chain issues, and every inflation reading,” he added.
*****
> On the data front, weekly initial jobless claims numbers will be released Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists are expecting a print of 240,000, according to estimates from Dow Jones. The prior reading showed 199,000 first-time filers, which was the lowest since November 1969. The November jobs report will be released on Friday.
*****
> Thursday’s reading follows a better-than-expected ADP report on Wednesday. Private payrolls increased by 534,000 in November, ahead of the expected 506,000.

I’ve been watching the market for a long time... (I bought apple at 27$), and today (1st December 2021) was so ridiculous that I decided to give it a shot, and prove to everyone how stupid the market is. In order to do so, I will quickly show you a pure example of manipulation.

I’m no bull or bear. I’m just an ordinary guy that can’t stand this insanity. I am insanely tired of seeing this kind of stuff day after day.

In the end, I am just curious to find out what other people (ape) will think about this. I hope that you will enjoy the read.

&amp;#x200B;

**I. Market breakdown (1st December 2021) :**

I will use SPY and QQQ, but I could have done it with mostly anything.

**SPY**

Day’s range: 450.29 – 464.67

Open: 461.64

Close: 450.50

**QQQ**

Day’s range: 386.64 – 400.48

Open: 398.28

Close: 387.12

&amp;#x200B;

**II. Oversight of the Treasure Department’s and Federal Reserve’s Pandemic Responses**

The meeting started around 10AM, so that was the perfect excuse to pump the market while we are all expecting JPOW to say that inflation is transitory and that he’s very sorry for the misunderstanding. We can clearly notice that he left the printer on while assisting the meeting.

&amp;#x200B;

Spy : The climb started right on time !

**At the end of the meeting (12:15PM), JPOW was obviously furious about his colleague that keep harassing him about inflation. It took him about 30min to get home and pulled the plug around 12:46PM.** Don't forget about the first omnicron case! Timing is everything. 

**SPY**

**III. Options chains**

***\*\*\*Source: Barchart – might differ from other source depending on the last trade / time.***

Now let’s take a look at the option volume / open interest (see below), and notice how convenient, they moved (manipulated) the index in order to IV Crush the calls / puts. Please keep in mind the day’s range of SPY/QQQ.

**IV. Conclusion**

I hope we can all agree that we stand no chance against JPOW and his crew. They can do whatever they want, and they obviously want an **economical crisis.** Omnicron was also a cause of the drop, but still coordinated with the options chains.

Sorry for the missing rocket emoji.

**Edit:** JPOW made sure to pump the market while he was in meeting, but pulled the plug once he was home because he was mad at his colleague. Also, he made sure to optimize (manipulate) the options in order to crush them all.

1. Fed policy: Currently the fed is tapering and has said that if inflation persist they may increase the speed they taper. If you look at history every single time the fed tapered the market corrects (20+%). The same can be said when they Fed announces they are increasing QE, the market reverses a downtrend and continues on a bull run. This has proven to be 100% accurate in the US. The market is forward looking and sees this coming, IMO the market has already topped. Of course the Fed could reverse there decision and decide to continue QE for longer, if this occurs I will cover my short.
2. Stocks under pressure: ARKK ETF and the vast majority of speculative stocks are down 50-70%, these are the first to be hit when we extend to the end of a bull run, and the stock market participants are looking for a safe, cash flowing companies to ride into the end, that is essentially a flight to safety in anticipation of tapering and an increase in the funds rate.
3. Fed announced Taper: On November 3rd the fed announced the taper, since then we've seen stocks get smashed on any miss earnings and just the way the market is reacting to news has drastically changed. Most recent example is the new C19 variant, any potential bad news the market is no longer just brushing off, participants are confused and see the market as being irrational for no reason, where in fact the real reason is because of the TAPER. We will continue to see large draw downs on any negative news.
4. Valuation: The FAANG stocks is holding up this market, as they are seen as the safest and best companies the world. This has pushed there valuations to ALL time highs. MSFT is trading at a 37 PE and 14 PS, not seen since the Dot Com bubble. Normal MSFT or AAPL trade at a PE of 12-18 and that was during the last decade where they had a massive run rate of growth ahead of them.
5. Shift to small cap from large cap?: I have thought about the possibility of a shift away from large cap, allowing them to correct while small cap coming back into favour, keep the market propped up,  however EVERY SINGLE time MSFT has corrected or crashed the market does the same. So unless this is the first time we ever see this happen, It just isn't probable.
6. Forward guidance: AAPLE is only expected to grow at 4% in 2022, and MSFT 15ish%. Demand has been pulled forward and we are going to see a reset in their valuations based on forward looking guidance, currently it is completely unsustainable and they have no way to grow into there valuations.
7. Economic outlook: Inflation is rising which will put pressure on companies margins if they don't have pricing power. On top of this I expect we see a much weaker consumer in 2022/2023. The cost of living is rising significantly in every aspect of people's lives, leaving them with less disposable income to spend on non essentials. Any correction in the stock market or housing market would further pressure consumer confidence making them think twice about going on that vacation or buying a new Macbook etc..
8. China: The Chinese economy is on the brink of collapse, the real estate giants such as Evergrande are barely meeting payments on interest. Evergrande has 300 billion in debt and is selling assets to meet interest obligations. Real estate sales are down 30% in October! The Chinese see the inevitable real estate crash as these giant companies fail, which will cause the economy to collapse and will have a ripple affect on the world. China is the #1 purchaser of commodities from countries around the world, as their economy slows they will purchase less ,which will put pressure on other countries GDP,  we have already seen a massive slow down in China doing just this!
9. Market is currently crashing: The Russel 2000 peaked a couple weeks ago on November 8th and is already down 10%. In nearly ever case small cap lead a crash (not including black swan events) and the S&P follow behind within a matter of weeks. Also; technical analysis on the FAANG stocks all show they were extremely over extended and have peaked, which would be very consistent with the Russell leading the crash and 2 weeks later (now) the FAANG beginning their crash.   Thank you for reading. Please poke holes in this thesis and invest at your own risk.  Don't fight the FED, adapt to their policy.

My trade is on the following;

\-SARK (Inverse ARKK ETF)

\-SPXU (3X Leverage inverse S&P ETF)

\-TZA (3X leverage inverse Russell 2000 ETF)

It is the summer of 2015, orange man is on the rise. I'm twenty years old, working in a hot stuffy Western Digital (HGST) lab. I spend my days putting hard drives and SSDs into servers, running tests on them, collecting data, updating the firmware & replacing the drives. This is the work for dummies like me who couldn't get internships at tech companies.

And now that we've established that I'm retarded (a slow learner), let's continue. I'm coming home every night and reading about investing. I read ""PROFITS GOOD"", ""DIVIDENDS GOOD"", ""TECH BAD,"" ""TECH NO MAKE PROFIT OR PAY DIVIDEND,"" ""TECH IS BUBBLE.""

Okay, simple enough, so I go around telling everyone , ""tech is bubble, amazon has NEVER made profit"". ""People should invest in companies that make profit and pay dividends so dividends can be reinvested.""

So with this stupid thinking, guess what I do??? I put 8K into Ford because it pays dividends and makes profit, unlike Tesla, which is ""total scam"".

REEEeeeeeEEEEEEeeeEEEEEE, FUCK FUCK FUCK.

Three years of my life past and this dog shit car company goes down 30%. But HEY, at least I got dividends the whole way down. Meanwhile FANGS killed it (Amazon up 250%...)

# What I failed to understand

We currently live in an era where access to capital (money) is dirt fucking cheap (i.e. low interest rates). If we look at a chart for the interest rates on corporate debt, we see that we've been in a secular decline since the 1980s. Hence, year after year, access to capital is getting cheaper and cheaper.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8sm2zhuwmn281.png?width=2356&format=png&auto=webp&s=22290983179194c6325db318f955dd39b5aafddf

So in an era of cheap capital, the big dick move is to reinvest all revenue back into the company and expand aggressively as possible. Company over spends one year? Who gives a fuck, we're growing revenues at 10, 20, 30% year over year. The interest rates on the debt is nothing compared to the revenue growth.

This is why growth stocks have absolutely crushed it since 2008. Old boomers will cry all day about the importance of ""profits"" but what they fail to realize is the times have changed. They grew up in an era where capital was becoming more and more scarce as interest rates marched higher and higher. When capital is scarce, profits and the accumulation of capital is everything.

""BUT WHAT ABOUT COMPANIES THAT MAKE FAT PROFITS, AND HAVE HIGH REVENUE GROWTH??""

Those make my pp extra hard (i.e. apple, google, microsoft). The important aspect to me however is they continue to have high revenue growth. I'd take revenue growth over profits any fucking day of the week.

In my opinion some of the greatest value investors of this decade will be investors that find companies where the market is greatly misunderstanding the companies future revenue growth. A recent example of this is Asana, where it was growing revenue at 80% per year, however the market cap was only 4 billion at IPO.

However, I'm still retarded so I don't listen to my own advice. Only bought $4,000 worth and no calls 🤦‍♂️

Everyone and their mum knows that the future is coming fast and wants a piece of the pie, but that leads to almost every publicly traded company having a crazy valuation, even fraudulent ones( I am looking at you, NKLA) . Some might argue that the insanity is even bigger, cuz the automotive industry is famous for its competitiveness and low margins. However, no one knows how long the bubble will last, especially given the fact that the adoption of EV vehicles is growing rapidly and if you have a higher risk tolerance there is still time to make a bunch of money.  My personal favourite is Canoo, a company that despite all of the hype in the space, might still be a bit undervalued if it manages to deliver and has limitless upward potential if its competitors continue to trade at such  high valuations and the EV sector continues to be the ""hot chick"" of the stock market.

&#x200B;

Canoo is a young company that was founded by former Faraday and BMW employees. They both have left the company and one of them is now supposedly being in charge of the development of the Apple car.  The current CEO is Tony Aquilla, a serial enterpreneur. Aquilla has founded and sold numerous companies and all of them were directly connected  to the automotive industry.  In short, he mostly managed companies that sold workflow software for the vehicle's collision and insurance industries, but he also used to import automotive refinishing products. Also, unlike other executives of EV companies who ""cashed out"" at IPO, he recently bought 35.3 million shares of GOEV ( at a discounted price) and he plans to buy an additional 18.3 million, having a significant part of his network tied to the company. Well, this guy definitely inspires trust. 

&#x200B;

Okay, the CEO is good, any other reason to buy Canoo?  I think that there are many. First of all, Canoo is not just another EV company that has its exterior design as the possible main competitive advantage. They actually want to revolutionise the way that EV cars are made. The basic shape of a car hasn’t really changed over a century, with space for an engine, space for passengers, and space for luggage, all arranged in basically the same configuration. But because powerful electric motors and batteries are smaller than a standard powertrain, the whole shape of the vehicle could transform, if car designers were feeling creative. Canoo designed what it calls a “skateboard,” a thin platform that holds the battery cells, powertrain, and suspension, leaving more room for passengers with less footprint. Furthermore, they would use their ""skateboard"" as the de facto chasis for all of their models and that means faster production with less production costs. 

&#x200B;

Are they gonna really make a vehicle, or what you are saying has not gotten past a powerpoint presentation? Yes, they will as soon as the end of 2022. The company plans to build  a 400-acre campus including a full commercialization facility with a workshop, general assembly plant and another low-volume industrialization facility in Oklahoma. Canoo expects the plant to employ approximately 2000 people. Furthermore, the state has commited 300 million in financial iniatives for them. They are also planning to build a research facility in Arkansas and moved their headquarters there( of course, they have made a deal with the state that guarantees them more financial iniatives) . All in all, their mission is to transform  the U.S. Route 412 corridor from Oklahoma through Arkansas into a center of electric vehicle research, development and manufacturing power. 

&#x200B;

Now, let's take a look at their financials. Canoo as expected is a loss-generating company as they have zero revenue. However, their ""current ratio"" is over 3, which means that there is an extremely low chance for them to have liquidity problems at least in the near term. They also have preorders that are worth 303 million and expect at least 100 million from universities and institutions in the states that they are operating in. They also upped their sales estimates and now expect to sell 30000 units in 2023.

Can I make a lot of money from investing in Canoo in a short amount of time?  I never invest in companies for this reason, but nearly 40 percent of Canoo's float is shorted and if the shorts start to cover, the share price might get ""artificially"" inflated fast. There are also some near term catalysts like potential Apple and Walmart partnerships, but I won't dive deep into them, cuz they are pure speculation. There are a lot of DD' s on reddit about this topic, if you want to know more. Last but not least, Cannoo's current market cap is way lower than some of its competitors, which also have zero revenue. It is nearly 40 x lower than Lucid's and Rivian's , 2x lower than Fisker's, and 1.2x lower than Nikola's. My personal opinion is that Canoo's downside is lower compared to most of its competitors and the upside is bigger ( I know how cliche that sounds). However, I won't suggest investing in GOEV stock if you do not have a rather high risk tolerance, because you are still investing with a company that is at the early stage of its development, has zero revenue and market cap in the billions."

r50roh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r50roh/matterport_mttr_is_on_the_rise/,Matterport ($MTTR) is on the rise,56,39,2021-11-30 01:24:35,"Howdy all,

&#x200B;

I think Matterport is going to be huge in the coming months… and here's why:

&#x200B;

To reach as many people as possible, every e-commerce company wants to distribute their fulfillment network as much as possible. The downside of this distribution is that the engineering and construction teams must travel to get accurate site measurements (as-designed - NEVER - matches the as-built... or the building just doesn't have blueprints/CAD available). This type of situation makes Matterport an indispensable tool; reducing engineer travel and speeding up the whole design process. Matterport has a network of contractors with their 3D scanning equipment across the country, and can easily get an accurate 3D and 2D model of the site built. As more e-commerce startups happen, and formerly closed business spaces begin to re-open, Matterport will be the go-to for accurate space information.

&#x200B;

Facebook already has a contract with Matterport for AI research. As Meta continues to grow and tries to get ""digitized"" workplaces, I'm sure Matterport will be the company scanning every corporate facility for ingestion.  Apple, Google, Microsoft, and many others are also trying to compete with Meta in the digital workspace realm, and they will also need 3D scans of workplaces, so this will be ripe for opportunity. The possibilities here are limitless.

&#x200B;

I've been keeping an eye on the housing market, and I would estimate that around 30% of houses I'm seeing have an accompanying Matterport. As foreclosures start to happen and the technology continues to gain popularity, this will only drive more adoption."

r491zl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r491zl/tsm_dd_the_most_important_worst_performing/,"TSM DD: The Most Important, Worst Performing Semiconductor (besides Intel)",89,71,2021-11-29 01:10:24,"**Company Summary**

TSMC is the worlds largest semiconductor manufacturer, with total market share at 57%, and high-performance market share of  >70%. They are based in Taiwan, but have recently started construction of new fabs in Arizona and Japan. They supply chips for Apple, AMD, NVDA, INTC.

**Opportunity**

*Large Addressable Market, and Growing*

The semiconductor space is currently a $550B industry, with total market growth of almost 25% YoY. This kind of growth rate for a mature industry is incredible, but semiconductors have a cyclical nature. Total semiconductor share is expected to grow to $800B by 2028, a CAGR of almost 10%.

*Strong Macro Tailwind*

Possible semiconductor legislation, and moves to green energy store, production,and EVs require semiconductors

*Possible semiconductor supercycle*

The age of the Metaverse, AI, 5G, EVs, self-driving, and robotics are upon us. These industries are growing at rapid pace and require custom chips, with TSMC provides. AMD/NVDA have skyrocketed this year on Metaverse news/great earnings, and TSMC is the main supplier of these high performance chips. The reason Micron bounced back recently is because people are realizing this cycle will last longer than they thought. AMD CEO Lisa Su (I love her) recently stated we are in a semiconductor megacycle. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZGwLas0MyY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZGwLas0MyY)

**Strengths**

*Strong Financials*

TSMC is sitting on a PE of 29, and a forward PE of 25. They are currently growing at a CAGR of about 15%, with their gross margin at about 50%, which I suspect will be growing in the coming quarters. TSMC recently raised prices across the board 10-20%, which all their customers accepted. They know they have pricing power, as they sell literally everything they make. Companies fight over capacity. I have a feeling we may see more price increases in the future as their moat widens. They also pay a nice dividend.

*Amazing Products, Wide Moat*

TSMCs moat is widening every year. Frankly, Intel is fucked. They are 1-2 years behind on nodes, and this gap is growing. TSMC will spend more than 100 billion dollars in just the next 3 years on fabs, which they have plans for 3 new fabs this year. TSMC is starting mass production on 5nm nodes, while Intel is on 10nm (about 7nm compared to TSMC). Once you lose the performance crown, it's very difficult to take it back. In fact, Intel started to buy chips from TSMC this year.

**Risks**

*Gyna.* Over 50% of their capacity in based on Taiwan. If China decides to attack, they are fucked.

HOWEVER, tell me. If China attacks Taiwan, what do you think will happen to your stocks? The entire market will take a shit. It will be WW3. So while these are valid concerns, the chances of an invasion are very low, and if they do, money is gonna be the least of my problems. Anyways.

**The Play**

TSM is currently up 20% over the last year (YTD 4%), underperforming the market, with semiconductor ETFs up over 45% in the same period. They’ve traded in a range of 110-125 since February. Last week, they broke above 125 before the market took a fat shit. Options volume has been crazy and IV is on the rise, whales buying up tons of December calls.

The Play will be load up on Jan 23 125 calls. The IV is very low at about 30%, and a breakeven of 138 in 14 months. Just saying, we were over these prices in January. If you want more risk/more reward, Jan/March 125c will probably print. I bought in a 120 and will triple down at 110.

In Conclusion, **TSM Jan 23 125c.** "

Edit 3: I'll try to update new information at the top:

1. From Moderna CMO - \~30 mutations on the spike protein, 50 mutations in total. Also believes that it will be probable that immune escape will occur. \*no evidence to support yet.
2. 2 cases discovered in Canada.

**TL;DR.** *On the variant itself* \- it is likely highly transmissible (\~500% more than the virus originating from Wuhan), a small sample size suggests it is less severe.  Immunity escape and vaccine avoidance are unknown.  See link below for details on the above, mutations and actual case counts. Edit: Important note is that the data on transmission and severity is based on limited information, however the WHO states there was enough evidence to make a declarative statement on transmissibility. The facts pertaining to this variant are based around what is scientifically known about the mutations.

*Latest News* \- Israel has shut its borders for 2 weeks, India has stated they may restrict international travel, CDC states there are no USA cases.

*Positive Information, Path forward and an opinion on the markets:*

1. 14–21 days: much more information will be available about the mutations (especially the unknown ones). We will also have more information on severity.
2. 50 to 100 days: IF the variant escapes vaccines it will take about 6 weeks to release an updated vaccine (this is because in the case of vaccine updates a limited trial of just 24 people is required). Estimate is 50 to 100 days to having the vaccine available.

My personal opinion: if the markets are truly forward looking and we estimate that a highly transmissible, less severe disease may have some resolution in 100 days then the market should correct it’s recent downtrend (will have to analyze flows tonight).

Positions: long Apple, cash and VIX calls as a hedge

Edit 2: Notes on Friday's market action (26Nov21)

1. It was a half day of trading with low volume (low liquidity)
2. JPow's announcement had been pulled to earlier in the week (would have been a positive catalyst for Friday)
3. SPX futures dropped below the vol trigger line (4666) overnight - this means things can get extreme - term structure went into backwardation as well.
4. Disagreement between OPEC and SPR release for several countries (crude impact)
5. MOC $2B + (could be funds de-risking)
6. A lot of put selling occurred at 3800 and 4000 (for Feb) on SPX
7. The magnitude and volume of the moves on Friday usually indicate we have more downside but this could really have been an overreaction to the Omicron news, so I'm waiting for the market to tell me what to do (my trading style) - I'll be very interested in futures tonight, the volatility and flow positioning."

Since we definitely have a great influence on the overall trading situation, I decided to conduct new research on the most popular companies over the last week based on retail traders’ activity (buying/selling), as well as the sentiment of their tendencies.

Let's drill into this and discover the top 5 companies by percentage of trades by retail traders for the last week:

**1. Tesla (**[**$TSLA**](https://contora.ai/ticker/TSLA)**)**

Even after selling billion worth of shares by Elon Musk, $TSLA remains the most valuable automaker in the world, with a market valuation >$1 trillion.

**2. Lucid Group, Inc. (**[**$LCID**](https://contora.ai/ticker/LCID)**)** \- is a technology and automotive company. It develops the next generation of electric vehicle (EV) technologies.

Btw, $NVDA shares bounced back today from their mini sell-off - it happened after **Nvidia** crushed Wall Street's expectations when it released its fiscal 2022 third-quarter results on November 17th, with its record numbers and impressive guidance sending the stock up 8% to a new all-time high post the release.

While this makes a lot of sense (calculated risk mitigation & informed forecast), it's quite difficult (at least for me) to pin-down what exactly they spend that time on.

1000hours or 6 months etc. is a lot of time, which can potentially reveal a lot of more or less useful stuff about a company... so the question is what's the ""optimal"" breakdown of that time?

I mean...

r0xnap,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r0xnap/klic_september_quarter_dd/,KLIC September quarter DD,3,20,2021-11-24 13:39:15,"  

Kulicke & Soffa Industries, Inc., (KLIC $57.07) reported September quarter results that were better than initial expectations and guided the December quarter to be above street estimates as the core wire bonder business is performing a bit better than expected given the drop in IC unit volume growth. KLIC is seeing upside to other segments such as high-end LED, advanced packaging tools for thermal compression bonding, and growing opportunities in the automotive segment with power management chips and battery assembly applications.  Over the next couple of years the company's LED pick and place tool could drive revenue in this segment to be over $300 million from around $80 million in FY2021 establishing KLIC with another major growth driver.  The new LED tool addresses more applications besides just final placement including sorting, binning, and adjusting the LEDs on the substrate and is expected to drive much broader customer adoption outside of the initial customer who we believe is Apple. We would be adding to positions of KLIC at current valuations with a move to the $105 range of 15x our FY2022 pro-forma EPS of $6.34 plus the $11.63 in net cash.

The company reported September (Q4FY2021) revenue of $485.3 million up 14.4% sequentially and up 173% versus last year's September quarter and in-line with the company's pre-release of results on November 1, 2021.  Revenue was better than initial estimates driven by strength in general semiconductor, memory and LED revenue coming in at the high end above $80 million for the year. Gross margin was 47.7% up from the 46.1% reported last quarter driven by volume, mix, cost reductions, and ASP increases. Operating profit was a record 31.9% up from 28.4% reported last quarter and the 13.0% reported in last year's September quarter. Pro-forma EPS was $2.17 up from the $1.87 reported last quarter and the $0.35 reported in last year's September quarter and in-line with the pre-released EPS estimate of $2.15-$2.17.

KLIC generated $123 million in cash flow from operations and total cash increased $105 million sequential to $740 million or $11.63 in net cash per share up from the $10.00 in net cash reported last quarter as KLIC continues to be a cash generating machine.  Increasing cash by $4.15 per share over the last twelve months

KLIC's reported FY2021 revenue of $1.52 billion up 144% in versus FY2020 and better than the company's initial $1.50 billion estimate driven by much higher IC unit volume growth in 2021 driving the company's core wire bonder business significantly higher servicing the 5G, EV's, and increasing content and complexity of each IC.  Strong growth in LED displays, service and the automotive recovery also helped revenue growth for the year. Operating income was $412.4 million or 27.2% of revenue in FY2021 up from the 9.4% reported in FY2020 driving huge EPS growth of 482% to $6.14 propelled by the increase in revenue and tight operating expense control.

The company guided December quarter (Q1FY2022) revenue to be $460 million down 5.2% sequentially and up 73% versus last year and better than the street's $411.7 million estimate driven by another strong LED display quarter and less of a decline in the core wire bonder business than initially anticipated.  Gross margin should be around 47% down slightly from the 47.7% reported last quarter. Pro-forma EPS should be $1.88 +/- 10% down from the $2.17 just reported and up from the $0.86 reported last year and better than the street's $1.54 estimate driven by the higher revenue and gross margin. 

KLIC did not update the $1.5 billion revenue estimate for FY2022 (flat with the $1.52 billion just reported in FY2021) but did suggest we might now have a bit of upside to that number as the core wire bonder business declines a bit in calendar 2022 as overall unit volume growth slows from over 20% in 2021 to around 8-10% in 2022.  This decline of around $150-$200 million in core wire bonding revenue in 2022 will be offset by growth in the company's other segments of high-end LED, advanced packaging focused on thermal compression bonding with a large OEM who we believe is Intel, new opportunities in automotive battery assembly and power management segments with customers such as Tesla and increased service revenue producing flat revenue for the year, or as we are forecasting, moderate growth for FY2022 to near $1.6 billion.  Expanding gross margin and operating leverage should produce higher EPS on flat revenue in FY2022. We are now forecasting pro-forma EPS of $6.34 in FY2022 up from the $6.14 just reported.

We would be adding to positions of KLIC at current valuations with a move to the $105 range of 15x our FY2022 pro-forma EPS of $6.34 plus the $11.63 in net cash.  In the near term the core wire bonder business will drop a bit in 2022 but then probably start to grow again in 2023 as increased IC unit volume growth drives up the core business again. The ramp of the LED display business from $80 million to over $100 million in 2022 and the ramp up of new advanced packaging products, in the back half of 2022 in the thermal compression bonding segment, which should double from the $20 million range to over $40 million in 2023 and $80 million in 2024, and growing automotive and battery assembly revenue should allow KLIC to show slight revenue growth in 2022 and higher revenue growth above $1.5 billion in 2023 and 2024 pushing the stock to over $100."

Most of you apes know Qualcomm as a company that supplies chips for smartphones, but in the latest Earnings call and investors Day, Qualcomm has shown the results of its diversification plans. With roughly **40%** of the QCT **earnings being from non-handset domain.** This has clearly pleased the wall street and the stock jumped more than 40% over the last few weeks!

The main reason why I am supper bullish on Qualcomm is that they mentioned with all their diversification plans coming into fruition their total addressable market has jumped from **100B to 700B!** That is insane for company of this size.

# A brief overview of Qualcomm’s New & Existing Markets

**The Metaverse:** 

https://preview.redd.it/g0klgm7und181.png?width=2195&format=png&auto=webp&s=9079349fa0732c10fcbd45a33ead96f768932138

Qualcomm has been in the metaverse game before it was hip. More than **10M** Meta Oculus have been shipped containing the SnapDragon XR2 chips. They already have a strong presence in this area, and it’s likely to be more popular. They have acquired multiple AR related companies over the last decade and have a well-established Snapdragon Spaces Developer platform. The CEO is expecting demand for these devices to be just as big as phone market which means another market space for Qualcomm to dominate in.

**The PC market:**

Let’s be honest, Qualcomm’s current presence is the PC space is almost negligible. But Last year Qualcomm did a very interesting acquisition of **Nuvia for 1.4B** dollars. Nuvia was a startup focused on developing ARM based high performing CPUs which was **founded by chief architect of Apple SOC**, responsible for CPUs like iphone A14 Bionic chips and also the M1 & M1 pro Macbook chips! Qualcomm already has the best modem expertise in the world, and teaming up theoretically with the best CPU team is definitely gonna take a good bite out of the PC chip market share soon. Qualcomm is planning to launch its first CPU by late 2022. 

**Automotive tech:**

https://preview.redd.it/86j6smdynd181.png?width=2340&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfe6050350390e98ba595f49af4aceb6ac91ab59

Qualcomm is serious about being the technology provider for most of the auto industry. It recently acquired the ADAS (advanced driver assistance system) unit of Veoneer for **4.5B** dollars. GM and BMW are one of the first companies that has agreed to power their digital cockpit with Qualcomm tech. Revenues from auto sector have already doubled since last year with **13B design wins in the pipeline** over the next few years. 

**5G Dominance:**

https://preview.redd.it/8t3u5khznd181.png?width=1890&format=png&auto=webp&s=70f171e5d260f2b7f00d477f8f11d62f3eb81dc7

Qualcomm has decades of expertise in Communication technology, which is significantly more than any other companies. With the transition from 4G to 5G just starting, Qualcomm is set to continue dominance in the smartphone world. The big concern that investors had with Qualcomm was with Apple planning to make its own modem chips in the next few years. But QCOM is projecting that the revenues from Apple will be less than 5% within a couple of years. **Even though Apple and Samsung are making in-house chips, they cannot escape the royalties that they have to pay to Qualcomm for using their 5G patents.** So virtually every smartphone is using Qualcomm tech directly or indirectly!

**IoT Projection looks Insane and currently on track:**

https://preview.redd.it/1rxoh0l0od181.png?width=2637&format=png&auto=webp&s=80b766d721b0252482385b544cd787a7abfd4ffc

TLDR: Qualcomm is a severely undervalued at the moment, especially if you compare to Nvidia, which has less earnings than Qualcomm and still roughly 4X the market cap of $QCOM. With all the diversification plans showing results every quarter, $QCOM It is ready to launch into stratosphere. I believe Qualcomm has the potential to be one of the best tech stock over the next few years.

My Position: 250 shares and few 185c jan calls for some tendies. 

Not a Financial advice. Do your own research.

Every other company has been building the same vehicle over and over again, Tesla had the bright idea to add batteries but changed nothing else except adding a frunk. EV's offer the opportunity to rethink this design, however Tesla, Rivian, Lucid, Fisker, Lordstown, you name it, have opted to manufacture the same damn thing.

Canoo has rethought this formula, and is creating vehicles with more space and less of a footprint. Want a minivan interior with a compact car exterior? Want a truck with a longer bed and more storage space than an F250 in half the footprint? Only Canoo is offering these things, and my bet is that the age of supersized unnecessary vehicles is closing, and the age of efficiency and proper utilization of space is near.

I've been in this company since pre-SPAC and it continues to quietly and thoughtfully move forward. It's signed a deal with one contract manufacturer in Europe (VDL NEDCAR) and has signed an agreement with Oklahoma to build its own facility. Canoo just bumped up it's manufacturing timeline to late 2022 and, just for fun, Apple was in negotiations with this company early on, and if you believe the rumors, they offered to buy it and they were rejected by the leadership team.

And just to be as honest as possible, I've owned both the stock and warrants for the last 18 months and it currently takes up about 33% of my brokerage account (it was 8 percent not that long ago but it's gone up and I couldn't help but buy more). Tesla at 1.2B, Rivian at 100B, Lucid at 90B, Fisker at 6.5B....Canoo at 2.5B. Refuse to believe it will stay this way for long.

Edit:  I should state that Canoo had a really good day when I posted this, and it’s rare that that’s followed by another rise so, if you’re interested, might want to consider that.  That being said, I’m holding for a long time and believe this will be much larger than a 2.5B company in the future, especially after they start manufacturing."

**SNAP – Ruling the Meta-World : An Alpha Call**

*Disclaimer: Not a financial advice; just my view and interpretations.* 

**Brief Synopsis:** 

SNAP the self-proclaimed camera company is the de-facto founder and ruler of the Meta-world. The technologies developed by SNAP over the years have been game changer in almost all aspects and have been shamelessly copied by the major social media players. Snapchat launched the filters, stories, spotlight, in app games, social maps and many more paving the way for Snapchat being arguably the most preferred social media in the 13-24 year (90%) and 13-34 year (75%) population.

SNAP has also been well received by the product companies. Their AR (Augmented Reality) technology is far superior than any of the competition that is around. The AR helps the users to try the products (apparel and accessories) and gives them more confidence about product fit and quality. This also reduces returns to a great extent and is preferred by the manufacturers.

**The current issue pulling the stock price down:**

Apple’s new privacy feature that allows the user to turn off tracking has affected the targeted advertising. This has increased the cost of acquiring sale through ads in Snap and all other mobile based advertising platforms. This move has adversely affected the earnings of SNAP and it missed their own lower end of the guidance in Q3 by $3 Mn. In the words of the CEO/Founder, Evan Spiegel, “While we anticipated some degree of business disruption, the new Apple provided measurement solution did not scale as we had expected, making it more difficult for our advertising partners to measure and manage their ad campaigns for iOS”. 

**How will SNAP tackle this?**

But the important part here is what Evan Spiegel later said during the Q&A of the earning’s call, “This has definitely been a frustrating setback for us, but I think over the long term these privacy changes and protecting privacy for users is really important for the long-term health of the ecosystem and something that we fully support”. In the current environment it is really meaningful of a CEO to recognize this and find a way to monetize with these limitations. 

Also, when the supply chain issues start to resolve, maybe post the holiday period, advertisement revenue will pick up once again, mainly in SNAP (among social media); why? because of SNAP’s incredible AR technology, its metaverse model and the user group that values its privacy and which fully utilizes the AR world. Recent brands that have started using SNAP’s AR technology to target user groups include Samsung (for their wearable), Hollister, American Eagle, Ralph Lauren, HBO Max (through co-watching experience).

**Financial Performance:**

SNAP has been proving itself to investors consistently. Just looking at their numbers will prove how incredible they have been. **Heads UP:** They have not yet made a profit. But they are on the way to being mighty profitable. **Take a look at their key numbers and make a decision for yourself.** This is a long term play.

If Warren Buffett says it, then it must be true, so this means that AAPL has to be valued alongside other disruptive EV companies such as FSR, NKLA, LCID, and RIVN. The reason TSLA is not included in this list is because everyone knows that TSLA is a boomer value stock EV company as indicated by it trading at a mere 371x P/E ratio.

In order to properly value Apple we need to gather estimates of FY 2021E Revenue for the other Disruptive EV companies:

Trading at a monumental 27 Standard Deviations away from our sample mean (statistically speaking, the valuation is in the bottom 1.229691733830117\*10\^-162% of all disruptive EV companies), Apple has a lot of room for upside. If apple were to grow to a valuation in just the bottom quartile of our sample, AAPL would be at $23,316 a share, a 14,422% gain."

What I am trying to understand is the relationship between the brand names in the industry and the investor community for that industry in the market. For example, Apple, it has a strong following in the social media channels and usually positive sentiments on the social media channels about the stock results in a price increase. Today's chart - 

[Sentiment increase --\> Price Increase](https://preview.redd.it/p0vfs32wkg081.png?width=1002&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c6524b36b7ed90e313f4d50f3d38439e72c4bb4)

What you would notice in this chart is that at around 9 AM today the bullish sentiments for APPL started growing on the social channel and this was followed by a price increase a couple of hours later. I also noticed the news about them accelerating their autonomous car, so that contributed to the social chatter on these channels as well. I saw this trend usually in industries where there are established brand names, such as Automotive (TSLA, RIVN), Entertainment (AMC, GME) and Tech. Media (MSFT, FB etc.) 

But at the same time, industries such as Marijuana, Psychedelics etc. do not really follow this trend. As I try to understand why? one reason that I could think of is that these industries do not have a strong established incumbent and hence do not really have a strong social following. Which further leads me to think that these industries are just scratching the surface of their potential market cap. Another reason that comes to mind is the percentage of the shares that are held by institutions vs individuals. So, for companies and industries where we do not see a price movement following an uptick on social media, would it be safe to assume that most investors are institutions and not individuals. 

How do you all perceive the social media sentiments and their relation to the stock market for growing industry vs an establish industry? Sorry if the conclusions that I have drawn are very basic and not thorough, but I would appreciate a perspective or some direction to learn more."

Monday (11/15) after hours Tony Aquila (CEO) announces that Canoo will be accelerating US production from its orginal Q1 2023 to ""before Q4 2022"". I was sent a Bloomberg article written by Mark Gurman [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/apple-accelerates-work-on-car-aims-for-fully-autonomous-vehicle](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/apple-accelerates-work-on-car-aims-for-fully-autonomous-vehicle) mentioning that Apple is also accelerating work on their car.

The apple car's discussions seem to be moving in the direction of something similar to Canoo's models, how the seating should be ""along the sides of the vehicle"" and have an exterior design like the Canoo Lifestyle vehicle. 

Canoo has the Multi Purpose Platform, the flattest skateboard design as of now. This platform is designed in a way to carry any type of ""tophat"", this the way Canoo is decreasing it's engineering costs and how they are going to be launching 3 different vehicles  (possibly a forth, pictures of a sedan/sport vehicle were leaked) in 3 different segments. 

Here is the speculation: Tony Aquila has made a huge point of protecting IP, part of the reason why the engineering services deal with Hyundai was terminated. They made sure to poach top notch IP lawyer from Harley Davidson to protect it and sidelined VDL Nedcar (their contract manufacturer in Europe) over a hacking attack they recently had. Why would you be so hell bent on protecting IP unless you are going to be licensing it out to other companies (also for corporate espionage, but I'm not sure how often that happens). If they do license the MPP, Apple would only have to focus on what they do best, the design and the user interface and based on the patents Apple has been focusing more on those types of tasks. For example, Apple is exploring the potential of using a phone as the car's infotainment, Canoo has been on board with this concept since its inception.

I was having fun just moving shares around and making small amounts of money. Then a few weeks ago I decided to try options. I bought an apple call that went up a couple hundred bucks. I was amazed at how easy it was to make money with options. Then I decided to put a bunch of money into Delta Airlines calls expiring in January and February. Initially they went up, and I was making more money than ever before. But then they started to go down. As I'm writing this, my weekly chart is down almost 20%. This is all the money I had in my saving account. I'm not sure when I will crack, but at this rate it will be sometime soon. I'm still holding, but I can't focus on school or anything else because all I can think about is how much money I'm losing.

My question is, how do you guys deal with waking up in the morning and seeing huge losses? How do you keep going?

Edit: Thanks for all the great advice guys! So many responses! For now my plan is to keep holding because my [fortune cookie ](http://imgur.com/uV6mzeO)from lunch told me to, and I still have a few months till the calls expire."

I want to talk about $VIAC and why it's going to make you MONEY!!!

First off, what is $VIAC and what does it include?

1.  CBS- one of the most watched cable networks

2.  Paramount Pictures- makers of the most currently watched tv show ""Yellowstone"" and movies like a Quiet Place and wolf of wall street

3.  Showtime-Premium TV network with many top originals that also does boxing events such as the recent Canelo fight. Also includes Bellator, which has been growing and is the only real competition to UFC.

4.  Includes other Networks like MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, BET-which I’m sure most of you are familiarly with.

5.  Pluto TV- basically like free cable with a large selection of channels. Just tried it out for the first time today and it seems legit, you don’t even need an account to watch. Pluto TV revenue numbers are up 77.7% year over year.

6.  Paramount Plus, it has one of the largest content libraries for shows and movies. Also has deals with NFL, European Soccer Leagues, PGA (golf) and more. Also, paramount plus was one of the most download apps in the apple app store recently. They Also plan on releasing an exclusive movie each week in 2022. [https://www.cbr.com/paramount-plus-debut-new-movie-every-week-2022/](https://www.cbr.com/paramount-plus-debut-new-movie-every-week-2022/)

Let’s talk about upcoming catalyst.

1.  VIAC just announced they added 1 million subs on P+ in the last week. Netflix added 4.4 in all of Q3. 

2. This stock also has a small chance of announcing a buy out at any given time. Would be a great target for Amazon or Apple.  

Bonus, according to Nasdaq the Institutional Stock & Mutual Fund Ownership is 68.2%. and the Short interest is around 8%. I believe the rebound from the selling pressure happened today, shorts will start to cover and with the low average volume they should drive the price up.

There's a lot of other great points I missed, these are just some of things that come to my mind.  I would recommend spending some time looking into VIAC yourself. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.

I'm holding 15 leaps and just bought 40 35C expiring next week. IMO 35 is the lowest we will go anytime soon. 

TL;DR if you want to make some money buy VIAC Shares or Leaps, Fundamentals are as solid as an Applebee’s steak yet lots of growth potential."

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* Stocks slumped on fears that rising inflation may jeopardize the global economic recovery, prompting central banks to raise interest rates sooner than expected. treasuries rose.
* Traders took some risk off the table as data revealed a slowdown in new home development in the United States, implying that builders are struggling to break ground on projects due to high material prices and continued labour shortages. Target Corp. fell after warning that cost pressures are increasing, fueling fears that inflation may eat into retailer profitability. The NASDAQ 100, which is heavy on technology, beat key indexes, spurred by a rally in tech titans Apple and Tesla.
* According to GS' CEO Solomon markets may face a rough period as the economy attempts to recover from the rapid impact of the epidemic. If interest rates rise, it will ""take some of the euphorias out of some markets,"" he said in an interview at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore.
* The worst quarter for the S&P 500 since the pandemic appears to have scared off some do-it-yourself investors. According to the SEC and market data compiled by major newswire Intelligence, the retail trading surge that began with lockdowns has now subsided, with total equity volume from individual investors falling to 19% in the third quarter, down from 24% at the start of the year.

# Observations/Assumptions

Before  you jump down my throat, these are simplified observations/assumptions,  not internationally agreed upon mandates from heaven. Okay, now you can  jump down my throat.

* Companies  with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a  sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies  missing one or more of those attributes.
* For most people it is impossible to time the market
* Stock prices have all available information priced into them.
* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.
* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)
* [Index  fund returns, such as the S&P 500, are now predominately determined  by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)
* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).
* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 (yes, simplified)
* During times of volatility, companies that had poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.
* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.
* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:
   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp)  even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have had  losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing in  that same set of stocks in the same proportions.
   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don’t want to support.
   * Due  to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the  index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when Tesla  was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on 11/16/2020,  forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up the price,  which had already been driven up by people buying the stock knowing it  was then going to get added to the index forcing more people to buy the  stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular, that’s because it is.

# Hypothesis

Using  industry benchmarking against the best of the best of the best  companies in each industry in order to purchase only the best companies  in equal measure should provide a well-diversified portfolio that over  the long term should be able to beat the S&P 500.

# Experiment 2020

750  largest US stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry  (Industry details available further down the post). Stocks were given a  score based on their relative percentage compared to the industry index.  For example, each companies’ average ROE of the last 4 years was  compared to this index value with the following type of breakdown:

* ROE < Index ROE = Poor = 1
* ROE > Index ROE = Moderate = 2
* ROE > 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3

For  example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was  10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,  they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they would  receive a moderate rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would receive a  great rating.

This was done for all of the metrics below:

* ROE
* Revenue Growth %
* EBITDA %
* FCF %

The  relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there  was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth  only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be  decreased to 125% for a better distribution.

Any stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.

[ROE Example](https://preview.redd.it/t7l27u9tu6081.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f904309edb170cc8679189ea62f7bbe057646a3d)

ROE Example

That left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.

This  left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the  company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently  in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them  being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire? Has  WSB said it's a buy? Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason  that I want to exclude them?

That left 26 across 7 sectors.

**2020 Industry Breakdown**

These  26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and  September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total  purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.

2020 Experiment Results July, August, and September 2020 purchases to 11/16/2021

* **S&P 500** total return reinvested dividends: **49.09%**
* **My 26 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **61.53%**

Can we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.

# Experiment 2021

2,850  tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.  The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:

* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company
* Profit Margin – shows how effective the business is at making money
* Operating Margin – shows how much money the company earns on its revenue
* FCF Margin – shows how efficient a company is with their cash
* EBITDA Margin – shows a companies’ operating profitability
* ROE – shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money
* ROA – shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits
* ROIC – shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns
* Debt/Equity Ratio – shows the financial stability of a company

More  metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to  determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to  median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of  the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:

·  3 stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over  the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry is  then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that benchmark.

Each  stock was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the  metrics and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite  score out of 27, from 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the  metrics. The scores are based on how much better they are then the  average. I measured them against the benchmark using the same  methodology as previously performed: Poor < 100%, Good < 150%,  Great > 150%. Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the  particular metric to find a useful distribution.

I  also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst TICKER THAT SHALL NOT BE NAMED (evidently a stock that cannot be named because I was banned the first time I posted this) with a score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9 categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn’t match the original  input (congratulations on your reading comprehension), this is primarily  due to mergers/acquisitions or the stock being taken private. Another  stock was acquired during the analysis, changing the max number yet  again.

Here is an example showing Aerospace & Defense scoring:

[Aerospace & Defense scoring](https://preview.redd.it/5r8i1qb0v6081.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=947be14d943204b8211c0933e9c1f1a41d4a1986)

Here is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the company’s most recent year):

[Growth Scoring](https://preview.redd.it/a2nq8c1av6081.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1f79a62b587bf6f1530f5beefda1b174b5d7d43)

Here is an example of the visualizations for the data:

[Data Visualization Example](https://preview.redd.it/5d41vcvdv6081.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=26567d730e1d668ccef856a18497fab38345577b)

I  applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at  the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock  that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a  high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.

Next,  I read the description of \~300 stocks and looked through their  financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off  their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly  leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that  Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns  Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them (how could you not?), no  there are not great synergies between the sectors of the business, yes,  they are aware of this. I also eliminated industries I wasn’t interested  in reviewing, such as REITS due to the need to look at different  metrics like FFO, Oil and Gas because it’s oil and gas, etc. These  activities eliminated \~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I’d  need to build a separate model.

I  then looked at each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made  the cut. Are all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are  the profit margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt  situation, did WSB say it's a buy, etc. Who deserves to be on this list?  This eliminated \~75.

We were down  to 84 stocks at this point. I then looked at each company's investor  presentation, annual report, etc. to better understand what the company  does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was not nearly as thorough on  this portion this year compared to last year just due to the substantial  increase in companies, 26 vs 84. My hourly wage at McDonald was going  to be better than my returns from the analysis if I took too long. I  only eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83  companies across 31 industries. Breakdown below:

[Industry Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/0bmcwyuiv6081.png?width=390&format=png&auto=webp&s=0df395664265ef942ff736c889108711216e76ed)

I then purchased all of these in equal proportion in April, May, and July of 2021.

2021 Experiment Results April, May, and July 2021 purchases to 11/16/2021:

* **S&P 500** total return including reinvested dividends: **11.93%**
* **My 2021 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **14.26%**

# Industry Classification

* For Experiment 2020, the Sector was used to determine how companies should be compared.
   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.
   * This  seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each other  that aren’t really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE below.
* For Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.
   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.
   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).
   * I  ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further. Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less than 10  stocks. I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical issues dealing  with averages/medians that were negative. There were also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they could be combined such  as biotech and pharmaceutical.

# Notes

I  partnered up for both the 2020 and 2021 experiments. This was critical  for both expanding my initial idea, brainstorming methods to build the  model, and reviewing the work done for errors. This was a team effort,  and I by no means deserve all the credit or hate.

All returns are showing reinvested dividends in the total return.

First let's address the basic stuff and then the **well-kept secrets.**

**basic**

Last night ser Tony CEO/Chairman/mini-Elon dropped some updates - the key points:

* manufacturing production in the US to begin before Q4 2022 (vs early 2023) ➡️ sooner than exp.
* $100 million in additional non-dilutive financial incentives ➡️ more cash
* targeting $100 million in vehicle orders with the states and universities ➡️ would be juicy when set in stone
* cash left $414.9 million as of Sep 30, 2021

**the bigger picture**

* Canoo HQ is moving to **Bentonville** \- a city most **famously connected with Walmart.** Tony: “This is an advanced manufacturing facility that will allow us to produce vehicles for unique use cases as well as accelerate our testing into gamma. We’re looking for ways to take down the traditional go-to-market way and this will produce vehicles that we will sell, as well.” Then during the call Canoo played a video demonstrating the progress of its gamma build, **hinting at a specific unnamed partner for which the company is producing vehicles in the US**. Canoo expects to build 120 to 150 of those vehicles, and “some of them **will be** in the hands of potential **partners**"". [Read TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/canoo-is-setting-up-headquarters-in-walmarts-hometown-picks-panasonic-as-battery-supplier/?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALpMekhyzJoLaqvSyFMsBQ7sVoiVZZaqAdFyR2OxdEvGaz6boCqNRiQL3KYZtw_JKMlNlukcf5RkXfXVPbszJtU6Gnlx7xWdBclv1jPzA-goRnQny_1X0kuYlRBY3Sz-wg39pbL1d2irsUNh587CWwtUMTDPl158Kv4pq9s0Qd86) for more details and nice global recap.
* **The short interest is unsustainable.** Depending on which provider you get the SI numbers you will find between **25% and 35% SI** on GOEV. The days to cover based on [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest) are **15.5**([meaning](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daystocover.asp)). The market cap is only **$2.3bn.** Just for context LCID is $83bn and RIVN $138bn. Among the smaller EV US players Canoo has achieved the most beta testing and Apple wanted to buy them out before they went public to use their skateboard and IP as the basis for Project Titan aka the Apple Car. Shorts are cornered but they are also very strong on this ticker and will do anything to keep the price action contained.
* Today's price action is very indicative of the long/short story. GOEV opened at 8.50 just +0.05 from previous close. Then mini-mooned at 9.00 and 9.50 milestones. Obviously 10.00+ is the nightmare scenario for shorts going onto OpEx week. They will throw absolutely everything they have to keep it below $10.00 on Friday's expiry. On 1st attempt the stock managed to touch 10.01 then ladder down. On 2nd try 10.05 and ladder down. 10CALL 19-Nov has 18K open interest and almost 10K daily volume as I write. No other strike has a comparable activity.

**quick outro**

Btw not financial advice or whatever. I'm long stocks, warrants, and random calls - all ITM. I'd rather accumulate into one of the strongest IP and business plan at $2.3bn valuation and be on-board of the next moon mission rather than chase $80bn+ FOMOs near fully priced in.

**Bonus watch this** [cool video](https://78449.themediaframe.com/incomm/canoo111521_v2.mp4)

**Edit:** *I posted the OP when GOEV was at its 2nd try to consolidate above $10.00 (trading around $9.65). It took 5 intraday attempts to break free of all these $10.00 walls. And as I *luckily* predicted the pain started after that for the shorts with the stock running into day high at close. Last print in after hours was $12.55 ie +48.5% from previous close.*"

It owns the mobile space. Apple is building augmented and virtual reality hardware that will complete with Meta gear. The iOS moat will have a significant impact on the emerging metaverse. Unity Software and their dominate mobile virtual reality gaming engine is testimony to that.

Eventually, AR/VR glasses will replace Oculus like VR headsets. Longterm, that will be the real metaverse battle. The consensus of opinion at the moment is that AR/VR glasses will one day replace mobile phones in the future metaverse world. Apple is well aware and is planning accordingly.

In conjunction with development of  AR/VR glasses, the iPhone and Apple Watch are sleeping metaverse giants. Beware!"

Some decent write-ups were done for VZIO a few months back. The market has continued to ignore the stock since then, but it's missing the ball on this growth story as the financials are somewhat clouded by their hardware sales/margins. Make no mistake, this is 100% a play on their platform model. 

Thesis -
Although it's possible that growth slows, absent a macro event (recession, etc), Vizio's ability to drive adoption through subsidized hardware sales (i.e. selling TVs at breakeven or even a loss) should allow them to succesfully eat into incumbents (Roku, Apple TV) market share. Black Friday and Christmas TV sales in 2021 will drive meaningful uptick in Platform + viewing hours in 2022, so I think both the sequential and YOY growth metrics will end up being conservative. The company has now had 3 quarterly reports as a public company, and has beaten Platform + revenue guidance 2 out of 2 times, indicating that demand continues to grow quicker than anticipated. A third beat in Q4 2021 and strong guidance for Q1/FY 2022 would cause a huge jump in the stock price (at least $30, but potentially $50+). Current Analyst PT are $29 for Piper Sandler and $30 for Needham. I think we start getting some PR over the next month and this closes 2021 around $30. Leaps are the play.

But is 2030 the best time to sell? Will Tesla yoy growth justify its stock growth?

Tesla doesn't have a demand problem cause it sells every car it makes, so their main problem is their supply capacity.

So this analysys is based on the Utopia principle that Tesla will have enough demand until 2030 and that it will grow at a 40% rate. And that it will be able to build their factories in 12 months without any geopolitical problem and with swift negotiation with the goverments of all the countries. And with the asumption that Tesla suppliers will be able to grow at a similar rate and that all the copper/alum/etc mines will be able to satisfy the demand.

&#x200B;

**Important data**

Elon said that they will search where to build more factories in 2022 and that they will announce the location in 2023.

The calculation is based on the premise that the factories will be built in 12 months and that they will be able to go at max output instantly. Elon said that they will increase their max output of the factories by 50% next year, so in the calculation in the 1st year the factories will have a max output of 500.000 cars and in the next 750.000.

&#x200B;

Max output: Shanghai 500.000 cars

**Result: Supply doesnt meet the demand**

&#x200B;

This shows that in 2030 Tesla wont be able to grow at a 40% rate unless it builds more factories than in this analysis. In the case that Tesla announces a lower number of factories in the next years vs the analysis then their supply wont meet the demand sooner.

In my opinion Tesla is more than capable to built 3-4 factories at the same time, the main problem would be the lack of human resources, regulatory problems like in Germany, negotiation issues, etc, all external problems that Tesla cant do anything about them.

Internal problems like a lack of money for the new factories are not an issue for Tesla. 

One main advantage that Tesla has is that they can make the new factory better than the last one, so in 2030 they could need less factories to meet the demand by making each factory produce close to 1M like they aim to do in Fremont, this would offset any external problem like in Germany.

**And this is where i ask for help: Has any automaker be able to built 5 factories at the same time? or any other industrial company? Apple, BYD?**

In my opinion Tesla is a safe bet until 2025, then we will need to reevaluate it, cause predicting 9 years ahead is just guessing, anything can happen.

**In my opinion BYD is the main threat to Tesla. And Starlink is the main threat to Tesla stocks cause even tesla investors will sell some shares and stop buying to buy Starlink shares when it goes public in 5 years.**"

&#x200B;

I'm not gonna go in-depth about Canoo as a company. If you're on WSB then you've probably heard of Canoo. Regardless we all just throw money around any way, so fuck it, if you really give a shit then do some research.

&#x200B;

To cut to the chase, Canoo is having its' Earnings Report next Monday (11/15/2021). Because Canoo is a newer EV company they obviously don't have any true earnings to announce. The idea is that Tony Aquila (CEO of Canoo) will use this call to drop some good news. But will he drop news? and if so, what?

&#x200B;

**That's where the true speculation begins.**

&#x200B;

A lot of information has been leaked that Tony Tequila has not commented on or has barely acknowledged and is not priced-in. The next logical thought process is; What information does Tony Tequila have that hasn't been leaked yet? Will Tony Tequila comment on any of the leaked information or release any new information?

Well, what I'm saying, is that there are known-knowns and that there are known-unknowns. But there's also unknown-unknowns; things we don't know that we don't [know.](https://youtu.be/2msQwpzatQc?t=23)

&#x200B;

**Here's some known-knowns that hasn't received a lot of press and has barely moved the stock price:**

\- Canoo announcing battery supply agreement with Panasonic

\- Canoo's attendance of the Certified Pest Control Operators of Georgia's 23rd annual conference

\- An insane amount of new hires including people from Nio, Tesla, Harley Davidson, etc.

\- Canoo partnership with VDL Nedcar to manufacture vehicles

\- Canoo's MPDV nominated for Red Dot Design Award

&#x200B;

**Here's some of the known-unknowns that Canoo hasn't commented on or has barely acknowledged:**

\- Pictures of the new sedan (leaked, unannounced)

\- Frontdoor Collective ordering 10,000 delivery vans by 2024 from Canoo (barely acknowledged, hardly any press)

\- [AirAsia](https://i.imgur.com/WpY2qVX.png) partnering with Canoo for its' new rideshare program (YouTube video uploaded by AirAsia then made private soon after)

\-Tony Aquila's Form 4 showing him become a majority shareholder in the company

&#x200B;

**Unkown-unkowns?**

\- Who the fuck does know. Looking at the past knowns, it could be anything (Canoo-Apple partnership? /s)

The obvious idea behind unknown-unknowns is that Tony ""butt fuck"" Tequila could release information that hasn't been leaked that no one knows of.

**A little bonus spice:**

Now I want to make it clear that this is mostly an earnings play.

&#x200B;

But I can't leave out the the insane volume of open interest for the 11/19 calls. Currently there are 56,598 options that are currently OTM. 17,069 of them are for the $10 strike. Current stock price as of writing this is is around $8.50. If the 10 strike calls get close to being ITM then GOEV could go parabolic.

&#x200B;

I want to reiterate, this is not a GME type fresh orange juice play, this is speculation on the Earnings Report being received well by the market. But the fact that OTM OI is so high, could help this stock fly. Just an added bonus.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

Canoo ($GOEV) will release some big news that makes the market excited for the company. When big news then big moves. High OI make stock fly.

&#x200B;

I will add links for proof to the above claims in a comment below. Auto-mod is a bitch.

# [Stock futures inch higher after sell-off induced by hot inflation data](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures inched higher in early morning trading on Thursday following a tech-driven sell-off on Wall Street.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose about 40 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures added 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.7%.
*****
> Disney shares fell more than 5% in premarket trading after the media giant missed on the top and bottom lines of its quarterly results. Disney+ subscribers also came in short of estimates.
*****
> The major averages dipped on Wednesday after a hot inflation report pushed up bond yields. The rise in yields especially pressured growth pockets of the market.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 240 points. The S&P 500 fell 0.8%. The Nasdaq Composite was the relative underperformer, dipping 1.7% as Facebook-parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet all closed lower.
*****
> The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 dropped 1.6% on Wednesday.
*****
> Fresh economic data released Wednesday showed persistent inflation. The consumer price index, which tracks a basket of products ranging from gasoline and health care to groceries and rents, rose 6.2% in October from a year ago, hitting its highest level in three decades. On a monthly basis, the CPI increased 0.9% against the 0.6% estimate.
*****
> “Inflation remains stubbornly high, to the surprise of many that expected prices to come back to earth sooner,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial. “The truth is you can’t shut down a $20 trillion economy and not feel some bumps as it restarts, but we are hopeful the supply chain issues will resolve over the coming quarters and inflation should calm down as well.”
*****
> Following the CPI data, traders moved up their expectations for when the first Fed rate hike would occur. The Fed funds futures market now sees greater odds of the central bank’s first full rate hike coming in July 2022.

But there were some really good nuggets in there. 

”The average stock doesn’t go up over long periods of time. The average stock will eventually go down 100% 
Indexes work because they weed those out and replace them”

“Shorting stocks is actually mathematically in your favor and that’s one of the secrets i have, that you have to search deeply for”
His sample portfolio was 40% long 40% short 20% cash he believes in being cash heavy.

How often should you trade stocks? 
“If you own a stock for 10 dollars and you think it’s worth 20 you want it to happen as fast as possible because of opportunity cost” 
I would rather make 20% in two weeks then 100% in 2 years” 
As long as you have other opportunities” 

“If you think everything is overvalued or under valued 
You kind of suck and your process is not correct 
8/10 stocks should be fairly valued”

“I studied pharma that helped me invest in biotech stocks that’s more important then 13f filings and listening to cnbc” 
The information I got from working in pharma
Made the 13f filings look like useless garbage in comparison”


“The CEO is one of the most important factors, do you trust him to make big profits 10 years from now?” 

“Where boys Become men 
Most analysts don’t understand this,
Apples 
100 billion ev and
33 billion in profit 
Is 33% on your money 
It’s a calculation warren uses”
( this was years ago ) 

“Investing 1% in something that could 10x is good risk management” 


“You have to look at all stocks 
Imagine going to a restaurant and only eating one dish out of 800 dishes 
And saying this is the best dish for sure! 
You have to try the other dishes to get perspective and to maybe find something even better”

“ USA has more fairly valued companies in general, International stocks 
Are either super undervalued or overvalued.
That’s what you want so you can buy undervalued and short overvalued”

“I feel bad for people who look at p/e 
If Tesla is worth 50 billion 
And has 1 million in net profit it doesn’t mean it has 50 k p/e and should be avoided” 

“I like companies who make people think with a different part of there brain. 
Like Apple and Tesla.
They don’t care about price they just have to have it. 
Usually great marketing, great design and a great product. 
With a great design comes a big price” 

“ very few people short sell
It could be good a lot of the time 
In 2000-2012 you wouldn’t make a penny if you were long. 
Markets go down often” 

“You want to be as diversified as you can”

“Don’t invest if you don’t have a good idea.
Hedge funds are forced too invest” 


“Leverage if you have confidence in the Investment 
I made 50 million in the last 2 years with options and derivatives.
But it is very risky so you have to be really sure”


“Have a margin of safety”



“Discount rate is gold 
It’s theoretical 
Basically you guess what growth they will have looking at the history of the company and you guess how long the company will stay alive. 
How much cash will it bring in, in its whole lifetime.
So Apple for example might bring in 300 billion a year in profit times 20 years.
Giving it a value of 6 trillion. 



But it’s all theoretical 
It might live for 30 years 
It might get a worse profit growth 
It might shrink by 15% per year instead of 2% 
You don’t know” 
You give them a discount rate based on how risky the investment is how diversified they are and how easy it is to eat there lunch.
This could take years as an investor to calculate correctly” 




Books he recommended 
- Margin of safety 
- common stocks and uncommon profits 
- everything from warren buffet and Charlie          munger

qpwkcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qpwkcu/why_intel_is_the_play_to_the_and_beyond/,Why Intel Is The Play. To the 🌗 and beyond.🚀,50,45,2021-11-09 13:17:20,"**BULL CASES**

/1. INTC is the only real US chip manufacturer that can reasonably compete with Korean Samsung and Taiwanese TSMC (-100 credit score for acknowledging Taiwan). It is getting lots of literal boat load of cash(probs something like $50B equivalent) from the government that is positive for the shareholders, while maintaining the buybacks and dividends.
Yes, TSMC and others are also hedging and gonna start making some chips in USA but realistically the gubment will give most of the cash to INTC.

/2. US gubment is in a cold war with China, this means it's also a technological warfare. This means supercomputers, missile, Starlink chips(private company) etc and Intel is likely going to be one of the prime suppliers of this boom in tech investment.

/3. TSMC and Samsung are pretty much bottlenecked. Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Mediatech, Broadcom, various carmakers, electronics manufacturers etc and not to mention Intel themselves are a big buyer. Specifically, Intel and Apple has bought out all capacity of TSMC 3nm(equivalent to Intel's 5 nm probs, I forgot). This means there is an enormous demand that is not being fulfilled and Intel launching their foundry services and already signing deals with Qualcomm, Amazon is a big deal.

For reference, TSMC's market cap is bigger than 3 Intel (yes, that's a unit I invented). In 2024-2025, you might even see Apple, NVIDIA and the likes fabricating their chips from Intel just to give a big F U to TSMC (who is currently slightly overcharging if the rumours are to be believed).

/4. Intel is launching a GPU. The GPU market is also in a huge bottleneck due to higher demand from gamers and corn miners. Everyone expects that they are likely to sell their GPUs very easily. Think about this for a sec. Intel is just about to become one of the players in this huge GPU market.
Which would also make way for their server GPUs and AIs and the likes.

/5. Think 10-15 years from now. Your fridge, doorbell, light, heating system and every ducking thing will have some chips and Intel is likely to remain a dominant player in this market. I think this will be bigger than the current entire semi market as it is. IOT is just getting started.

/6. Intel is one of the forerunner player in AI techs like autonomous vehicles through their various investments(Mobil eye for one) and will likely remain so. I don't know how big this will be in 10 years, but it's likely that Intel will be one of the bigger players in the market like Google (through Waymo), Tesla and NVIDIA.

/7. Intel also recently launched their big little architecture, where it has already became competitively better than AMD especially in gaming with low power consumption and huge power. Not to mention being very power efficient most of the time for using its efficiency cores most of the time. Not that it matters that much, seeing the gamer Steam reports, very few people actually play on the latest of the latest gen. But, that's also something that's worth noting at least. 

However, the vast majority of pc sales is in just your average boomer laptops and desktops. And they have a good lead there.

*Tips for those wanting to build a high end new pc. Wait for Intel's lineup to be available broadly, high end pc gamers will dump their last gen AMD chips for the Intel one in the second hand market, causing a flooding of cheap AMD CPUs, buy one of them. Source: Did this once.*

/8. One worrying factor is in the server market. Everyone seems to be launching their own server chips and AMD is very competitive and eating away market share. But Intel's management seems to be guiding us towards the right path. If their predictions prove to be right, they are on the right track.

/9. Intel announced that they will launch Angstrom scale CPUs in the future, that's good I guess. They are also working in RISC-V and other CPU architectures.

/10. Pat has an approval rating of 96% in Glassdoor and the employees would recommend others to work in Intel 89% of the time. This is a huge ass jump for both scores from the Bob Swan era. Go to Wayback Machine, you will see. This means a noticeable change has taken place within this huge organisation in such a short time.

/11. Intel stock always seem to have price support at around $50. And it's near that range right now.

/12. Most analysts are bullish on the stock. Comparatively cheap stock in this clown market. Wanna buy a $5.48B gravity powered truck company anyone?

/13. Intel actually has one of the highest talented employee pull who can be expected to deliver. Contrary to popular belief.

**Bear Cases**

/1. This is a boomer stock according to reddit's circejerk. So, it's difficult to convince people that it is actually expected to grow around 11% CAGR just by the current demand circumstances alone by management's conservative estimates for the next few years. This is mega bearish. If the market doesn't care about a stock, no matter what the management do, the stock will not perform.

/2. Intel has repeatedly failed to prove that their foundry division's predictions are reliable. If they went fabless like AMD, it would have probably rocketed already. But a big part of the cheapness of the stock comes from the unreliability of their foundry division. Yes, the management has finally started getting serious about their foundry, but one cannot ignore their past failures.

/3. Government contracts and the likes are not completely free money like some of you believe, delays in delivery and contract fulfillment could make what is essentially a free money glitch to a costly mistake and a billion dollar loss with a brink of an eye. The terms are generally very strict, so Intel has to deliver.

/4. Investments are going to be a lot and semiconductor industry being cyclical means, if Intel fails to deliver, its market share will be eaten away and lose billions in potential profit.

/5. Stock seems to be largely rangebound like Microsoft was for 15 years.

I don't hold any TSLA directly nor do I have any options because I hate money and I have a small PP, but that's beside the point. 

SPY continues to hit new ATH week after week. I'm in heavy on SPY calls this week and am starting to get a little nervous that Musky E is going to let TSLA dip, which might cause people to sell, which could hurt my SPY calls. 

SPY is only 1.44% TSLA according [to this reputable link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/holdings/). I am polling you retards - will Elon's sale of TSLA stock hurt TSLA bulls.. will that hurt roll onto SPY or is just a fart in the wind? 

If we wanted to make this part of a larger discussion we could talk about how much any one holding can impact an ETF generally. What if AMZN has a really good day and AAPL has a really shitty day? Does it cancel out? Maybe people will pull back on all kinds of tech shit once they see TSLA dip a little bit. Is there any correlation? 

Also ban bet, SPY 500 by EOY."

qogn3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qogn3g/investor_note_2022_summary/,Investor Note - 2022 Summary,2,19,2021-11-07 11:58:10,"Times have certainly changed. In hindsight we underestimated a number of critical factors impacting the financial markets. A perfect storm of global economic shocks has led to a precipitous drop in the worldwide equity markets.

Signals had been growing that a collapse was possible. As inflation began to ravage American purchasing power, people sought to buy more tangible goods as supplies dwindled. Digital assets, especially if thought of as currencies, were known to be poor allocations during rising inflation. People cashed out of cryptocurrencies in favor of actual goods, which began dropping its value dramatically at the end of the year. Meme stocks were next, as retail investors quickly realized that the companies had turned a good deal of their strategy toward digital assets tied to cryptocurrencies. Or that they were stuck hopelessly in the past like the AMC facing the growth of convenience of in-home-streaming. Many finally figured that these companies may not be the best positioned for the future after all. In fact, both GME and AMC were delisted after crushing exodus from their stock. No private suitors emerged as the companies as sophisticated investors were not enthralled in what made out to be venture capital plays at best. These strategies had potentially exciting returns, but were most likely to fall dead before something interesting would come to pass.

The first market wide indication of trouble came as the Fed began its tapering programs. When announced the market was unmoved. However in early December, a small correction was triggered as the 10 year treasury began to rise slightly faster than expected. It was later learned that this caused a large portion of the market trading on automated risk-return algorithms to quickly exchange assets into the fixed income market, causing the first equity leg down.

Problems then compounded around Christmas and the New Year. The holiday season was plagued by ever increasing supply issues. Surging retail demand coupled with an already heavily disrupted supply chain created a number of shortages. Now feeling more of the direct impacts of the supply chain, the American public began to pay closer attention to their leaders. Many Republicans cite hardline policies on vaccine mandates as the final domino in the supply chain disruptions. In truth it had little bearing on the situation, as panic buying had already built a huge bullwhip (Forrester) effect long before the holiday selling season. A strained supply chain began to completely logjam as persistent over purchasing had built so much excess in the system. A tired workforce was unable to keep up with crushing backlogs. Many quit their jobs under the immense pressure to fulfill holiday demand. Even record overtime pay wasn’t enough to keep people working in the growing pressure kettle of the large online retailers grueling supply chain. President Biden’s approval rating dropped to the lowest in recorded history.

The more significant impact to the market came late January as waves of companies that were unable to fulfill their typical holiday volumes missed earnings estimates substantially. Juxtaposed to record volumes in earlier quarters, firms depleted inventories couldn’t keep up with the demand. Most illustrated by Apple Corporation who could only get 85% of its normal holiday volumes to market. Rising supplier costs continued to hollow out bottom lines to add other concerns to the sustainability of record profits seen throughout the pandemic. This added momentum to the market decline, heavily spooking investors who began to pay closer attention to price/earnings ratios.

More bad news followed from inflation readings. As retailer shelves had emptied early from heavy promotion of ‘pre black friday’ deals. Many had scrambled online in fear of missing out on the most popular holiday items, causing price setting algorithms to rapidly increase prices. As the inflation readings skyrocketed throughout the end of the year and into the new year, the entire Federal Reserve Board had been called in front of congress. The Board was lambasted for the instability in the financial system. Many calls were made to accelerate the tapering process, even as those came at the expense of Washington insiders' massive financial portfolios. Many elected officials had become too scared to sell and be caught in another stock market scandal. Powell was reluctant to heed the calls, but eventually relented. Alarmingly when accelerated, the tapering exposed that other countries had their own growing debt burdens and the American public's diminishing confidence in their government had left demand for US bonds severely overestimated. Additional tapering exposed a severe lack of demand for the notes, driving the 10 year treasury several percentage points higher.

Concern started to rise about corporations' ability to fund debt in a higher interest rate environment. Inflation was seen as the only option as the rate could rise no higher without wrecking havoc on the global financial system. Many companies, over-leveraged by the decade of cheap money, now risked default as a large portion of debt funding was tied to floating rate instruments.

Meanwhile overseas, a cascading impact was starting to be felt when Evergrande and a growing number of other Chinese property developers were unable to repay billion dollar notes due in early 2022. This signaled that most of the bonds of Chinese real estate developers were completely worthless. Evergrande’s CEO fled the country in an attempt to avoid the heavy pressure from the Chinese government to use his own diminished wealth to repay the bonds. Additional press reports of the true magnitude of the debt crisis emerged as the defaults uncovered how much debt was hidden off balance sheet for Chinese developers. While believed to be mitigated by China’s central bank, the magnitude of the problem was underestimated and China faces a significant financial crisis akin to the 2008 financial crisis in the US. Most impacted are those that held debt outside of China, as all focus of the CCP has been to mitigate domestic damage.

Tensions within US-China relationship had grown considerably during this period as China faced its number of nationalistic crises. The Chinese public surprisingly outwardly grew more concerned with Xi leadership as they faced significant losses from property values and homes never completed. In desperation to distract from the problems, signs indicate that he was getting closer to using military conflict to reunify Taiwan, accelerating worries of a new and more complicated full blown cold war. This cold war that would have been far more dangerous with China’s economic power entwined with the US, unlike previous superpower conflicts of the past. However, an angry Chinese population had overthrown the government before any more dangerous conflict could arise. The US hopes a Democratic government may be formed in its wake, focused on basic human rights and freedoms.

Back in the US, a group of angry Reddit investors confronted Elon Musk after Telsa dropped 95% of its value as states started to step in to regulate Self Driving car technology as a series of high profile mishaps finally forced the regulatory agencies to step in to control the rollouts of these technologies. Those bodies indicated it could be several years before they would have the framework in place to allow for a regulated self driving market. Elon tweeted after the incident: ‘You win some, you lose some… Cybertruck still looks really cool’

Labor relations problems in the US continued to escalate as employees wanted more control of the companies they work for, ensuring these problems don’t happen again. Wage inflation pressures continue despite the market correction, as more workers demand a fairer distribution of compensation from their executives.

Janet Yellen resigned as secretary of the treasury, citing family issues, joining a long list of economic leaders in the administration who resigned over the financial meltdown. Concerns of the stress of the mounting cash flow requirements of the treasury department are speculated as the true reason for her departure.

Banks currently face the difficult decision of how to approach floating rates agreements at current levels as most businesses were over-leveraged and could not support the rapid increases in interest rates. The Libor rate has risen considerably while the Fed has kept the fed fund rate at 0. Congress hastily passed a law limiting interest rates banks can charge on any loans for a two year period to curb a rash of potential defaults as the Fed struggles to reverse policy and regain stabilization by restarting pandemic level bond purchasing programs. However, with the true problem exposed, many wonder if this program will have the same effect it did previously.

There are reports that the drastic price movements in individual shares across the market had been exaggerated by pay for order flow algorithms. It is speculated that the algorithms behind the scheme had prioritized and accelerated volatility which drove more dramatic price movements to drive additional profit for the market makers. As the pay for order flow consolidated due to high retail activity in online brokerages stoked by the pandemic, the competition that would have minimized these effects had been drowned out, allowing only a few algorithms to dedicate stock prices. The SEC has opened a wide ranging investigation into this phenomenon. The largest market makers currently have not responded publicly to the allegations.

All the news is not completely bad for the stock market and the economy. Reasonably priced securities with tangible business models were least impacted by the drawdown, losing only half the value compared with their higher valued peers particularly in the technology space. Companies that also did not rely on an import dominated offshore supply chain escaped the brunt of the pain. Supply chains have begun to ease as record demand has cooled and the shipping industry's new investments began to come online to augment the system.

All in all, if you were highly invested in high-valued growth equities, your portfolios suffered the most. The ‘Great Reset’ as it is now called has reminded people that the financial markets are driven by real companies with real performance trading on a historically reasonable price to earnings ratios. At current the bond yields now offer a reasonable alternative to equity investing, returning a non-volatile asset class into the financial picture for managing risk. Business leaders are already engaging the community to bring home overextended offshore supply chains that while more costly are far more resilient and friendlier to the environment.

TLDR: Intel is making all the moves to hire good talent to get fabrication and R&D back on track, they have the cash to do it, and DoD has stepped in to make sure they succeed in the wake of the China scares. Moreover, Intel is moving to offer foundry to other companies, which means that it don’t matter whether your team pro AMD or NVIDIA, they will likely be manufacturing for most US companies in the next 3 years.  

I figured Intel was done for ever since they stopped making significant progress on their chip performance and neglected their foundry, and was on the AMD hype-train ever since Ryzen 2 launched. However, a lot has changed on the global stage and on Intel’s strategy which signals a new outlook for Intel in the next year. 

First of all, Intel has seen the writing on the wall. They have gotten sloppy and greedy for too long and have seen their bottom line and image hit the shitter. In response, they have started hiring the talent they need to get their foundry and R&D back on track. They recently hired [Vineet Goel](https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/intel-hires-top-amd-gpu-architect-to-lead-xe-ip-roadmap) from AMD to work on GPU architecture, and have hired a slew of [veterans and new talent](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16807/intel-continues-to-rehire-veterans-at-some-point-theyll-run-out) as part of their revamping and have finally started to [move in the right direction](https://www.pcworld.com/article/549611/intel-core-i5-12600k-review.html/amp). Intel definitely sees how they’ve lost their edge to AMD and NVIDIA and are making sure they hire the right talent to turn the tide. They also have deeper pockets than AMD and NVIDIA to make sure this happens (34.6B vs just 3.6B and 7.7B respectively). 

On the other hand, the political stage has completely shifted, and China and the US are more than just on bad footing, as the FBI officially note that . [china is “a threat to our economic security—and by extension, to our national security”](https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/the-threat-posed-by-the-chinese-government-and-the-chinese-communist-party-to-the-economic-and-national-security-of-the-united-states). As a result, the US government is currently in a race to decouple as quick as possible from china, and no decoupling is more important than that of the chip-manufacturing industry. 

There is only 1, US-based chip manufacturer, and if you’re also smooth brained, you likely know it’s INTEL. Everyone else just designs in the US and manufactures in Asia, which is an issue because the next big player, TSMC is increadibly close to getting rammed by China because china want’s to [take over Taiwan](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2021-11-03/china-clearly-developing-ability-to-invade-taiwan-top-general-says). This leaves the US government as well as the  entire private industry up in the air if and when China invades Taiwan (or even just makes shipping to/from Taiwan harder). 

You know who has deeper pockets than Intel? The DoD and they’ve basically decided that Intel has to be the leader for the sake of the entire private industry and US national security ([see here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-wins-us-project-develop-foundry-ecosystem.html#gs.f1t2zi).

Intel will be a big mover going forward because they want to win, the US government needs them to step up their game, and cash is clearly not and will not be an issue. More importantly, Intel is going to be more than just a cpu vendor, they are likely going to be the main foundry for most american chip designers like AMD, Nvidia, Apple and Qualcomm"

Inside that post I specifically detailed exactly how AMD would eventually dominate the CPU race in energy efficiency, processing power, space, security etc.  

I know INTC is out, AMD is gaining a lot of ground, but I'm huge on energy efficiency and why want to get a head start as I think Arm with it's speed and energy efficiency is something we should investigate.  

Unlike my AMD stock post years ago I have no knowledge of Arm or M1 except using it in a macbook but it's performance blows me away while energy consumption is so low is quite the milestone.

Besides owning NVDA I haven't kept up with the merger, are there national security concerns, monopoly concerns that might hold up the NVDA Arm deal?"

Now is the time to be investing in Disney. Why?

1. Disney fucking prints money. Especially if inflation goes out of control, you want to put your money in companies that print serious cash rather than in high growth companies. Diversify yourself from all the Tesla and other high growth companies.

2. Recovery stocks are the hottest rage still, COVID stocks are out (e.g. Peloton). You think Americans give a fuck about covid anymore? Disney upped the hell out of their Disney World tickets, AND PEOPLE STILL GOING TO BUY IT. Reminds of you of something? Yeah, Apple and their iPhones. Everyone and they mother is going to Disney world this fall and winter break.

3. ""Technical analysis"". Disney stock completely flat this year, every other company up 40%. I actually don't know any TA, but obviously this means that Disney gonna take off soon.

4. They have declining growth headwinds on their Disney+ subscribers. CEO already announced that, so the stock is already priced in for it.

It’s a simple version, with many other factors to consider. But this is the general concept of how it works. There are a lot of good experts on here that can help better with strategy and technical analysis. Do not take any examples as ways to strategize. It’s just made up examples. 

Background: I’ve been trading options for over a decade and I have no financial or business background. I learned before it was popular online and I am self taught. So I’ll be explaining it the way I was able to understand it. There are better ways, but this is what helped me. I turned $1700 into $500,000 back in 2014. 


Options are basically lay aways for shares. So let’s use a house as an example. 

If you bought a house for $1M and I come and offer you $1.2M (the strike price). The catch is I have a certain amount of time to decide if I want the house. You cannot back out but I’m not obligated to buy it. So what’s in it for you? I offer you a $10,000 deposit that you get to keep no matter what happens. Now what? 


I hold a CONTRACT between us that costed $10,000 and I give myself 6 month expiration date to decide if I want it. So now I am hoping the housing market goes up above $1.2M so let’s go over a few scenarios. 

Benefit? I profit on a $1M house as if I own it even though I only paid $10,000. 

MARKET RISES
1. The housing market goes up and it’s now worth $1.4M within 3 months giving me 3 more months on the contract. So the contract is worth at least $200,000 because if I forced you to sell it (exercise). So I can go around and sell the contract to someone else and say “look I can force them to sell for $200,000 today, so give me $200,000 + $20,000 for the 3 months because it could continue to rise. So they pay $200,000 to receive $200,000 in equity and $20,000 premium because the contract still has more time. Meaning if the housing market goes up to 1.5M The new owner of the contract can now exercise the contract (option) and profit $80,000 or 4X their investment. 

 MARKET DIPS
2. The housing market dips and the house is now worth $800,000. I would owe you $1.2M so I just wait the 6 months and hope it rises or I sell my contract $10,000 at a loss maybe like $3,000 to someone else hoping it jumps back up. Worse case if the time comes to an end i lose $10,000. 

MARKET RISES BUT NOT MUCH. 
1. You do not have to hit the price you bet to earn money. So if the market hits $1.1M within 1 month since there is 5 months left. I can sell the contract to someone else for more now thst it’s more likely to happen. So I can get $20,000 even though it didn’t go over $1.2M. I’m selling the contract to someone else and letting them hope it goes up. 

Now translating to stocks. 

1 option or contract is 100 shares per contract. 

So if you buy 6 contracts for apple to hit $300 you have 600 shares on hold for you. Every dollar above $300 you earn $600. Because you only owe the owner $300 so everything above is yours. 


So your call is you betting it goes up, and if you do a put, you are betting it goes down. Either way you will only ever lose the initial deposit or purchase price of the contract. 

Stock example I bet Nvidia will hit $360 by feb22 so I needed to pay the owner $15 per share as a down payment. So it was $1500 for the 1 option. Now the closer it gets to the price I said it would hit the price of the contract goes up because it’s now more likely to happen. 

So for example if I said your house will hit $2M by 3 months you wouldn’t believe it would happen so you would accept a lower deposit say $1000 now imagine something happens and 1 week later your house jumps to $1.4M. Since it’s more likely to happen I could sell the contract to someone else for $2500 because it’s not as crazy and I’ve made 150% in 2 weeks. 

You don’t hold a contract till the date, you flip the contract to someone else when you make money on the deposit. 

How are they priced? The crazier your bet the cheaper it is. Tesla at $2000 within 2 months is probably impossible so it would be cheap. Tesla at $2000 by 2024 is more likely so it would cost more. 

I turned $1700 into $500,000 from options at 19 back in 2014. But I’ve also lost $100,000 in a day when fedex dipped when gas was low because they buy gas in 6 month intervals. So their earnings were low and the stock dipped. With not that much time left I lost it all. So if it’s your first time, give your self some time in the expiration date . So be careful."

What's strange is how the stock has acted during the past few weeks. It's almost as if large swaths of investors don't understand how their business works and how TTD's exposure to varying facets of the digital advertising market is different from that of other players.

So what I have seen is significant drops in the price of TTD shares following earnings reports from the likes of SNAP and FB, which I understand are largely driven by concerns about changes to the Apple iOS ecosystem that make it really difficult to target advertising on mobile. The changes are absolutely a concern; media reports conservatively place the revenue losses at nearly $10bn this quarter. However, these barely affect TTD, which disclosed earlier in 2021 that they expect no material impact from the iOS changes (they have spent much of the past couple of years developing workarounds).

[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-magnite-the-trade-desk-and-other-ad-tech-stocks-tanked-friday-2021-10-23](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-magnite-the-trade-desk-and-other-ad-tech-stocks-tanked-friday-2021-10-23)

Of course, Google's earnings report and guidance demonstrated that secular weakness in digital advertising isn't as great a threat as folks might have thought. And (frankly) TTD's business is more like Google's than it is like FB or SNAP's. Which brings me to today's developments. It's difficult to see why TTD is down by 5.5% today until you realize that ROKU reported earnings yesterday evening and tanked. ROKU is, of course, a HUGE player in the ads space- it's the real reason why it makes and sells TVs and dongles and such. But their placement of ads and thus their ad revenue is HEAVILY dependent upon two things: hardware sales and adding users. ROKU apparently added new users this quarter, but its hardware sales tanked because supply chain. ROKU is also seeing some of its hardware partners drop out and it is seeing increased competition from Amazon in this space as well. TTD faces none of these headwinds.

I am fairly confident TTD will beat and raise and that those who have spent the past couple of weeks selling TTD on bad news from other advertisers are correlating things badly. They report 11/8; I dropped $20k in call options for 11/12 at the $75 strike. I may add to this today or tomorrow."

Single thread:  Intel domination throughout.

Multithread:  Intel small lead for on top tier CPUs and massive lead for mid tier.

Basic DD: INTC has been beat low from being dominated in CPU market by AMD and from competition from Apple.  Finally their newest product takes the lead again (vs AMD) and in a big way.  I can see the stock rebounding back up once wall street figures out what these CPU benchmarks mean.  If you are an AMD fan, don't panic.  AMD will still keep riding all of the contract wins it has gotten.  I am also heavily invested in AMD and will keep my long positions.  Just that with INTC stock so beat down, this is a very good turning point.

Disclosure: This is not financial advice.  I bought INTC after reading this article because of the the reasons above.  I also own a lot more AMD than INTC."

II (“Northern Star”) (NYSE: NSTB), today released its Q3 2021 Apex Next Investor Outlook. The report highlights the top stocks and noteworthy holdings of the rising class of Gen Z investors. Amid a quarter characterized by inflation concerns and a fits-and-starts reopening associated with the global pandemic, Apex’s data reveals younger investors maintained a bullish stance on AMC and GameStop—two of the earliest meme stocks to gain widespread popularity earlier this year. Other names within the Gen Z top 10 also held steady, including Tesla, Apple, and Amazon, hinting at the younger generation’s proclivity to provide stable support for its highest-conviction holdings. Shorter-term sentiment was evident elsewhere in the rankings, as vaccine makers Moderna and Pfizer enjoyed a nice bump upwards on the back of booster-shot momentum. Giant retailers Costco and Home Depot also climbed the rankings as Gen Z bet their healthy budgets and supply chain expertise would spell success this holiday season.  
>  
>“Gen Z investors are changing the investment world in meaningful ways – and we could be in the early innings of this transformation,” said **Bill Capuzzi, Chief Executive Officer of Apex**. “In Q3, heavyweight meme stocks AMC and GameStop exhibited impressive staying power in Gen Z portfolios, standing right alongside more traditional mega-cap holdings, such as Apple and Amazon. As this key demographic continues to develop and express unique investment views, our team at Apex looks forward to providing ongoing data and information around these significant developments.”

>The Apex Next Investor Outlook includes data of the top 100 stocks owned by millions of investors on the Apex platform. The Q3 2021 report is based on more than 1 million Gen Z accounts, in addition to more than 5 million accounts held by Millennials, Gen X and Baby Boomers.

>**Vaccine stocks catch another wave –** As shares of vaccine makers climbed in Q3 amid growing momentum for booster shots and vaccine mandates, Gen Z investors rekindled their interest in frontrunners Moderna and Pfizer. Moderna vaulted 27 spots to #19 while Pfizer climbed 20 spots to #45. Gen Z also took notice of Novavax (up 7 spots to #87). The company has been focused on making regulatory headway in lower-income countries after falling behind in the race for authorization in the US and Europe. Johnson & Johnson retreated 1 notch to #39. Vaccine demand—or lack thereof—is expected to have minimal effect on the company’s overall financial performance, given its choice to deploy a not-for-profit pricing model for the vaccine.  
>  
>**Smooth sailing for meme stocks –** Gen Z support for flagship meme stocks stayed strong in Q3. AMC kept its crown as the #1 holding and GameStop also showed staying power this quarter, holding steady at #6. Outside of consistent heavy-hitters, other meme stocks continued to make appearances within the Gen Z rankings. Camber Energy joined the list in Q3 at #10, propelled by a massive September runup in its share price. Vinco Ventures, a digital media company that recently became involved in the red-hot non-fungible token (NFT) arena, debuted at #55.  
>  
>**Charting a new course for retailers –** Ahead of the all-important holiday shopping season, Gen Z investors backed big-name retailers. Q3 saw notable moves in giants like Costco (up 20 spots to #31), Walmart (up 8 spots to #52), Target (up 3 spots to #53) and Home Depot (up spots 22 to #76). In the face of extraordinary shipping disruptions and logistics challenges, large retailers with sophisticated supply chains and deep pockets appeared to shine.

Alright, hear me out. I didn’t even know there were already HIMX posts until after this was written. Enjoy it anyway. 

Hopefully we haven’t forgotten that we want to own companies that are profitable as fuck. I believe this play presents an asymmetric risk. HIMX is trading at 8.6 PE while competitors are trading at 28.57 PE. Fair market value is $25 based on multiples alone. 174.3m free float. Decent amount of SI (26.6m shares sold short) and 99.4% utilization. CTB fee rising. They also are a healthy company that produces a dividend. If a dividend is too boomer for you it’s because you’re poor and I’m trying to help change that about you so pay attention.

What do they do: Himax Technologies, Inc., a fabless semiconductor company, provides display imaging processing technologies in China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Korea, Japan, Europe, and the United States. The company operates through two segments, Driver IC and Non-Driver Products. It offers display driver integrated circuits (ICs) and timing controllers that are used in televisions, laptops, monitors, mobile phones, tablets, automotive, digital cameras, car navigation, virtual reality devices, and other consumer electronic devices.

The opportunity for additional upside here is that Himax has their hands on the future with virtual reality devices. They have MetaVerse exposure. This is lagging hard compared to other tickers who have recently exploded, and those tickers aren’t even profitable. FB is expecting to spend in excess of $170bln over the next decade making the metaverse possible. 

Apple is producing its first headset as well - “a mixed reality experience that can handle games in high quality virtual reality with snappy chips and high end displays.”

Think: Ready Player One

Big tech is investing big money into this space and whether we lack the vision for it or not, it’s happening. They’ve already created new position titles at their respected companies to get ahead of this curve. Source: trust me bro. This space is going to create an even higher demand for semi conductor companies let alone those who produce micro displays. We are entering the next evolution of the internet.

But don’t just listen to me, Fintel claims HIMX to be undervalued and have a high ranking for the company. 90.04 score in their quality metric and 77.9 in value. Recent articles suggest it’s one of the few Taiwanese tickers to own, presenting value and growth. 


Financials:

“For the third quarter, the Company expects further revenue growth from the already high level of Q2 2021. Gross margin shall see another uptick and could reach another quarterly high. With the increases of both revenue and margin, Himax anticipates net profit shall increase substantially in the third quarter.” Massive flex, ok.

Third quarter projections: the company is expecting net revenues to increase 13-17%. 

Positions cost distribution: 
26% shareholders are profitable. Sitting on top of a volume shelf looking to move up. 12.3 and 13.94 are the next two largest areas of supply. 

Q2 Total Revenue: 365.26m up 95.43% YoY. 
Q2 Net Income: 108.89 an 7,773.54% increase YoY.
EPS: .62 which is 7,690.00% YoY. The median for its sector is .47. 
ROE: 18.68% which is 5,737.00% YoY. The Semiconductor sector median is 2.79%. 

Those numbers are so good you’d think I was tripping on acid. Fact check it. Me being high as balls right now has nothing to do with it. Fuckin seahorse sea hell.

Total debt: HIMX has $159.5m in debt, which is down from $222.4m reported a year ago. They also have $270.4m in cash to offset the debt. This leaves the company $110.9m in net cash. 

Cash flow: 89% of its EBIT 

Dividend: .262
Dividend Yield: 2.53%

Technicals: found hard support at $9.6 and is testing its daily resistance of $11.32. A daily close above this price would present a pivot point. Key areas of resistance past this point would be $14.61 and volume shelf where bag-holders lie waiting, although not many. Institutions are holding at higher prices. 

MACD has crossed, bands are squeezing - haven’t been this tight since your mom birthed you crotch goblins. We also have a 9EMA/21MA crossover signaling bullish trend reversal. 

Options: call activity has been bullish recently. Recent sweepers into the 11/19 12c. 

**TLDR: future proof conductor company prints hard as fuck right now and in the future. Jan 8c 2022 / 30c 2023 buys you lambo equipped with HIMX shit.**

ER Thursday before the bell. I don’t want you to get IV crushed but do your thing. I have shares, Jan 8c 2022 and Jan 30c 2023, with intentions of exercising. 

For transparency, this is 15% of the weight of my portfolio and I’m green 11%. I will not sell below fair market value. Godspeed retards."

qlb35d,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlb35d/yo_seriously_what_the_shit_would_tesla_even_need/,Yo seriously. What the shit would Tesla even need to do for profit in order to even justify it's current valuation???? 1.2t market cap. Amazon is at 1.7t and the most profitable car company rn is Toyota at 300b .......???,5975,2106,2021-11-03 02:43:45,"Mind you Walmart is at 400b market cap. So what this means is that Tesla would need to make as much profit as 3 Walmart corporations In the future in order to even justify it's CURRENT market cap. It's actually absurd. It almost seems like people who are investing into Tesla don't really understand what it's current market cap even means... 

I've heard from a Tesla investor that Tesla would become an industry leader like hibachi Ltd.... And once that happens Tesla is going to moon..... And its like dude .. hibachi Ltd market cap is at 50b . Forget about mooning once Tesla becomes an industry leader like hibachi Ltd. Tesla would need to be an industry leader like 20 hibachi Ltd  just to even justify it's current valuation lol.... 

If Tesla becomes the world's most profitable corp like apple. Get this .... You'll justifiably only 2x your money if you invest In it now 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂 . Bruh such a tall order to fill just to 2x . 

Look I get it. Tesla is innovative yadadada yes . The company is still in it's early stages and it'll be better later on. Yes that too. The company is at it's early stages. However, the stock valuation of this company is not. The stock valuation of this company is already at a level where it can swing it's dick around and smack China with it. 

The question is. What would Tesla even need to do.... For profit at a level where it's absurd valuation is justify? 

Another note Toyota is currently the most profitable car company and it's valuation is 300b..... (I'm not saying Tesla is just a car company) Tesla's is already at 1.2t . 4x the most profitable car company already... Without making any profit... Tall order to fill . Let's just say that.




Edit : this is just speculation but hear me out on this Tesla's car margin went up 30% recent quarter ... Now I did some googling turns out Tesla's build quality and assembly is ranked the lowest . So what does this mean? Well it's obvious. This is a very common stock hype strategy. They sacrifice build quality by getting cheap parts and assembly. on paper itll look great for short term profit it's no wonder margin is at 30% then they report it. Boom everyone eats it up HYYYYPPPE. Stock shoots up!! Bruh at this rate Tesla solely survives on hype and elon fucking knows it 😂😂😂😂😂😂 . It's a very obvious stock hype strategy tbh. Do you seriously think this company that is entirely pressured to perform on paper wouldn't go this length? Honestly this is the only thing Elon can do in order to maintain this level of stock price . It's actually a no brainer. Because as soon as that sheet of paper looks bad. Y'all know what's gonna happen. And he knows what's gonna happen. So long as he report good news albeit paper news . All's is well. 

It's a very common tactic for public company in order to showcase short term paper gains. In order to shoot the stock upwards. Some even layoff workers, it's just speculation. But my money is on this.



Edit 2: reading many of the comments , it seems like alot of people are confused that there's actually a difference between  company and stock. Saying that Tesla is a growth stock (disregarding it's current market cap), just because the company is still growing is essentially the gist of many responses. While Not realizing it's already priced in on a veeeerry optimistic note at that. 

Also do people ever stop to think how the hell is this dude gonna monopolize all these different areas of innovation? Amazon focused on 1 thing only , it took them 2decades to reach 1.7t.  and monopolize that one thing . honestly , the ideas are decent ,but what about execution? People invest like all his ideas are already at monopoly level. 

Battery grid, EV cars, AI, spaceX , renewable energy, solar, boring company tunnels, internet grid, something about monkeys , And many more projects. I've heard the argument that Tesla is ""not a car company"" to justify it's current valuation. Like somehow this dude is going to monopolize all these different fields. Ironically If anything EV cars is where he'll most likely have a Monopoly. 


 Saying Tesla is a growth stock just because the company is still growing while it's already at 1.2t marker cap, is the same  as saying GME is a growth stock during MOASS when it's market cap is quadrillions . Just bc "" the company is still growing it hasn't implemented NFTs yet"" .

Edit 3: Also y'all remember when Tesla double in market cap, AKA double it's company's worth (for those who don't understand market cap) ,just because musk boy said ""5/1 split"" 😂😂😂 yo this stock is surreal. Any other company with these kinds of specs , it'll be a no brainer to short. Puts all the way! Not Tesla. Hell fucking no. You think I'm gonna bet against a stock where the company double in valuation just because ""oOoOO it's ""cheap"" now!"" --- (P.S you actually paid more for a smaller piece.) 

 you outa yo goddamn mind if you think I'm gonna go against this kind of retard strength! This is the kind of company that will go up 100b if they announce theyre creating their own gaming console . 0 - 100. From announcement to best case completion price all in a day."

BCG (world’s 2nd largest strategy consulting firm) estimates that quantum computing could create value of $450 billion to $850 billion in the next 15 to 30 years.

We can attribute 15% of that to the computing platform, and keep in mind that the Apple App Store and other platforms charge significantly more.

$97.5bn revenue potential or addressable market at the middle of BCG’s range. 

In cloud the market leader is AWS with 55% market share. Vastly superior error correction puts IONQ miles ahead of others and I expect them to capture up to half the market. But let’s just say 40%. 

$97.5bn x 40% market share = $39bn revenue in 2040

Put that on a very conservative 10x multiple = $390bn enterprise value 

What are the odds of that playing out? I’d say 5% is not crazy by any means. 

$390bn x 5% = $19.5bn.  Current market cap is just $2.9bn

6.7x upside = $101 price target 

Call me an idiot but I don’t think this is wild for a game changing industry and business that will be crucial for the US.

**Overview** 

AST SpaceMobile (ticker symbol: ASTS) is an emerging wireless infrastructure provider that is seeking to provide global 5G connectivity, no matter where you are in the world by using satellites. Currently AST has predicted price targets of $35 (Deutsche Bank) and $29 (Barclays). AST will operate in global wireless services which generates over $1 trillion in annual revenue. With 5.2 billion current wireless subscribers who move in and out of coverage and 3.8 billion cellular subscribers that are not subscribed to cellular broadband, AST offers a unique, large-scale approach for current wireless providers to solve these issues. By operating under a wholesale model, the company has established themselves as a partner to the largest names in the telecommunications industry. To date, AST has executed commercial agreements with many familiar names in the market such as Vodafone and AT&T. Along with the MOUs that they continue to sign, AST’s agreements have given them access to a customer base of 1.5 billion subscribers. Overall, this company has great potential to fill in the voids that current wireless providers simply cannot fill, and thus present a unique early-stage investment opportunity.

**Business Model/Margin Structure**

AST SpaceMobile strategically has decided to operate under a wholesale business model. Under this model, they will gain most of their revenue off 50/50 revenue share agreements with MNOs. Within the revenue share agreements, the partners will cover the costs associated obtaining and retaining customers such as marketing, customer service, billing, and local regulatory approval. Because of this, AST SpaceMobile’s only large significant costs will come from satellite launches and satellite maintenance. Additionally, the low operating cost allows AST to competitively price their product in their target markets. In the equatorial region, they predict an average monthly revenue per user of $1.03, $2.15 globally, and $7.62 in Europe and the United States. The company predicts 95% EBITDA margins could be achieved as early as 2024, making AST extremely profitable within just a few years.

**Key Partners**

Through the wholesale business model, AST has been able to execute commercial agreements and sign MOUs with companies such as Vodafone, AT&T, Telefonica, and Smart Communications. All together, the companies that AST has partnered with have given them access to approximately 1.5 billion current mobile subscribers. The binding commercial agreements cover approximately 800 million people to date. Customers of AST will be able to add SpaceMobile service to their plans that they buy from partners. However, if there is no provider in the area, customers will be able to sign up for SpaceMobile services directly.

**Funding**

AST plans on launching in 4 phases which each cover different geographic regions. Phase one will consist of 20 satellites that will create the Equatorial constellation. The cost of launching phase one according to the company's investor presentation will cost approximately $309Mn. Subsequent phases, which have predicted costs of $1.3292Bn, will be primarily funded by revenues from phase 1’s geographic region. To date, AST currently has the full cash to fund phase one. After closing a SPAC merger in early April, AST added 423Mn in cash to their balance sheet. Additionally, Abel Avellan, Chairman and CEO, has stated his confidence that AST will receive funds from the $9Bn 5g Fund for Rural America to assist in covering the Capital Expenditures. AST also holds the right to raise another $202Mn by calling their outstanding warrants. Dilution is unlikely in the future as Avellan has specified that if new funds were needed, they would be raised through debt or their partners. Though phase 1 is fully funded, AST holds many alternative solutions to fund the rest of their capital expenditures without directly harming shareholders through dilution.

**Technology**

The unique size and shape of AST’s satellites is the key to success. The company will produce packed satellites that unfold into a thin 20m x 20m array when deployed in space. Each satellite will orbit in low earth orbit and will be 5G compatible with forward compatibility with 6G. As for speeds, preliminary numbers forecast each satellite to provide 40 Gbps, 1.2Mn GB per satellite per month, and latencies around 20-40ms. The size of the satellite is key to produce the power necessary to connect a small-handheld device to a satellite directly without any extra equipment.

In terms of technology costs, AST has held the costs to a minimum. On the satellites themselves, there are two primary cost drivers: the array and power. The company has dramatically cut the cost for the arrays down by mass producing the microns which will go onto the satellites. In the last three years, companies creating the equipment to power satellites have been taking terrestrial solar equipment and adapting it to function on a satellite which has caused a large decline in price. The final large cost of satellite launches has seen one of the biggest decreases with the emergence of private launch companies such as SpaceX and Rocket Lab. With all of these costs coming to a minimum, AST is positioned to be the first with the technology and the funds to pursue space-based cellular broadband.

**Key Drivers/Timeline**

In my view, there are four key events left that are crucial for AST to achieve their predicted financial numbers. As of today, the company has already achieved great progress on the business and technological side of the business. The company has established base access to 1.5Bn potential subscribers through their partnerships and has one last major test before commercial launch begins.

The first major milestone for AST is gaining regulatory approval. In the business update presentation in September, the company stated that they had received regulatory approval in 6 countries, and their application to the FCC had been accepted to test BlueWalker 3. With only a commenting period left before approval from the FCC (which should occur in November/December of 2021), AST is making a clear advance toward gaining regulatory approval to operate. For the meantime, AT&T has given AST permission to test their final test satellite, BlueWalker 3, on their frequencies.

The second major milestone is the launch and test of the BlueWalker 3 test satellite with a predicted launch date with SpaceX in March of 2022. This is the final test before the equatorial satellites are launched, so it is the final opportunity for AST to test and tune their satellites, if necessary. The launch is necessary to validate the technology on a larger scale, though the proof of concept was already successfully tested on the company’s BlueWalker 1 satellite.

If the company’s tests are successful, they will immediately start the mass production of BlueBird 1, their commercial satellites. The commercial operations are the third and final milestone the company must hit in order to achieve projected financials. The company splits the launch of the entire constellation into 4 phases: equatorial, North America/Europe/Asia, global coverage, and global MIMO. Phase 1, the equatorial constellation, will launch in late 2022 and begin operations in early 2023. It consists of 20 satellites orbiting above the equator. Phase 2 calls for 45 more satellites to be launched and operational during 2023. Phase 3 will also deploy 45 satellites and will provide global coverage towards the end of 2023/early 2024. Finally, phase 4 will launch 58 satellites by late 2024/early 2025 in order to increase the speed and performance of the constellation. If all is successful, AST plans on scaling the network between 2025-2030 through the launch of 160+ additional satellites, which will be determined by consumer demand.

**Industry Overview**

AST SpaceMobile will operate in the global telecoms market which has turnover of 1Tn a year. Inside this market, there are 5 billion mobile phones that move in and out of coverage and 4 billion people who still remain unconnected to cellular broadband. AST plans to join a growing industry as the expected CAGR for telecommunications is expected to be 5.4% for the next 8 years. Though everything in this presentation focuses on the telecommunications aspect of AST, there have been mentions by the company of entering other markets such as home broadband, Internet of Things, and military/defense.

**Competitors**

Though all of AST’s competitors are taking different approaches towards satellite cellular broadband, it is clear that AST is years ahead both in terms of funding, business agreements, and technology wise. There are four main competitors that will be discussed further below: Lynk, GlobalStar, Omnispace, and Iridium. We do not discuss Project Kuiper or Starlink as they are seeking to provide internet broadband that requires expensive, specialized equipment. 

Lynk, the most closely related competitor to AST, has claimed that it can connect a satellite to a cell phone without any special equipment. However, Lynk is only offering text-messaging services using their equipment. Though they have mentioned that they will explore cellular broadband in the long-run, AST remains years ahead for cellular broadband technology. Additionally, Lynk lacks any partners compared to AST’s partners and access to 1.5Bn mobile users worldwide. Finally, in comparison to the 500Mn+ that AST has raised, Lynk has raised tens of millions of dollars. AST is simply far ahead in every category compared to Lynk which is a gap that will be extremely difficult to close. 

Recently, rumors broke out of Apple partnering with GlobalStar in developing chips that could directly connect to satellites. However, Apple did not confirm this rumor when unveiling the iPhone 13. In fact, the rumors furthered that the connection to satellites would only be used for emergency situations, not cellular broadband connectivity. Similar to Lynk, AST is years ahead in cellular broadband which is where the company derives its value.

Omnispace acquired its own spectrum on S-band and has the right to directly communicate with mobile devices. This spectrum is not used in mobile terrestrial, and would require a shift from manufacturers of chip sets and mobile phones to integrate them in the future. Omnispace claims that it will be in operation by 2026, 3-4 years later than AST. Altogether, the sheer burden of a technological shift for manufacturers and a late start to operations makes us not believe that Omnispace is a serious threat to AST’s operations.

Iridium, a current leader in satellite connectivity for mobile phones, requires specialized, bulky mobile phones to be used to connect. As consumers have not adapted to using these expensive alternative phones, we have a strong precedent to state that Iridium will not be a threat to AST and no equipment is needed to connect to their services, other than any standard mobile phone.

The other players in the satellite mobile communications industry are either years behind AST or require significant changes to modern phones in order to provide connectivity. None go as far as having cellular broadband available within the next 5 years, nor have they had the funds to come to keep up with AST SpaceMobile’s technology. Combining the facts above with the executed commercial agreements and MOU’s, AST has established a large moat between the competition that we believe will not be closed within the next 10 years.

\- Traders weighed dismal results and bond-market gyrations amid fears about inflation and monetary tightening, and equities in the US rose.

\- After opening lower on disappointing results from Amazon.com and Apple, the S&P 500 climbed less than 0.2%. The advances sent the benchmark index up 6.9% in October, its highest monthly rise since November last year. Meanwhile, advances in Tesla and Meta platforms after its name change from facebook propelled the Nasdaq 100 up by 0.5%.

\- Inflationary pressures and the likelihood of interest-rate hikes shook bond markets around the world. The 10-year treasury rate has dropped to 1.56%. In Europe, bonds fell further after data on eurozone economic growth and inflation beat analysts' expectations, underscoring a growing belief that interest-rate hikes are on the way despite only a mild pushback from the ECB's leader.

\- A number of crosscurrents are having an effect on the markets. Positive corporate performance has aided in the support of global equities. However, supply-chain snarls and higher-cost raw materials are raising expectations for rate hikes and lowering the economic outlook.

\- The latest GDP data from the United States shows that growth slowed more than predicted in the third quarter, hurt by supply chains and an increase of COVID-19 infections. In addition, weekly unemployment claims fell to a pandemic low in September, but personal spending slowed in line with analysts' expectations.

\- Despite reversing losses, the Stoxx Europe 600 index gained for the fourth week in a row. The value of the US dollar increased. Crude oil gained.

# **Markets could be challenged in the week ahead as the Fed prepares to reverse easy policy - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/29/markets-could-be-challenged-in-the-week-ahead-as-the-fed-prepares-to-reverse-easy-policy.html)**
*****
> The Federal Reserve is expected to take its first major step away from the easy policy it put in place to fight the pandemic, a milestone on the road back toward normal.
*****
> The Fed’s two-day meeting Tuesday and Wednesday is the big event for markets in the week ahead. The central bank is widely expected to announce that it will begin to unwind its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases and end the program entirely by the middle of next year.
*****
> Economic data will also be important, with the October jobs report on Friday. There are dozens of earnings expected, including pharmaceuticals like Pfizer and Moderna, as well as a host of travel, energy, insurance, and tech companies.
*****
> The Bank of England also meets Thursday, and it is expected to raise interest rates. The move comes after rate hikes by South Korea, Norway and others.
*****
> “The Fed is part of a global move to remove accommodation, and the market drives right past that,” Bleakley Advisory Group CIO Peter Boockvar said. “In a way, the stock market is playing a game of chicken, with this inflation move and interest rates and the response from central banks.”
*****
> Inflation has been running at a 30-year high. Core PCE inflation — which is the Fed’s preferred gauge —jumped 3.6% in September on a year-over-year basis, the same as in August.
*****
> Stocks were higher on the week, with the S&P 500 up about 1.1% as of Friday afternoon and up roughly 6.7% for the month of October. Both the Dow and S&P 500 notched new highs in the past week. The widely watched 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.53% Friday afternoon.
*****
> “There is an incredible level of complacency out there in this environment,” Boockvar said.
*****
> Other events the markets are monitoring include the gathering of world leaders at the G-20 in Italy and the United Nations climate summit COP26, beginning Sunday in Scotland.
*****
> # ‘Wild week’
“You’re going to have a wild week,” Wells Fargo’s Michael Schumacher said. He noted that the Fed’s action will dominate the week, and the jobs report will be secondary.
*****
> Wells Fargo economists expect 390,000 jobs were added in October and average hourly earnings grew by 0.4%, he noted. Payrolls were up just 194,000 in September. Schumacher said inflation is the biggest concern in the markets, so the wage data will be most closely watched.
*****
> Schumacher said the market is widely expecting the Fed to announce it will reduce its bond purchases by $15 billion a month, starting either in November or December. The central bank implemented its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program in early 2020, as it slashed rates and introduced programs to buy a range of assets to help keep the markets liquid.
*****
> Now, as the program is being wound down, it is what Fed Chairman Jerome Powell says about inflation that matters most because that will drive interest rate expectations.
*****
> Yet, Powell is expected to stress that the Fed is not automatically going to raise interest rates once the bond purchases end in the middle of next year. Traders are pricing in as many as three interest rate hikes next year, but in the latest Fed forecast, only half of central bank officials agreed there should be even one.
*****
> “The inflation commentary is a lot more important,” Schumacher said. “Powell has sounded concerned about expectations getting baked in.” He noted that the 2-year yield, which most reflects the Fed, has risen more than 30 basis points since the last Fed meeting five weeks ago.
*****
> Schumacher said market expectations for rate hikes may be overdone, and that he does not expect a move until the beginning of 2023. “The direction is right, but the speed is wrong,” he said.
*****
> Powell’s comments will be closely watched for any adjustment in his thinking on inflation. The Fed had described the surge in rates as “transitory” or temporary. The consumer price index has been running above 5%, and core CPI was at 4% in September.
*****
> “The general feeling among central bankers and the major central banks is this inflation rate will come back down,” TIAA Bank president of world markets Chris Gaffney said. “Nobody is using ‘transitory’ anymore, but they don’t feel like we’re going to have prolonged high inflation.”
*****
> Gaffney said the weaker-than-expected 2% growth in third-quarter gross domestic product could help the Fed convince the markets that it intends to keep rates lower for longer.
*****
> “As long as they stay accommodative, I think the recovery continues,” he said. “I’m fairly bullish for the markets going forward. We’ll certainly see a lot more choppiness, but I still think the global economy, the U.S. economy particularly, is right now a great environment for corporations. We’re seeing fairly positive earnings reports, and more importantly expectations for future earnings.”
*****
> There have been some high-profile misses, including both Apple and Amazon this past week. Both their stocks fell, weighing on the Nasdaq down Friday.
*****
> “Earnings overall have been good, but there’s still a lot of profit margin challenges out there,” Boockvar said. “There’s no better example than Apple and Amazon.”

> # November’s First Trading Day: DJIA Up Over 1% Three Years in a Row

> Based upon data in the 2022 Stock Trader’s Almanac on page 90, the first trading day of November is the fourth best of all monthly first trading days since September 1997 based upon total DJIA point gained. DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ have all advanced 13 times over the last 21 years. Average performance on the day ranges from a low of 0.17% by S&P 500 to 0.28% by NASDAQ over the 21-year time period.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0362ad93159683f932d60b790bfa9ac8/e57961a120ac1354-3a/s500x750/517dc1575ee1212443153f2b842289d3b9eda639.jpg))**

> # Here Comes One of the Best Days of the Year (and the Best Week and Month)

> The calendar is about to do a lot of favors for the bulls, as late October and early November historically are quite strong.

> October 28 was the best day of the year, until it fell more than 3% last year, but this day is still one of the strongest days historically for stocks. Not to be outdone though, October 29 and November 2 and 3 are also some of the better days of the year. “I’d like to think it has something to do with my birthday being on October 28, but the truth is bulls should be aware that the coming days are historically some of the best of the year,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.27.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the single best day to buy at the close and hold for the next five trading days is today, October 27. Yes, these 5 days were lower last year by 0.6%, but you have to go back to the late 1960s to see the last time they were down two years in a row.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.27.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Lastly, November has been quite strong historically. In fact, since 1950, and the past 10 years, it is the best month of the year, while it ranks second over the past 20 years and during a post-election year. “November is the best month of the year, but it doesn’t seem to get nearly as much love as you’d think,” added Ryan Detrick. “We all assume December is the best month, but November is actually better and gets very little fanfare. Maybe it should be a month for the bulls, not for turkeys.”

> # Year’s Best 3-Month Span About To Start

> November, December and January constitute the year’s seasonally strongest 3-month period for the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrials and the NASDAQ Composite. This seasonal strength is created by a combination of the annual, semiannual and quarterly operations of institutions and the habitual behavior of retail investors and consumers.

> The November-January 3-month span has produced a gain of 4.3% for the S&P 500 & DJIA since 1949. October-December runs a close second at 4.1% for S&P and 3.9% for DJIA. Since 1971 NASDAQ has gained a whopping 6.3% November-January with December-February in second at 5.0% and October-December in third at4.4%.

> These charts also highlight the Best and Worst Months of the year with the Best running from October/November to April/May/June and the Worst from May/June/July to September/October. Stocks have been firming up since we issued our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal to subscribers on October 8 and look poised for a solid yearend rally that continues into early 2022.

> # Short Term Breadth Takes Off

> One of the points noted about the recent moves for the S&P 500 over the past few days have been on the outsized impacts of big gains or losses in names like Tesla (TSLA) or Facebook (FB). In spite of the impacts of those single names, the S&P 500's return to record highs has happened on very strong breadth across sectors. Below, we show 10-day advance-decline line charts from our Sector Snapshot.

> The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average daily number of advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last ten trading days. It's a short-term breadth measure that traders use to measure how extended the market is at the moment. Very high readings suggest that the market might be overbought in the near term, and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low readings suggest the opposite -- that the market might be oversold in the near term, and upside mean reversion can be expected.

> For the broad S&P 500, the 10-day AD line has hit the highest level since February 12th. Going back to 1990, the current reading stands in the 97th percentile. Looking at each sector, most lines are also in the upper decile of readings since 1990 and only two are not currently overbought: Communication Services and Consumer Staples. Meanwhile, some like Technology and Real Estate are a full two standard deviations above the historical norm. In fact, the Tech sector's line is the most elevated relative to its respective history of any sector with the current reading in the 98th percentile of all periods. The last time that the line was as elevated as now was in November of last year. No other sector has as long of a gap in time in which it has seen levels similar to the current reading. Most other sectors have seen higher readings as recently as August or September, though current levels are nonetheless elevated. The market has had quite the run over the last two weeks, and we'd expect some sort of cool-off period soon.

> # High Number of Record Highs

> Major US equity indices have returned to all-time highs in the second half of October with the S&P 500 and Dow both hitting record levels today. Meanwhile, the NASDAQ Composite is roughly a quarter of one percent away and the closest to a new all-time high since the last one on September 7th. The Russell 2,000, on the other hand, is at the high end of the past several months' range, but it is still over 2% below its high from March 15th.

> With the S&P 500 having been at new highs over the past few days, it has made 57 new all-time highs year to date. As shown in the top-left chart below, there have only been three other years in the past that have seen more record highs during the full course of the year: 2017 (62), 1964 (67), and 1995 (78). For the other major indices, the pace of record highs is less impressive but still strong. The Dow has made 38 new highs in 2021 which is more than triple the historical average. This year is on pace to see the highest number of record highs for the index since 2017 when it tied 1991 for the record of 71 closes at an all-time high. The NASDAQ Composite has also seen a solid number of highs at 36 which is well above the historical average of 19 per year historically. Given the index has been rangebound essentially all year, the Russell 2,000, conversely, has only seen 13 closing record highs. That is the same number as last year and it is actually below the average of 20 per year historically.

> # Sentiment Steps Back

> The weekly sentiment survey from AAII saw a surge in optimism in recent weeks, but it took a step back this week even with the S&P 500 at new highs. Bullish sentiment fell from a recent high of 46.9% down to 39.8% this week. Outside of last week, that is still the highest level since the first week of September.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Bulls.png))**

> While bullish sentiment saw a significant 7.1 percentage point drop, a relatively small share of those losses turned to the bearish camp. Bearish sentiment only rose 1.6 percentage points to 29.4%. That is still below levels from two weeks ago and is in line with the average from throughout the summer.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Bears.png))**

> The corresponding moves in bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bull-bear spread to fall but bulls continue to outweigh bears by 10.4 percentage points.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Spread.png))**

> As previously mentioned, the largest share of losses to bulls did not go to bears, but instead were picked up by those reporting neutral sentiment. That reading moved back above 30% this week gaining 5.3 percentage points. Again, that does not mark any sort of new high or low but instead brings sentiment back to similar levels seen only a month or two ago.

So like any degenerate gambler I have leveraged to the tits and invested in long ITM options for some tech stocks. Given the abysmal earnings all my investments were rather in deep red. Just to say I started my day with apple as red as an apple, I could see my future wife running off with her future boyfriend, my future kid in an orphanage and so on... Although rather slowly through the day the red became green, but that doesn't discount the decades it shaved off my life in few hours...

What I want to hear from my fellow apes is how do you deal with market over-reactions to earning calls? Please dont say to not put my life savings(future and current) given it is either YOLO or NONO..."

Or, I will walk away with lower profits if Tesla crashes before any of the next steps shared below.

Here is my current short position: **Step 1:**  


https://preview.redd.it/i1z93h9xffw71.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47b828402fbf3b681459a963182519ea7729ae87

✅ **Step 1/Position Started:**   
Current Average: $1,070.14  
Current Cost Basis: -$200,117.03

✅ **Step 2**  
Short at: $1,200\~  
Amount: $200K\~   
Shares to buy: 166\~  
New Cost Basis: $400,117.03\~  
New Average: $1,131.20\~

✅ **Step 3:**  
Short at: $1,500\~  
Amount: $400K\~  
Shares to buy: 266\~  
New Cost Basis: $800,117.03\~  
New Average: $1,289.68\~

✅ **Step 4/Optional:**  
Short at: $1,700\~  
Amount: $200K\~  
Shares to buy: 117\~  
New Cost Basis: $1,000,117.03\~  
New Average: $1,354.91\~

I plan to cash out after a -30% drop, maybe ill aim for a 50% drop which means Tesla would be either at $949.44 for a -30%. Or, $677.45 for the -50%. This leaves Tesla with room to run from its current position of $1,100 a 23% gain to the final breakeven point or, 54% to the final optional step.   


**Worst Case:**   
Tesla runs up from my even price of $1,354.91 to $2,100 a $2.1 Trillion Market Cap. I'll take a half a million dollar loss which I can afford all day, any day. Won't kill me. (-50%).  


✍️**Note:**  
If Tesla doubles from its current price, it will be worth more than Apple and Microsoft by $1 Trillion Dollars.  I strongly believe the ROI for new buyers is dramatically decreasing. In other words, the Greater Fool is running low/near the end. There is too much risk, too many emotions, and greed flowing around. Be fearful when others are greedy. In this case, ill profit from their beyond delusional greed. Or, Tesla is currently at peak levels and I don't even get to the next steps. Still a win.

They currently sit at 50 cents premarket.

Wednesday morning you saw massive Bull volume entering Google, despite only being up 1% premarket off strong earnings. Initial volume trading institutions to jump in and pump Goog to new all time high. 

https://preview.redd.it/f6c0705wrdw71.png?width=507&format=png&auto=webp&s=674029e01b66d8bd8dc46e575cc3f44c67024193

Yesterday we saw SHOP down premarket off mediocre earnings, and when SHOP bulls jumped in buying the dip, that triggered institutions to pour volume in, pumping off **1328** low all the way up to  **1504** high in less than 90 minutes. Oct 29th calls went from .25 cents to **22.75**.

https://preview.redd.it/0dwp8nv8udw71.png?width=509&format=png&auto=webp&s=a614725507a3183bbd0b1695385937a3882956c4

I believe we are going to see the same today with FB, especially with Cathie Wood Jumping in. FB has been beaten up over the last 2 months and has dropped from and ATH of **382** and now sits at **320** premarket. Bull volume will be pilling in and will fill the quick drop from $**340**. If this happens, **OCT 29th 330** calls will go from **.50 to over $10. 20-1 risk to reward.** I am further convinced of this with AMZN and AAPL earnings misses, institutional money will flow into Greener pastures. 

I think longer term options are a great play as well, but I think todays calls is the best risk to reward based on previous patterns observed this week.

At the moment, don't know what's going to happen because of how shitty those aapl and amzn earning reports were but I can share my opinion on how Roblox looks from this point in time.

From a technical standpoint, let's just say I haven't seen a better looking inverse head and shoulders since SNOW a couple weeks ago. Check it's chart and you will see it pretty clearly and also see how the stock cruised after breakout.  The chart below shows the current head and shoulders Roblox is in. It broke out of trend on big volume at the end of the day prior to the general market melt up indicating it may follow through with a larger scale breakout based on Technicals alone.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/TE0U2gof

There are a couple other reasons why this may be the best time to get into this play. Facebooks rebranding to Meta says it all. Facebook is rebranding to Meta to highlight it's focus on the metaverse, a field that will be seeing huge growth in the coming years. There is no other player bigger than Roblox in the metaverse field at the moment. Roblox is already hosting virtual concerts by the likes of 21 pilots and other popular artists. They are also partnering with companies like Chipotle to bring advertisements to the users of it's platform, an interesting new revenue stream. All in all, Roblox is more than just a kids game; it represents the first real comprehensive metaverse project. This will likely continue to attract big partnerships, maybe Facebook some day.

Another thing to look forward to is the fact that their earnings report is right around the corner. I don't have a stance on how the stock may perform post earnings but I do know there is a strong chance it runs in anticipation of earnings as many other stocks do. This adds to draw of this play.

Tldr: great looking chart, good sympathy play for facebooks rebrand to Meta, and upcoming earnings make this a play that you should consider.

**John Malone,** who holds most of Discovery’s voting rights is at it again. In January 1990 he had ‘tight control’ over the media industry. So in order to alleviate some pressure from Washington he decided to spin-off the telecom giants programming assets from its cable operations, and he made a quick fortune in doing so. The scene has changed and cable is no longer the king of content, but behind John Malone’s leathery exterior sits a keen mind that is ever aware of the changing landscape- and how to profit from it.

# Spin-offs

Funnily enough, where there is proof that acquisitions destroy shareholder value there is also proof that spin-offs tend to [add value.](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/strategy/sp-us-spin-off-index/#overview) Spin-offs give the market the opportunity to appraise a single segment or division of a company, rather than looking at it boxed up with old antiques.

Below, the white graph shows the S&P U.S. Spin-Off index compared to the blue- S&P500.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e4cnmjhjt6w71.png?width=1009&format=png&auto=webp&s=06f1e7c18be02ebd9a1d21a1806c42fc2f15c265

This doesn’t mean we can blindly jump into a spin-off. We still need to do our homework.

Looking into AT&T previously naturally led me to take a squiz at Discovery again. The spin-off merger (planned to happen next year, 2022) of WarnerMedia from AT&T into Discovery is a big deal. WarnerMedia has top content, HBO Max is set to compete on the global stage with Netflix, Disney+ Apple TV, and Amazon Prime and Discovery is a bridge for the expansion.

I feel like I am slightly late to the game on this one, as most of the internet has already pored over this. But from what I have seen (or what I have missed) they didn’t get the value quite right.

I looked briefly at Discovery some years ago, the share price was depressed then too. A large amount of debt and cable assets didn’t scream “buy” to me. Their shares could also easily be diluted by preferred stock shareholders. Netflix was also gobbling up subscribers who were slowly cutting their cable.

Maybe Discovery has passed its prime, maybe the days of watching Bear Grylls drink his own piss are gone…or are they?

&#x200B;

# Discovery:

Discovery isn’t an overly complicated business. They do television networks and make content. Their money comes from advertising and distribution.

Discovery’s biggest moneymaker is their American television network segment. But they also have a great footprint internationally. The television network segment which contains Discovery Channel, Food Network, and others, has a significant amount of subscribers.

**Discovery 2019:**

Cash provided by operations: **+3.4Bn**

Cash used in investing: **-438Mn**

Free cash flow to the firm**: \~3Bn**

**Discovery 2020: Covid Year**

Cash provided by operations: **+2.7Bn**

Cash used in investing: **-703Mn**

Free cash flow to the firm**: \~2Bn**

### Strong Cash Flow

Discovery has a strong cash flow. Most of the 3bn and 2bn generated in 2019 and 2020 respectively have been used to **buy back stock and pay down debt.** **Debt sits at \~15Bn,** so they are not conservatively leveraged but Discovery easily covers this \~**$650Mn** interest expense so it’s not a dangerous amount of debt either.

A nice way to scan a company before diving into the dirty details is to look at the cash flow generated and compare that to its market capitalization. This gives you a rough free cash flow yield. I like to take their cash flow and cut a good 10-30% off of it, so I arrive at a conservative estimate. Then if the cash flow yield is still above 10-15% I start looking deeper. I do this to maintain a margin of safety, it gives me room to make mistakes because I am not omniscient.

Looking at Discovery itself, however, is not the way to value this business. The merger is going to change what Discovery shareholders are exposed to.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uy8il35qt6w71.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&s=620d2db9334d8c65cf1570d52b702f8cfb6bbfc8

In 2022, Discovery shareholders are going to hold much less of Discovery’s original business. They will be more exposed to Warner Media’s growing business, compared to Discovery’s lackluster television networks business. **This changes the game a bit.**

If we buy Discovery, we need to understand how much of the pie we’re getting, and at what price…

&#x200B;

### The Merger

Discovery current has a weighted average of **504Mn undiluted** and 6**64Mn fully diluted** shares outstanding. The dilution comes from convertible preference shares, namely Series A and Series C convertible preference shares. “Series A Preferred” **originally** converts into 9 Series A Common. “Series C Preferred” **originally** converts into 19 Series C common.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ro3tfftwt6w71.png?width=1105&format=png&auto=webp&s=b113e8228d809c1b061f5951c876fbebfc99a117

What has changed due to the merger? Here in the Discovery/Warner Media merger agreement or “The Merger Agreement” they provide us with a lovely ***riddle:***

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jso90auyt6w71.png?width=1315&format=png&auto=webp&s=044f3ea2717d2e16d4726e04b674d5ac867ed262

“WTF are they saying?” right?

We do not need to calculate how much dilution will take place, or what these shares will be converted into. **We already know what we need to know- that all the preferred stock is going to convert leading to a full dilution.** And the amount of fully diluted shares is given to us on the financial statements - **664Mn.**

# Valuation

I wouldn’t buy Discovery if in one years time it was still going to be Discovery. They have quite a bit of debt, and even though the cash flow yield is ok, I think their business is going to face extreme competition from the streamers.

**But,** the merger changes a lot of things:

1. It allows Discovery to help give HBO/HBO Max the international footprint it needs to continue to grow and take on Netflix/Disney.
2. It gives Discovery shareholders great exposure to a new hot asset, that can turn the 14.6% cash flow yield into a cash flow yield that grows over time which changes Discovery’s valuation completely.
3. It creates a new streaming media company with tons of hours of content/entertainment AND a way to get it directly to consumers. **It allows Discovery to move from earning money from distributors and allowing them to have a direct to consumer relationship with customers- huge.**

To value Discovery right now, you cannot look at Discovery alone. After the merge Discovery shareholders are going to be holding an entirely different beast. They will have exposure to Warner Bros content, Turner, HBO as well as exposure to the synergies.

Recall that the new Combined company is going to receive \~75% of it’s revenue from Warner Media assets.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/56n95n81u6w71.png?width=668&format=png&auto=webp&s=b80c611ba60df073ee14c19078a8e52fe2d490ab

So what do you get when you buy Discovery common stock now? Below I combined a few metrics from Warner Media and Discovery to create a **rough** view of the “Combined” company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ycp96a43u6w71.png?width=647&format=png&auto=webp&s=cad37f877f1e34ea1ec76d663d74dfa16193be9f

If you buy Discovery common stock now, **then after the merger** you will be receiving \~$3.17 cash flow per share (conservative estimate) **that is generated mostly by Warner Media**. Discovery is trading lower and lower, around **\~$23 per share** or a **13.8%** cash flow yield or a **price to cash flow of 7.25** \- **using the combined company’s metrics (note:** not pre-merger Discovery metrics, these are based on post-merger financials).

But by buying Discovery now, you set yourself up to receive this exposure next year.

### Netflix

Compare this to Netflix which has a price to cash flow of **\~127.** (can’t make this up).

These are pricy multiples because Netflix is growing fast, and has amassed large market share. The thing is, people do not pay for Netflix, they pay for Netflix’s content, and Warner Media + Discovery will have tons of content. A formidable opponent to Netflix. HBO is already well known globally for Game of Thrones, Succession, and others.

**Discovery & Warner merger: Price to cash flow: 7.25**

**Netflix: Price to cash flow: 127**

“You can’t compare Netflix to Warner Media/Discovery” - what better asset is there? Look at HBO Max’s platform compared to Netflix’s below: The similarities are striking, the only difference is the management of the content. Discovery generates income from advertising and distributors whereas Netflix has a direct-to-consumer relationship.

Discovery will provide the bridge to HBO to go global, and HBO can allow Discovery’s content to get closer to a direct-to-consumer model.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/olthnl96u6w71.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=11714ea3dc1afc22c2c755870002943ea05e4d49

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/epysq4d7u6w71.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1ab3caf8c6222f39ab71f92050bedcbba6d2a5a

The Discovery and Warner Media merger seems like a great “plug and play” way to increase value by moving Discovery’s content away from cable and to an OTT (over the top) service.

# Catalyst

Normally I don’t care for a catalyst. I just care for value, but the catalyst here will be the spin-off merger combined with HBO Max going global.

**Warning:** In a spin-off stocks sometimes tank hard and fast because shareholders from parent companies sell the stock indiscriminately. Some tracker ETF’s may also sell spin-offs because it doesn’t meet the requirements for what they can hold. All of this can add undue pressure in a sell-off. However, in this chaotic environment, it can also offer someone who is prepared to buy at lovely prices.

*****
> Stock futures edged higher in premarket trading Thursday, a day after after the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped from their record highs and as Wall Street looked to more earnings news and an important read on economic growth.
*****
> Dow futures rose 84 points. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures both traded in solidly positive territory.
*****
> Ford saw its shares jump more than 9% on blockbuster earnings while also raising guidance. The automaker said increased availability of semiconductors during the quarter allowed it to ramp up production.
*****
> Shares of Twilio fell around 13% in after-hours trade, despite a beat on both earnings and revenue for the third quarter, after the cloud communications platform projected a fourth-quarter loss. Ebay also fell by about 5% on weak fourth-quarter revenue guidance.
*****
> Pharmaceutical giant and Dow component Merck saw its shares rise nearly 1% premarket after the company posted an earnings beat on the top and bottom lines. Fellow bluechip index company Caterpillar topped profit estimates but fell just shy on revenue, sending its shares up nearly 2%.
*****
> The market will be getting more big earnings news, with tech giants Amazon and Apple reporting after the closing bell. NBC Universal and CNBC.com parent Comcast posted a solid earnings beat before the bell, sending shares up 3.4%.
*****
> Investors awaited the first estimate for third-quarter annualized gross domestic product growth from the Commerce Department. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected an increase of just 2.8% as products remained stranded at normally bustling ports, employers struggled to find workers and consumers battled with inflation.
*****
> On Wednesday, the S&P 500 slipped 0.5% for its first down day in three as the rally on a strong earnings season started to ease. The blue-chip Dow dipped more than 250 points, falling for the first time in four days.
*****
> Major averages have been marching higher on earnings momentum this month. The S&P 500 has gained 5.6% in October, on pace to post its best month since November 2020. The Dow is up 4.9% this month, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has rallied 5.5%.
*****
> Nearly 40% of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings and more than 80% of them beat Wall Street expectations, according to CNBC calculations. S&P 500 companies are expected to grow profit by about 37.6% in the third quarter.
*****
> “Earnings have helped and a reminder that US reporting so far has been better than the long-term average in terms of beats,” Jim Reid, head of thematic research at Deutsche Bank, said in a note. “It has still been healthier relative to some of the stagflationary gloom stories seen through September and early October which has perhaps helped the relief rally.”

As usual the chip shortage still looms over tech companies such as Apple and with the new iPhone 13 release I’m questioning if it was as much of a success and as profitable as the company predicted.

I’m not too worried necessarily about the earnings per share, I’m more worried about the outlook of the company for the rest of the year and going into 2022. The majority of Apples iPhone sales occur during the holiday season and I’m not sure if supply will be able to meet the high demand. Personally I feel like there is always the highest jump in iPhone demand every 3 generations due to the general trend of how the average consumer upgrades. Such as with the iPhone 6 to the iPhone X, then to the 13.
 
Apple is amazing and like with many other companies, they have made many advancements and innovations but just haven’t had the chance to benefit from them to the fullest extent financially due to the economic and supply restraints brought along by Covid. The market at the moment is propped up by hope for the future, which I think is fine, it shows that more investors are bullish and in it for the long haul. Therefore I think Apple’s stock might be just fine for earnings and follow suit with the end of the year upward swing of the market even if earnings does not necessarily meet expectations."

I’m posting it today since I already typed it up, but I can’t predict how Peloton will move in the next week. Take your positions early at your own risk.

Note on quarters: Peloton’s financial quarter differs from our calendar. Their upcoming report will be for Q1 2022, covering July – September 2021. When I refer to their “full-year guidance”, this covers the months July 2021 – June 2022.

**Situation:**

Peloton is a Covid stock darling that has retraced significantly from its ATH. Their report for Q4 2021 (covering April – June 2021) could be considered their first post-Covid earnings report, and disappointed the market. Based on the guidance they provided, I think they will also underperform the lowered expectations in this quarter, and cut full-year guidance.

**Peloton business:**

Peloton earns money in two main ways: Selling low-margin hardware like their Bike and Tread (70% of revenue) and selling high-margin subscriptions to their library of workout videos (30% of revenue).

Peloton has two types of subscribers: Connected Fitness (CF) subscribers (those who own a Bike or Tread) who pay USD \~40 per month, and digital subscribers (those who only use the app) who pay \~USD 10 per month. The former type is far more important for their revenue and profits, although the digital subscribers are considered an important acquisition funnel for future CF subscribers.

**Peloton gives optimistic guidance for 2022:**

On their most recent earnings call, Peloton gave a few pointers to their expected full year performance. I’m going to use these to triangulate expectations for subscription revenue and hardware revenue for the full year.

Here are the cold hard expectations we know from management: full-year revenue of 5.4 billion (800 million in Q1), 3.63 million Connected Fitness subscribers (2.47m in Q1). On the call they indicated that they expect Q2 and Q3 combined to be 60% of their annual revenue.

Based on this I constructed the following table. Numbers in black are given by management, numbers in blue are my deductions/triangulations.

&#x200B;

In this context I think it’s interesting to look at Hardware revenue over time, starting January 2020, their last “pre-covid” quarter.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3jdg1ry0buv71.png?width=735&format=png&auto=webp&s=3deb66ef8cd6734b4bb6e885719b3ac80b5c8483

Orange: upcoming quarter; green: future FY 2022 quarters

This chart reveals something interesting: while Peloton expects relatively weak sales in the upcoming quarter (17% y-o-y decrease) they assume that ALL THREE future quarters will significantly outperform the respective quarter from 2020 (covid year) in order to hit their full-year guidance. In total, they expect hardware revenue from October 2021 – June 2022 to increase 34% compared to the period from October 2020 – June 2021. Considering the they just decreased the price of their flagship Bike by 20%, this implies that they will sell **40-50% MORE** units this upcoming year than they did during the Covid year. I’m not a scientist but I find this staggeringly unlikely. In the next chapter I’m going to show a few data points that bolster my disbelief in this bold guidance.

**I don’t think they’re going to hit these guidance numbers, guys**

App downloads

Peloton’s app downloads show a tale of two cities. On the “top grossing” chart (= how many people sign up for Peloton subscriptions through Apple), Peloton has been extremely steady for 1 year. This is a proxy for existing subscribers. The numbers reflect the extremely high satisfaction of existing subscribers and their fantastically low churn (significantly below 1% per month). People who signed up for Peloton during Covid don’t seem to be quitting. So far so good.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sttxplq5buv71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe07fa4a0436ef1ee69927bc337a39d2999786f2

The “free chart” (how many people download the app) shows a very different picture. This is a proxy for  new subscribers and new hardware sales. This number unsurprisingly peaked in April 2020 and was strong through 2020 due to Covid. It absolutely nosedived in April 2021 (right around the time vaccines became widely available in NY and California, two of Peloton’s biggest markets). Since then, Peloton has almost completely dropped off the app charts, meaning that they are acquiring very few new users. Everyone who buys Peloton hardware is all but required to also download the app on their phone. Remember how they expect future hardware sales to be much higher than they were during 2020? Hmmmm.

&#x200B;

Subscriber additions

Net Digital subscriber additions (those who use the app but don’t own hardware) were negative in the most recent quarter, for the first time since Peloton went public. Peloton considers this an important funnel for customer acquisition – if the number of people trying out their digital subscription decreases, you’d logically also expect the number of people buying hardware to decrease.

&#x200B;

Reddit follower additions

The biggest Peloton subreddit is adding fewer and fewer subscribers this year, compared to 2020. Kind of the opposite of what you’d expect from a company that wants to sell more hardware than ever before.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lye47ui7buv71.png?width=716&format=png&auto=webp&s=69a5b3391b2eb76488b0360854ebe4901aac9223

Tread popularity

Despite the infamous safety incidents in 2021, Peloton has been pushing the Tread very hard, acting as if it will become as popular as their Bike and even claiming that many people who already own a bike would buy a Tread \*in addition\*. The numbers speak a different language. The share of running classes (black color) taken decreased significantly in FY 2021 – this despite the fact that anyone can take a running class, even if they don't own the hardware.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xfmg0038buv71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b6631cce03f7f19f6a9deae946ab6e517cea538

High inventory, low customer deposits

During 2020, Peloton sold essentially every singe bike they were able to produce, and customers had to wait up to 3 months for delivery. This has moderated \*significantly\* in the most recent quarter. Customer deposits (money received from customers for hardware that wasn’t delivered yet) was at an all-time low. This indicates a significant relaxation in demand. Peloton significantly increased their supply chain ability during Covid, and it looks to me like they overinvested. In 2020 there was a huge rush to grab one of their products. In 2021, you can basically order one and get it delivered almost immediately. Given this relaxation in demand, I find it very unlikely that they would be able to actually deliver more product than last year

https://preview.redd.it/16fmynebbuv71.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfd45634f2586cd7fb9b281fb80838a40672bd12

&#x200B;

**Summary**

Peloton has lofty goals for 2022 and I don’t think they can fulfill them. Existing subscribers are clearly extremely happy and stick with them (I’m one of them), but they are having big trouble expanding to new customers outside of the coastal elites. Even in other “rich” countries like Australia and Germany, Google Trends and app download data point towards significant demand decrease after an initial period of hype, despite costly marketing campaigns (including TV ads during prime time).

While Peloton is still valued like a growth stock (\~6 P/S ratio, despite not expecting to be profitable until 2023), I think expectations are too high. I expect them to cut full-year guidance during the next earnings call, leading the stock to tank.

**Positions**

A lot of legacy ICE (internal combustion engine) companies like GM are acting as if they are the innovators.

Germans know how to manufacture cars but they are too rigid for adapt change in technology. They have been giving lip service to EVs for 6 years and so far they have too little to show for 6 years of so called pursuing EV strategy. Remember BMW i3?

**A word about Europe. In many ways Europeans care about the environment more so than people elsewhere. People there see EVs as the new hot thing while in US there are some people/politicians who are less open minded to EVs. In Europe at this point people are starting to develop an anti-ICE mindset and those who want ICE may even be peer-pressured into buying EVs. You can clearly see the CO2 emission restrictions and incentives in Europe:**

**Apple is the elephant in the room that no one talks about. My bet is that Apple will buy one of the smaller EV manufacturers (not the Chines ones) when they roll out their AppleCar (iCar?, iAuto?). Apple is flush with cash and bitter that it missed buying Netflix. They already sell computers, phones, and ear phones. The next product line for them to add is clearly cars and as Elon has mentioned Apple is working on EVs. Apple had approached Hyundai but that deal is dead; I can't remember the second company they approached for takeover.**

I have seen a Lucid Air, Polestar 2, and obviously many Teslas. They are all amazing cars and I prefer them to my BMW, my father's Porsche, or my mom's Mercedes (low key showing off). I would even argue that current EVs are far superior in performance and creature comfort than super cars.

**My EV investing is focused on global companies with heavy European representation who can be good takeover targets for Apple, Alphabet/Waymo, .... I dislike Chinese companies because of the political risk as we saw in the past few month. Tesla is an awesome choice but it is too large to generate alpha that the smaller EV players may generate. I imagine a future where Apple/Google is FOMOing in autos, bringing out their version of self-drive, and competing with Uber/Lyft. We are one year away from massive merger and acquisitions in this space.**

I have a somewhat crazy theory. Since Facebook is talking about changing their name to pivot the business focus and after SNAP’s woes with advertising thanks to Apple, I think this is FB’s way of putting the writing on the wall. They’re getting a contingency plan for if the ad space changes (which is 100% is).

Any yolo option plays before their earnings announcement? Could the stock lose 20% if they miss earnings because of ad revenue? They should miss on a much more significant level than SNAP did. 

Expected $3.17 per share on revenue of $29.59 billion. There’s no way they’re making those numbers."

Well, it’s now the largest company in the world.

The AAPL cult is now not so vocal, because it has matured. 

DIS cult, Nintendo cult etc have made their companies huge players in their respective industries. Now they are just dormant.

Let's come back to some present day cults. AMD, Valve(private company) and NVDA are the biggest pc gaming related cults that are out there. Go to r/pcmasterrace or other similar places, the cult vibe is relentless and unending. Their only position being: INTC and Epic(private company) bad. AMD, NVDA, Valve daddies good.

And look at the stock price of AMD and NVDA!! They speak volume of the power of that cult!

Of course, PTON the workout cult is also a good example to showcase this example or NKE.

Cult stocks generally have higher valuation relative to their peers or their valuation may even be nonsensical.

I am kinda a AMD cult person(indoctrinated by the pcmasterrace cult), but let me demonstrate the valuation difference by comparing AMD and INTC.

AMD has almost 73% market cap of INTC. This would indicate that ultimately AMD would have 73% of the discounted free cash flow of INTC. Is that likely? Hell no.😂
INTC is much more diversified and has almost 6 times more revenue than AMD and even the most optimistic projections won't make that prediction.

But does that mean INTC will keep a larger market cap than AMD within 1 or 2 year? No, I think the opposite will happen, AMD will surpass INTC in market cap regardless of fundamentals.

It’s supply and demand. Cult followers not just buy their product, but also the stock (I think).

Also, there are cults surrounding GME, AMC stocks and if those cults are long lasting, well, elevated valuation is highly likely.


Now, let us talk about the current biggest cult of all. TSLA. Need I say anything?
If the cult is to be believed, TSLA will have 3 trillion in robotaxi, solar energy and other revenues within 2025 or something. 
(I am not saying you shouldn’t buy TSLA, my whole post is about showing the power of cult)

As long as there is a cult which has buying power and buys the product+stock, the stock would reward one handsomely.

With all that prologue, I have recently started browsing some online discussion circles, and I think DWAC is a similar big cult in the making. They have a huge portion of the populace by the balls as potential customers and regardless of what their product is, if the cult has staying power (which I believe it does), the product would hardly matter.

TL;DR: Invest in cult. Invest in DWAC and other similar cults.


Edit: I haven't mentioned some cults as I don't wanna get banned(cry ptos, tell me what value they actually produce), other cults could include companies like LULU or Yeti. And my original intention was to see some other tickers that have similar cult vibes, looks like the discussion just became too focused on a single ticker."

I wrote a scraper to hit URLs like [amazon.com/affirm](https://amazon.com/affirm) for thousands of companies in the NASDAQ. Over the last few weeks, I've noticed a handful of pages newly popping up on Teladoc's website:

I'm not sure what it means but it looks like they are actively growing their Expert Medical Opinion service, but nothing has been written about it online yet.

What's poppin' bull gang, hope you’re all doing well! Our free money glitch remained unpatched for another update, allowing many of us to pull clean double baggers across the board. God bless $SNAP. With all of big tech set to report this week, it could prove to be more lucrative than the last. We’ve got a large variety of trades we can make this week ranging from educated gambles, to good old fashioned theta plays. We’ve even have a couple of opportunities to sprinkle in some collateral plays if we wish! Let’s get into it!

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Jetblue is inefficiently priced.** Historically Jetblue moves roughly **4%** post earnings (inline with all the other American airlines),  yet this quarter, the options are pricing in a move of roughly **10%**. If we sell straddles or strangles, we can collect this extremely inflated premium with very little risk on our end. I looked into the entire sector as a whole since I planned on trading it last week, and I came across nothing that would’ve fundamentally caused this spike in volatility in airlines, or Jetblue specifically. The odds are awesome on this trade, and I plan or robbing some gamblers next week. For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)

&nbsp;

- **Twitter is inefficiently priced. Avoid it.** Historical move of **6.5%**, priced move of **11%** - on paper, this trade gives us insane edge, but I’m still not touching it, as we saw what happened with $SNAP on Thursday. Although Twitter dropped 5% as the market tried to price $AAPL’s privacy policy in, I don’t feel like taking on additional risk because the fundamentals have shifted right before its’ earnings. Normally I would take this trade 10/10 times simply from a pure numbers standpoint, but I’m not as confident anymore because of the added volatility created by $SNAP. 

&nbsp;

- **Oil stocks tend to experience Post Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD).** PEAD is the phenomenon where a stocks price will drift in the direction of an earnings surprise for several weeks following an earnings announcement. If a stock beats, it will continue to grind up for weeks following the ER report, and vice versa if it misses. This is especially true among oil stocks - check the charts if you don’t believe me. The best way to play oil this quarter would be to capitalize on this effect, and do **monthly** call or put debit spreads based on the results that come out Friday. To those curious, standard weekly options provide no edge at the time of writing, so it’s best not to gamble this time round.

&nbsp;

- **Collateral Plays are your friend!** If you’re bullish on big tech, look to long $QQQ this week to alter your risk exposure and bag some safer gains. If you’re bearish on oil, look to short $XLE instead of any of the individual companies for an added safety net. If you think $AMD is gonna knock it out of the park, look to play $NVDA or $SOXL instead. There’s lot’s of opportunities for collateral plays this week, and I’ve just barely scratched the surface. If you wish to learn more about collateral plays, refer to [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

#Summary and Conclusion

We've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly!  If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you’d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**"
qf2z9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qf2z9b/intel_is_not_comparable_to_socalled_value_traps/,"Intel is not comparable to so-called ""value traps""",80,89,2021-10-25 06:37:20,"I believe that the climate surrounding the discussion of Intel stock has caused it to enter the realm of hyperbolic discounting.  One claim I hear over and over again is that it is a ""value trap"" such as AT&T or IBM.  Luckily, we retail investors have data and the internet to be able to fact check such claims.

To do this, I used data from gurufocus and macrotrends. I plotted two graphs, one representing the PE at the end of each year, the other was the ROIC-WACC.  I chose ROIC-WACC (%),  because ROIC is one of the most important determinations of whether a company is doing better than an average index.  The results were surprising.  First, there is no similar comparison to be made of AT&T vs Intel nor IBM.  AT&T has an average ROIC-WACC of 1.2, IBM 6.9, Intel 10.7, Apple 17.4, and Microsoft 18.4.  A company with an average ROIC-WACC of 1.2 is not a value play.

The average 10 year ROICs were AT&T 5.4, IBM 13, Intel 17.8, Apple 25.6, and Microsoft 26.1. Intel's ROIC is well above the S&P average of 7.2 and yet the average PE is 27.6 vs Intel at a PE of 11.  I chose Microsoft and Apple for a comparison, because these two stocks were also thought to be a dying stock in the past.  However, often times there is a difference between a narrative being told and the data. ROIC-WACC was strong for these companies, and naturally they have done quite well, despite the news surrounding their demise.  Note that Intel now has a PE less than IBM and AT&T now.  While future ROIC is difficult to predict, Intel still has a good running ROIC, and with current interest rates, now is the best time for more capital investment because it allows WACC to be kept lower.

$PYPL wants to move beyond just payments. They want top of funnel positioning. This would allow $PYPL to not just be used as a utility (payments) but to also influence a purchase.

Quick diversion: $SNAP was (recently) arse fucked (in part) due to $AAPL changing the game. What game? Monetization with ads. The App Tracking Transparency (ATT) privacy policy. This policy disrupts the collection of data from a customer to be shared with other companies since before you can leverage an identifier for advertisers (IDFA) to help deliver customized advertising from an ad targeting platform. Now, if the customer opts out (which they are more likely to), your ad platform is more useless than it previously was.

So what is happening? These companies don’t necessarily die off. They innovate within the new environment (that comes with new constraints). Part of this innovation would come in the form of super-apps or apps that move away from a wall-garden approach to a content fortress. The difference between ad targeting resulting in a customer moving off site to keeping the customer within a single ecosystem (content fortress). Companies will either support this in-house (e.g., $SNAP developing its own services to become a content fortress), or through Mergers and Acquisitions (e.g., $PYPL acquiring $PINS leveraging $PINS visual discovery platform and predictive Pinterest engine).

How to play? Ahead of merger, load up on:

$PINS Nov 12 2021 62 Call (weekly) or shares

Risks? Merger doesn’t happen.

# **Big Tech earnings in the week ahead could test stocks’ recent rally - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/22/earnings-alphabet-apple-results-could-test-stocks-recent-rally.html)**
*****
> An earnings avalanche is coming in the week ahead that could put the stock market’s recent gains to the test.
*****
> Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon — the biggest of big cap tech — are among the 30% of the S&P 500 companies reporting. A third of the Dow also releases results, including Caterpillar, Coca-Cola, Merck, Boeing and McDonald’s.
*****
> “Next week is the real test,” RBC head of U.S. equity strategy Lori Calvasina said. “We’re getting a little bit in every sector.”
*****
> Of the companies that have already reported, nearly 84% beat estimates. Earnings are so far expected to be up 34.8% over last year, based on actual reports and estimates, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
*****
> “The tug-of-war in good versus bad earnings reports has landed in favor of the market with the S&P hitting an all-time high [Thursday]. That may run into difficulty next week,” National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said. “We may finally be seeing some cracks in the earnings season.”
*****
> The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average notched fresh records this week, and the indexes have solid gains for the week. The S&P 500 gained 1.6% to 4,544, while the Dow ended the week up 1.1% at 35,677, the first record close since Aug. 16. Some strategists view the return to those highs as a signal the market is on track for a year-end rally.
*****
> The Nasdaq Composite was also 1.3% higher for the week, but it was down 0.8% on Friday as tech stocks declined.
*****
> “I think we’re going to learn a lot from this reporting season,” Calvasina said. “So far, so good. Better than feared, with no change to underlying demand. Companies are still managing through for the most part. Investors are punishing companies that aren’t, but they’re not punishing the whole market. The market seems very rational right now.”
*****
> For instance, Intel shares were pummeled, falling more than 11.6% on Friday, after the company’s sales missed expectations. Intel warned an industry-wide component shortage hurt its PC chip business. But other semiconductor stocks did not get pulled down in the decline. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF was down about 0.8%.
*****
> But Snap sent an industry-wide warning Thursday when its quarterly revenues missed expectations. The company reported that Apple’s privacy changes introduced earlier this year affected its advertising business. The company also said that advertisers were holding back due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages.
*****
> Facebook’s earnings on Monday will be closely watched for any similar comments, as will reports from Alphabet and Twitter Tuesday. The three stocks fell Friday as Snap plunged 26.6%. Facebook lost more than 5%.
*****
> “Facebook has been the more broken name. It had the Instagram problem. It had the kid problem. It’s had a hard time going up post-earnings. It will be interesting to see if all these problems are priced in or does it go even lower,” T3Live.com chief strategic officer Scott Redler said.
*****
> Redler said the Snap news was a big surprise, since traders viewed social media as immune to supply chain problems. Even though social media was under pressure as a whole Friday, he said stocks have been able to diverge within sectors recently.

> “Tesla was able to make a new high, and Netflix is at an all-time high. Every group has winners and losers, but overall the participation is better than it’s been in a while. Five stocks aren’t driving the S&P to the all-time highs,” he said. “It’s a bunch of stocks in every sector.”
*****
> Traders are now watching the Russell 2000, since a breakout in small caps would be a positive for the overall market, he said. Redler trades the the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) which closed slightly lower at $227.41 Friday. “If the IWM gets above the $230 to $234 area, it could be a signal for more risk on at the end of the year,” he said.
*****
> Redler said the market could be challenged in the coming week. “You just had a big 10-day move up. You would think there will be some digestion,” he said. “I don’t want to chase the market here. It feels like we could rest a little bit next week. If it could digest here, and we could get some individual stock movement, that would be healthier than the pain trade, which is straight up.”
*****
> There are a few important economic reports in the week ahead, including durable goods Wednesday; third-quarter GDP Thursday and personal consumption expenditures Friday. Friday’s data includes the PCE deflator, the preferred inflation gauge watched by the Federal Reserve.
*****
> # Higher interest rates
> The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield continued to edge higher in the past week, touching 1.70% before falling to 1.64% Friday. Market pros are watching to see if the yield will reach 1.74%, the closing high from March, and whether it will begin to worry stock investors. The 10-year yield hit this year’s intraday high of 1.776% on March 30.
*****
> “I would say over the next week or two, it’s possible we test it, but I would be a little surprised at this stage if it sustainably breaks through,” NatWest Markets’ John Briggs said. He noted that yields have been moving higher, as investors now anticipate the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates next year and as the market anticipates more inflation.
*****
> “I get a sense that people are more interested in buying here rather than selling,” he said. Bond yields move inversely to price. It could be a busy week in the market, as investors adjust for the end of the month
*****
> Briggs notes the front end, or the 2-year note yield, has moved faster than the longer end. He said that reflects the market’s increased expectation for rate hikes next year, with two hikes expected by the market in the second half of the year.

> # 9 Charts We Are Watching

> Here are a handful charts that caught our attention recently.

> Yesterday was the 34-year anniversary of the Crash of ’87. To this day market pundits still don’t quite agree on what caused the crash. As only Art Cashin can scribe, here were some of the worries at the time that lead to the more than 20% one-day crash on Black Monday: a historically overbought market (the S&P 500 Index was up more than 40% for the year in August); worries over a currency war with Germany; a historic storm in London that closed markets the Friday before the crash, concentrated selling on the New York Stock Exchange; First Lady Nancy Reagan possibly being admitted to the hospital with breast cancer; and even potential worries over engaging with Iran. At the end of the day, stocks up more than 40% for the year in August was likely much of the trigger, as that is a very stretched rubber band.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> The S&P 500 finally pulled back 5% a few weeks ago, after not doing so for nearly a year. But remember, the great majority of the stocks in the S&P 500 have already corrected at least 10%, with many down even more. This rolling correction has done a number on overall investor confidence though. According to the Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey, managers were the least bullish they’ve been since October 2020 and cash levels hit the highest level in 12 months. “It might be cliché to say, but many managers moved to cash on the 5% pullback, leaving plenty of cash on the sidelines to eventually push stocks higher again,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, historically the S&P 500 forms a major low near the end of October and has a nice rally to end most years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Blog-chart-3-10.20.21.png?ssl=1))**

> Building on the late October period, remember that the last few days of October and first few of November are historically one of the most bullish periods of the year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/blog-chart-4-10.20.21.png?ssl=1))**

> A post-election year tends to see stocks bottom a tad earlier in late September. So far, this year is following this template nicely.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**

> November is quietly one of the best months of the year. In fact, it is the best month since 1950 and over the past decade. The past 20 years it is the second best month and in post-election years it ranks second as well. “No matter how you slice it, November is known for turkeys, but maybe it should be known for bulls as well,” exclaimed Ryan Detrick.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-6.png?ssl=1))**

> The S&P 500 is less than half a percent away from its first new high since September 2. Remember, it has made a new high every single month so far this year. Should it make another new high in October it could remain on target to join 2014 as the only year to have a new high every single month.

> (Trivia stat – The S&P 500 peaked on September 2 in 2020 before a near 10% correction over the following weeks. This year it also peaked on September 2, but it is looking like 5% may be the most we’ll see to the downside this time.)

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.1.21-blog-chart-7.png?ssl=1))**

> Speaking of new all-time highs, the S&P 500 has made 54 so far this year, one of the most ever. The record of 78 appears to be safe, but with a late year rally this year could go down as the second most ever.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-7.png?ssl=1))**

> As we noted at the start of the month, stocks have historically done quite well in October during an odd numbered year—years without an election around the corner and no pre-election jitters. Well, 2021 is following suit once again, as the S&P 500 is already up nearly 5% for the month, which would be the best month of October for the index since 2015.

> # An Impressive 2021 So Far, But Flows Are Slowing

> Yesterday the Investment Company Institute updated weekly fund flow numbers for the US mutual fund and ETF industry. As shown in the chart below, total mutual fund flows were positive this year but compared to the performance of ETFs, the inflows have been only modest at best. ETFs have logged more than $700bn in inflows, and while mutual funds avoided a fourth straight net outflow, their $66bn in inflows wasn’t that impressive. Across mutual funds and ETFs, bonds have been the massive winner this year, with more than $500bn in inflows. Equity funds record outflows over time as a mechanical result of equity retirements, but this year inflows have been the largest since 2014 with more than $210bn in buying across mutual funds and ETFs. About a quarter of total equity fund inflows so far this year have been dedicated to funds buying the domestic stock market. That’s the best year for domestic equity fund flows since 2014, and breaks a string of five consecutive years of outflows, though net flows have been stable for months now.

> This analysis was first published last night in The Closer, Bespoke's end-of-day macro note.

> # Late October Is the To Time Buy Stocks

> As it is written in the 2021 Stock Trader’s Almanac on October 21 on page 97, late October is the time to buy depressed stocks, especially techs and small caps. In the chart here taken from page 112 of the 2021 Almanac we divide daily data for the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks by the Russell 1000 index of the largest stocks since July 1, 1979, and then compress into a one-year seasonal pattern from July to June. When the graph is descending large caps are outperforming small caps; when the graph is rising, small caps are moving up faster than large caps. This year has been rather typical.

> You will remember the November 2020 was a month for the record books for the Russell 2000. And then R2K topped out in March 2021 and has been lagging the big cap indexes since spring. Over the past couple of days the R2K appears to be perking up right on schedule. We just released a new small/mi-cap stock basket to subscribers in order to take advantage of the “Best Months” of the year (November through April/June) for stocks on the heels of our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal.

> # Road and Rail Soar Above Air Freight

> One major economic trend of the past several months has been supply chain constraints including logistics issues. Now in the throes of earnings season, earnings of companies related to supply chains and logistics (whether that be people or parcels) are beginning to roll in with four such names reporting in the past day alone: Kansas City Southern (KSU), United Airlines (UAL), Marten Transport (MRTN), and Knight-Swift Transportation (KNX). In the table below, we show all the S&P 1500 Transportation Industry stocks that have reported since late September. Most of these stocks have beaten estimates on the top and bottom line with a few exceptions. While it is the one furthest in the rearview now, FedEx (FDX) was perhaps the worst of these missing EPS estimates and lowering guidance. KNX, on the other hand, reported a triple play this morning; one of the first companies to do so thus far in earnings season.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102021-TRAN-Earn-1.png))**

> Two more transportation names, CSX (CSX) and Landstar System (LSTR), are also set to report earnings after the closing bell today, and over a dozen other names will follow up in the next week alone. These names could potentially be interesting areas to look for anecdotes regarding broader supply chain issues pressuring the economy, but turning to the stock price reactions, Saia (SAIA) has averaged the largest single-day gain on earnings averaging a 2.5% move across its 60 past earnings reports. Old Dominion (ODFL), Echo Global Logistics (ECHO), Hub Group (HUBG), and XPO Logistics (XPO) are the only others that have averaged greater than 1% gains in reaction to earnings. C.H. Robinson (CHRW) and Avis Budget (CAR), on the other hand, have historically averaged the worst reactions to earnings of this industry.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102021-TRAN-Earn.png))**

> While there are still plenty of companies within the industry left to report providing plenty of catalysts for moves, since the closing low on September 30th, the transports have seen solid performance with an 8.79% gain through today. That move has not only lifted the industry above its 50 and 200-DMAs but it has also broken the downtrend that has been in place since the spring. Currently, the group is still down 6.1% from its 52-week high.

> # 1-Year After 7-Month Winning Streak–S&P 500 Gains 6.37%

> Going back to 1950, S&P 500 has enjoyed 15 streaks of consecutive monthly gains lasting 7 or months. The most recent streak came to an end with September’s full-month decline. The longest consecutive monthly winning streak lasted 11 months and occurred twice, from September 1953 to July 1954 and from March 1958 to January 1959. S&P 500’s average gain during these monthly winning streaks has been a solid 25.86%. The smallest gain was 9.09% ending March 1993 while the largest was a whopping 53.53% ending in April 1983. When past streaks ended, S&P 500 performance following tended to be mixed and rather tepid compared to its performance during the winning streak. The month after the streak ends, 3-month, 6-month and 1-year after performance appears in the table above.

> # Sentiment Surge

> Over the past couple of weeks, the S&P 500 has reversed higher, and the index is now only a few basis points away from the September 2nd closing high. With the rally, sentiment has taken a sharp turn towards optimism. The AAII reading on bullish sentiment rose for a second week in a row, climbing 9 percentage points to 46.9%. That is the highest reading on bullish sentiment since the week of July 1.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-Bull.png))**

> While this week's increase was large, it comes on top of a double-digit rise last week. In total, bullish sentiment has climbed 21.4 percentage points in the past two weeks alone. That is the first time since November of last year that bullish sentiment has risen by at least 20 percentage points in two weeks. Going through the history of the survey, there have only been 17 other periods in which there were similar moves without another occurrence in at least six months. Overall, these instances have consistently seen the S&P 500 move higher in the following weeks and months with larger than normal average and median gains. That is except for one year out in which performance has been slightly worse than the norm.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-20-pp-1.png))**

> With the big jump in bullish sentiment recently, bearish sentiment has pulled back to 27.8%. That is the lowest reading since September 9th and the third week in a row in which bearish sentiment has moved lower.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-Bear.png))**

> With inverse moves to bullish and bearish sentiment, the bull-bear spread stayed in positive territory for the second week in a row as bulls outnumber bears by the widest margin since the first week of July.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

> Big gains to bulls also borrowed heavily from neutral sentiment as that reading fell from 30.3% to 25.4%. Similar to bearish sentiment, that is the lowest reading since early last month.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-Neutral.png))**

> As for some other readings on sentiment, the NAAIM Exposure index measuring investment managers' exposure to US equities has also made a significant move higher this week. Readings in this index range from -200 to 200 where (-)200 would indicate responding managers are leveraged long (short), (-)100 would be fully invested long (short), and a reading of zero would be market neutral. At the end of last month, the reading fell to a low of 55 which was the weakest level since May. While the past two weeks only saw modest improvements, this week there was a surge all the way up to 98. The 33.6 point increase ranks as the fifth-largest week over week moves on record in the index dating back to 2006.

My name is Peter Parker and you don't have the attention span to read the rest of that monologue so let's get this over with.

[If you haven't seen this movie yet, skip to the part where you buy calls and go watch it. It's fucking iconic.](https://preview.redd.it/1ec56lfwcou71.jpg?width=2303&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9c701f5655e9350c7f70b315a23c20e58384f24)

# Not A.S.S. (Another Space Spac)!

First off, I'm going to only briefly touch on the technical prospects of the company. I have been assured, by people who are much smarter than I am, that they are fucking great. Head over to r/RKLB and check out what the nerds think. Here are highlights that I've selected because I think they're cool:

* **Vertical Integration** \- They make all their own shit, in house. 3D printing? Yup. Custom robotics production? Yuup. This is responsible for-
* **Slashed Lead Time** \- For commercial purposes, they've cut the time it takes to get your social-creditscore monitoring CubeSat into orbit from years to ***weeks***^(\[1\]). Seriously.
* **Standard Setting Pricepoint** \- USD$5,000,000 gets whatever the fuck you want into orbit^(\[1\]). Compared to other options that cost $200,000,000 or more. *We could crowdsource like six of you degenerates and have that stupid Harambe statue off this planet and into orbit in less than a month.* That's fucking bananas.
* **Helicopter Retrieval of Rockets** \- After having demonstrated the reusability of their boosters, they're now experimenting with *mid-air* retrieval by helicopter^(\[2\]). They're dope and they do dope shit, okay?

Oh yeah, I almost forgot. If you take one thing away from this fever dream of a highschool essay, it's this:

* **THEY ARE AN ACTUAL, FUNCTIONING COMPANY THAT HAS CUSTOMERS WHO PAY THEM.**

This is something that *no other* space spac spork what-the-fuck-ever can boast, with one exception. They've delivered almost **two dozen successful payloads for NASA**, over one hundred satellites put into orbit successfully. **They've been working for giant names like NASA, Lockheed Martin and AeroJet Rocketdyne since 2018.** They have a button on their website that **you can click, and reserve a launch.**  Even Virgin Galactic ($SPCE) can't figure that part out.

Suck on that, Branson.

[No no, not these guys. AeroJet RocketDyne. The guys who work for the US DoE and made the nuclear generators for the Mars Rovers? \[3\]](https://preview.redd.it/h4xts6z2dou71.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eed61e7ac5d18382583b1771f6b654b0c109e579)

**The only comparable company is SpaceX.** Yes, *that* SpaceX.

# I Just Remembered SpaceX Exists, and Now I'm Uninterested.

But what about Elon, you ask? Surely the TechnoKing will use his superior intelligence, resources, suspiciously good hair and Meme Mastery to crush any competition? **Wrong.**

RocketLab doesn't want to directly compete. **They are servicing a specific niche, and being the best at it.** Their Electron rocket is small, efficient, agile. They may not get to carry the men to walk on Mars, but when Bezos needs another bottle of champagne aboard his Orbital Space Harem, or when the astronauts on the 2030 moonbase need fresh porno mags, they'll be there.

**Betting on RKLB isn't betting against Elon**, it's betting that that Elon and all these other big dick billionaires are gonna do what they're already doing; build the infrastructure necessary to leave the poors behind on this dirty, boiling rock.

# Okay, Now Tell Me a Different Thing.

I'm glad you asked! Introducing Peter Beck, CEO and founder. I'm not gonna suck the man's dick too hard, but let's set the record straight. He's not a businessman, he's not a pretty face, **he's a goddamn rocket scientist.**

He is not doing this to get rich. He is not doing this to be famous. He has been making rockets for nearly three decades because he *fucking loves rockets.* **RocketLab has pulled top-tier talent from global competitors** because this is the company you want to work for if you want to be on the bleeding edge of rocket tech.

There's a cute anecdote about his parents getting called to a grade-school counselor meeting to discuss his ""absurdly unachievable dreams"" of ""building rockets for a living"".

Oh, did I mention that he's a **Professor of Engineering** at the University of Auckland, **without having ever attended university?** ^(\[4\]) He just skipped the part where he drops out of college and went straight to the 'being a maverick' part. Fuck you, Zuckerberg. Fuck you, Gates.

**Peter Beck eats, breathes and shits rockets.**

[The stone cold stare of a serial killer.](https://preview.redd.it/mm8djq0bdou71.png?width=250&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1611a8b49600c35f63587c9b4040fe28bb26962)

# He Looks Like Fat Dennis Reynolds in That One Episode.

A little.

# Do You Really Think You Noticed Something Wall St Overlooked?

Yes.

This is a growth play. **This is a 15† year old company that** is good at what they do, and are getting better. RocketLab **has completed investment into upscaling their infrastructure** to meet growing demand^(\[5\]).

They have a proven track record. They have first mover advantage. They have the financial backing of major players. **They have rockets that work.** I really can't stress how unique that is.

There's an incredible amount of risk associated with space and space accessories. If you had looked at Apple in the nineties as a struggling computer company, you might have missed the story about Steve Jobs' singular and impressive passion for being a demented control freak^(\[6\]). **This is a story about vision and dedication, and also rockets.**

[Yeah, yeah. I'm not a big charts guy, sue me.](https://preview.redd.it/a5lholwfdou71.png?width=1283&format=png&auto=webp&s=755686c4dedd425fd8e0f9760af835fbc9129109)

# This Chart Looks Like A Regular De-SPAC PnD, tho?

Admittedly, the chart looks gross, and not just because it's yahoo. This chart in particular however, is a filthy little liar.

**RocketLab was taken public via de-SPAC about a month ago.** I think you can guess where. Because of all the weird activity and the small time frame, a lot of useful indicators are wonky here. In spite of all this, **I think now is an excellent time to start building a RKLB position.** Surprise, surprise.

In terms of getting dumped on further, downside risk is mitigated as **RocketLab has recently unlocked the PIPE shares and filed an S1-A to offer shares at $16**^(\[7\]).

RocketLab also had very high Short Interest until recently. **Cost to borrow dropped from over 100% to below 40% in the last few days**^(\[8\]), which would seem to indicate Shorts are interested in covering at these levels. As of writing, **RSI has broken below 40** which would indicate it is leaning towards, if not already, oversold.

**In terms of potential upside, they have earnings and two rocket launches scheduled in November**. Remember, these aren't tests. They're putting functional satellites into orbit for BlackSky^(\[9\]). Additionally, **early investors are incentivized to keep the price high** as they get additional equity paid out if the stock stays above $20 for twenty days out of thirty^(\[7\]) before the end of March.

These launches are going to be great publicity as **RocketLab is gaining a critical mass of attention**. If we get even one-tenth of the speculative valuation that Tesla has, I will be a very rich man.

# Okay, But What If I'm A Bear?

If you are worried about inflation, Chinese fuckery, the debt ceiling, energy crises, World War III or the boogey man, then I'm not sure why you're reading about speculative tech growth companies that build expensive, highly combustible space trebuchets.

RocketLab is subject to the whims and vagaries of the market just like everything else. If the apocalypse starts, I'm not worried about money.

**I am very bullish.** I will remind you that **nothing has fundamentally changed about any of these bearish narratives yet we are approaching SPY ATH**. Stonks only go up. Twerk cock, fist on chest, no fear, etc.

# tl;dr

I Like Space. 🚀🚀🚀

# Disclaimers and Positions

# [Dow futures jump 160 points as investors bet strong profits will continue to lift market](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures gained on Tuesday as major companies continued to report strong third-quarter earnings, easing concerns that persistent Covid cases and rising costs would derail corporate America’s profit recovery.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed about 164 points, or 0.5%. S&P 500 futures added 0.5% and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.4%.
*****
> The Dow and the S&P 500 come into Tuesday both sitting about 1% from record highs.
*****
> Dow member Travelers saw its shares gain more than 3% in the premarket after the insurance company’s quarterly earnings report topped expectations.
*****
> Fifth Third Bancorp shares ticked up in early morning trading after its profit and revenue beat Wall Street estimates.
*****
> Procter & Gamble continued the bullish trend with better-than-expected earnings, but its shares dipped more than 1% in premarket trading. The consumer products giant said it is raising prices to cover rising commodity and freight costs and warned that inflation may continue.
*****
> Johnson & Johnson also beat third-quarter earnings expectations by 25 cents per share, but saw its shares dip in early morning trading.
*****
> Elsewhere, Walmart shares gained around 2% in the premarket after Goldman Sachs added the big box retailer to its conviction buy list, saying the stock could rally nearly 40%.
*****
> As of Tuesday morning, 82% of S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings beat expectations, according to FactSet. Taking into account those reports and estimates for those to come, third-quarter profit growth will come in at 30%, according to FactSet.
*****
> Other major reports after the bell Tuesday include Netflix and United Airlines.
*****
> On Monday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite notched their fourth day of gains. The S&P 500 rose 0.34%. The Nasdaq was the relative outperformer, gaining 0.84% as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet all closed higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 36 points, dragged down by a 3% drop in Disney’s stock.
*****
> While reports have been strong, investors are looking for commentary from corporate America about supply chain issues and inflation.
*****
> “The financials got earnings season off to another strong start, but let’s be honest, COVID and supply chain issues aren’t going to impact this group. Now it gets very interesting to see what other industries will have to say about the health of the economic recovery,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.
*****
> Netflix could set the tone for technology earnings this season. Three months ago, the streaming giant forecasted paid net subscriber adds of 3.5 million, while analysts expect about 3.84 million, according to StreetAccount. Analysts are also forecasting fourth-quarter subscriber guidance of 8.5 million, which would be the highest outlook since the first quarter of 2019.
*****
> Shares of Netflix have traded lower on six of its last seven earnings releases.
*****
> Earnings from United Airlines should give investors a gauge on the travel recovery from the pandemic and Procter & Gamble earnings could show how strong the consumer is in the goods sector.
*****
> Stocks are coming off of a winning week but have been volatile since September. Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist Mike Wilson — who has been calling for a correction in the broader market — told clients on Monday that although fundamentals are deteriorating, the market seems to be resilient to a bigger pullback.
*****
> “Whether we end up getting this finishing move at the index level this year or not will depend largely on retail participation, the message that 3Q earnings brings from a guidance standpoint, and the path of PMIs into year end,” said Wilson.
*****
> Economic data from China weighed on investor sentiment after it reported low GDP and industrial production for September that fell short of expectations. Industrial production in the U.S. also fell for September as supply constraints continued to hinder manufacturing, the Federal Reserve reported Monday.

qar6j5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qar6j5/hedging_against_a_market_crash_2008_all_over_again/,"Hedging against a Market Crash, 2008' all over again",495,362,2021-10-19 01:14:17,"Hey everyone,

I did put a lot of research into the current situation for quite some time and finally build a portfolio I am 100% behind long-term. However, the more I learned, the more sure I am that we will experience a market crash rather soon, than late.

I am not here to debate whether or not you think this is true, but the situation for this thought game is that we might see a crash similar in numbers, **not principle** like 2008' all over again. In general, during times of high inflation, most businesses will not come out well. The earnings will go up, but they need to put more money into their own business to even stay in the same place. A hedge for this are companies that can easily scale their business without needing money flow. I am looking at you Facebook, who can place 10% more ads, Adobe who can increase their product price without fear of losing customers, Apple, Microsoft...

The theory behind this discussion would assume that GameStop is a good hedge, I even heard that from the high ups in a very big, German bank, which is incredibly weird since they were against it months ago and did not even want to talk about it in the first place. This assumes that the crash is happening because of said theory I explained below in short. It does not mean that a high percentage of the entire portfolio should persist of them, but a chunk just in case might be a very good idea. The market is more complex than many think.

Another hedge and long term hold can not be mentioned in this sub, but you might guess what it is. Sadly, we cant debate this here. Has to do with weird blocks and tokens, latter of which might change the whole gaming industry and I am thankfully in the position where I can take constant profits from it in percentages that sound absolutely insane.

So, in case of this **theoretical** scenario, I would like to get everyone's opinion on this. I want to be clear, I value every single opinion and would love the most input possible. In case of no crash, my investments should grow steadily, but in case of a crash due to named circumstance, they would skyrocket. Again, this is purely theoretical, I do not want to discuss whether or not it is happening, but what you would do in case it will happen in the near future.

&#x200B;

**TLDR: How would you hedge against a potential market crash ala 2008' (similar in numbers, not principle) due to Evergrande + GameStop and the overall market situation?**

*I will add the theory behind GameStop again, even though most of you might know this already.*

*The theory: Most part of the stock is traded in Dark Pools and some shorting Hedge Funds are telling us that they closed their position, which is mathematically impossible. Do the research yourself. What I think is happening, is that all the shorts are actually synthetic and not real shares. There is tons and tons of proof of it, too much to even deny at this point. They exercise and sell deep ITM calls in order to get the FTDs. So basically, they are passing them from one to another, to another.*  
***The endless cycle:***  
*Person 1: Exercise deep ITM calls > Person 2: Sells deep ITM calls > Person 3: Sells shares > Person 4: met his FTD > Person 5: Exercise deep ITM calls  > Person 6: Sells deep ITM calls > …*

***Explanation for Golden Retriever:***  
*Think of it like this, a good analogy; You get a credit card with 10.000$ on it, max it out and have to repay the debt next month. However, you have endless credit cards, so you can get another credit card and ""pay"" the 10.000$ with that. The debt is still there, its just getting passed. You can do that forever. Now you need more money, so you do this all over again and keep digging the grave deeper and deeper. In this theory, multiple times the float and continuing. In order to stop that, you have to lock the float entirely, which is why everyone is currently directly registering their shares.* ***IF*** *this is true, I do not have to explain the potential outcome. There is simply too much proof.*

*Computershare confirmed this.*  
*Quote from their Twitter: ""Shares held directly on the books of US companies through a transfer agent are not held at DTCC. As such, shares are not available to be loaned for any means within the security markets. Computershare is a registered transfer agent, therefore does not lend shares in any capacity.""*

*Cheers, have a nice week everyone!*"

# [4 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-monday-oct-18.html)

*****

> # 1. Wall Street set to start the week lower after Friday’s rally

> * Dow futures dropped nearly 150 points Monday ahead of a busy week for corporate earnings against the backdrop of increasing U.S. oil prices and a tick-up in bond yields. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rallied Friday and for all of last week.
> * The Dow was less than 1% from its Aug. 16 record close. The S&P 500 was nearly 1.5% away from its Sept. 2 record close. The Nasdaq was 3.1% from its Sept. 7 record close.
> * The flood of earnings takes a pause Monday but picks back up Tuesday with Netflix, Johnson & Johnson, United Airlines and Procter & Gamble reporting.
> * So far, 41 S&P 500 companies have delivered third-quarter results, with 80% of them topping EPS expectations, according to data from FactSet.
> * Taking into account those already out and estimates for the rest, third-quarter profit growth would total 30%, the third-highest quarterly profit growth rate for S&P 500 firms since 2010, according to FactSet.

*****

> # 2. WTI tops $83 per barrel; bond yields move higher

> * U.S. oil prices, as measured by West Texas Intermediate crude, jumped another 1%, topping $83 per barrel, their highest level since October 2014. Behind the march higher are continued recovering demand as Covid-depressed business activity picks up, and as high natural gas and coal prices encourage a switch to fuel oil and diesel for power generation. WTI was already up three straight sessions and surged 3.7% last week for its eighth positive week in a row, the best weekly winning streak May 2015.

> * The 10-year Treasury yield started the week moving back up toward 1.62%. Before topping those levels earlier this month, the last time it was that high was in June. The 10-year yield, which moves inversely to price, was boosted Friday after data showed that U.S. retail sales rose by 0.7% in September, versus an expected decline of 0.2%. Industrial production figures for September are out at 9:15 a.m. ET, with estimates calling for a 0.2% increase following a 0.4% jump in August.

*****

> # 3. China GDP disappoints, third-quarter growth slows to 4.9%

> * China’s third-quarter gross domestic product grew a disappointing 4.9% from a year ago as industrial activity in the world’s second-largest economy rose less than expected in September.

> * Many factories had to stop production in late September as a surge in the price of coal and a shortage of electricity prompted local authorities to abruptly cut off power. The struggles of giant developer China Evergrande came to the forefront in August. Real estate and related industries account for about a quarter of China’s GDP, according to Moody’s estimates.

*****

> # 5. Apple likely to finish transforming its MacBook lineup

> * Apple is holding a launch event Monday to announce new products, likely including a redesigned MacBook Pro. The company has a chance to drive continued momentum to its Macs ahead of the holiday shopping season, especially since it’s expected to announce more computers that run on its own chips instead of Intel’s processors. Last month, Apple announced and subsequently released new iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches, leaving Macs as the remaining major product line that hasn’t been updated this fall. Apple is also likely to provide a release date for macOS Monterey, the latest version of Mac software, which was announced in June but has not yet been officially released.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/wallstreetbets?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Monday, October 18th, 2021! :)**"
qaj5ul,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qaj5ul/how_to_pick_big_movers_the_importance_of_adr_how/,How To Pick BIG MOVERS 🚀 - The Importance of ADR & How To Use It.,153,22,2021-10-18 17:27:51,"**What is ADR and ATR:**

The ADR of a stock is calculated using the daily lows and daily highs over a certain period of time to give you an average “Average daily range” for that specific stock. This is usual set at either 10 or 20 days, I personally use the 20 day average for a more accurate representation. This is shown via a percentage basis.

The ATR is the same calculation except it’s shown on a dollar basis.

**Below are two examples:**

1. **$SOFI – Sofi Technologies**

ADR = 5.4%

ATR = $0.89

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/anppf1h0g6u71.png?width=2151&format=png&auto=webp&s=2810d45dbc2e23f1de4a8a71e6194ab65d5efeca

So in this example the average daily range, the difference between high and lows on $SOFI is 5.4% and/or 89 cents.

**2. $AAPL – Apple Inc**

ADR = 1.8%

ATR = $2.74

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z22clw21g6u71.png?width=2151&format=png&auto=webp&s=a22b1e8a1bd62910b3adabe4241d1ab6c7da232c

So in this example the average daily range, the difference between high and lows on $AAPL is 1.8% and/or $2.74 cents.

**Why is the ADR important?**

As traders it’s our job to find stocks which have the potential to make strong moves over a relatively short period of time. To do this we need to focus on names which have the characteristics to make a strong move which can therefore represent a strong gain.

In examples 1 & 2 lets take a hypothetical scenario. Let’s assume both names are set up for a breakout and both names have received news of equal weight. our plan for the trade is to buy an opening drive move (buy an opening rip).

In both positions we purchase $10,000 worth of stock and risk the low of that opening drive.

Due to the news catalyst both stocks move 2x their normal range due to an increase in volume and attention (very common).

**The results:**

1. SOFI with an ADR of 5.4% therefore moves 10.8% leaving us with a gain of $1,080
2. AAPL with an ADR of 1.8% therefore moves 3.6% leaving us with a gain of $360

Both stocks made the same equivalent move (2 times their daily average) yet example 1 was always the better pick due to it’s potential to provide a far more significant gain. During a swing trade which you may be positioned in for days/weeks the name with the higher ADR is far more likely to provide you with a much better return. Meaning your investment/capital is put to work in a far stronger position.

However it’s not simply a case of the higher the better as fundamentals and technicals matter. Some stocks will have a high ADR because they are pumped and dumped on a regular basis. To showcase this let’s take a look at two names with similar ADRs.

1. $SI – Silvergate Corporation. This company has strong fundamentals with good growth and a healthy balance sheet. The daily chart is also clean with a strong daily formation building into all time highs. It has an ADR of 8%. It respects both the 200 and 10ma showing the ability to make large and clean moves.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/el3lsgg2g6u71.png?width=2178&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f56c34ed87b56a9605828ff9b1468be6eccba0b

2. LM funding . This company has literally no revenue and no growth over the past two years. The daily chart also shows nothing but pump and dumps on a regular basis. This name has a 10.47% ADR.

As you can see, the second example only has a high ADR from high aggressive pumps which are immediately sold into. The graph showcases the previous 2 years of movement. These are the exact names you want to avoid unless you’re a day trader with a short bias.

**Avoiding Bad Plays:**

One of the large misconceptions with beginner traders are that penny stocks provide a better chance of large percentage/monetary gains. More often that not this couldn’t be any further from the truth. For this example we’re going to compare two speculative names to keep things fair. Both names have almost no revenue and are therefore considered as speculative plays.

1. $NNDM – Nano Dimension. This was and is one of the most watched penny stocks across social media and amateur traders. With Cathie woods ark Invest taking a position last year and the hype around 3d Printing. Now I’m not here to discuss whether it’s a good company or not, we’re hear to talk trading.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nhumc9e4g6u71.png?width=2151&format=png&auto=webp&s=1edc9f7a851cdc57af2328d964cf5290d59bbaa6

Since early February 2021 this stock has been in a downtrend with any moves higher being aggressively sold into. The volume has decreased on a weekly and daily basis which tells us there’s very little attention on the name and therefore it’s very unlikely we’ll see any worthwhile movement soon. There is also currently no hype in or surrounding the sector. It’s current stock price is $5.60 and has an ADR of 4.47%

2. Lithium America. Another speculation name which has received quite a lot of attention across social media and amateur traders, however there’s a huge difference. Firstly the chart isn’t trending lower but the complete opposite as it attempts to break into all time highs. Secondly the volume is increasing which shows attention to the name is increasing and therefore a big move is likely (one has recently happened, we traded it). Thirdly there is a large amount of hype in the sector with similar names also being bought and gaining attention. The current price of this stock is $25.43 and the ADR on this stock is 6.73%

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vtzmek86g6u71.png?width=2151&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6b24530c5cbc8aee62c5ddd56d64a8bf42aec5a

So in this example we have two speculative stocks both with little to no revenue. However the Penny stock NNDM has a downtrending chart, no hype, no volume and therefore almost no chance of breaking out.Lithium America on the other hand has a very strong chart, lots of volume, increase hype and therefore a great chance of breaking out.

It’s irrelevant if you have $500 to invest or $500,000 as Lithium America in this example on any given day will provide a larger move and better return than NNDM. Not to mention that the likelihood of the move happening on Lithium America is far greater due to the points outlined.

**Using ADR to determine entry.**

The ADR can also be used to avoid bad entries using the simple mathematics and change of probability. If you’re looking to get into a name which has had no news, no increase in volume and isn’t set to breakout then you’ll want to avoid entering if it’s already close to 1 ADR.

Based on averages and the law of probability it’s extremely likely that in that scenario you’ll be entering at the high of the day.

The opposite to this is a strong name that’s holding its trend is reaching 1 ADR to the downside. If all other factors look good then the law of probability states you’re likely buying at the low of the day.

On aggressive breakouts and large catalysts such as earnings we can use the ADR to determine where we take profits or when we may avoid a late entry.

It's not uncommon for large catalysts like a big earnings beat to provide 3-5 ADR's on the first day. You can therefore once again use the data to determine the probability of continuation and a good/bad entry.

**In Summary:**

We use ADR to filter out the names which have the potential to provide us with a significant move. However they must also have a clean technical chart with some form of growth and/or growth potential. The ADR is the key number to go by

Ideally you want to see a minimum of 3% ADR and ideally something within the 5-10% range."

You may notice the rise in all stocks generally.

Tech stocks such as NVDA and AMD is what i am watching right now.

NVDA up 2.8% and AMD up 2.5% meanwhile, TSM is only up 2.3%

No real news reported to make NVDA and AMD rise. TSM reported better than expected earnings and they lack behind the rest of the sector.

I believe TSM will gain market share in the following weeks due to its trading pattern. I believe we may see this touching $130 - $140 range in the next few weeks.

Here is a comparison between Walgreens today and TSM today. I believe we will see the same thing soon.

People do not realize, TSM is known for manufacturing the high tech Semiconductors for things such as your cell phone and Apple watches.

TSM had reported a 20% increase in the chips due to the shortage in the auto sector.

With a annual dividend payment of $1.87 yearly, solid future. I would not be surprised if this becomes a 1 trillion dollar company.

Building new factories in Arizona, and finding an agreement to build another on in Japan with Sony. This appears to be a solid lifetime stock.

I've done some DD on a company trending right now, and I may have figured out a scam/trick an hedge fund is pulling off. Would like to share my findings and have opinions on how to play this.

The hedge fund in question is [Hudson Bay Capital](https://www.hudsonbaycapital.com/) (HBC). According to [Fintel](https://fintel.io/i/hudson-bay-capital-management-lp), they have about $8.2B in AUM.

I cannot mention the company, as:

\- based on quick calculations, they never reached the $1.5B market cap threshold, and are hence (appropriately) qualified per WSB rules as ""worthless securities that are susceptible to scams or pump & dump schemes"".

\- otherwise every single person on WSB would load up on puts or do whatever shit.

Anyway, if you have minimal research skills you'll guess/find what I'm talking about.

I'll call it Company X for this post. Company X has no meaningful revenue, and does nothing but lose money. In the management team, there's a guy who recently settled for fraud, for his involvement in another company (which recently collapsed). The stock used to have a total market cap of \~$20M, right now, after massive dilution (5x O/S in a few months), shares are trading higher and the total market cap is \~$650M.

Company X has recently engaged in a flurry of M&A, spinoffs and whatever else, creating potential ""catalysts"". It's also heavily promoted by well known Twitter personalities. Not having the cash to fund such endeavors, they started issuing convertible notes.

And here Hudson Bay comes into play. The hedge fund offered hundreds of millions $ to Company X in convertible notes with short expiration (note: company revenue \~$2.5M). Other warrants have been offered to them and, to a lesser extent, to other firms.

As Company X doesn't make money, but spends a decent bit, they are now asking shareholders to approve early exercise of all warrants.

[Very few warrants issued](https://preview.redd.it/klsmw8osdat71.png?width=1952&format=png&auto=webp&s=be05f5c47aaaef87e2deb4297a048b6437673087)

Pointing out that, without that, the company would be in a tough situation (and realistically the M&A activities might be gone):

[A little nudge on the vote](https://preview.redd.it/8x22vcgvdat71.png?width=1951&format=png&auto=webp&s=301d2009cac271eafba87f072a47ec3d44608311)

Hudson Bay Capital would have, including the convertible note, warrants for about 120M shares, which is more than the current O/S total (\~100M). Dumping such truckload of shares wouldn't be feasible, with current volumes. Hence, I suspect they are pulling of a magic financial trick called

# Warrant hedging

I know, what the hell is this, who the fuck trades warrants, etc. Warrants are basically call options, but they're issued by the company, hence the money would go straight to them if exercised. Warrant hedging means:

\- you hold a warrant at $10

\- you place a short at $20

\- your position is hedged. No matter where the price goes, you locked in a risk free profit. It's also an unsqueezable short, since you can't get margin called.

The moment such warrants are exercised, you cash out of your position with $10 in profit, the company cashes in $10 from the warrant, and shareholders are left holding the bag.

There are a series of things that make me suspect such strategy is being employed. The first is that the SI has gone nowhere but up lately, despite the supposed ""squeeze"" and the subsequent tanking. It's worth noting that high SI has been recently attracting flocks of retail traders, hoping for squeeze profits. Price action would look manipulated: whenever the share price approaches the warrant level, volume dries up until there's a rebound, often ""catalyst"" triggered. Then huge volume, price goes flat/down, rinse and repeat.

HBC can place a de-facto risk free short anytime the price is above the warrants (lowest is $2.655). This leads to a situation in which they could, in principle, short a ton of Company X stock, wake up on the day after the early exercise is approved, and cover their position by exercising their warrants. No messed up price action, which they'd get if they were to dump their position, just a sudden spike in O/S.

There are a few instances in which this may not be the case:

\- HBC actually plans to dump their position after early exercise is allowed. Whatever.

\- HBC plans to hold >$700M, close to 10% of their portfolio, in a single low cap stock with no revenue and dubious management. This would dwarf their [current largest positions](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/hudson-bay-capital-management-l-p) ($INFO and $AAPL).

\- shareholders vote against the proposal. This opens up a pandora box of deals falling apart, and potential default, for Company X.

Considering that, in principle, the last could happen and create some turbulence, and looking at a SI of \~20-25%, I would think HBC is employing this strategy for a decent chunk, but not all, of their holdings.

Last thing to note: the company has placed another ""catalyst"" (spinoff) one week after the vote, possibly to encourage retail not to offload their shares. This was originally planned for the day after the vote, but has since been postponed. It would help the hedge fund dump the rest of the shares.

The question now is: **how do you play this shit?**

I bought some puts, was swimming in the green, getting hammered this week. Would you think puts for the spinoff week would work? Puts for this Friday? A month from now?

And especially, could the warrant hedging just balloon the O/S without any meaningful price action when exercised? In which case, my puts would be fucked?

That's all, thanks for coming to my TED talk

tl;dr : the Hudson Bay Capital hedge fund is pulling off some serious fuckery"

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-wednesday-oct-13.html)

*****

> # 1. Wall Street looks to avoid a four-session losing streak

> * U.S. stock futures were essentially flat Wednesday after Dow stock JPMorgan Chase reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue and ahead of key inflation data. Shares of JPMorgan rose modestly in the premarket as third-quarter results from the bank were supported by a $1.5 billion boost from better-than-expected loan losses.

> * The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq all dropped Tuesday for the third straight session. The modest losses indicated that investors were in a wait-and-see mode ahead of earnings season really kicking into high gear.

> * Shares of Delta Air Lines dipped in the premarket after the carrier on Wednesday reported that third-quarter earnings and revenue topped expectations. It was Delta’s first quarterly profit without taking federal aid into account since the start of the pandemic. However, it was still below 2019 pre-Covid levels.

*****

> # 2. Supply chain woes, rising costs may make for rocky earnings

> * Supply chain issues, labor shortages and higher energy prices are making this a very difficult quarter to model. As of Tuesday, 22 companies that are early reporters beat estimates by 11%, according to Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout. While this is above the traditional beat of 3% to 5%, it’s far below the average of prior quarters this year, including the roughly 18% beat for the second quarter. Third-quarter estimates, which had been rising steadily for months, have stopped in the last few weeks.

*****

> # 3. September consumer prices expected to remain high

> * The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 1.57% on Wednesday ahead of what’s expected to be another elevated inflation report. The government at 8:30 a.m. ET releases the September consumer price index. Economists expect headline CPI and core CPI, which excludes the food and energy sectors, to be around the prior month’s year-over-year increases of 5.3% and 4%, respectively. The Federal Reserve at 2 p.m. ET releases minutes from its policy meeting in September when central bankers indicated they expect to begin reducing monthly asset purchases “soon,” but did not say when.

*****

> # 4. White House aims to help key West Coast ports stay open 24/7

> * President Joe Biden will unveil a plan Wednesday to try to ease West Coast port backlogs by expanding round-the-clock operations. The Port of Los Angeles is expected to announce a shift to 24/7 operations, following a similar transition by the Port of Long Beach in California last month. Central to this plan to ease supple chain disruptions are commitments by some of the nation’s leading retailers and shippers, including FedEx, UPS, Walmart and Home Depot, to increase overnight and off-hours operations at the ports to get the goods to market. Together, the ports account for about 40% of the shipping containers entering the United States.

*****

> # 5. U.S. to reopen land borders in November for fully vaccinated

> * The U.S. said Wednesday it will reopen its land borders to nonessential travel next month, ending a 19-month freeze due to Covid as the nation moves to require all international visitors to be vaccinated. Vehicle, rail and ferry travel between the U.S. and Canada and Mexico has been largely restricted to essential travel since the earliest days of the pandemic. The latest move follows last month’s announcement that the U.S. will end country-based travel bans for air travel and instead require Covid shots for foreign nationals seeking to enter by plane.

q0yzmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q0yzmv/why_sofi_will_be_buying_my_wife_and_me_a_new/,Why SOFI will be buying my wife and me a new boyfriend,136,51,2021-10-04 13:17:31,"Just as a rough comparison, if SOFI follows a P/E ratio along the lines of Square's PE history:

Sofi CEO has talked about being proftable for 2023 at 27c a share with a goal of 36c a share for 2024.

As Square turned profitable it's PE ratio got as high as 400 at one point (Dec 2020 with stock price at 218ish).

The PE ratio has fallen to the 200 area as profits have grown despite a relatively significant slow down in stock price. Stock has moved up to the $250 area (roughly a 13% increase from Dec 2020) while their PE ratio has fallen 50%.

So...if we get to a 400 PE ratio with SOFI as they turn profitable at 27c a share, and it falls to 200 as they grow to 36c we're looking a target price range of $108 to $72 depending on which scenario you want to look at. This only takes us to the end of 2024. 

If you want to look farther out (2025) and build in:

1) Continued exponential growth as their user base continues to sky rocket.

2) Their cross selling ""flywheel"" effect has multiple years of history behind it.

3) The bank charter would be 4 years in the past and have 4 years of CERTAINTY behind it (what ever that certainty actually turns out to be) instead of forward looking hopes and projections.

4)Covid FUD is (hopefully) in the past as we improve treatments, or generally just become numb to it. The economy will generally be closer to ""normal"".

5) SOFI will have maybe (likely imo) made further acquisitions of other companies... creating a wider funnel that feeds their user base.

6) They are currently appealing to a younger crowd. One of their main focuses once they get their bank charter will be to push for direct deposit pay checks. I see no reason they won't go balls deep on that push, and give all kinds of incentives to bring people into their ecosystem. These younger people (who will be very attracted to the soon to be offered things like ""Get $100 worth of free stock when you sign up for direct deposit"") will be 4 years older by 2025. Which leads to #6

6) Their (currently) younger user base starts aging into a demographic that wants to start buying homes. All the while SOFI has spent years improving on and expanding their options for trading stocks, butcoin, options ect.

I'm picturing SOFI's long term set of goals similar to creating a banking culture like Apple has with their products. Apple's product (in general) are not always the very best of the very best at what they do. They are great, but there is usually something better for a specific job, however, if you fully commit to the Apple brand and only buy Apple products, they all work TOGETHER better than trying to piece meal together a bunch of different brands.

By appealing to a younger crowd (starting with refi of student loans), on-board more younger people with Direct Deposit, get them checking and savings accounts and now be able to use those deposits for loaning back out at higher margins than they currently can as a 3rd party, give these younger clients education and get them investing in stocks, get them credit cards that are essentially backed up by their stocks, checking or savings accounts, offer ""rewards"" for using these credit cards like:
""1% cash back if redeemed towards your card balance, 1.5% when used toward purchase of stocks, or 2.0% when used to reduce the balance on your student loan, or 2.2% when deposited into this special savings account that can only be used as a down payment towards a home if you finance that home with us""

And then get them into some home loans. 

I normally am not a long term buy and hold guy. But I really like the leadership, the current moves they are making, the rough draft of long term goals I've been able to find, and the idea of a financial 'ecosystem' of clients that resembles something like Apple....this is the type of stuff that gets me hard enough that my wife canceled her date with her boyfriend and spent some quality time with me instead. 

I backed the truck up on this at $16.00 a share. I normally try to keep 4 to 8 stocks that I like for the next 4 to 12 weeks and then keep about 50% of my portfolio in option spreads. But I'm down to 5% in options and something like 80% of my account is in SOFI. 

I can see this going to $160 by the end of 2025 or 2026. Granted, it's not the type of return you'd get on a successful FD play. But a 10x over 4ish years...? On a stock that I'm totally sold on and have high confidence in...? I'll fucking take it. 

Add all this to the recent 1.1 billion funding deal? Jesus fucking Christ, I dont know how much more an Ape can ask for. 

They previously stated that once they got their charter they would dedicate around 750 million to funding that bank and future loans, and now...around the same time that we are expecting the announcement that the charter is official, they secure a deal for a net of about 800 million in fresh capital. 

Gross was about 1.1 billion at zero percent interest. They have the option to repay this loan with stocks and the exhange rate is about 42 shares per $1,000 of principle. As I read it, it doesnt matter what the share price is on the market, this loan values them at around $24, but if they run to $100 then it's still 42 shares per $1000, but SOFI has the option to pay in cash OR shares.

 Also, to avoid diluting the stock, they spent around 110 million buying privately negotiated ""Cap Call Options"".  They are currently obligated to repay every $1,000 borrowed with something around 42 shares (hence the $24 value) but if the stock goes above this. SOFI has options contracts in place that cap that value at $32....because the loan is repayable on shares and has nothing to do with the market value of the shares. So by buying the options they cap the max profit their investors will make....and they used proceeds from the loan to pay for those options. So basically these investors loaned them 1.1 billion and said ""you can pay us back with your stock that is currently at $16 as if it's at $24"" and SOFI said ""Okay, but we're buying Call Contracts at $32 so the most you'll make is $8 more than that rate.""

Why do these ""sophisticated investors"" seem so eager to jump into a zero interest loan and assign a 50% premium to the stock they are getting paid back with? 

So...I'm balls deep and in for the hold

But I'm just some Ape on reddit. Not financial advice. Find your own way to blow up your account because this one is mine.

Just a little something to sweeten the pot: Citadel and GS are currently short over 3 million shares between them and SI has almost doubled in the last month. Still only 5% of float, but always a good time sticking it some of our old friends. This rallies even just to $30 and these fuckers are likely down 50% to 100% on this play."

You can find examples on YouTube.

Let’s kill some time by doing the same with stocks/companies: pick one or a few and describe them badly. Note that this is for humor and not seriousness. I’ll start…

AAPL - You’ll continue buying the same crap we put out, so why innovate?

ADBE - Let your creativity loose. Just pay us a subscription price to do so.

AMZN - We’re not satisfied with world domination. Space is next.

BRK.B - Because you’re too poor to afford BRK.A.

FB - We know all your secrets.

GOOG - We know even more of your secrets than FB.

INTC - We used to be the kings of our class. Then we took an arrow from AMD.

LMT - War makes us orgasm.

MSFT - Milking the same OS for almost four decades.

Many are asking if GM is using WEJO([GPS data platform](https://www.wejo.com/)) for its ULTIFI platform ([software platform](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/general-motors-new-software-platform-ultifi-is-coming-to-vehicles-starting-in-2023/) ) instead of Blackberry Ivy ([intelligent vehicle data platform](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws))

The clear and straight forward answer is NO! WEJO and AUTONOMO ([here](https://otonomo.io/)) only provide GPS type and location data. They both LICENSE data from OEM and sell it to whoever wants to use. This data is NOT processed in cars using machine learning models or in cloud learning models.  the ULTIFI platfrom is bigger than just GPS coordinate data...the GM ULTIFI platform needs data from all 300+ sensors in car. 

[Blackberry Ivy](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-ivy-to-provide-secure-vehicle-based-payments) is a pipeline that sucks in data from over 300 sensors in each car. It then processes it right on the edge (in car chips) and then creates a AI model to use in real time by car APPS and then it also uploads that model in the cloud for other app developers to use. All this data is owned by OEM and they can decide who to give it. Blackberry ivy is NOT just GPS but camera videos to seat sensors to wiper sensors to accelerator sensors to gas sensors to battery sensors to turn signals etc!!! it's mother of all sensors processing platforms. 

The software platform that GM launched (ULTIFI) is coming out in 2023 models the same time Blackberry IVY is coming out. GM is using Blackberry IVY for the data pipeline and providing it to their own app developers and then eventually will open up to other outisders...just like apple store and android play store. 

Blackberry ivy can sit on BB QNX operating system, BB QNX Hypervisor, Linux, anywhere!!! GM is using LINUX for ULTIFI platform to blackberry IVY will sit in there processing thee data. The QNX is embedded in pretty much every car sensor's chips (AMD,Qualcomm, etc) so each sensor has the ability to process all this data in realtime and apply machine learning to it for insight. 

&#x200B;

So yes the final answer is GM ULTIFI software platform is using Blackberry Ivy!!!! This is bigger than anything...this is huge. First big customer of BB Ivy."

How does GameStop justify it's valuation of over $10B in market cap, while threats to it's core business accelerate? Console manufacturers are moving to digital delivery instead of physical games (38% of GME revenue). Meanwhile physical consoles, which make up over 49% of GME revenue, is only sold on 4 year cycles--and sold at all competing retailers.

Create a GME coin that consoles can mine, while powered on and connected to the internet. Users then spend GME Coins online to buy games, in-game items, and cosmetics--competing with Free to Play (F2P) market while supporting game publishers. GME sells the mining processing power to host games and CDNs, turning GME into a technology company.

**Context**

You are tasked with drafting the turnaround strategy for GameStop, an online and brick-and-mortar retail store specializing in console games and accessories. The chairman for the board, Ryan Cohen, began his turnaround of the business in 2020, aiming to make GameStop the “Amazon of Gaming”. Recent “Meme Stock” speculation of the company's stock has driven the price of shares from $15 to as high as $483 in less than a year. As of September 20, 2021 the stock now trades at $189 per share.

**Assumptions**

GameStop has full alignment with Microsoft (Xbox) and Sony (Playstation) to build the “next generation” of gaming. In the wake of the Epic vs. Apple lawsuit, Microsoft and Sony have determined that retailers such as GameStop are necessary and, for fear of antitrust regulations, have committed to a strong collaboration with GameStop. You have counterparts at both companies working to launch this new product offering. Ryan Cohen is interested in a serious turnaround strategy, to help justify the recent $10 Billion Dollar valuation by share price.

**Challenges to the GameStop business model**

During the Covid-19 pandemic, online retailers, digital game platforms, and online services grew the most due to the “stay at home” nature of pandemic restrictions. These companies saw increased revenue, online users, and engagement ([source](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stay-at-home-stocks-have-been-crushed-here-are-ones-that-could-still-win-long-term-51621036411)). GameStop’s second quarter earnings of $1.18 Billion dollars of sales, yet reported an operating loss of $.76 per share. GameStop revenue came from 49.7% Hardware and Accessories (Consoles, controllers, adapters, etc), 38.9% Software (used and new video games), and 11.4% Collectibles (figurines, magazines, etc).

https://preview.redd.it/gvp45w5h5eq71.png?width=994&format=png&auto=webp&s=80a189cc248d650230faa1e85252dd4d1892ac01

The major consoles that contributed to GameStops revenue were the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series One. In the recent Epic vs. Apple lawsuit, when asked how much margin Microsoft makes on the Xbox consoles, the head of Xbox business development stated, “We don’t; we sell the consoles at a loss”. This is because the console market is a “hardware subsidy model, where game companies sell the consoles at a loss to attract new customers. Profits are then generated from game sales and online service subscriptions ([source](https://www.news18.com/news/tech/microsoft-sells-xbox-consoles-for-a-loss-but-the-xbox-gaming-business-makes-money-3715331.html)).

Each major game console manufacturer creates new consoles every four years on average, which creates growth challenges to GameStop in interim years between releases. An additional challenge to GameStop’s future revenue is that each manufacturer operates online digital stores for instant purchasing of games, which is quicker to play than even Amazon can ship. It is estimated that around 50% of console and PC game sales are now being made through an online purchase. Adding insult to injury, both Microsoft and Playstation offer consoles without digital disc drives, requiring digital purchases to operate.

**Analysis**

GameStops customers are increasingly purchasing digital copies of games directly from Microsoft, Playstation, or Nintendo, instead of physical copies from brick and mortar stores. It’s estimated that 50% of sales are now digital, and growing.

1. GameStop could work with publishers directly to offer subscription models for new games, exclusive content, or digital expansions, fronting the development costs by capitalizing their market share.
2. GameStop could try to become the “Amazon of Gaming” by increasing their fulfillment and logistics chains to deliver physical copies of games and hardware quicker to customers, competing for market share of fixed price products.
3. GameStop could broaden their hardware offerings to include Gaming PC’s, laptops, and other hardware accessories, transitioning into more of a Best Buy ($29 Billion Valuation).
4. GameStop could utilize their 4,000+ Brick and Mortar stores to perform services such as computer repair, and specialty services.
5. Leverage GameStop’s brand halo to create experiential events focused around their favorite games with exclusive “drops” and releases.

SWOT Matrix (Figure 1) and Porters 5 Forces (Figure 2), show that there are increasing threats to the GameStop retailer business model, not only from traditional competitors (Best Buy, Walmart), but also from online retailers such as Amazon and direct-to-consumer marketplaces (Xbox, Playstation, Nintendo Stores). The PEST analysis (Figure 4) shows that marketplaces have a unique sensitivity in today's legal atmosphere that can be utilized to negotiate with Console Manufacturers. Marketing Mix (Figure 5) shows that GameStop does not have a unique marketing position or product offering to leverage. Amazon fuels it’s growth from nascent businesses by utilizing it’s profits from Cloud (AWS) while operating at scale to decrease costs while increasing selection. Amazon even created its own last mile delivery and transport hubs to reduce costs and compete with FedEx and UPS. It’s not feasible for GameStop to do so.

https://preview.redd.it/ao50evpe6eq71.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=578b562722fbbb7379be64c25ae2c2685bc8c457

In analyzing the current market, positioning of GameStop, and threats to the business, GameStop’s future is not certain. GameStop risks following in [RadioShack](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/081315/5-reasons-why-radioshack-went-out-business.asp) or Circuit City’s footsteps.

**Recommendation**

GameStop should continue to leverage its sales of Console hardware, accessories, physical games, and used games/trade-ins for the near term. Instead of redeveloping their supply, logistics, and fulfillment chains to maximize delivery speed, GameStop should leverage it’s existing relationships with manufacturers and game publishers to receive inventory of releases early, and ship with promised delivery with UPS/Fedex. This allows low cost shipping options to be utilized without expensive logistic routes. Fervent fans can still receive their games or consoles on Day 1, but without the upfront [CAPEX costs](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/24/walmart-launches-delivery-business-to-connect-other-local-retailers-with-consumers.html) to GameStop.

Ultimately, Judo Strategy (Figure 6) suggests GameStop must find ways to use their opponents' weight and strength against them, rather than emulating what their competitors are already doing well. Drastic steps need to be taken to compete against existing and future incumbents. To increase high-value engagements with GameStop that correlate to retention (eg “Stickiness”), GameStop should create a digital wallet that allows customers to collect “coins” that they can spend to purchase new games, cosmetics, or in-game purchases.

Utilizing GameStops close relationship with Microsoft and Sony, GameStop should create a console app that performs hosting functions (mining) while connected to the internet. Porters 5 forces (Figure 2) shows that these consoles have expensive GPUs that can perform significant processing functions for centralized servers. [Many server farms today](https://www.businessinsider.com/take-a-look-inside-an-underground-crypto-farm-busted-by-ukraine-police-2021-7) mine cryptocurrencies with consoles due to these strong GPUs.

https://preview.redd.it/h6vrukth6eq71.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf918fc5d54a68f15a009e9df526842e63b9032e

GameStop customers can then load this application and earn coins for every hour of hosting functions they perform for the collective platform. The hosting services could enable decentralized hosting of online video games and GameStops own e-commerce website. If a customer leaves the app on, performing hosting functions for the decentralized server for one hour, they would earn 1 credit. A new video game release may cost 1,000 credits, in-game cosmetics 500 credits. Credits could also be purchased directly from GameStop instead of mining. This would enable game publishers to create additional mirrors of their games online to prevent ever [increasing DDOS hacks](https://www.pcgamer.com/apex-legends-hacked-to-protest-titanfalls-server-situation/) which cost publishers millions while frustrating customers. This JUDO strategy allows GameStop to shift and compete in a whole new way, while the industry cuts out middlemen with Free-To-Play, digital downloads, and in-app purchases.

**Measuring Success**

Each customer's wallet would be tied to their GameStop account. This customer data would be aggregated to identify unique users. Aged GameStop accounts could be renewed and tied to new wallets. Mining/hosting, spending coins, purchasing coins, and browsing the coin marketplace would be high value engagements (HVEs). As the gaming industry shifts completely to digital games, which could occur as soon as four years from now, GameStop can leverage this hosting strategy to grow revenue directly for game publishers, while competing with “Free to Play” games. This enables game publishers to continue to create high budget games, without charging exorbitant prices to customers ([which data shows customers are resistant to pay](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/18/free-to-play-games-rule-the-entertainment-world-with-88-billion-in-revenue/)).

**Implementation**

You would work with the new Sr. Platform Manager of Xbox and Playstation (see assumptions section above), to select three pilot game publishers for this launch. They may include Epic Games (Apex Legends) and Activision (Call of Duty), among others.

The initial MVP would comprise the following headcount:

1. Two Engineers (Xbox and Playstation App Development)
2. Four Engineers (Mining/Hosting experts with Content Delivery Network Experience)
3. One Engineer (Ledger system to calculate payouts, spending, etc)
4. Three Engineers (Flex, QA)
5. Four Game Advocates (Work directly with the pilot Game publishers)
6. One Marketing Specialists (Work directly with PR for news release on launch day)
7. One Engineer (Coin Spending Storefront)

After MVP development, the idea could be iterated on to improve hosting utilization and even sell spare hosting to the general web hosting marketplace. This would include cloud content delivery networks similar to Cloud Flare ($38 Billion Valuation).

Yet, we go out of our ways to select certain brands over others - most of the time at a higher price \[1\]. Everyone knows the importance of reputation for a company. Highly reputable brands have multiple things going for them:

* Their customers are extremely loyal and drive recurring purchases
* The public is vocal about recommending their brand and products
* Easier to expand to other markets as their reputation precedes them

Basically, you can consider having a great reputation to be a positive feedback loop on steroids! In an economy where 70-80% of the market value of a company comes from intangible assets like brand equity, intellectual capital, and goodwill \[2\], reputations can make or break a company’s performance.

In one of my previous analyses, we had discovered and proved that the [best companies to work for routinely beat the market in stock returns](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ok4l9c/i_analyzed_the_performance_of_companies_in_the/). So this week, let’s see how the most reputed brands have performed over the last decade!

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/e1y8b3xtp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=050451ab56c0dd05014ff5207231fc40766dadcf)

**Data**

While there are multiple companies that measure reputation, I chose the [RepTrack](https://www.reptrak.com/) list for my analysis as they seem to be the most established ones and have been creating their top 100 list for the last 2 decades.

They base their study on more than 240K responders over 15+ countries and the rating tells us how the companies are regarded by the general public. They have multiple factors that go into the final ranking, but for this analysis, I am only considering the final rank of the company.

I am considering the companies that were present in the Top 10 list at least once in the last decade \[2012 - 2021\]

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/w05hhrxtp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=5827fd247cb15d12bd50ac6746134c6bb6dac330)

**Analysis**

RepTrack publishes their result in March, every year. Since I could not find any fixed date of publication, for the purpose of the stock price calculation, I am using April 1st of every year as my investment date.

Even though the company produces a Top 100 list, I have limited my analysis to the Top 10 companies \[3\]. We then calculate the stock returns generated by these companies \[4\] over various time periods (1-year, 3-years, 5-years & till date) and then compare it to our benchmark. \[5\]

https://preview.redd.it/serqaextp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=18f15aea04e8a6decc25ff972c0bb01110d65bb5

 **Results** 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/hdjeau7zp8q71.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=a50598f9162d4b211dce3f202ff26e87296c52d8)

Companies in the most reputable list have consistently beaten SPY over different time periods. There is a significant improvement in overall return when holding the investment for a longer-term.

My hypothesis here is that, even though the short-term returns can be affected by market cycles, over the long run, companies having a great reputation end up outperforming their peers, and this is reflected in their stock price.

https://preview.redd.it/shv1yw10q8q71.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b85dbf0596b22f9d93bfa3f1cd954f012e9e796

 Another interesting insight we can derive from the data is the performance of the top-10 companies in each year’s list. As we can see, the most reputable brands beat SPY by a considerable margin in 7/10 years \[6\]. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/m10k3451q8q71.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=af6fb32d2245b0a5bc5d157d0931a91872716761)

But, before you YOLO your next paycheck into this strategy, do note that most of the returns were contributed by tech companies \[5\]. This is expected given the tech rally we had over the past decade. What is more interesting is how difficult it is to lose money investing in the top brands. Only 4 companies that were in the top 10 list over the past decade had a negative return. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/gz1th2ytp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab684cf2e2d4a3584b1c3590965c804bba19c284)

**Limitations to the Analysis**

There are some limitations to the above analysis that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy.

* Ideally, the backtest should be done over 30-40 year’s worth of data as we would know how the changing trends would impact the analysis. The last decade or so was predominantly biased towards tech.
* One should also benchmark this against the companies having an average or poor reputation to see if reputation is indeed a distinguishing factor that is driving the returns. \[7\]
* Finally, reputation is just one factor related to the company. There are companies whose reputations are in the gutter but have produced extraordinary returns for their shareholders (Facebook gave 175% return & Volkswagen gave 117% return in the last 5 years even after all the scandals they have been through).

**Conclusion**

Whether you like it or not, brands seem to have a significant impact on our daily lives. Just think about the number of times you/your friend have sworn by a brand and recommended it to everyone \[8\]. Almost all the brands in the top 10 list (eg. Rolex, Ferrari, Adidas, Harley-Davidson) have users that are extremely loyal, willing to pay a premium, and acts as unofficial spokespersons for the company.

Our analysis, in turn, proves that all these positive factors cause the company to outperform the market! So now you know what to do next time when your friend is swearing by a brand.

Until next week…

\[2\] [Reputation and Its Risks](https://hbr.org/2007/02/reputation-and-its-risks) \- Harvard Business Review

\[3\] The main reason for stopping with the Top 10 is the manual data pull process. They do not give a stock ticker associated with the stock nor is the list easily parsable. Given we are pulling data for 10 years, I limited myself to the top 10 companies.

\[4\] A stock is only considered if it’s directly investable from the US market and is an independent company (Examples of companies ignored - Rolex, LEGO Group, and Bosch)

\[5\] Before you come at me with Pitchforks for using S&P 500 instead of Nasdaq Composite, please take a look at the list of companies. It’s from a wide variety of industries. Adding to this, even though tech provided the majority of returns, starting in 2012, you would not have any idea about the tech run we would be having over the next decade.

Hello boys n girls... So what's going on? Well... Lucid is having a PR event at their AZ factory this week. Word in the swamps? They are getting ready to announcing the first set of deliveries for the Lucid Air and confirming delivery dates! It's been speculated for awhile that the first deliveries was going to be sometime between Q3-Q4. There has been uncertainty with the chip shortage... but with this news, short$ will shit themselves.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TL;DR;**

# LCID hitting production runs hard, will announce first deliveries schedule this week. Official EPA rating of 520 range. Plus with PIPE lockup expired 9/1, most of short term investors are done dumping shares. With that, and a week long PR event, very good chance they will set a date, and send the stock to URANUS!

*<begin\_plagiarism>*

Lucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone\*.

In 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.

In 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site\*. Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase\*, with early construction already having begun\*. Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to > 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes\*.

Lucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a ""two horse race.""\* In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21\*, bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as ""post-luxury,"" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence\*.

▶ **TECHNOLOGY:**

***Motor***\*: Lucid utilizes a *permanent-magnet synchronous motor* which is much more efficient than a traditional induction motor (eg, those used by Tesla until the Model 3). Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire → more resistance → more heat → decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***

Lucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds\*. Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o1stpusvzyp71.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb7eff1951a48874c28474791856d75dea6120ba

***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (""dumb range""). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I2R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)\*:

https://preview.redd.it/izejluexzyp71.png?width=2155&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba9252ec9a4efe2cb550b385fa9c38099419f025

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lhio20z00zp71.png?width=2191&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd5baa49a33a130763584fdb952fc85abc95bf32

Higher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW\*. The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW\*.

For battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier\*. While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)\*. Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.

It should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells\*. This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week.

Some have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips—it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*—the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.

***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform\*. It allows compatibility with—and the maximizing of—charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).

***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their ""Full Self-Driving"" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities\*. Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available on Lucid's website\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**

**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:

&#x200B;

\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now\*

**Gravity SUV**: ""Project Gravity"" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market\*. Prototypes have already been built\* using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.

&#x200B;

Project Gravity SUV

**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **CHARGING:**

Charging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships\*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \~20kW and DC charging up to \~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo\*.

Tesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.

Modern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

**▶ PEOPLE:**

Lucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resumés from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.

**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO/CTO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979\*. Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)\*. At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production\*. Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer (CTO) before being promoted to CEO in 2019\*. Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter\*; however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted\*.

**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021\*. Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)\*. She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.

**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy\*. Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally\*. Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.

**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors\*. At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.

&#x200B;

Besides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com\*. There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly\*, expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**

**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020\*. This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.

**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.

**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of >500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.

**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid’s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:

* 2021 - 577 vehicles
* 2022 – 20,000 vehicles
* 2023 – 49,000 vehicles
* 2024 – 90,000 vehicles
* 2025 – 135,000 vehicles
* 2026 – 251,000 vehicles

*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021*\*. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year\*\*\*\*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.\*

**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026\*. Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**\*.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m7ubjif50zp71.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=39d87075d7ed1e05626f32fdcb85bd59550a1c4e

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **FUTURE DIRECTION:**

Peter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California\*. They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they’re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life\*. Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/buq3dei60zp71.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3a2698ee2c34a0a37850630aa50d9bf43d0beb3

As a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.

Lucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022\* and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018\*. If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**

**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:

*CompanyValuation (8/22/2021)Total debtPrice-to-sales (P/S) ratio*Tesla (TSLA)$673.5 billion$11.1 billion (6/2021)\*18.33\*Toyota (TM)$226.8 billion$24.5 trillion (6/2021)\*0.81\*Volkswagen (VWAGY)$144.6 billion$219.2 billion (6/2021)\*0.51\*General Motors (GM)$70.8 billion$111.1 billion (6/2021)\*0.51\*Nio (NIO)$57.9 billion$2.7 billion (6/2021)\*12.7\*Honda (HMC)$50.7 billion$7.7 trillion (6/2021)\*0.37\*Ford (F)$50.2 billion$148.2 billion (6/2021)\*0.37\*Lucid (LCID)$35.1 billion$179 million\*N/A \*(see below)\*Xpeng$30.8 billion$2.7 billion (3/2021)\*N/ALi$27.1 billion$3.9 billion (3/2021)\*N/AFisker (FSR)$3.9 billion$20.2 million (6/2021)\*N/A

This is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026\*. *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion\*. *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).

For comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.

With this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52\* so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO\*.

[My 1st OP on this subject.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mliwqp/blackberry_how_the_patent_sale_could_transform_bb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) ^(For future reference BB reported last night 22-Sep-21 and price is now $10.65.)

**Let me start with the TLDR smooth version for crayon eaters**

* BB has been negotiating a sale of a bunch of their mobile phone patents (they no longer need) for around **$1bn $1.3bn range** (my estimate). They already have $772m in the bank & their market cap is $6bn. So they would have 30% as much cash as their current market price (yes it's a lot).
* Revenue for all businesses beat expectations this quarter.
* If and once it's confirmed the media will run the story that BB is now a company of the future fully focused on IoT (internet of things) and cybersecurity (and no longer failed phones ""lol"").
* Their most ambitious project: building the equivalent of the Apple Store back when the iPhone came out but for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles. Project name: IVY. Oh and they have a partner in this: Amazon. Early release: in a few weeks October 2021.
* Now why it's taking so long to sell that Portfolio? Well the big boss (Papa Chen) said he's mad too and added *""it's coming up, the next Christmas""* (2021). *I put 80%, we get it done this quarter.*

**Before I go any further: imagine you have a paper acct like me, so how to trade BB?**

^(Not a recommendation to use real $$$.) Rule of thumb: when it's below $10.00 it's a paper buying signal. But why bro? Well check the graph for whichever timeframe you want in 2021. It doesn't stay for long in single digit. There is big money behind it (yea looking at you Allianz AM) so ppl BTFD.

But it's already above $10 bruv... Well either wait for a pullback and pls refer to how quick it bounced back from the dip this morning or do your own DD and risk assessment if it's still worth it below $11...

Do not FOMO at $15+ or God forbids $20+. Be smart be early with your monopoly paper bills.

**The in-depth details and why I call it a Christmas Gift**

The most important is: Papa Chen said 6 months ago - when they first revealed the ongoing negotiations - that ""our investors would be very pleased with it"". In the previous quarter he said it is at a stage of definitive agreement. But last night he brought that term: it's coming for Christmas. And I feel how cheeky he is. It's both a time frame and a gift to BB ^(bag)holders. 

Now I must emphasise it's not 100% done. The sale could still fail. He put a probability of 80% that it would be done by Xmas. So now I must share Papa Chen's exact words:

*Turning now to licensing. As I mentioned earlier, negotiation to sell the portion of the patent portfolio related to mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking, are ongoing. And we have made significant progress since our last earnings call, including preliminary agreement of many of the key terms of the deal. We expect to execute definitive agreement this quarter. Closing the transaction will be subject to a normal regulatory review. Naturally, given this backdrop, we will continue to eliminate monetization activities for the remaining of the fiscal year, therefore, revenue for both Q3 and Q4 is expected to be similar to Q2, which is at $10 million per quarter. While we expect the sales to conclude essentially, the process has taken longer than we expected or anticipated. Should it not conclude this quarter, we have other options, including additional interested parties. We will update investors on any of the material developments in a timely manners.*

Then later in the Q&A:

Paul Treiber -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

*Hi, John. First question on the patent sale, I know you can't say much just given you're in the middle of negotiations. But in your statement, you mentioned that the negotiations are going well. But then you also indicated that if it doesn't close, you have other options. Just could you bridge between those two statements, because they're actually quite far apart from a tone perspective.*

John Chen -- Executive Chairman & CEO

*That's a good one. I'm glad you caught it. Yes, it is going well. I fully expect to finish this this quarter.* ***But I'm tired of waiting. I know a lot of our investors are too.*** *I'm not blaming anything on anybody, and may be we have too many lawyers assigned to this, sorry, lawyers, I doubted you. But the key is: it's a complex and big portfolio. It is rightfully so that they have done a lot of due diligence, and those things are now completed by the way, all the due diligence are completed. And then we have a lot of time span on definitive agreement negotiation. And then by and large, with the exception of one or two items, we're done with that. And then we have the purchase agreement. And so it just for me, it's been since last Christmas. It's coming up, the next Christmas. So, I basically kind of draw the line in the sand and say, I can just stop licensing the business so either move on one direction or the other. And then there are other interested parties in calling. And so we are not entertaining them because, as you recall during a period of time, not long in the past, we were in exclusive discussion with these people. So I can't really entertain a third-party. So my only point is, if you want to put percentage, waiting percentage, I put 80%, 20%. I put 80%, we get it done this quarter. Does that help?*

Paul Treiber -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

*Yeah, that's very helpful. I wasn't going to ask for percentage, but I'm glad you threw it out.*

Later in the Q&A Chen added: *I would say to you that that we have settled on the price.*

**Thoughts and Risks**

To be honest some of the risks are behind: it should have been sold already. Instead these negotiations have been dragged over the last 6 months hurting BB both top and bottom line. Making them miss their numbers. Downgraded by mean analysts. Reduced to a meme name.

But Papa Chen had enough of this BS. He and I quote has drawn a line in the sand. Either they send the money or he's gonna talk to other companies. I'm not sure how threatening does this sound...

Bottomline: if the sale is not concluded to this particular buyer from North America it would have been a lot of time and money wasted.

Then comes the regulatory risk because the sale could be delayed or even blocked for antitrust concerns or what not.

But if we are in the 80% area and the sale is indeed concluded by Xmas that would significantly strengthen BB financials and business model as they would be then fully focused on IoT and cyber.

BlackBerry needs to tell this story to the world: forget about the past, forget about our phones (even though they were so cool with the keyboard), we are now primed to be a New Big Tech company. For where you are now. And where you go next.

**Part 4 – Recent Updates**

**Part 5 – Financials and Valuation**

**Part 6 – Bear Case**

**Part 7 – SI and Squeeze Potential**

**Part 8 – TL;DR**

**Part 1 – Introduction**

It was a warm Monday morning on August 23rd almost a month back, when seemingly for no reason – **GOEV shot up from ~$5.9 to ~$8, a 30% gain on the day.** The next day – GME popped, for a 30% gain as well, with AMC and BB also making up big gains, leading to the ‘meme mania’ we’ve been experiencing for the last couple of weeks. 

Why’d this happen? Well there were no company/industry catalysts. The only event that seemed to occur in the prior week was the expiration of monthly options. One of the theories going around is that there’s an almost quarterly cycle going on at this point where FTD’s are leading to a surge in prices in the next cycle for ‘meme stocks’ which tend to be heavily shorted for the most part. How accurate this is I have no clue and whether this applies to GOEV I don’t know, haven’t investigated that particular theory but there’s plenty of posts/comments floating around for you to look into if you’re so inclined. 

The quick point I’m trying to make here is that if a heavily shorted stock is popping 30% in a day, with no major catalyst for the industry or the company in question – and that company is now advancing towards realizing its major milestones with favorable tailwinds expected for the sector, it could pop a lot more than 30% in the months to come. **GOEV is among the youngest EV companies - having been around for less than 5 years, with arguably the most unique vehicles coming out (on schedule – seems to be pretty amazing in the EV space) that very few, if any, of the established or other up and coming competitors are producing, and has been shorted more it seems – for the failure of its peers than any real fault of its own.**

**Part 2 – Market Trends and Upcoming Catalysts**

* From an investment into equities point of view – S&P 500 has fallen about 0.5%, on average, during the month of September. Stocks have tended to go up, on average, during every other month — other than a slight dip in February — over the past half century [link]( https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/01/investing/stock-market-september/index.html). However, this may soon be coming to an end as in the past week Investors stampeded into stocks and out of cash as global equity funds witnessed their biggest inflows since March 2021 while large-cap U.S. funds enjoyed a record haul, a weekly round-up by BofA showed. [link](https://www.investing.com/news/economy/monster-reallocations-to-stocks-as-us-tax-threat-recedes--bofa-2619022) 

* Let’s take a look at the EV market dynamics and upcoming catalysts before getting into GOEV specifically, so we get a high-level understanding of the bigger picture. The global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021 [source](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/electric-vehicle-market). This is expected to grow to $1.007 trillion by 2027 which is an average of 2 sources - [source 1](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/electric-vehicle-market-analysis-size-regional-outlook-competitive-strategies-and-forecasts-to-2027-2021-07-12?tesla=y), [source 2](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/electric-vehicle-market-size-to-be-valued-at-1-212-1-billion-by-2027-owing-to-rising-number-of-government-initiatives-globally-to-promote-manufacturing--adoption-of-evs--million-insights-301238118.html), another source actually has the market valued at $2.5 trillion but it’s a bit of an outlier compared to the other 2 [source 3](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/11/2227050/0/en/Electric-Vehicle-EV-Market-Worth-2-495-4-Billion-by-2027-Growing-at-a-CAGR-of-33-6-From-2020-Exclusive-Report-by-Meticulous-Research.html).   

* Global EV forecast is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years: Total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  Despite the pressure exerted on the market by the COVID-19 pandemic, the long-term outlook for EVs is strong. The significant shift in expected volume of BEVs and PHEVs by 2030 is based on four factors: consumer sentiment, policy and regulation, OEM strategy and the role of corporate companies. All four of these factors saw major changes in direction over the last year, prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and have since been shaped further by the pandemic. [link](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html) 

* In November 2018, an article came out stating that the number of EVs on U.S. roads was projected to reach 18.7 million in 2030, up from 1 million at the end of 2018. This is about 7 percent of the 259 million vehicles (cars and light trucks) expected to be on U.S. roads in 2030. Annual sales of EVs will exceed 3.5 million vehicles in 2030, reaching more than 20 percent of annual vehicle sales in 2030. About 9.6 million charge ports will be required to support 18.7 million EVs in 2030. This represents a significant investment in EV charging infrastructure. [link]( https://www.eei.org/resourcesandmedia/newsroom/Pages/Press%20Releases/EEI%20Celebrates%201%20Million%20Electric%20Vehicles%20on%20U-S-%20Roads.aspx). 

* As it turns out, that number of annual EV sales of 3.5 million vehicles in 2030 was revised to almost double of that in a November 2020 report, just 2 years after the previous article. The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. Over 90% of states offered incentives for setting up EV charging infrastructure, with meaningful quality of life incentives and exemptions are offered across 39 states in the US, including easier payment plans for the purchase of EVs, limited-time incentives to accelerate EV adoption/conversion and lack of requirements for emission inspections across several states. [link]( https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan)

* President Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030 [link 1](https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/40-percent-evs-2030/), [link 2](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/biden-set-target-50-evs-by-2030-industry-backs-goal-2021-08-05/) which is double of the 20% forecast just three years earlier in 2018, and would likely occur only with strong support on the supply side through infrastructural and other support that would enable EV manufacturers to develop the capacity to produce the target number of vehicles, and demand side with respect to incentivizing people to purchase EVs. 

* EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. This bill adds $4,500 to the current $7,500 tax credit available for a total of $12,500 potentially available to EV buyers. It includes passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks. The proposal calls for $160 billion to fund subsidies and purchase incentives, EV charging infrastructure funding, EV manufacturing incentives, federal EV procurement requirements, and incentives to electrify heavy-duty commercial fleets. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ev-tax-credit-bill-biden/) 

* The proposed EV credits in the budget blueprint would last for 10 years and consumers would be allowed to deduct the value of the credit from the sales price at the time of purchase. In 2027, the $7,500 credit would only apply to U.S.-made vehicles. It would also create a new smaller credit for used EVs of up to $2,500. There are also lower credits for EVs with smaller battery packs. The bill says individual taxpayers must have an adjusted gross income of no more than $400,000 to get the new EV tax credit. It would limit the EV credit to cars priced at no more than $55,000, while trucks could be priced up to $74,000. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. [link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/11/us-democrats-propose-dramatic-expansion-of-ev-tax-credits-that-favors-big-three.html) 

* Furthermore, the bipartisan infrastructure plan, titled the American Jobs Plan, includes billions of dollars for other electrification efforts and for a national charging network. Specifically, the bipartisan plan includes $7.5 billion for a network of EV charging stations across the country. It also includes another $7.5 billion for electric buses and other transportation methods. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/biden-infrastructure-ev-subsidies-charging-network/)  

* States area also providing EV incentives to residents e.g. Gov. JB Pritzker signed Illinois’ clean energy law which includes a $4,000 rebate for residents to buy an electric vehicle (EV). [link](https://www.mystateline.com/news/local-news/illinois-wants-to-give-you-4000-to-buy-an-electric-vehicle/). 

* By 2030, there’s expected to be an 8% divergence between EV demand estimates and production plans, meaning there needs to be a massive scaling up of infrastructure/capacity of EV manufacturers over current projections in order to fill the gap in the market.

**Part 2 – Company Overview and Unique Value Proposition**

**Before we look into what’s happened since my last post, let’s go over a quick refresher on what the company does.** Canoo is a Los Angeles-based company that has developed breakthrough electric vehicles, with over 650 employees [link](https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/65/canoo-receives-initial-aa-esg-leader-rating-from-msci) from leading technology and automotive companies [link](https://www.canoo.com/about/). Canoo’s Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else’s lineup… take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=1747). What makes this Canoo so special compared to other EVs is their modular platform, which is purpose-built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space and adaptable to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses. 

It is this modular platform that led to Apple’s interest and having talks with Canoo (the talks are assumed to have fallen apart because Canoo was looking for an investor while Apple was looking to for an acquisition), as the platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car’s electronics, allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design. It also features steer-by-wire technology, which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry. [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev).

Apple wasn’t the only major company interested in Canoo, Hyundai Motor Group (Hyundai and Kia’s parent company) actually went a lot farther than Apple did with Canoo, announcing a partnership in February 2020 to develop new electric vehicles based on the technological platform developed by Canoo [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). This was extremely unusual and referred to as a significant victory for Canoo, as ‘pretty much every electric vehicle startup has talked about wanting to license out their technology or partner with legacy automakers, almost none have landed a deal… Canoo now joins that small list despite only coming into existence at the end of 2017, when its founders started the company’ [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). 

Ultimately this partnership did not go ahead because Canoo’s chairman didn’t feel as though it was worth it for Canoo, saying that the original deal with Hyundai didn’t factor in the value of Canoo’s IP, so a shift in strategy was made from licensing out the technology to protecting the IP and manufacturing and selling Canoo’s own vehicles to commercial operators [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev) 

Regarding the technology/IP - Canoo has developed the world’s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. For example, the lifestyle vehicle, which will offer the interior space of a large SUV, but on the exterior footprint of a compact car. To help achieve this, Canoo’s suspension utilizes a double wishbone with two fiberglass leaf springs, mounted transversely in the front and rear of the platform. The dampers are mounted to the frame, eliminating the need for large shock towers that take up vital cabin space. The entire suspension system is incorporated into the skateboard and sits below the height of the tires. [link](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-shows-off-performance-and-versatility-of-skateboard-platform-for-the-first-time-in-video).

Let’s take a look at the current automotive model and see how Canoo’s approach and the use of the skateboard platform add so much more value than conventional ICE manufacturers [link](https://gyazo.com/041f5f426804ab087740da6c5b0b1aeb), currently the model is broken because 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit is only generated after the first owner. The current model is geared towards the first owner and nothing more, with an assortment of OEMs/spare parts retailers/3rd party installers servicing vehicles after the initial sale. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same [link](https://gyazo.com/272959d52f3e8c169c711e9b18dbd98c). 

The use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions [link](https://gyazo.com/7ade9dac03f0e6fcbffc6b8f3942eb4c), with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo’s vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next. It’s also worth pointing out that in traditional ICE, it would be exceptional if Bill of Materials cost carryover across variants reached 25%, with Canoo, this is exceeding 50%. The specific savings include:

* 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed

* 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants

* >70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.

These enable the development of space efficient cabins that integrate simply onto platform [link](https://gyazo.com/0a5777ed4387d9d9916a0c0d949f452e), and provide the key basis for engineering Canoo’s new value proposition of having a harmonized and articulated 3 – layer vehicle concept that keeps fresh and returns capital over an entire vehicle lifecycle [link](https://gyazo.com/7992fbead2e3c724ec002333b8c909c8). This image also showcases how Canoo aims to capture the full vehicle lifecycle value [link](https://gyazo.com/ca0abdaece1006dbb34ad42b60bb2977) 

The three vehicles that Canoo has publicly announced as part of its lineup are:

Lifestyle vehicle [link](https://www.canoo.com/canoo/) - Fully electric, highly versatile and offering more utility inside and out for city explorers, businesses, families and adventurers. The multi-purpose platform unlocks SUV-size interior space on a smaller exterior footprint. It’s pretty hard to put into an image of the vehicle into words so I’d recommend clicking on the above link to check it out for yourself. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):

* Launching late 2022.

* Starting at $34,750*

* 2 seats - 5 seats - 7 seats

* 250 mi range

* Up to 350 Horsepower 

* 28min charge time 80%

* 188 ft³ interior volume

* 80 KWh battery

* 1,464 lbs payload – 2,000 lbs capacity

Multi-purpose Delivery Vehicle [link](https://www.canoo.com/mpdv/) – Business ready vehicle that lowers the total cost of ownership while providing easy maintenance. More cargo in a small footprint to enable easy maneuverability. A productivity tool that enables you to plug in your tools and get to work. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):

* Starting at $33,000*

* 200 ft³ - 500 ft³ cargo volume

* 130 – 230 mi, 90 – 190 mi range (EPA)

* 1,540 to 1,980 lbs

Pickup [link](https://www.canoo.com/pickup/) – All Electric, All American, All Utility - The Pickup Truck is built to be the new standard in function, form and utility — ready for work and the weekend. The picup truck is as strong as the toughest trucks out there and includes features for people who use trucks on the job, weekend, and adventure. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):

* Launching as early as 2023.

* Price – Not currently listed, but during the Q&A portion of the investor day portion on June 30th, somebody asked what the base pricing for the pickup was, given that the Ford lightning F-150 base price was being advertised at $32,000. Chairman Tony Aquila said Canoo was not prepared to announce the pricing at that time, but Canoo would not be beaten in this category – you can check it out at the following link [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=10908)  

* Targeted HP – 500+

* Payload Capacity – 1800 lbs

* Range – 200+ mi

* Powertrain – AWD or RWD

There’s actually a fourth vehicle as well that hasn’t been listed anywhere officially but was found by /u/Mcardiel007 when he was having issues communicating with Canoo and went to their Torrance location and spotted them unloading what is potentially the new sedan. All credits to him/her for the following pictures [pic 1](https://gyazo.com/5e84005c8399352f2de9efbedeb3d933), [pic 2](https://gyazo.com/608a14d42df52284544bfbf0cf4a2912?token=1800737b805fc34222e29805d032b29c), [pic 3](https://gyazo.com/906b46f350bed3e4ed10357422bf548a), [pic 4](https://gyazo.com/5dd4b620f07fcb72fdb2234dfc35a36a), [pic 5](https://gyazo.com/83e23a1219e08bd6a2d118138121a714). 

We can see that Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup). One of the fastest growing segments is delivery vans, with ~2M more delivery vehicles needed globally by 2030 [link](https://gyazo.com/309703e692c4a4fa96cd91096b593ac4). It’s important to keep in mind existing fleet conversion to EV as well. Using the common platform provides a pivot-ability to focus on high margin products and is a large and profitable opportunity – highly lucrative and accretive to overall margin [link](https://gyazo.com/51a7448bc7b0c236d6c4b528eb662dda). 

Canoo is also looking at car data and not just strictly being a vehicle manufacturer – with an opportunity for harmonizing hardware and software + superior cleaning leading to actionable data instead of the status quo of outsourced hardware + poor cleaning leading to disjointed data. Each connected vehicle offers 1 – 2 TB of raw data per day, with car data monetization globally valued at $250 Billion - $400 Billion [link](https://gyazo.com/d1e6a55ce2f1bb3777020592281afe8f).

To sum it up – Canoo is well-positioned for success with a differentiated business model [link](https://gyazo.com/6b0ce0f9af42b090b04e970aafe696fe), developing exceptional products that are aimed at the most profitable segments ($115B+ for 90% 2020 profit pool) in the US, addressing upfitting and accessories market in the US by monetizing full vehicle lifetime value with emphasis on 2nd, 3rd and 4th customers (valued at $24B+), and monetization of car data globally through customer-centric, software ecosystem generating exponential network effect ($250B+).

**Part 4 – Recent Updates**

**Now let’s take a look at some of the hires that the company’s been making (note that almost all of these hires have happened since the last quarter, with most being in the last two months, and this is not an exhaustive list).

**Now why on earth would these long-established and assumingly well-reputed individuals with executive level careers at places including the United Nations, U.S. Department of State, Nio, Tesla, Fiat Chrysler, Daimler AG/Mercedez-Benz, General Motors, Nissan, Toyota, Hyundai, Honda, Salesforce, NASA, McAfee, PepsiCo, Samsung, Harley-Davidson etc. move to an upstart EV manufacturer within the last couple of months if they didn’t believe in it’s potential for success? Some of these individuals have spent 5-10 years with their prior companies, it doesn’t make sense that they’d all be jumping over to Canoo for a 1 year engagement.**

Other than the talent, Canoo has made a number of moves in in recent months as it moves closer to bringing the first of the Lifestyle Vehicles to production, including:

Announcing plans to build its new factory outside of Tulsa, Oklahoma, creating more than 2,000 jobs and opening in 2023. The facility will be built on a 400-acre site at the MidAmerica Industrial Park complex in Pryor, Oklahoma. It will house a paint shop, body shop, and general assembly plant. Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538811/canoo-ev-factory-oklahoma-electric-vehicles-vdl-nedcar).

Partnering with VDL Nedcar as a contract manufacturing partner to manufacture the Lifestyle Vehicle for the US & EU markets while it builds its US-based mega micro-factory. By parallel pathing contract and owned manufacturing Canoo will meet its commitment to start production and deliver vehicles in Q4, 2022. Canoo Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that VDL Nedcar ‘is the top trusted European manufacturer building high quality products for leading OEMs, and they significantly outcompeted the other contenders. VDL is also independently owned by the van der Leegte family of entrepreneurs - which aligns with our commitment to support businesses that form the backbone of communities. This strategic partnership will enable us to deliver vehicles to market while we build our Phase 2 factory in Oklahoma. It also strongly positions us for geographic expansion in Europe and builds a lasting relationship with VDL Groep of companies. Our investment will help us scale quickly and fulfill our mission to bring affordable, purpose-built EVs to Everyone.” The Nedcar facility is slated to build up to 1000 units for both the US and European markets in 2022 with a target of 15,000 units in 2023 [link]( https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-names-vdl-nedcar-as-contract-manufacturing-partner)

De-risking the path to market, Canoo designed, built and tested beta for its lifestyle vehicle [link](https://gyazo.com/e9e9bee044f83da1536c1ab57809dece), with highlights including:

* >$250M invested in Beta

* ~1.5M hours of engineering

* ~500k miles of testing

* 13 beta runners / 32 beta properties tested

* US NCAP 5-star overall rating targeted, with simulated, sled and vehicle level crash testing.

Undertaking the Gamma Phase with SOP on track for Q4 2022 [link]( https://gyazo.com/772813dd1ab4b30255dfdfa9674006ce), with key highlights including:

* >12 months of testing

* ~120-150 vehicles will be built and validated

* ~70 crash tests

* 30 sled tests

* Full slate of vehicle tests; no shortcuts

* 80% of all components are sourced

* 63% of all engineering is released

* 54% of tooling is committed

Partnering with the frontdoor collective for 10,000 MPDVs, the frontdoor collective are a network of delivery service partners that provide dependable last-mile delivery experience, with founders and executives with experience from FedEx, Walmart, XPO, Amazon, Instacart and the U.S. military. With more than 100 franchisees with experience in delivering for companies like Amazon, XPO, Axlehire and Ontrac, the company, aims to expand that to 300 franchisees by the end of this year [link](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/qa-frontdoor-collective-executives-explain-importance-of-franchised-dsp-network). 

Surpassing 9,500 non-binding pre-orders across lifestyle vehicle, pickup track and multi-purpose delivery vehicle [link](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/second-quarter-2021-results) 

Showcasing its vehicles at various events including the ACT Expo and Cars & Coffee (both of which were attended by some of the amazing folks at the canoo subreddit who attended, took detailed notes/pictures and shared it with everyone), and receiving invites to others such as the LA Auto show [link](https://gyazo.com/ff9b83052183c0128970b65c4e05aa55).

**Part 5 – Financials and Valuation**

Before looking at Canoo/Competitors, here are some analyst PTs

* R.F. Lafferty - $19 [link](https://www.investing.com/news/rf-lafferty-stick-to-their-buy-rating-for-canoo-2568124) 

* H.C. Wainright - $15 [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-goev-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-09/) 

* Bank of America - $5 (can’t find the article at the moment but I’m sure I’ve seen it somewhere)

Average = $13, current SP = $6.7

As of Canoo’s second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million [link](https://investors.canoo.com/financial-information/balance-sheet), which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing its first products to markets [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=9398). 

The company could raise $273M from warrants if the SP is greater than $18 for 20 out of 30 days.

At a pre-revenue stage there’s not too much to say in this department, other than to note that value of a couple of orders:

* Over 9,500 non-binding preorders – which if they are followed through with would be worth at least $313,500,00 (assuming 9,500 orders of the cheapest vehicle which is the base model MPDV).

* 10,000 MPDVs for the frontdoor collective which would be worth at least $330,000,000 (assuming cheapest MPDV).

As far as valuations go, let’s divide the pre-revenue EV manufacturers into tiers for an easier look – based on their market cap. I’m sure some are missing because I only took a few, let me know and I’ll add them in later. These market caps were taken within a few moments of each other on 9/21 from yahoo finance.

* Lucid Motors – $41.23B, 11,000 pre-orders, delivery delayed to fall 2021

* Nikola Corporation - $4.25B, lowered delivery guidance of 25/50 vehicles for 2021 

* Fisker Inc - $3.917B, >17,000 pre-orders, value of $637,483,000 

* Faraday Future - $3.66B, 300 FF 91 Vehicles, value of $54,000,000 delivery in 2022 

* Canoo – $1.63B, 19,500 pre-orders (9,500 individual + 10,000 front door collective), value of $643,500,000, delivery fall 2022 for LV, 2023 for MPDV 

* Company A (market cap too low, has a DOJ investigation ongoing and issued a going concern for whether it would have cash to make it to production) - $1.2B

Just looking at a couple of examples here it would seem that Canoo is undervalued purely on a pre-orders/revenue perspective. Fisker and Faraday Future, which are both expected to deliver in 2022 as is the case with Canoo, have over double the market cap despite Canoo having similar preorder value (compared to Fisker) or much higher (compared to Faraday Future). Haven’t done a cash flow analysis of every company but even taking into consideration Fisker having $400M more in cash on hand [source](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/), there’s a significant discrepancy. Faraday Future meanwhile has less than half of Canoo’s cash on hand at $230M [link](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/).  

**Part 6 – Bear Case**

With anything pre-revenue, the biggest issue is always going to be do we have enough cash to get the product off the ground imo. I could write a really long paragraph but yea that’s pretty much it in a sentence. Since I’m on the bullish side for the company, I’ll lay out a few reasons why I think Canoo won’t be running out of $$$ before it comes to market – these have mostly been stated here and there throughout this document but I’ll summarize them below:

* As of Canoo’s second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing the Lifestyle Vehicle to market. 

* Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility.

* EV funding is a significant portion of the upcoming budget, this is less grounded than the others but there is assumedly some hopium that Canoo would be able to receive some federal support if needed.

* The company could take on debt to assist in getting to production – H.C. Wainwright in their coverage indicated that they expect $500M to $525M in funding could be raised in debt to 2023. Tony has previously stated that they are looking for as non-dilutive an approach as possible, and given the current SP it wouldn’t make much sense to go the additional equity route.

* In May, the SEC opened a fact-finding inquiry into Canoo as it did with many former EV SPACs, unlike others such as NKLA and (Company A) – nothing further has come as of yet, nor have any DOJ investigations been launched.

**Part 7 – SI and Squeeze Potential**

I know y’all have just been waiting for this so I’ll get right down to it. Famously developed by the esteemed /u/pennyether, the SMELL system is going to help us take a look at some key numbers that’ll help understand GOEV’s squeezability.

* Short Interest – 31.8 million shares, 32% of free float 

* Market Cap – $1.63 Billion, not big enough that it’s immovable, not small enough that shorts would be able to cover without investing a decent amount of capital

* Extremely Memeable – I mean… GOEV, like Go… EV, idk I think it ticks off the memeability criteria

* Low Liquidity – Average volume per yahoo finance is 2.7M shares, which is 2.7% of the free float so any inflow will cause the share price to move pretty significantly. Over the last quarter, it seems that institutions have been loading up on Canoo for cheap, with institutional inflows of $177M and only $2.56M sold [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GOEV/institutional-ownership/)

* Low Risk (IV) – Yep, current IV is 77.1% for 9/24 and 10/1 options. Please do NOT consider this financial advice, like at all, but if you’re one of the folks who look to just buy options for the sake of contributing to a gamma squeeze, take a look at the post by /u/ChemaKyle on how buying far OTM options and how it’s not the best idea if you want the MMs to hedge. There’s not much of a need to hedge vs something that doesn’t have a ramp up and no OI at the ATM values. I’d agree with his/her post and the commentators that buying ATM options and the underlying shares would have a greater chance at causing a gamma squeeze, but this is something you should research and do your own DD on as well based on your risk tolerance and investment threshold.

**Part 8 – TL;DR**

The global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021, with total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. 

President Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030, to support this EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in the proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. Either way, this is huge for Canoo which is offering base models of the Lifestyle Vehicle and MPDV at <$35,000, with the base pickup model expected to be priced similarly. 

Canoo aims to disrupt the current automotive model by taking a piece of the 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit which is generated after the first owner and traditionally ignored by manufacturers. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same. Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup) and targeting one of the fastest growing segments of delivery vans, for which ~2M more delivery vehicles will be needed globally by 2030, with its MPDV.

To facilitate this disruption, Canoo has developed the world’s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. Canoo’s Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else’s lineup… take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle. The use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions, with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo’s vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next.

* 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed

* 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants (compared to ~25% on ICE)

* >70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.

If we take a look at the funding incentives being proposed for consumers e.g. with the LV, the maximum federal rebate would be $12,500, and if we add in state incentives e.g. Illinois with it’s $4,000 rebate – that turns into $16,500. The LV is priced at $34,750 which means that post-rebates you’re getting it at almost half the price, pretty ridiculous in comparison to ICE vehicles, add in tighter emissions standards for ICE vehicles and Canoo starts looking pretty good.

If you made it this far, I’d like to thank you for reading this – I’d like to give a big shoutout to the community over on the canoo subreddit (not sure if I can link other subs so won’t). They’re extremely dedicated individuals who provide a wealth of knowledge on the ongoings of the company – from driving to HQ and coincidentally finding an unrevealed product to attending EXPOs and other showcase events and sharing vehicle images and detailed write-ups. Y’all the real MVPs. Position – 1k shares @ 11.69."

So we will see if the mods even allow this.I thought to myself the other day about “apex” companies. These are the companies that are far and away the leading companies in their space.   


For example:  
Social Media:   
Facebook  
Online Shopping (and cloud..): Amazon  
Search: Google  
Smartphones: Apple  
EV cars: Tesla

You get the idea. But what I was moderately surprised at was the **lack of social media** **marketing** company. When a company is scheduling things to advertise on Instagram, responding to your whining on Twitter, or answering customer queries via Whatsapp, what are they using? **If you’re a top company, they’re using Sprinklr.**

Go look for yourself. What’s Amazon’s Twitter using? What’s Google’s Twitter using? What’s ESPN (Disney) using?  


Other examples of companies that use Sprinklr (as of Q2):  
Netflix  
Microsoft  
Twitter  
Amazon

Google  
The Marines (yep, it’s been government-certified)  
TSA  
Accenture

Deloitte  
McDonalds (tendies)

If you work at a big company, you’ll recognize there are a lot of disparate tools being used in a similar function. Social Media management is no different. At its simplest, Sprinklr allows companies to organize content across platforms, easily respond to customers through different channels, and analyze the outcomes. This is exceedingly valuable to companies in order to manage their social media (helping with marketing efficiency, customer service outcomes, social listening, etc.)

There are also much deeper integrations here as well, but we will start with that. Now, how much do you think a company would be worth, given that the majority of the Fortune 100 uses their services? What if I told you they had 74+ customers generating over $1M each on a yearly basis? What if I said they had about 1000 other customers, with average subscription revenue (yearly) of $350K each?

Well, whatever you had in your head - the current market cap of Sprinklr is roughly $4.3BN. By EoY, they’re expecting (their prediction from Q2 earnings) to generate \~$415M in revenue (22% growth YoY).

However, I believe it’s generally undervalued for a variety of reasons.

1. They are recognizing revenue from subscriptions (90% of their revenue) as it happens, not when the deals are signed. I believe their estimates to be really low. Consider that there are 74 customers with at least $1M in yearly subscription revenue, and they themselves have stated they have 1000 customers with an average yearly value of $350K (as of June 23).Well, if you just took the average value X 1000 customers, + $74M, you’re already at $424M revenue. And no doubt, there are more customers signed since June, and no doubt some of the 74 “big” customers are spending much more than $1M annually. They also have the opportunity to upsell their current customers. **TL;DR** they’re clearly going to be way ahead of their projected earnings and will continually revise earnings skyward.
2. This is a really sticky industry. The companies that put the amount of work to migrate to use Sprinklr aren’t going to change to a different provider easily (and frankly, a single competitor doesn’t really exist). Retention is likely to be extremely high.
3. Sprinklr is **really early**. The fact that they have the majority of the biggest companies on the planet signed bodes well for their future. They have now stated they’re targeting the next biggest 30000 companies, and their sales pipeline/staff has started to ramp up (paused all of last year). I would expect many more companies to be signed here; additionally, I expect additional products to be released that can be upsold to existing customers (live chat analysis, liter-research platforms - they just announced something like this called Modern Research Lite - etc.)

Anyway, I could say a lot more, but by this point I either have your interest or not. A few things to conclude with -

1. Look at companies in an adjacent space to them. Qualtrics (survey + experience management company) - $23BN. Zendesk (mainly customer support/comms) - $14.5BN. Liveperson (a stock that literally just does chat on a website) - $4.7BN. Take any comp you want - probably undervalued.
2. Sprinklr does have a competitor called **Sprout Social**. Sprout is awesome too, and much more targeted at small companies. I’m invested in Sprout as well; they’ve been on a rocketship recently ($7.3BN cap with $132M in yearly rev). However, I like Sprinklr over Sprout for a variety of reasons.. But the main one? **Trust what the top companies on Earth are using**. And I will take their judgment on this one. There’s probably room for both to succeed, but Sprout is much more narrow in my mind.
3. All wall street analyst PTs are above current price, with the lowest at $21 and the highest at $29.
4. There is basically **zero** ETF ownership of this, which is absurd as Sprout has **60** ETFS that contain it. I would be shocked if ETFs didn’t start picking this up, which will likely lead to a quick upswing in price because the amount of outstanding shares is quite low (high amount of institutional shares held, but can’t be sold).
   1. This has led to volatility recently (5-7% up and down days), but it doesn’t seem to be reflected in options pricing as IV is \~60-70%. Options not a bad idea.

TL;DR Sprinklr is undervalued. Massive opportunity. I think it could be the “Salesforce of Social Media Management”. Position = 2600 shares and 38 Feb 20 calls.

Here is my response

“Well, seeing as how everyone is over leveraged including hedge funds, it could pull back 10%. Right now it's at 5, and everyone swore it wouldn't get to 5 lol. 

The 50 EMA, which is the uptrending channel it's been on for the past year and a half, convincingly broke the past two trading sessions. It is now focused on the 100EMA, if it breaks that, youre looking at a fall to about 390/395 for the SPY, and 3800 for the SPX. (Spitballing here for you gay technical gurus)

To be honest though, I'm not buying that it will be a crash or a major correction past 7%. I believe it falls tomorrow and Wednesday, which allows me to make profit lol, and then soars Friday. There is no way the federal reserve 1) stops buying bonds at the rate they are doing, or 2) hike interest rates while delta variant is growing in the US.

Although the economy is showing good growth, and inflation is running rampid (not transitory like  they try to say), the fed will continue to print infinite money therefore ruining the economy and setting up another great financial crisis event. The crash will severely destruct the country. 

1. The debt ceiling raise is being opposed by the republicans , without that raise, America essentially defaults on debt, which makes the evergrande (you need to google that, that's important) situation look like a walk in the park. They are probably doing this to delay the infrastructure bill (which will ""help"" the economy by pumping even more money into it, therefore causing a crash)......excuse my language but basically either way we are in a shit ton of trouble . 

2. In terms of the bill, it's coinciding with a tax rate for every class, let's start from the bottom up, there is a 11 million dollars getting pumped into the stock market every day by retail investors, this is largely from shutdowns, stimulus checks, and no incentive to put money in savings (see: interest rates) this slows down when the public opens up unrestricted, and when taxes are hiked to pay for the bill. Now, here is the trick that is lost on a lot of people. The administration doesn't want to hike taxes for anyone under 400000, but what they are missing is taxes are being put on popular items that people under the 400000 limit typically spend their money on (see: tobacco), moving on from that, those with incomes ranging 400000 to 5 million will be taxed at 28%, this is the somewhat important money, not as much as corporations but has the ability to drive prices unlike retailers. A lot of loopholes like the mega roth back door and criptoe (see: mods 🙄)  being treated as a property rather than a security would be reversed. That has big implications into the next part. Corporations. The administration hopes to raise the tax rate on capital gains to 39%. The one thing the rich know how to do, is get around the system that was built for them to succeed. What this will do is force a further sell off by the big money in order to escape the new tax rate, and buy at a cheaper price in order to capitalize/make up for the tax rate during the economic recovery. The corporations will make off with more money than they had before, in a resurgent economy that is powered by the money of the only losing party who started the year and half rally in the first place, the retailers. 

3. I don't know if you remember, but I spoke to you all in the group chat about the federal reserve and their bond buying program, I was betting on that it stopped, but it didn't and reversed to its last ATH. The fed stated that the economy was not ready to go in its own and decided that tapering was off the table, the stock market rallied from its 2.5% low to an ATH in 3 hours. 10 days. 10 days later it created its last ATH (all time high) and has fallen for the past 3 weeks. Which is a clear sign that it is over valued. & furthermore, several fed board members have sold exactly at that ATH (which is illegal), Congress and pelosi has as well (which is illegal) and the only people who think the stock market will reverse back to ATH are, the retailers. The fed has two options, continue printing infinite amounts of money to stabilize a already stable economy further losing up the bubble to Great Depression proportions (which would not serve their best interest since they all have capitalized and SOLD already 😬) or taper the economy and have the equivalent of the great financial crisis sell off for the next month . Technicals or news doesn't move the markets, people do. 


I'm hoping for a 10% correction, which is healthy for the economy and also for my bank account, I've already made my profit thus far, but if it doesn't continue correction and reverses to all time highs, we are going to enter a year long recession. There just isn't anymore money to throw at the economy without it coming back. 

And technically, the S&P/Nasdaq are tech heavy and controlled by FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, google), if there is a sector rotation there isn't one single sector that can hold a candle to them. The economy will falter.”

I’m not the smartest in the world on any of these subjects. I suspect neither of you guys are either. Jokes are welcomed. And I’m also willing to learn on shit I was probably wrong on in here. CAN YOUUUU DIGGGG ITTTTT?! 

LET THE GAMES BEGIN!

TL;DR - What do you think about the correction, recovery, and future of the stock market?"

The recent chip shortage has shown that the U.S can't keep up with semiconductor demand. Joe Biden has laid out a $50B subsidy plan for research and development in the semiconductor industry. In the CEO Summit on Semiconductor Supply Chain Resilience, Biden stated that this was a “once in a generation” investment for the future. Semiconductor chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water.

​​4 ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:

* Transition from wet to dry etching
* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production
* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process
* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams

**Technical Analysis**

Looking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.

**Conclusion**

The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out high dividends (\~1.56% annually) but does re-invest that money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.

prtrge,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/prtrge/could_bumble_help_you_retire_a_millionaire/,Could Bumble Help You Retire A Millionaire?,0,26,2021-09-20 20:24:03,"Bumble (BMBL) has been a volatile investment since its IPO. The female-oriented dating app maker went public at $43 per share in February, and its stock opened at $76 before hitting $84.60 less than a week after its debut.

Bumble's stock tumbled back below its IPO price in May, but it subsequently rebounded to the high $50s after it posted a strong second-quarter report in August. Could Bumble still help you retire a millionaire over the long term? Let's take a fresh look at the bull and bear cases to find out.

What the bulls will say about Bumble
Bumble owns two apps. Its namesake app, which hosts more paying users and generates most of its revenue, only allows women to make the first move. Its older app, Badoo, is more similar to Tinder and generally more popular in Europe and Latin America.

The bulls believe Bumble can carve out a high-growth niche against Match Group (MTCH), which owns Tinder, Hinge, OK Cupid, and other popular dating apps. Bumble's share of the U.S. dating app market rose from 10% in 2017 to 19% in 2020, according to Sensor Tower, putting it firmly in second place behind Tinder's 40% share.

Bumble's number of paid users across both apps rose 20% year-over-year to 2.9 million last quarter. Its average revenue per user (ARPU) increased 13% at Bumble and 4% at Badoo. Bumble expects its total revenue to rise 29% to 31% this year, while analysts expect Match's revenue to grow 26%.

Those growth rates indicate there's plenty of room for Bumble's female-friendly platform to grow. Over the long term, Bumble plans to expand into new overseas markets like India, as well as monetize its BFF feature for platonic friendships and Bizz feature for business connections.

Bumble ended last quarter with $252 million in cash and equivalents and $642 million in total debt. That gives it a fairly low debt-to-equity ratio of 0.5.

Bumble could also benefit from a recent court ruling against Apple that will allow companies to integrate their own in-app payment systems to bypass Apple's 15% to 30% cut of App Store fees.

The global online dating market could grow at a CAGR of 8.44% between 2021 and 2025, according to Statista Research. If Bumble merely matches the market's growth rate, it could generate $1.05 billion in annual revenue in 2025.

But Bumble is growing faster than Match and the broader market, and that trend could continue as it gains more users, launches new premium tiers, expands its international business (which generated 43% of its revenue in the first half of 2021), and monetizes BFF and Bizz as non-dating social networks. Bumble could also acquire smaller dating apps to diversify its portfolio and widen its moat against Match.

Bumble's market cap of $10.7 billion is less than a fourth of Match's market cap of $45.5 billion. Bumble trades at 14 times this year's sales, while Match has a comparable price-to-sales ratio of 15. Therefore, Bumble's higher growth rates and lower valuations could give it more room to run than Match."

prnoeo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/prnoeo/some_common_mistakes_we_seem_to_make_and_how_not/,Some common mistakes we seem to make and how not to repeat them [Long post for newbies],154,27,2021-09-20 12:33:18,"Hello! I am mostly a lurker in here but I do post time to time. And recently, I am seeing an influx of bad rumours or advice that seems to be constantly circling around. So, I hope this post might be helpful for those that are kinda new into degen gambling.

*if you are already an experienced trader, ignore this post.*

Now, here's some common mistakes or rumours or bad advice that's circling around in reddit:

* Everything is not a short squeeze. Seriously. I have seen people claiming stocks like PLTR, SPY etc is short squeeze. It is not. There are very specific criteria that makes things a short squeeze, and without understanding that, you might lose money thinking that everything is a short squeeze.   


1. Most of the time, when some redditor is claiming a short squeeze, it's probably just that that person wants everyone to pile into that stock so that their options/stocks gain value and could make a quick exit. So, the intention is to create a pump and dump scheme. You may make money if you are early, but most likely you are not early at all.

[Short squeeze](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp)

Also, do understand that if someone says hedgies are manipulating the market or things like that, be very sceptical. Are you sure that the person saying that isn't manipulating you? Are you sure that the person saying that is not some fund manager/high net worth individual influencing you to buy some shitty options that they want to sell?

Market is influenced/manipulated by everything. Your buying and selling is also a form of manipulation. So understand this, don't fall for ""Hedgies manipulating this stock, if you buy it, you will stick it to the hedgies"" narrative.

We are here to make money through short term positions, not to be manipulated by some idealistic rant.

&#x200B;

* Everything is not a gamma squeeze. I saw a post today about Gamma squeeze, and that's what made me write this post.

[Here's the link to that wsb post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/prcdnr/why_you_suck_ass_at_gamma_squeezing_and_what_you/)

[What is Gamma?](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamma.asp) I think if you follow this investopedia article and read through the various links linked there, you will under pretty easily.

&#x200B;

* Understand the basics of options, seriously, you don't even know what an options chain is (that happene), yet you are throwing money at some random redditors words, that's just bad for your financial health. Seriously. **You shouldn't touch options until you realise what you are doing. If you lose money after you realise what you are doing, well, that's all right.**

You will find plenty of free materials online that might help you with it. If I were to give you a suggestion about a book, well, ""Option volatility and pricing strategies"" by Sheldon Natenberg may help you with it.

&#x200B;

* Puts are not bad and is not equivalent to burning money. Puts and swaps are instruments that could be really useful in a trading plan. Understand this. If buying puts is really equivalent to burning money, then why do all these huge investors do it? Because they are retarded? Not really.   
Why are puts generally more expensive than calls?

They work like insurance. If you are making 10% or maybe 500%😂 or maybe even more gains a year, it makes sense that you keep your wealth preserved. If someone is warning doom and gloom, you won't have to lose your sleep, because you know when the time comes, you won't be the  💼 holder.

&#x200B;

* Special dividend doesn't make a stock suddenly worth it to buy. I have seen some dumb plays being shared in wsb that company Something (I forgot the company ticker) is going to announce special dividend, so let's just buy the stock. Unless you can create such a hype that autists pile onto the stock for no reason, then special dividend suddenly doesn't really change things.

The market will adjust the amount of special dividend that will be given. An options seller will also adjust the price of the options that you are going to buy. So, special dividend is a zero sum game or a rather negative sum game, cause you might create a taxable event which could impact you in the future.

&#x200B;

* Bonds are not lame. It is an instrument that may not have its applicability in this sub, but to imply that anyone who buys bonds is burning money or to create false rumours to that extent is really misleading and I have seen lots of redditors imply this.

Did you know that up until 2020, long term treasury bonds outperformed S&P 500 (dividend inclusive) for the last 20 years before that? [Sauce](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/business/bonds-beat-stocks-over-20-years.html)

Although this trend will not be seen any time in the future any longer as bond yields are just too low. That's why we are finally seeing some inflows into stocks instead of outflows from it.

&#x200B;

* Understand the taxes that you might have to pay, before you gamble and use tax sheltering facilities that the government is providing you. I don't know if you are a US retard or not, but to my knowledge, most countries have some form of tax advantages or som schemes similar to that, use that to gamble your money.

Taxes have destroyed many a gamblers life. They won money in a play. Sold. Then lost all or some of it in another play, in some cases (not all), you might actually owe taxes to the tax authority that you don't even have.

This is a very country and individual circumstances specific thing, so I can't really tell you how best to save on taxes unless I know in detail about your circumstances. But for Americans hope this [will help start in your journey.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxshelter.asp)

Also, to add to this, I have seen probably some very dumb comments of people saying things like ""I would owe more taxes if I make more money that's why I am making less money"", don't be that guy.

&#x200B;

* Be sceptical. This is the best thing to understand. Even if you ignore all of my other points, don't ignore this, just be more sceptical. No one lost money by not entering a play. Someone is showing rocket emojis, dildos, some gibberish, drawing, meme etc to induce you to buy something, be sceptical. Why is that person pumping AAPL (although very few may have lost money in that), what is his motive? Why is he writing such a long essay on that particular stock? Ask questions. 

You should also ask the question why I am writing this? What's my motive? Etc etc.

&#x200B;

* Don't trust the comments, do your own DD. Seriously. You might see a lot of coordinated efforts if you really dig into some of the profiles.

&#x200B;

* Technical analysis is not astrology for men. While I don't use technical analysis much, technical analysis in its core, just shows you where the buyers and sellers are. And it can be helpful to enter and exit a trade.

Remember, for every time you are buying something, someone else is selling those something. Technical analysis can easily show you where buyer and sellers are meeting the most in a condensed format.

Understanding it might help you position, enter, exit and most importantly discipline your trades.

Does it mean that you should just follow the cup and handle pattern and buy things? No. It is a tool, much like every other tool a gambler can have in their belt.

&#x200B;

* CPI is not a sham. I have seen people claim general inflation has been 10% or whatever imaginary number for the last 2 decade and things like that. And I am unable to neither laugh nor react to it.

To understand CPI, you gotta understand the composition of the CPI.

Some say, CPI doesn't include housing consumption, which is laughable. [Here you will find CPI weights of each sector.](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf) The question if CPI includes hous or not is answered by this [paper](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2008/08/art1full.pdf) succinctly.

You might see people use a source like shadowstats, which is essentially a completely flawed website. Here's some reading [material.](https://www.thestreet.com/economonitor/emerging-markets/deconstructing-shadowstats-why-is-it-so-loved-by-its-followers-but-scorned-by-economists)

Yes, CPI has some flaws, but it is not a sham like people try to make it out to be. If inflation is really 10% or 8%, why are commercial banks lending money at such a low rate? Wouldn't they have become bankrupt within this 2 decade?? Better yet, if you really believe that inflation is something percent, put your money where your mouth is and buy up everything you see in Walmart and try to sell that 1 year later also using the low interest environment in your favour.

&#x200B;

*  I have seen many more rumours or other bogus claims but I feel like I should get some sleep, so I am stopping here. Other kind redditor may continue from here in the comments section. To give you some hints about some other false rumours, they are mostly about Chinese tech giants like Alibaba; about [quantitative easing and inflation  misconceptions](https://www.lynalden.com/inflation/) or even misconceptions about cry pto etc.

Hope this helps in clearing out some confusion and have a nice night. And if you have seen or know about some other mistakes or misconceptions people have, please do share!"

pqps2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqps2l/whats_going_on_with_you_apes_complaining/,What’s going on with you “apes” complaining?,193,134,2021-09-19 00:39:42,"Alright let me explain something.

People are on here complaining saying “oh why are all these stocks being discussed”, WSB isn’t the same. “I remember when we used to only YOLO on solid fundamental companies like TSLA &amp; APPLE so that if you fucked up your trade at least your not bagholding”.

First off, shut the fuck up. I do agree that the sentiment has changed a bit since prior to January 2021, but do you even know what WSB is about?

It’s about finding good trades that can like 5x to 10x your profits which also comes with high risk aka High Risk, High Reward trades … like 1-0DTE SPY calls or puts.

I’m not pushing $IRNT here, but I’m holding my bag until next week to see what happens. I think with its setup, high OI% for October, high SI%, and high CTB% that there’s something unique to come of it, “potentially”.

Fuck for a lot of you on here, prior to two weeks ago had no idea what a super 8-k was or a company completing a stock redemption from a DeSpac.

I’m in full exceptante of the L’s I take as it was my choice to partake. I can imagine posters of DD getting flack from people not getting “GaINs” or losing a fuck ton of money blame posters or ask them questions like, hey man I just dropped a bag on this stock how fucked am I? No one is going to answer you. That was your choice to play that play.

People complaining of stocks in this sub-reddit this week and saying ah man I miss the old days; when 95% of you weren’t even here back then.

You want to know why the DeSpacs high redemption are being discussed? Because of their Super 8-k (Redemption) and Option Chain activity.

These types of stocks can lead to gamma squeezes and high return for those who got in early before IV and on the run up when the stock was illiquid and IV is low, if that stock pops off, again, High Risk to High Reward plays, then that make sense.

For example, until lock up expires for the PIPE investors, I’ll use $IRNT as an example, it still has absurd Option Chain activity for October, high short interest, high CTB, closed at $30 which indicates to me dumb money is still holding strong, and a very small float that moves easily and has been proven to do so.

So, for me I’m rolling the dice and playing this into next week to see. But here’s the thing, I ChOsE tO tAkE tHaT rIsK … because I knew why I was going into that trade and if I get burnt that’s on me and me only, there’s no one else to blame but myself and some of you are forgetting that.

DeSpacs are hot right now because some of them have potential to make good money if your lucky and smart.

Plays like $IRNT are unique and if anything remind me more of old WSB rather then the current buy $WISH or buy $CLNE type shit.

There’s a lot of interesting plays out there as of lately, but don’t ever bitch and complain to a Mod or Redditor because your down and didn’t know why you got into  a trade.

This isn’t fucking Safe—Moon you quacks. If that’s your mentality then go join a subreddit similar to that.

This is a place where we take bets on trades that have at least some form of logical reasoning as a catalyst to occur.

Whether it be an Option Chain activity, highly shorted with a catalyst, Oversold, Calls or Puts because of JPowws money printer goes Brrrr, etc.

If you can’t eat a loss based on your own decision gracefully, and go straight to blaming others, then get the fuck out this sub.

Sincere regards,

Edit: I want to be clear, I don’t post shit to receive awards or upvotes or any glorification about anything that I post. I post when I feel people don’t understand something or when I see an opportunity etc. I also read other redditors post for the same reasons.

This shit could get downvoted to oblivion and like I said, idgaf about Karma points etc. This is staying up unless a Mod takes it down. 

TL;DR - Don’t blame others for your decisions. There’s logical reasons why certain stocks apart from playing SPY weeklies etc are being traded on."

Low float/volume make it a squeeze candidate which would just be icing on the cake.

Wrote this DD over at another sub Reddit a while ago and after today felt it was worth sharing. I see a lot of risky gaming happening on high redemption plays and while I’m not saying you can’t make money that way, a lot of those dynamics exist here AND it’s an actual quality business that is undervalued relative to peers. Would check it out and consider parking a sliver of your capital here. 

As noted at the end I have a large position in this one that I’ve continued to build over the last 4-6 months. My intention isn’t be a shill — I’m very confident institutional money will move this anyhow. And I won’t dilute it to four bullet points either. Intention is serious evaluation for more long-term holders.

Good luck out there all!

**Team Background and Historic Context**

Sponsor is Trie Wind Capital. Their first deal like this, LPRO, consistently trades in the $35-40 range despite most post-merge companies getting demolished. It’s a high-growth, high-margin fintech company that works in the automotive financing space, connecting credit unions and applicants for credit without taking any balance sheet risk. The use analytics to help banks and insurance companies underwrite the credit. Not sexy. Right? Wrong. The deal was priced at a material discount to its peers in the fintech world. It took a bit, but the market suddenly realized one week that it’s not every day you can pick up a 40% grower with 70% EBITDA margins for \~10x revenue. It then ripped.

The team is mostly ex-KKR guys, one of the most successful private equity firms ever. Period full stop. So its no surprise they knew how to negotiate and deliver a strong deal that made sense for their investors and themselves.

I mention this because the same exact team is using the same exact blueprint for Cellebrite, and it’s why I am taking a big bite of the apple for the long haul on this one.

**Cellebrite Overview**

Cellebrite is a mission-critical and end-to-end digital intelligence platform with two key products:

1. Collect and Review: Extracts and decodes data from almost all digital sources, allowing the users to unlock evidence-based data to uncover crime and fraud. This is literally the product the FBI uses to crack terrorist’s phones and laptops. It’s the world leader in its category.
2. Analyze: AI-based analyses that provide insights on large amounts of data. Think Palantir for investigations. Customers report that the product accelerates investigation times by 30x, and given the nature of the investigations they often have no time to waste. Customers love the product (which is shown in the historic financials which I’ll get to in a bit)

The business has a huge amount of sticky, long-term contracts. They quote over 100 North American Federal Institutions, over 2,700 State and Local institutions (everything from local police departments to state departments), and some marquee enterprises. The Enterprise segment is the most exciting portion of this business – they have anchor clients that include 9/10 of the top accounting firms, 9/10 of the top software companies, and 8/10 of the top commercial banks in the US. These anchor logos, along with their history of serving elite government institutions, establishes a level of credibility that will allow them to move down the market as cybersecurity becomes a larger and larger part of everyday life for businesses of all sizes.

**Investment Thesis**

Win. Retain. Upsell.

1. Cellebrite is a dominant leader in its space. We call these businesses “category killers”. Currently, 90% of public safety agencies in the US are customers. More impressively, the business has nearly a 100% win rate when going up against peers for contracts. In other words, as soon as a customer needs a solution, Cellebrite is almost guaranteed to win the contract based on historic win rates
2. THE RETENTION! Holy cow. You do not see retention metrics like this in all but the most mission-critical products. Cellebrite has 140% net retention. This means that all customers are spending 40% more each year on Cellebrite than they were the prior year. Barely any are cancelling their contracts, and most folks are instead INCREASING the amount of products they use from Cellebrite. This is enormously impressive. We hope to see 90% net retention on most businesses. Anything above 100% is considered stellar. Anything above 115% is considered anomalous. 140%? Almost unheard of for a business that has been around this long. In other words, once Cellebrite wins a contract (point 1), they are highly unlikely to lose that revenue in the future – in fact, they’re likely to increase it by 1.4x per year!
3. Continued product expansion: The reason why net retention is 140% is because most people start out using collection and review and then, upon seeing how strong it is, immediately buy more products to analyze the data, etc. On average, the difference between just the collection and review product and the full suite is 5x the revenue. Cellebrite has an enormous opportunity to increase revenue within its customer base even without winning new customers…and from point (1) we know that they do win new customers with a nearly 100% rate. The growth opportunity is incredibly strong, and it’s why they’ve grown their ARR \~50% in the last year.

**Incredibly Attractive Deal – Sponsor-Friendly Structure and Great Valuation**

The True Wind team has decided to defer 100% of their sponsor shares until they reach price targets. They receive 40% of their shares once the stock sustains a trading level at $12.50, 40% of their shares once the stock sustains a trading level at $15.00, **and 20% of their shares once the stock sustains a trading level at $30.00.** In other words, the sponsor team believes that, just like their last deal LPRO, this business will be trading at $30.00 within the year. Why?

Valuation. As I mentioned earlier, this is the same exact playbook they used with LPRO. They gave up their shares until the business performed, putting their money where their mouth is. And the reason they are so confidence is how they priced the deal.

[Cellebrite](https://preview.redd.it/ckvv01nszcu61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb82ee51d3b940c3bcc99bebf035f1dddf121070)

[LPRO](https://preview.redd.it/k6cnipytzcu61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f95bc5fd494ec7b49c9c4f32c676a9dbc15aa333)

Look familiar? Based on the competitive names in the space and how the market views them, Cellebrite should be trading at a much higher multiple than where they priced the deal. Just like last time, the market will quickly correct that gap and earn them their sponsor shares. If the market were to value Cellebrite at the regression-implied multiple given their growth, it would be worth \~$3.1 billion today. That is a 1.7x times greater than this deal value. In other words, the stock should trade at $17.00 out of the gates and increase and the business performs through increasing margin from scale and executing M&A.

Finally, a major PIPE participant was strategic competitor Axon. This business is a clear acquisition target for them, and many strategics like to get a toe hold in businesses they may acquire down the line. This is a heavily bullish indicator.

**Summary**

1. The business is a category killer and the best at what it does
2. The cyber market is not going anywhere and continues to grow as we are an increasingly digital society both personally and in business
3. The business wins almost every deal that comes to market
4. Of the customers it wins, they spend \~40% more each year on the product
5. The sponsor has given up all its shares until they hit targets. They are confident and putting their money where their mouth is
6. The deal terms point to an undervalued business that should immediately swing up once the market does its diligence. 
7. A major strategic invested heavily into the PIPE demonstrating the businesses’ strength relative to competition and its attractiveness as an acquisition target

**Risks**

A large part of the value generation in this thesis is on the relative undervaluation of the asset against peers and closing that gap. If there's a broader market correction, the regression line could shift and hamper the thesis there.

Beyond that, cyber continues to be a highly competitive space and that pressure could result in higher R&D spend / capex in the event competition devleops products of similar quality. The result would be a compressing margin profile and/or cash flow

There's potential reputational risk if someone uses the product for bad purposes (a la PLTR)

Hampered growth from a decrease in the net retention rate (unlikely to stay at 140% forever because that's ridiculously good) will need to be replaced by net new adds and upsell into that client base. 

**Final Words and My Positioning**

I am long this business. I personally picked up a material amount of warrants (~20k) when the were $1.40ish and have continued to add those, shares, and recently a couple calls. Given the sponsor doesn’t earn a single share until it hits $12.50 and doesn’t get its full payout until it hits $30.00, I’m confident on this bet and willing to buy into warrants here. These guys are all ex-KKR guys who know what they’re doing.

As analyst coverage continues to come out this one will continue receive attention and volume will increase on a low float (Cowen initiated at $20 PT…the SPAC underwriters were Citi and DB so those are likely suspects. GS picked up coverage on their last deal as well so the True Wind guys clearly have connections). Once people discover and zero in on it think this thing is gone. So, like the KKR guys who inked the deal, I am putting my money where my mouth is.

Position: 30k warrants @ $1.50, ~1k shares @ $11.00, 10 10c 4/22"

To put this in perspective, Shopify did 2.9 billion in revenue with a 180 billion market cap. On top of that, Wish has 1.6 Billion in cash and no debt. I believe Wish is way oversold and undervalued.

  
After processing new information (Q2 results and management outlook for upcoming quarters), Wish's fair value is $14.77 per share. At $6, Wish is massively undervalued, and current prices are likely driven by a market overreaction to the Q2 earnings report and bearish all around short term market sentiment. I sold my AAPL and TSLA shares and doubled down on Wish this week.

Position: 20k USD in Wish shares at average prices of $7"

That is all changing this week.

There were 180 million in the OS as the spac SRN G. %50 was redeemed leaving 87 million. Now subtract the 20 million that ARK owns and IS NOT SELLING as ARK is a large part invested in the PIPE and you are down to 65 million. Now subtract the 10 million that CDEL owns. 55 million. Now take away %50 of that that people who are in for the long haul are not selling. You are down to perhaps only 25 million in the float. 

Think about it...Ark and cathie own almost %50 of the tradeable float. It is unreal.

However there is something that is being overlooked that can change everything.

Recalls aren't going to last much longer and already #peloton has restarted selling their less expensive tread mill.  However although #pton's success in the short term might rely on hardware sales, the long term outlook is all about subscriptions and engagement. 

Peloton is the clear leader in this space and has branded itself as both quality and luxury.   Forward projections have been based on current market size which I believe is the big mistake.

There is growing competition coming from other companies such as #Tonal, #nordik,  #mirror, and even #apple that is weighing on stock holders.   However what's being missed is the behavioral changes that will be created by all of these new options.   The market size for at home fitness is about to grow dramatically!

For example - 5 years ago only a couple people if that many worked out at home with any equipment at all.   There was 0 community and besides a few popular dvds and TV shows, home workouts was a disconnected and lonely experience.   Instead friends and partners would gather at gyms and clubs to get fit and be social.  However the trend is moving towards at home fitness and the pace will accelerate exponentially over the next few years.   Those same 5 friends you met at the gym will be connected at home and battling or supporting each other with online fitness communities.    

So if your family, friends and co-workers are working out at home, then guess where you will be?   Brings us back to Peloton being the clear leader but then again why must there be only one?   If Apple brings 10million into the market,  there is going to be a good portion that say this at home fitness is great but I also need a good treadmill, bike or perhaps rower.   Those loving their tonals can easily afford a #pton bike and most likely will have one for status anyway.    Everyone working out from home taking selfies could want the best fitness outfits and that could also be #peloton.  

My projections- Overall Peloton subscriptions will only go higher and higher.  The vast majority of peloton users love it and rave about it.   They will sport their outfits with pride and this company will grow to over 50million users world wide within 5 years."

AAPL: The apple event was a huge bust and the stock has tumbled one entire percent on the news that the next iphone is going to be 5% better than the current iPhone, as always. Mentions really began to spike at the start of the event.

FCEL: A new ticker on this list. FCEL is up 12%. I believe they are reporting earnings today after the bell, so watch the fuk out.

CLOV: 10 million apes waiting for the CLOV squeeze to happen. The stock is pretty much flat today and only down 0.5% instead of 10% for once.

TSLA & GME: These bad boys are always on the top 5 list. GME squeeze will happen any day now. Keep an eye out for posts that say ""Why GME should be $10,000 per share""... those kinds of posts are usually filled with ~~genius~~ autistic advice

With partnerships already in place, I wouldn’t be surprised if they announce it with Affirm or Goldman Sachs.  Their credit card is with a partnership with Goldman Sachs and some early reports were that Apple was going to partner with Goldman for the BNPL service. However, Apple went with Affirm for Apple Canada.

There are several articles so Just google it since if I post a link I’ll probably do it wrong.  

The open interest for GS for this Friday at 410 and 415 is huge.  If the stock runs a little on the news, it will potentially run a lot.  Affirm has a fairly low float so it runs by leaps and bounds like we have all seen in the last month.  I think it’s going to be GS.  They want into the fin tech space and Cramer who is a GS insider made an interesting statement this morning.  He said that he thinks Apple is going to announce BNPL at the event today.  With his connections, I wouldn’t be surprised if he knew something…

I have 1 415 C for Friday (17th).   I don’t have crazy Ape money to risk…just wanted to share my idea and see what you all think.  

Edit:  I went ahead and bought shares at 405.  With a PE of 7.5 this seems like a low risk or the bottom falling out of it.  Financial stocks might do pretty well in the near term anyway."

Market crashes are supposed to be catastrophic. Shocking. UNEXPECTED.

If it is expected, it is already priced in.

The meth-ed out cashier at my local McDonalds has known that tapering is coming soon for months now. PRICED IN.

There will be corrections in some valuations, yes. I'm not saying that all valuations are reasonable right now. But why would the whole fucking thing crash? Literally everyone wants to buy the dip. PRICED IN.

You think the market will crash because 14k Reddit geniuses upvoted a post about the market crashing? PRICED IN.

You're telling me you wouldn't go all in on FAANG/FAAMG/FAGMAN if they dipped 20% tomorrow? (For the CLOVtards in the audience, 20% is the minimum dip required for a market correction). I would fucking jizz all up in my brand new Lululemon ABC Slim-Fit Joggers if I could buy Google at $2200 or Apple at $120.

Nobody is smarter than the market. Especially you.

&#x200B;

We can all agree that if you post on WSB, you're not very smart. And the longer you're here, the more not smarter you get. Sometimes they don't think it be like it is, but it do.

&#x200B;

So with this understanding that your capacity to rub two neurons together is rapidly becoming a herculean task, you may as well keep a needle on what the smart people are doing in the market. With the advent of the Federal Reserve having decided that they will force inject money into the market, you need to figure out who is 'in the know' regarding near term federal policy.

&#x200B;

Enter Eric Rosengren and Robert Kaplan. Who are they? Well you sentient chair warmer, the former is the Boston Fed Chief and the latter is the Dallas Fed President. Both of these people have recently come under scrutiny for having the ""appearance of conflicts of interest"" in having sold millions of dollars worth of stocks amid the rapid growth after March of 2020. [Example.](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/fed-presidents-kaplan-rosengren-share-trades-conflicts-interest-apple-tesla-2021-09)

>Two Federal Reserve regional presidents apologized on Thursday for [**multi-million-dollar share purchases**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/robert-kaplan-stock-trades-apple-tesla-federal-reserve-president-2021-9?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) that generated the ""appearance"" of conflicts of interest, according to multiple reports.  
>  
>In simultaneous statements, Dallas and Boston Fed presidents Robert Kaplan and Eric Rosengren expressed regret for their investment decisions, which involved purchases of big-name firms like Apple, Alibaba, and Tesla.  
>  
>""I have made the decision to divest these assets to underscore my commitment to Fed ethics guidelines,"" said Rosengren, per a Financial Times [**report**](https://www.ft.com/content/696b1d6b-3643-45c7-96dd-cf58a9b31cb7). ""It is extremely important to me to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest.""  
>  
>Similarly, Kaplan said he wanted to ""avoid even the appearance of any conflict of interest.""

Now think about this appearance of impropriety. They have effectively been caught red handed doing what we all know and love, insider trading. So what should be the result? Divesting of profit, perhaps?

&#x200B;

Well think again, ya dingus. Apparently, all it takes to resolve this issue of impropriety is to finalize it by selling the stocks that have appreciated in value. In other words, *finish the job*. Come September 30, Kaplan and Rosengren will dutifully sell their positions on individual stocks, and hold this appreciated value in either broad index funds **or** cash equivalents. [Source.](https://news.yahoo.com/fed-officials-kaplan-rosengren-sell-143239456.html)

In my suspicion, this provides two people that are ingrained in the Federal Reserve's strategy an out. They were able to hustle for over a year on several stocks that made rapid gains as a result of their policies, and now they are making the personal sacrifice to sell off their positions for profit in public view because ""it's the right thing to do."" In the event that we see a massive decline and point to Kaplan and Rosengren having sold right before Fed policy changes cause a massive drop, they can simply say ""I just happened to get out due to ethical obligations."" 

Neither of these two are obligated to hold positions tied to the market as they can hold these now secured gains in cash. Convenient, especially in light of the growing concern that the Fed's overarching recovery strategy [has not been working at intended.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-economic-policy-powell-inflation-51631120497) In a nutshell:

1. The post-2010 recovery was the weakest since WWII
2. The Fed cannot get a handle on inflation rates
3. Economic inequality has become even more substantial

What do you even call the opposite of a hat trick? At the Fed, I would surmise that its called ""radical change in what we do, and soon."" Powell and the rest of the Fed understands that the issue with these policy disasters is not knowing that you need to get out--its knowing that every day that passes makes a resulting correction more substantial. And in this case, we're talking about ripping off a band-aid that is covering a gunshot wound to the saphenous vein so we can hopefully live long enough to suture it. 

**TL;DR**

Fed big bois selling their stocks at the high under the mask of being the right thing to do. Fed knows it botched the economic recovery and needs to shift gears now or cause even greater harm. Insiders at the Fed are getting out of their positions by the end of the month. Follow the people that have their fingers on the buttons.

**Planned position:** 

SPY Long 440P, Short 420P Expiration 11/19/21. Spread premium is $4.41, underlying target price is 380 by 10/15, giving the spread a profit of $14.88. Entering this position this week."

You may have seen my recent $SPY 100P 100 Bagger play which is of course the greatest hedge in existence to date or older plays like $ZIM and $WOOF. Basically, I clearly know what I’m doing.

Today I decided I’m bored of YOLOing meme stocks and spent several hours jacking off until I could find the next play of the century. See, over this past year, I have had 5000% gains while in mid-June I dipped to 3000%. However, as of this week, I have finally recovered my bags and reached all-time highs at 7000% gains.

[I'll be at 1000000&#37; soon. ](https://preview.redd.it/hidiiraorym71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbfbae38250692d7e6dd860af20d74532df818b7)

As the post-nut clarity hit, I reached peak nirvana, utilizing the powers of u/1ronyman, u/SirYoloGod, and my own past of degeneracy to achieve Tim Cock levels of wealth (looks like $AAPL shit itself so maybe he’s a poor now).  I have come up with the ultimate play to help every single person go from **Bags to Bitches**, just like I am.

Climate change is taking over everything you hold near and dear. Extreme temperatures and the frequent cum shower from u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT have destroyed thousands of homes, businesses, and lives. Got a basement? You’re fucked. Like food? You’re fucked. Want a city job? You’re fucked. (Good thing you won’t need one after this play).

[ This will probably happen next year and hurricane season peaks around now, so I think my plays are safe. ](https://preview.redd.it/dokmf1g2rym71.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e8606bb9d234f81ef516dbbf9b0e1dafc6dfd38)

**Where others find this to be sad, I find this to be BULLISH AS FUCK. It raises Bullcock Flags all around me and makes me wonder why you retards haven’t made a play like this before.**

**Bags to Bitches In 5 Steps:**

1. I’m going to recommend the forbidden fund. Invest 80% of your portfolio in PIMCO’s [$PSLDX fund](https://www.pimco.com/en-us/investments/mutual-funds/stocksplus-long-duration-fund/inst). Most brokerages have a minimum investment amount so you need at least $25k on boomer Vanguard. Don’t be VOOrgin, buy PIMCO. **This fund gives 17-20% of boomer gains per year by beating SPY 2x over, over the past 2 years. They also crash less in case SPY somehow does go to $300 (SPY only goes up though).**  Using the available 2x leverage for mutual funds, I will put 200% of my account (as margin) into $PSLDX, giving me an **actual gain of 34 to 40% per year for free.** With an expense ratio of 0.59% and margin interest of around 4.5%, my final profits from this alone are **29% to 35%.**
2. Next, I will take out the profits each month (about 2.5% to 3% of the entire port) and YOLO them into CME Weather Contracts. Wtf are those you ask? Well basically, you can bet on the weather, and more specifically, temperatures for various US and European cities. As we all know, just like how stocks only go up, average global temperatures also only go up now!
3. At the end of each month, I will flip the current profits from my weather contracts into the PIMCO fund (estimated $1M) each time, and then further increase my monthly income by $20-30k.
4. **Based on the compounding effect**, if I continue to take these 2-3% profits from $PSLDX and flip them to the appropriate weather contract each month, I will reach **$1.2B** in about 13 months, about 3 months earlier than u/SirYoloGod.
5. Retire in Malta with lots of bitches. I’m a sigma chad ofc so this part might be hard for a lot of you.

New York winters are milder now so I will be buying calls on the HDD (Heating Degree Day) futures contracts. This should give me approximately **570x leverage** on my position. Based on my calculations here is the payout as follows:

**Stats:**

* Timeframe: September 2021 - December 2021 (For now)
* Seasonal 10-year average for New York: 3700
* Strike prices: 4050
* Option premium: $2000 per contract
* Premium: $16,000 (max potential loss)
* Max potential payout: $3,500,000

**Furthermore, I challenge** u/SirYoloGod **in the race to $1B. May the best leverage god win.**

**TLDR; I will be buying Weather Futures Options for maximum leverage and reach $1B in a little over a year.**"

[Canoo pickup truck](https://preview.redd.it/76aswan72rm71.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=635a1f44992e767571b2291718d2df152b05aecf)

I am deeply attracted by the bold designs by Canoo at first sight even though most of those EVs are designed for business/workers instead of individual customers and really wish that I could own a truck or a van like that in the near future.  Yet shorts seem dominating the SP of the ticker and scare retailers away. There was a small short squeeze (up 30% without news) happened weeks ago but that's not the reason I create the post. I want to share all the knowledge I have about the company to discuss whether it is a good short term and long term investment. Potential short squeeze is of course a plus but that's not what I pursue here.

&#x200B;

**Why shorts are hunting Canoo**

Canoo was founded in 2017 by executives from BMW, Tesla, Ford, etc and went public last year. The main reason shorts crowded in is the disastrous earning call in March, where the previous CEO Ulrich (along with chief lawyer Andrew) stepped away and the new CEO Tony took over the company.  The change of executives also triggered a SEC investigation on the company. Meanwhile, Canoo does not have cars in production yet and blew off the deals with Apple and Hyundai. Those negative news hence scared away retail investors and shorts come in and took over.

&#x200B;

[MPDV I](https://preview.redd.it/l21zt3w92rm71.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b116f98f8210896dcbec741cd546a055cb9b44c)

&#x200B;

**Why I view the change of CEO positive**

Ulrich was later hired by Apple. (FYI, Apple reached Canoo in 2019 and 2020 for acquisition but Canoo turned it down. Canoo said that they don't want acquisition but investment.) Although many people view Ulrich's stepping down as a negative news, I view it differently.  The main disagreement between Ulrich and the board (including the new CEO Tony who invested $75million of his own money into the company), as I understand it,  is the business model and directions. Ulrich wants to create a subscription model for their vehicles (companies subscribe/lease vehicles) yet I don't think the Canoo board agreed. We have to admit that Ulrich contributed significantly to Canoo as Chief Technology Officer yet I don't think he can be a qualified CEO leading the company to right business model.  Tony, on the contrary, has abundant success business records.

&#x200B;

**What has changed after March.**

Everyone seems keeping those bad memories of Canoo after the earning call and no one really cares about what is really going on under the new leadership.  Facts below:

&#x200B;

* Canoo received $300M incentives from the Oklahoma government to build their factory. FYI, Rivian (pre-IPO which is valued $80B) received $350M from the Texas government. I don't think those state governors are morons. The question is why Oklahoma governments picked Canoo instead of all other 'promising' EV companies out there. (source: [https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538811/canoo-ev-factory-oklahoma-electric-vehicles-vdl-nedcar](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538811/canoo-ev-factory-oklahoma-electric-vehicles-vdl-nedcar))
* Canoo received 10,000 orders from FRONTdoor Collective executives (source: [https://www.freightwaves.com/news/qa-frontdoor-collective-executives-explain-importance-of-franchised-dsp-network](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/qa-frontdoor-collective-executives-explain-importance-of-franchised-dsp-network))
* Canoo has 9,500 non biding orders from individual customers.
* Canoo has signed contract with VDL Nedcar ( that produced BMW in Europe) source ([https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-names-vdl-nedcar-as-contract-manufacturing-partner](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-names-vdl-nedcar-as-contract-manufacturing-partner)) Their first batch of car will be on market in 2022q4.
* Canoo has been hunting for talents: the number of employees jumped from \~200 to \~700 and most of them are engineers. They have the ambassador Josette on board as the new president ( believe her connections can win Canoo government and international orders). (source: [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/canoo-names-ambassador-josette-sheeran-president-301340683.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/canoo-names-ambassador-josette-sheeran-president-301340683.html))
* Meanwhile, I think that Canoo has some news being held (The CEO mentioned in q2 earning call and there is either no news or big news), they have been actively expanding different markets (pest control, delivery. They attended different expos (ACT expo for example)  and received a lot of interests from companies like UPS for their MPDV type, they speak on Panel at World's Largest Mobility Event, etc.
* Rumors still stir around about the Apple and Canoo thing. I think as long as the price is seductive, there are always possibilities. I see a more possible situation as that Canoo focuses on hardware while Apple contributes the softwares (autonomous driving).

&#x200B;

**What is the core technology behind Canoo**Skateboard technology + versatile/flexible modules. The skateboard technology they own saves a lot of space and create more rooms for passengers.  The modulization gives the advantage of customization and reduce the production cost as well.  Their MPDVs (MPDV I, II and III with different sizes) and Lifestyles Vans are to B while the pickup truck (expected to go to market in 2023) are to C. But I personally would like to customize a MPDV for traveling as well![https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-shows-off-performance-and-versatility-of-skateboard-platform-for-the-first-time-in-video](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-shows-off-performance-and-versatility-of-skateboard-platform-for-the-first-time-in-video)

**TL;DR**Canoo has $563.6 million in cash and $300million incentives received from the Oklahoma government. This combines into $863.6 million. The company currently valued at $1.65B (less than 2x of the cash equivalents the companies owned), which is far undervalued compared with its peers. It is like $NIO when it was at $3. Short float reported as 40% but it should be much higher than this.  This is the company that Apple reached for acquisition not a long time ago, and rumors and speculation still stirs around about the collaboration. Their design of vehicles always remind me of the feeling that I first time saw iphone 3gs.

Because why would they release iPhone 13 because number 13 is unlucky number and who wants unlucky phone (iPhone 13) because there is high risk that it will blow up.

Today's top mentions include the #1 take-over by Apple that occurred over the last 30 minutes. Here they are:

&#x200B;

* AAPL: Apple became the #1 stock mentioned on WSB at exactly 11:20am. What happened? The share price went from +0.50% to -3% in a matter of minutes. It's actually amazing how fast WSB is to take note of any action in the market. The correlating AAPL chart is below so you can see the change of mentions on the first chart vs the stock price.
* CLOV: This stock seems to have taken the #1 squeeze name on WSB. My theory is that AMC and GME are old news and now CLOV, which is seemingly under-valued from reaching almost $30 just a couple months ago, has the potential to fly again.
* CCJ: A new name on the list and kind of unusual for WSB (uranium play??). WSB knows the power of uranium since a lot of members are probably buying uranium ore and storing it under their pillow versus just buying the stock.
* AMC: AMC nothing new here.
* TSLA: Elon tweets are keeping this stock alive as traders patiently wait for the next gamma squeeze.

Guidance for Q3 is expected to hit 233m. I think the expectations are lowballed and Affirm will outdo them. The price has cooled down a bit since its recent jump, and this stock has already seen a lot of volume at higher prices than it is at today.

**Increasing consumer adoption**

When Afterpay started becoming successful, Affirm started attempts to move towards being a consumer company in a similar vein, which seems to be paying off now. Their app downloads this Quarter were the best they have ever been, and much higher than in the same quarter of last year.

https://preview.redd.it/6acfw397jhm71.png?width=1615&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee1c355673cb256324d8a2ebd159b03fbf0a510e

**Partners outdoing expectations**

Affirm's biggest customer is Peloton who just had a mixed quarter. However hardware sales were still solid and I don't think the product recall will be taken up by too many people. Walmart and Target both just had big quarters, as well as the travel industry were travel bookings were up bigly in Q2 (although the outlook of those is a bit more mixed now with the Delta variant), Bestbuy, Figs, etc.. Referrals to Affirm's website from partners (what happens when you click on the ""Pay with Affirm"" button on e.g. Walmart's website) increased steadily since the beginning of this year. 

&#x200B;

**Industry trends in BNPL favoring Affirm**

With partnerships with Amazon and Shopify, Affirm is now a fixed player in ecommerce. Those companies prefer to keep the number of payment options low, so it is unlikely they will ever add more BNPL companies/loaners or replace Affirm. Affirm is now tied to 4 out of the Top 5 ecommerce companies and just launched a Canadian partnership with the 5th one (Apple). Affirm is probably the only pure play BNPL provider that can't be commoditized away. There will be some more consolidation to come for sure and I think these markets are pretty hot right now.

**Positions**

Since IV is quite high for my taste, I decided to go with a bull spread for this play. I'm pretty confident that numbers will be good and the stock price will at least be stable. I reach my maximum profit if Affirm is trading over 90 by expiry. Maximum profit and loss are both 24k.

Fellow retard here that wants to help someone potentially make some tendies.

The reason i'm not heavy in options is: **1.) the IV is too high**  • **2.) the stock is under $10  • 3.) I'm retarded**

# Synopsis:

I usually think of getting into a position based on where I think the company can disrupt inside of current culture. Now I don't know about you, but in today's world of free porn, the ability to swipe on hundreds of potential matches (bumble/tinder) has put a lot of pressure on guys/girls to look and feel their best. But who wants to walk into a doctors office and tell the 75 year old man that he is having a hard time getting it up? Or that his hair is going away? Or that she wants to clear those dots off her skin. It's 2021. Can't we text you?

***$HIMS takes away the pressure of going to a doctor to try and explain why you want some blue bombers. If you could save yourself the embarrassment of telling another soul that you want to rock your girl's world without saying it face to face - wouldn't you?***

# Technicals (here comes the crayons):

[If anyone believes in voodoo magic, that is a breakout of a loooonnng wedge. ](https://preview.redd.it/xrrtjernihm71.png?width=1278&format=png&auto=webp&s=2283c05f94c4e49e58f67d9f89a3dd0d8daa3fbc)

Also, it's trading underneath it's IPO price... in a growing field... that will... only get bigger..... If you don't like that chart, just flip it upside down.

[Recent Insider Buying. Why would the director load up 1.8million dollars on a cost over the price of the stock? Does he hate money? Is he retarded? That's for you to decide.](https://preview.redd.it/reqzifugjhm71.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc57dc7b6a9efd30efae914723a5d923519d601d)

\*\*\*From some random twitters that I get my bias from:\*\*\*$HIMS likely to be on a run-rate of more than $300 million by Q4 2021, to just be burning through $15 million per quarter isn't much at all, considering the amount of investment that's required to grow consumer awareness of its brand. Management holds nearly 40% of the stock.  Stock is near all time lows.

$HIMS originally guided for 2021 revenue of $179 million *before* going public. Now guiding for $255 in 2021, ahead of the 2022 revenue projections.

# The Sector:

Telemedicine has exploded since the COVID plandemic has hit. People are realizing not only can you work from home, but you can get most of your basic health needs done from the tap of a few buttons rather than in a waiting room. Sure, if you have a rash on your junk, you should probably see a doctor. But hey, if you want to kick it up a notch with the ladies... Hydrate your skin or just consider getting some more of your hair back.. Why would you walk into an office? This sector is growing at such a rapid pace, it's going to become more normal than a specialty. Kind of like.. you know calling someone versus texting someone.

# The looks of the company:

If you look at the marketing and branding, they feel young and fresh. Partnering with people like Gronk (Bucs player) / Miley Cyrus (singer) and the look/appeal of the website reminds me a lot of what brought a lot of success to companies like Lululemon, or hell even Apple if you want to go that far. Keep it clean, keep it simple. They are focused on a target that uses phones as part of their daily ritual. A target that uses TikTok/IG for advice versus listening to the boomers at the dinner table.

# End thoughts:

While I don't know if the stock will ultimately go up, i do believe at this price... the risk is well worth the reward. It won't rocket like $GME/$AMC on some meme dream, but if you hold it for a while we could see a similar pattern to what happened with $TDOC. I have no gay bear thesis here, because we all know stonks only go up.

GL out there traders. $HIMS is still at an incredible price."

I am 30 y/o and used to fap multiple times a day because my wife’ s boyfriend won’ t let me touch my wife, so I have to spend most of the time with my left hand (yes left handed).

There’ s only one problem I must face: I can only fap on my own loss porn. I mean really, I have tried a lot of different styles and other people’ s loss porn but it just never feels as familiar and intimate as with my own.

It has gotten such a bad addiction that I have to lose a lot of money at least 3 times a day for not stacking too much blood in my penis.

This is the whole reason I came to WSB in the first place because I thought apes here will help me out for sure. On my journey to find some huge losses I immediately bought some GME at $50. I was very disappointed by the performance and not turned on at all so I had to sell it at $350 and went on to buy puts in order to finally lose some money. Unfortunately, the price went down and I won again.

At this point in time my dick was so hard that I really had to print some losses so I could finally release some pressure. I doubled down my GSAT positions at $1, and put the rest into TSLA calls because betting against Michael Burry would lose me money for sure right?

Wrong again, Papa Musk and some shit rumors that happened over there at Apple pushed prices up again. I had to close my positions in green again to reduce opportunity cost by saving time to find something where I could lose money and finally finish off my job.

I am very desperate and depressed right now, since I’ m on WSB I’ ve only won money and did not lose a single dollar.

My last hope is reaching out to the biggest loss porn experts in here for advice of how I can start losing again to rub one off.

Best regards amici,

I hope you can help me out"

Globalstar Inc $GSAT is a satellite communication company with a constellation of satellites in low earth orbit (LEO) enabling communications in remote areas. Most of their equipment and service is now used for data and voice communication across the globe in special use cases like ports, cruise ships, cargo ships, remote wireline, etc.  

  

BUT the money is in licenses NOT just the LEO satellite network. They hold for the terrestrial spectrum that NOBODY can use without first leasing the rights from Globalstar. They have the FCC license in the US and are licensed around the world for a prime slice 2.4 ghz spectrum. This is the filet mignon of radio spectrum. Or rather it's the Wendy's spicy nuggets for all you dumpster sluts out there. This is important because it is the ideal voice communication band for earth based phones. Qualcomm's x60 chip has the software and architecture to use this band and will be used in the new iPhone 13. A top Apple supply chain analyst believes it may enable emergency or remote calling on the new iPhones:

Your wife can call her boyfriend from the piece of shit cruise y'all go on while you are getting fatter at the midnight buffet like the disgusting fuck you are. Space communications are the future and my bet is more on the licensing of the airwaves vs. the hardware needed to operate it.

pk0jdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pk0jdf/unique_risks_of_chinese_stocks/,Unique Risks of Chinese Stocks,36,31,2021-09-08 09:21:17,"You may have heard the news the SEC is requiring foreign firms risks of ""government meddling."" A rule that applies to everyone but is really targeted at US listed Chinese firms. This is ultimately appropriate as it shouldn't surprise anyone that capitalism in Communist China gets pretty weird. Chinese stocks sound perfect for this sub, given the high-risk high-reward tradeoffs and great diversity of outcomes, but understanding the risks that come with them is vital for winning.

First unique risk: ***No foreigner is allowed to invest directly in China***\*\*,\*\* all businesses in China must be majority Chinese owned, and all foreign owned shares are non-voting shares. Of course, this is circumvented easily, as big businesses simply get a Chinese partner to establish a Chinese branch. Chinese businesses often get a foreign partner who will take his shares to a foreign exchange and IPO them there. More recently, companies have been cutting the middlemen by establishing shell companies called ""variable interest entities"" in the Cayman Islands who will IPO on a foreign exchange and immediately invest said money in an ""arrangement"" with the Chinese firm.

What will come of all this? No idea, but note Communist China is extremely touchy about foreign meddling/domination on their own soil and may close any of these loopholes at any time for any reason. There's virtually no regulatory proposal/review process whatsoever, and regulators can act unilaterally and often do.

Second unique risk: ***All business is highly competitive profit margins are narrow***\*\*.\*\* Why is outside the scope of this sub, but you usually will find dozens of ventures all operating in one area trying to increase their market share any way they can. Even simple things like ride-sharing bicycles can bring some bizarre shenanigans and waste. Ride-sharing referring to the proliferation of bikes that can be unlocked with a phone app for a small fee, several companies in 1st and 2nd tier cities got it in their minds that consumers would go for the company that had the most easily accessible bikes. The race to get the most bikes on the streets got ridiculous as there were more bikes than potential riders. Then it got even more ridiculous as there were more bikes being left just anywhere than the workers could manage and they simply piled near popular destinations. Then it got even more ridiculous with bikes piled like heaps of scrap metal, most only ridden once. This is the point where a regulatory crackdown occurred putting most of the ride-sharing companies out of business and turning all the bikes to scrap metal.

I bring this up because even if there is a solid business model and good fundamentals in a company, that simply doesn't tell the whole story with a Chinese stock.

Third unique risk: ***Foreigners aren't protected by Chinese law.*** This isn't totally unique to China, but note that Chinese courts heavily favor citizens. Like when a Chinese man patented the ""iPhone"" that was really a satchel, and a Chinese court rejected Apple's filing that they owned the patent to the iPhone. I'm sure you've also heard of the forced intellectual property transfers, where as mentioned earlier foreign companies must have a Chinese partner. More specifically, any patents owned by any partner in a Chinese firm is owned by all partners, and the abuse of this intentional loophole is the foundation of China's tech industry. Apple said they only put up with it is because by the time cheap knockoffs hit the market they're already obsolete.

This process is actually repeated inside China, where everyone has a province of resident. Outside your province, you're a second class citizen. Unable to obtain government jobs, or access public schools. Most Chinese people see this as normal human behavior and are simply surprised that most other nations don't do it. What this means to you is that if you invest in a Chinese stock and get screwed, that's it. There's no chance of getting any help.

Fourth unique risk: **Lack of a*****ccounting standards.*** Chinese exchanges have many blanket bans on who can IPO, but once a company is on the exchange there are few rules about what they're obliged to disclose to investors. The creative accounting this creates (both legal and illegal) is the main cause of rejection the SEC gives for Chinese stocks trying to list on the NYSE.

Fifth unique risk: ***Unreliable economic data.*** This is not a matter of ""bad commies lie."" This is a matter of strange incentives and tight internal competition. China's government is totally hierarchical, with Beijing appointing provincial governors and so on down. Pay bones, promotions, demotions, jail sentences, and the allocation of state resources is often dished out solely based on economic data. This incentives creative accounting on the local level and large urban planning that disproportionately boosts GDP. This process is repeated up the chain of command until the final number shows growth that contradicts facts on the ground but you can be sure will republished as fact because GDP growth attracts investors like you and Cathy Wood and Ray Dalio.

Another product of this is weird fluctuations in the Yuan (Chinese currency). The People's Bank of China (PBOC) prints/destroys bills in circulation in order to maintain a steady value, but that system is messed up when the economic data they're basing their printing off of is wrong for any reason. Namely, if the the money printer thinks the economy is growing faster than it is, he'll print to much and cause inflation. The PBOC once blamed the creative accounting of local officials for weird fluctuations in the Yuan.

Sixth unique risk: **Chinese construction is just like** r/wallstreetbets. Leverage is unlimited and speed and high risk is incentivized by the following reasons:

1. The government leases all land for 30-70 years, doesn't sell it. Reason: They're Communists. Result: No reason to build any structure expected to outlast the lease.
2. Construction boost GDP figures disproportionately. Government officials rise and fall based on those numbers and can often profit by giving construction contracts to their business partners.
3. A large portion of government revenue is from land lease transfer fees and taxes, which is often 40% of the cost of a house. This incentivizes government officials to push land values up.
4. Housing and construction are among the few industries where there is little state control and/or state run enterprises. This increases the competition in this sector. Profit margins of less than ten percent are the norm, but accidents and bribes often leave builders with the choice between defaulting on payroll (which happens often) or ignoring the blueprints and cheapening the build. Given the former often causes the collapse of the business, cost cutting has become king with companies intentionally building shoddily in order to undercut the competition.
5. Many local rackets revolve around private business. One that was busted involved a fake construction company getting a contract, immediately subcontracting the project, and sharing the difference with the officials that gave the contract.
6. Escrows are not required and unlimited presales allowed. This allows even the tiniest start up to leverage to the tits by paying for the cost of building with the earnings from presales. Of course, this often causes broken capital chains as any little hiccup or cost overrun causes the project to collapse and the presale buyers left with garbage. Also many scams spring up where the real estate guys have no intention of finishing the project.

The end result is no one involved in building actually cares if there's any utility from these buildings. In fact, they still profit even if the building collapses immediately upon sale. In one recent case, Evergande company fell over 80% so far this year and their bonds fell by 20%, and they briefly registered a PE of 2.6. Reason? They had more debt than they could possibly pay and defaulted even though they were profitable. This isn't unusual, and in fact with Chinese microcap stocks things can get even more ridiculous. So if you find a Chinese company with some ridiculous discount, like a PE of 6, just note there might be something you don't know.

**TL;DR Chinese stocks are like Detroit real estate. It's cheap for a reason.**

More importantly, China's domestic economy can effect you even if you are not invested there. For instance, plastic recycling isn't profitable in the US except for specific high grade plastics. Metal recycling is more profitable than actual mining, but the process of separating cheap plastic to the total garbage attached to it isn't worth an American worker's paycheck. But in China, labor is dirt cheap. Also since China exports bulk consumer goods and imports manufactured goods, ships aren't full when they go from California to China, so shipping is dirt cheap. This meant for a time plastic recycle was baled up in the US and shipped to the Chinese coast where workers sorted through our literal garbage by hand. This industry produced a lot of waste and it would often get dumped wherever so in time Beijing realized what was slightly profitable for these businessmen was costing China as a whole and banned the import of plastic. This decision, made casually without any heads up, made the global plastic recycling industry go POOF. Recycling centers in the US no longer take plastic and most still have leftover bales sitting out in storage waiting to go somewhere (I've seen them).

As for the future of the Chinese economy... Well, predictions range from pure sycophancy to attempts to apply first world boom and bust cycle logic to a Communist country. Truth is China is full of localized micro-bubbles that cause substantial waste in the form of abandoned buildings/equipment and useless products. If there is a country wide bubble, the fate of the stock market will be the least of anyone's worries (I'm not calling the top at this time).

You can still profit from Chinese stocks, and name of the game is deep value investing. You can hunt down good deals or invest in what you think will be the next big thing or buy the dip in company that's slipping. But never go YOLO any stock as that introduces unnecessary randomness as there's the risk that you'll get screwed over in ways no one could imagine. Also don't buy an index of Chinese stocks as the Chinese market is corelated to the S&P... but underperforms the S&P.

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Walgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play & income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone’s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.

**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**

Below are the 6 main reasons we’re bullish on WBA.

&#x200B;

**1)** **WBA is a Dow component.**

Walgreens stock ($WBA) is a Dow component. As one of only 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the oldest and most historically-followed U.S. market index dating back to the late 1800s), WBA is now considered one of the select large-cap companies which (together) accurately represent the overall market.

Though WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only \~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.

WBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a “virtuous cycle”, where the stock price increases --> WBA weighting increases --> more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --> the stock price increases --> the positive cycle repeats.

In short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.

&#x200B;

**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**

Walgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA’s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.

&#x200B;

**3)** **4% Dividend**

A 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market’s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.

Its further possible that WBA’s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the ""Dividend Aristocrats"", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.

&#x200B;

**4)** **Attractive Valuations**

WBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.

Why is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn’t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.

How do we know it’s cheap? Why is the stock a “buy”? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Procter & Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).

In other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.

&#x200B;

**5)** **Improving Business**

Walgreens’ business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.

With most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA’s bullish cycle. 

We will look at the upcoming year’s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA’s progress and performance.

&#x200B;

**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**

The cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.

Walgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.

There is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it’s been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.

A takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.

Additionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.

Warren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called “Haven”) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).

It seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher."

Why I believe the U.S. stock market and U.S. Dollar will fall.,1156,938,2021-09-06 23:55:23,"This journey began for me with a random conversation. I was at a grocery store on my break from work and while I was looking at different Greek yogurts, I overheard a man say something I couldn’t believe. I turned around and said “Sir… I’m sorry, what did you just say?” He introduced himself as the owner of the grocery store (locally owned in St.Pete/Clearwater FL area) the gentlemen proceeded to tell me that **last year he paid around $4,000 for a crate of food…he said one year later, that same EXACT CRATE IS NOW $14,000.** This conversation was just 3 weeks ago. 

So…when I got into my car I had an idea. I wonder what the U.S. Dollar index is trading at…I’m sure it’s bloody red (I assumed) what I saw literally made my jaw drop. I’m not joking…**at that time the U.S. dollar happened to be at a 9 month high.** I couldn’t fucking believe it. At that moment I knew…we had fucked up. https://imgur.com/a/tBVu4f1

After already doing mini DD on why the U.S. dollar might fall just days before (just watching random videos on YouTube about Dr. Burry and stock shit) 

I immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation. Which was call options in $TBT. An ETF with 2x inverse exposure on 20+ U.S Treasury bonds. In simple terms, this is a bet on hyperinflation. **I believe that the Federal Reserve WILL BE FORCED to raise rates (as that is their main tool in their toolkit to fight inflation) faster than ANYONE is anticipating. Which in turn would collapse bond prices.** Making the calls print. I currently have a small position right now.

The dollar index after J. POW’s Jackson Hole Speech. 😂 https://imgur.com/a/hiN5OFy

Now this brings me to the U.S. stock market. I sold all my stocks 2 days ago. I have long exposure in only one position currently. A $50/$80 call debit spread in VIAC. Simply put, if I’m wrong and the market just keeps going, then the $350 I paid for spread will generate nearly $3,000 if VIAC is over $80 on expiration, which is in 2 years.

                  Technical Analysis

Let me start with my TA first…which is alarming. https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX 

**This was yesterday, Friday, September 3.**

Here is one from Thursday, September 2.

**$SPY is at a critical resistance level…I mean…it literally is hitting the fucking roof here**… and with everything going on in the world…you want more?!?? Sorry to burst your bubble…but how was that even theoretically feasible? It’s impossible in my opinion. 

Let me explain why…

              Updated GDP Forecasts

**Am I literally the only one who saw on Thursday that Morgan Stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter GDP expectations??? Let me fill you in on a little secret…THEY CUT THEIR FUCKING ESTIMATES BY MORE THAN HALF!!!!!**

For fuck sakes people, **THIS IS HUGE!!** This is a quote from a brand new article literally posted 45 minutes ago from the Washington Post! 

**“The team at Morgan Stanley led by chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to 2.9% from 6.5%.”**

**Gross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the United States. So…yeah we’re fucked. Which in turn has an impact on some companie’s future earnings… and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations now…** 

             Wall Street‘s High Expectations

So far, 88% of S and P 500 companies have beaten earnings per share estimates for the second quarter of 2021, according to data provider FactSet.

The strong results put the S and P 500 on track to be the best quarter for beats since FactSet started tracking the data in 2008. 😳 So…. What happens if the economy literally comes to a stand still? Which in my opinion is slowly happening and what will happen. You could have a slow correction based on this alone, just on companies missing earnings….which I guarantee that will happen… it’s going to be an earnings miss galore. 

                     Lumber/Gold Ratio

Simply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.

When gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.

**So investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio.**

This ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.

Get it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this  https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ 

I like this one better compared to the DOW 30. 
https://imgur.com/a/cvYyXsB

The lumber/gold ratio **HAS PLUMMETED** in the last 2 months…literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Remember…play defense)

Side note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But…gold was up big this week as well…and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.

                Consumer Confidence

**In simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption.**

So…for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.

**They reported 125.10 on the index for the month of July. Boy…were they in for a surprise. The month of August has a consensus estimate of 123.0, the number was 113.9….a very surprising miss. I wasn’t surprised at all to be honest with you.**


                      Conclusion

**Let me be clear…I believe Jerome Powell with his magical money printer and rising inflation will be the reason the market falls, also the fact that the government is just handing out free money to every single person with excess stimulus, it’s going to collapse our financial system possibly…also with all the over leveraging you have the perfect brew of a shit storm. Also with rising delta concerns, the new variant “Mu” and mass evictions will soon begin…**

**Since the start of 2013  the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs.**

No big deal right?

**I mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and on…. But you get the point by now…let’s not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, I’m sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. Don’t get me started on the mass evictions as well…and the FED has been buying MORTGAGE BACKED Securities… The very financial instrument the collapse of economy in 2008.**

Now…**my positions.** Take this into consideration… I’m 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios. I may or may not have just got out of prison 9 months ago after completing a 5 year prison sentence. So…**Not financial advice.** 

**Short term Tendies:** sold 4 different Call options on SPY via call credit spreads. 
$455/$456 9/15 exp- 2 sold
$456/457 9/13 exp- 2 sold

Bought 3 $10 puts in $BFI 9/17 exp 

**Long term Tendies:**

One $13 call option in $HIBS (this security blew up 200%-300% in the span of days during the covid crash)
It basically shorts TSLA and other ridiculous growth stocks… I looked at their top 10 holdings and like seven out of 10 of them are at all time highs lol. 

2 calls in $TECS $5 strike price. 1/21/22 exp. This is a 3x bear inverse of tech stocks. It’s holdings are like AAPL and MSFT. I want to short stocks that are trading at all time highs. Because when this house of cards finally crumbles they will fall the hardest. **There WILL BE MARGIN CALLS.** You can bet on that. 

1 call option in $TBT exp 1/20/23 (hyperinflation bet/Fed raising rates quicker)

One $50/$80 call debit spread in $VIAC 
Exp. 1/22/23 (long exposure to act as my hedge if by some divine miracle I’m wrong) 

**My last position:**

**$2,500 in Cash.**

Simply put…**cash is a position.** People seem to forget that. And I will simply buy the dip in my favorite companies… my choice of extremely cheap shares. Trust me… I already have my shopping list ready. 

Good luck out there guys. **Timing this is almost impossible**…but my timeline is within 6 months we will experience at least a 15% correction if not a full blown apocalyptic market crash. It’s hard to really assess the damage on how bad it will be. And for those who refuse to take the needle out of their arms, enjoy getting margin called and losing all of your money!

**The company PLTR has positioned themselves for what they call a “Black swan event”by purchasing $50 million in solid gold bars.Not gold ETFs. Solid gold bars…Let me remind you that they deal with information.**

I’m not saying you should sell all of your stocks like me, I’m saying that maybe it’s time to scale back a bit on the margin, move some money into cash and maybe sell some of those positions that are up big. Don’t forget **Sleepy Joe is going to raise long term capital gains tax, possibly very soon, from like 20% to as high as 43.4% if you make over $1mil**…another bearish catalyst for the market. I literally could go on and on guys….It’s pretty obvious at this point, we’ll at least to me…but what do I know? I just got out of prison last December. 🤔

But at the same time, we have investors like Warren Buffet who still swear by a low-cost index fund and recommends it over his own Berkshire Hathaway stock! So, in this week’s issue, we analyze both sides of the argument and see if we \[1\] should be worried about the index fund bubble!

**The Problem**

The argument against the index fund is a logical one. The basic premise is that index funds affect the price discovery of stocks in the market. If a stock is bid up just based on the presence in an index and not by analyzing the underlying asset, then it can lead to a bubble-like scenario where you are buying more and more just because the asset prices are going up.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/a04wyrgmpvl71.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=1693f22d16deb337345e5accb8f360de959707a7)

If you look at the above chart, you could see that in the first 4 months of 2021, a fund inflow of more than $20 Billion occurred just to the Vanguard 500 index fund. There are arguments stating that in the US, index funds make up [more than 50% of the fund market.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/) (This exponential growth is not a surprising one given my last analysis showed that passive funds have summarily beaten active funds over the last 2 decades)

If you think about this, more than half of the money that is flowing into the market is now just buying stocks that are on an index without doing any underlying stock analysis. The problem becomes that companies get more and more investment just because they are big and not because of their future growth prospects. So the question becomes

**Is the index fund affecting the integrity of the stock market?**

The problem with the fund inflow statistics is that stock price is not decided solely based on fund inflow but majorly by trading.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/cjlyt4unpvl71.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=67be6be3b3604712dd017a823da8aee69116019e)

If you look at this [study done by Vanguard](https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/ISGBEL.pdf) \[2,3\], it destroys the price discovery argument. It shows that only 5% of the overall trading volume is captured by index funds. The rest of 95% of trading is made by active traders, pension funds, and institutional investors who do individual stock analyses.

Adding to this, even if the index funds become large enough to create significant price distortions, it’s something that the active fund managers can benefit from as it would give them more opportunities to short overvalued companies and create outsized returns. The fact that it’s not happening right now shows that we are not anywhere near a situation where the index fund is big enough to fundamentally alter the market\[4\].

Now that we know that index funds are not causing any price distortions, one has to wonder

**why there is a sudden rise in concerns regarding an index fund bubble over the past 2-3 years?**

I believe that this issue is being brought up by institutions and active fund managers as there is a drastic shift from active to passive management over the last few years.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/pq1b3fbppvl71.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=699fc8dd9d5f2dee76f47e6f02763c8b352084b6)

The above chart from Morningstar showcases that active funds on average lost more than $150B every year over the 2014-18 period and this trend is only becoming worse for the active funds. This trend is also replicated worldwide with more than $300B is pulled out of active funds and $500B is pushed into index funds every year (as of 2016).

Finally, as of 2019, for the first time, more money is being pushed into passive than active funds! All of this must be ringing alarm bells across active funds as their income is directly dependent on the total asset under management.

**Alternatives to index funds**

While researching this topic, I came across some genuine concerns about index funds. The most important of them being that you might not be as diversified as you expect investing in an index fund.

As of Aug 2021, the top 5 tech stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN & FB) account for more than 23% of the S&P500! While this worked out great for the overall index over that last decade given the tech rally, any long-term downturn for tech stocks will significantly affect your portfolio.

There are two alternatives that I found to the regular market cap based index fund allocation

[Equal-weighted index funds](https://www.lynalden.com/equal-weighted-index-funds/): Equal-weighted index fund allocates your capital equally across the stocks in the given index. For Eg. in S&P500 index, all the 500 companies would get an equal proportion of your index. This will avoid your portfolio becoming concentrated on a few highly overvalued stocks!

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ikn5px2rpvl71.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff145127fe86a728e0ebd0663d8566341163aa3a)

[Reverse weighted index funds:](https://www.etftrends.com/smart-beta-channel/an-etf-that-beats-sp-500-by-turning-it-upside-down/) This one is for the more adventurous, where the investments are made by turning S&P500 upside down on its head! The smallest companies on the list get the largest share of investment! Even though this reduces your exposure to large tech stocks and blue-chip companies (which get a lot of attention and is possibly overvalued), your investments will be concentrated on smaller companies that are inherently volatile and can produce outsized returns! Even though this strategy has beaten the traditional index returns, you still have to consider that this type of fund was introduced [just two years ago](https://www.barrons.com/articles/sp-500-index-fund-reverse-weighting-51557430544).

**Conclusion**

I believe that the index fund bubble narrative is over-blown and is being predominantly driven active fund managers who are trying to stop losing their business to the passive funds every year. All the data from our research shows that we are nowhere near a situation where index funds can alter the price discovery in any significant way!

While the index fund bubble might be getting undeserved attention, it's always a good thing to check if you are comfortable with the current skewness of your portfolio towards tech stocks. After all, the tech rally over the last decade has undoubtedly benefitted all our portfolios, but we should also be ready for when the party inevitably comes to a close!

Until next week :)

**Footnotes**

\[1\] This is the first time in an analysis where I cannot claim to be unbiased as a substantial portion of my portfolio (>90%) is tied up in an index fund. So take all the arguments with a grain of salt!

\[2\] *Setting the record straight: Truths about indexing* is an excellent study done by Vanguard in 2018 where they review the rationale for indexing’s efficacy, quantify the benefits of indexing to investors, clarify the definition of indexing, and explore the validity of claims that indexing has an adverse impact on the capital markets.

\[3\] This study also showcases that ETF trading (creation/redemption mechanism of exchange-traded funds (ETFs)) has minimal impact on the underlying securities as only 6% of the trading is involved in primary market trading with the rest being in the secondary market.

\[4\] This is also known as the Grossman-Stigliztz paradox:- There would be a point where indexing would become big enough to affect price discovery, then active managers would be able to profit off that, and more and more people would move to the active funds. Finally, in an efficient market, an equilibrium point would be reached where neither party (index funds or active fund managers) would be able to beat each other."

Many things in this world require semi conductors! Its only a thriving technological world. I am a salesperson at a Large FCA Store (Stellantis) Dealership in the midwest, and we are sitting on less vehicles today for sale in September, 2021 than we had in July, 2021.

With rising demand in Electronics TSMC says has begun construction at its Arizona chip factory site. **June 1** (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW) (TSMC) has started construction at a site in Arizona where it plans to spend $12 billion to build a computer chip factory, its chief executive said on Tuesday.

&#x200B;

I think we may see a rise in Semi Conductors in the years to come. Everything that requires a button in your car, fire stick remote controller, xbox controller, keyboard etc... requires a semi conductor.

The problem with the vehicle shortage is that the vehicle manufactures planned to schedule less chips in February 2021 for the vehicles of 2021 sales. They thought they would sell less vehicles this year because of the Covid, however, earlier this year, things opened and mask came off.  The car manufactures decided to instead order the same amount of chips as they usually do yearly, but the orders were already booked for other manufactures that needed chips. This is why you dont see a shortage in Smart phones, and computers, or TVS. The chip factories are producing chips for them first now before they can produce for car manufactures. It isn't because of a covid factory shut down...

This gives me reason to believe that demand will only increase for Semi Conductors and since TSM holds the most market in this area and they can generally control pricing.

This shows that the demand of current electrical devices int he world is actually far greater than we expected!

Today i bought 100 calls, (2 days after earnings) purchase and am expecting more long term purchased investments into this company. I expect better than expected earnings, because last week, a representative said that we can expect order tightness of conductors to follow into next year.

IF you look at the earnings chart, each quarter they have gone closer to matching expected earnings, and this next earnings should either be the same or better than expected.

I tend to agree with the latter, but what I belive people are missing from the puzzle is the rumored new extreme version of the [Apple watch](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-26/apple-considers-launching-rugged-watch-for-extreme-sports), this is a product where GSAT intergration would make much more sense, and intergrating emergency beacon functionality to Extreme sporting watches has already been done by Breitling in their [Extreme watch](https://www.breitling.com/us-en/emergency/).

Alltough Apple watch might bring in as much revenue to GSAT as iphone 13 intregration would, im confindent that 37.5M every quarter in payment to GSAT is just the begining of the pontential cash flow from this product intergration.

Edit: If these mystery cashflows are going to be consistent 37.5M per qurater, that amounts to 150M every year. GSAT:s current revenue is 128M and the market value it at 4B$, if we assume that the market is pricing in around 17% Growth rate with a WACC of around 20% we get to the current valuation of 4B with today revenue. If we add in the extra 150M from this mystery customer and discount it with the same WACC and growth rate, we get to a valuation of 8.8B or a stock price of around 4.8. But if we say that this deal makes the market price in even more future growth, which i think it will, with a Growth of around 20% the valuation instead lands closer to 20B or 10$ per share.

Edit 2: Financial disclouser: I have several 5$ Jan 21 calls on this company, and thus this is not financial advice.

And also to make things clear this is not a fucking short squeeze play, there is barely any fucking SI on this company and everything does not have to be a short squeeze play. This is just a new cash flows play. Best of luck"

If you answered yes, then have I got the play for you! Do not worry my fellow illiterate ~~gamblers~~ investors, a **TL;DR** is at the bottom.

&#x200B;

[Apple Flavored 🍎😋](https://preview.redd.it/4fcogvimg4l71.png?width=585&format=png&auto=webp&s=78500ddf72d1cd9e2e5f1de752456f56162eef81)

So there is a growling amount of people buying and consuming these horse drugs to fight Covid-19. While the FDA has [approved the tablet](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19) for use of those dealing with intestinal strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis, they are not recommending either the tablets or horse paste to fight Covid. The intended use of the horse medication are to [get rid of worms](https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/product-safety-information/faq-covid-19-and-ivermectin-intended-animals) in your animal. Once the medication has killed the worms, then the animal shits them out. Companies like Merck & Co., Inc. ($MRK) make this drug that has been giving users [skin rashes, stomach pain, diarrhea, and possible swelling](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/ivermectin-demand-drives-trump-telemedicine-website-rcna1791). Which leads us to the briefs:

&#x200B;

[The 💩 Catcher](https://preview.redd.it/3r60vrwjg4l71.png?width=578&format=png&auto=webp&s=748739358f6e940526f32a67cfc17b05850d00b6)

Both the oral and horse paste versions of ivermectin are causing [the shits](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/ivermectin-oral-route/side-effects/drg-20064397?p=1) for users of both the FDA approved tablet Ivermectin and the horse paste ivermectin. No adult wants to be caught wearing a diaper, so why not use something that catches shit and does not crinkle to loud? Depends, which is owned by the Kimberly-Clarck Corporation ($KMB), has them covered!

&#x200B;

[Both suppliers and retail stores are struggling to meet ivermectin's demand.](https://preview.redd.it/7i5jkw3hg4l71.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=10a167e34919c6a7036f82efb907120179fdf229)

In the quest to fight the virus in their own, non-FDA approved way, a large swath of vaccine skeptics are using this drug. Former Fear Factor host, turned MMA commentator and podcast host, Joe Rogan has [caught Covid-19](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/01/1033485152/joe-rogan-covid-ivermectin) and announced his usage of supplements and ivermectin to fight it off. If anyone knows about the power of horse medicine, then it has got to be the Jamie PhD man that saw people eat bugs and swallow [good old fashioned donkey](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/7las7v/fear_factor_donkey_cum_challenge_that_got_the/) cum on a TV show! Well....maybe not, but a growing number of people are listening too, and following the recommendations of radio and podcast hosts to use this drug. Why not profit off of their spending, right?

&#x200B;


# So what is the play, and how do I make money?

To be clear, I do not condone the consumption of ivermectin to combat Covid-19. There have been posts in other subreddits that have [covered the safety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/oq2vtx/vaccines_work_and_are_safe/) about the vaccines in great depth. I have gotten the Pfizer-BioNTech shots, and I am still waiting for the software update that gives me the magnet powers and 5G internet. I'll update the post if it goes live anytime soon. While ivermectin has a human, FDA-approved version for humans in tablet form, it is not like these people are going to stop buying either version of ivermectin all of a sudden. My thought process is that we might as well capitalize off of the ignorance of others to fund our horse powered lambo's, right?

As mentioned earlier in this post, Merck & Company, Inc. are the ones who make ivermectin; however, on top of apple flavored paste, they have also [launching trials for oral](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-starts-dosing-patients-oral-covid-19-drug-trial-2021-09-01/) Covid-19 drugs. I expect retail companies like Tractor Supply ($TSCO) will continue selling out their horse paste stock like the PS5's and Xbox Series X's. To combat the leaking brown rivers, these users are going to have to depend on some Depend's ($KMB) adult briefs.

But when I arrived, I overheard one dude say “Wallstreetbets,” and I could feel myself getting excited. Two fellow retards (or autists?), in the flesh!

I sent my little one into the playground and started walking over to introduce myself to my brethren.

 “Those Wallstreetbettors are completely crazy,” I heard Dude 1 say. I slowed down. What sort of retard actually says ‘Wallstreetbettor’?

“Yeah, but you know what? My portfolio now is like 70% Apple,” replied Dude 2. Maybe Dude 2 is my guy because I can get down with AAPL and YOLOs.

“Wow, 70%? That’s real conviction. Don’t you think you should diversify some of that?” At this point, I was about halfway to them and having more doubts about them than my UPST puts (90x 9/17 200p).

“Yeah, my Apple shares have been killing it.” I stopped and turned around. These two were neither autists nor retards. They were investors. 

That was when I realized how much the WSB sub meant to me and what my limits were: parentally responsible is okay, fiscally responsible is not okay. See all you retards in Vahalla.

**TL;DR**

[My scheme to steal Everlasting Gobstopper recipe](https://preview.redd.it/zr4nnfj4xok71.png?width=1949&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ea88262681c64b8bd9da3a7db1713805cc5e18f)

# How will AST SpaceMobile change the world?

* **First space-based cell tower network ever to provide 5G direct to your smartphone 🚀 > 🛰 > 📲 using GIANT SATELLITES**
* Will serve as PRIMARY cell service for developing nations where populations aren't concentrated and cell towers prohibitively expensive to build and maintain
* Will serve as complementary service in developed nations, as even in the developed world plenty of coverage gaps.
* $1 trillion total addressable market, 5 billion mobile phones moving in and out of coverage, 51% of world without high speed mobile coverage.

# How will AST make ALL THE TENDIES?

* **They will be a wholesaler so they don't compete with existing mobile providers or need to market (zero acquisition cost > high margins).**
* **They have exclusive 50/50 revenue share coverage agreements with AT&T, Vodafone, etc countless others covering 1.5 billion subscribers, with more added each month.**
* Major test launch March 2022, Phase 1 late 2022/early 2023 covering equatorial countries, Phase 2 late 2023/early 2024 for global coverage
* Fully funded through Phase 1, then revenue from Phase 1 will fund Phase 2, etc.
* AST has received significant strategic investments from Vodafone, Rakuten (Amazon of Japan), American Tower (largest cell tower company in the world), and Samsung

[Idea how tech works from company's Everlasting Gobstopper recipe](https://preview.redd.it/ohvp6imoxok71.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=c68f94427d811d251eeae99f3848efbd30c8e81d)

# What about ""competitors"" like Starlink, etc. who want to steal all the tendies?

* **AST has NO DIRECT COMPETITOR, they are the only ones who will beam 5G high speed directly to your smartphone WITHOUT extra equipment.**
* Starlink beams internet to your home, building, large vehicle and still requires an antenna dish.
* Traditional sat phone providers require a bulky and expensive special phone
* Lynk is trying to do satellite service too BUT they are focused on text message only.
* Recent ""Apple rumor"" mentions satellite service but actually is not, only is expansion of terrestrial spectrum.
* AST also has over 1,000 patent claims to protect its proprietary and revolutionary technology.

&#x200B;

[Only SpaceMobile will get you that golden ticket](https://preview.redd.it/hpwrerbd0rk71.png?width=573&format=png&auto=webp&s=43c581f3a365bfae8bdadb1076b5bf1fbd2c44ba)

# Financials and Future Price

* **Project 2024 annual revenue of $1 billion, and by 2030 annual revenue of $16 billion with 90% EBIDTA margins.**
* Next main catalyst is final test launch of its BlueWalker 3 satellite in March 2022. They have already launched a successful proof-of-concept satellite previously, but BW3 will be at near production size.
* **Expect major runup to BW3 test date. AST is currently valued at only about $2 billion ($12/share). In 2017, about 7 months prior to Starlink's first test launch, it was valued at $15 billion ($83/share).**
* With successful final testing and launch of Phase 1 service, if you compare to American Tower (cell tower company) and its valuation based on 2024 revenue, **AST next year should be valued at $22 billion ($120/share). If you compare to Starlink's current valuation in their first year of non-mobile high speed commercial service, it's valued at $55 billion ($300/share).**
* **By 2027, if AST is on track for $16 billion revenues in 2030, it would be valued at $350 billion ($2000/share), which would be almost 200x returns from now.**

# Super low float with institutions adding

* 75% of outstanding shares are held by CEO, insiders, and above-mentioned strategic investors
* Another 10% or so are held by major institutions including Blackrock, Vanguard, Point72 (Steve Cohen owner of NY Met's fund), Greenlight Capital (David Einhorn's fund), D.E. Shaw, and Morgan Stanley.
* **Only about 25 million shares left in its free float, including almost 15% short interest.**

# Analysts agree

* Price targets of $35 from Deutsche Bank and $29 from Barclays.
* **Deutsche Bank adds: ""2024 is early in this project's lifecycle. If we take AST management's 2030 EBIDTA of more than $16 billion and apply a 10x multiple (which we think is still conservative given the business' expected growth profile), this implies a 2030 enterprise value of $163 billion (vs $2 billion today). Discounting that EV back to present time at a 15% discount yields a share price of roughly $190 today.""**

# Risk

* Does tech actually work? AST has shown through a prototype satellite previously that connected via 4G-LTE on the ground, but at large production/commercial size, won't know for sure until BW3 launches.
* Major delay in launch/testing. A few days/weeks delay due purely to launch provider/bad weather issues is fine, but if AST says they are delaying due to tech issue or they are not ready, that would not be good. They are launching via SpaceX rocket which has a very high success rate, so launch provider is not a major concern.

&#x200B;

*The above is my own personal opinion and should not be used as investment advice. Do your own research/DD and figure out for yourself what is right for you.*"

Would you:

a) cry and throw your phone in the ocean

b) quit trading forever and kick your wife's boyfriend out of the house

or c) sell your car, sell your house and live in a cardboard box, empty your kid's college fund, get a 2nd job, heck, a 3rd job as a stripper in wall street where you will dance for analysts at Melvin capital, and put every single dollar you could possibly get your hands on into apple?

I would say 90%, and that's a conservative estimate, of people who are into stocks would choose option C. I think even Warren Buffet would move into a cardboard box next door to you and explain that sold everything he has for apple shares if it ""crashed"" by 40% or more right now.

Which brings me to my point. For those massive companies with inflated market caps to crash, there has to be some kind of Earth shattering event that would make even the diamondiest of hands afraid to touch them. Not ""hey man, apple is making me too much money, think I'm gonna sell it for some bonds instead"". I'm talking a pandemic that shuts down the whole world's economy, several gigantic banks going out of business, fucking meteors falling out of the sky, Yellowstone erupting, that's what has to happen for people to start selling their blue chipped shares and for the market to crash. It will happen from time to time, but it can't be predicted by number crunching on a chart. It has to be something concrete.

Like in 2008, the market's didn't just crash randomly, they kept rebounding back and forth until finally it became obvious to everyone that the economy was going to be pretty much destroyed by several banks collapsing. So maybe, someone could have been smart enough in early 2008 to see the potential damage those banks were going to cause by going under, decide that congress was going to be too indecisive to do anything about it, and get out before the crash. But that was the result of an event that was happening, it had nothing to do with p/e's and derivatives and chart pattern. Stocks didn't crash in 2008 because they were ""overvalued"".

TL:DR: Unless someone has a very specific reason to be afraid of a crash, not ""the fed is printing too much money"" or ""p/e's are too high"", they are totally full of it."

* AAPL: This stock is kind of boring, but honestly it only goes up so I bought some not long ago.

[https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/29/iphone-13-to-feature-leo-to-make-calls-and-text/](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/29/iphone-13-to-feature-leo-to-make-calls-and-text/)

**Here are a few of my thoughts below:**

* Jay Monroe (CEO of $GSAT) has tried for many years to monetize the company's main asset, a 11mhz sliver of spectrum between 2.483-2.495ghz. The first iteration was something called ""Terrestrial Low Power Service - TLPS"".
   * Old $GSAT presentation covering TLPS: [https://tinyurl.com/4annmrhd](https://t.co/wAC2Oxqipa?amp=1)
* Jay famously convinced investors in 2013-2015 that this spectrum was on the cusp FCC approval to be used as a new ""private wifi"" 802.11 extension which existing devices with wifi could use this network with only a software upgrade.
* This all turned out to be complete BS and investors lost their shirts when the FCC shot the idea down.
* Fast forward it appears [$GSAT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GSAT&src=cashtag_click) has a new lease on life. Globalstar was able to get its 2.4ghz band, now designated as ""n53"" incorporated into 5G and approved for \*terrestrial\* use in 2017.
* What does that mean? [$GSAT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GSAT&src=cashtag_click)'s spectrum can be used for ground-to-ground comms as an anchor channel for carrier aggregation or licensed assisted access (LAA) in cellular networks. It is NOT approved for satellite to terrestrial device comms.
   * [https://www.lightreading.com/opticalip/globalstars-parent-company-slowly-stirs-5g-assets/d/d-id/767923](https://www.lightreading.com/opticalip/globalstars-parent-company-slowly-stirs-5g-assets/d/d-id/767923)
* It's conceivable Apple is working w/ [$GSAT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GSAT&src=cashtag_click) to create a ""private"" terrestrial LTE network to augment a user's existing service with AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, etc. Maybe there's confusion by association: using [$GSAT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GSAT&src=cashtag_click)'s spectrum must mean a new LEO service!
* A few problems with this theory: 1) [$GSAT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GSAT&src=cashtag_click)'s spectrum is approved for terrestrial use only, 2) Even if it was approved for space to terrestrial handset use, you would need powerful, large aperture satellites to talk to low power handsets and 3) Wireless carriers own the subscriber today and WON'T be letting someone else eat off their plate. You can get designed into new chipset... doesn't mean anyone will light up your spectrum.
   * Abel Avellan, the CEO of $ASTS agrees about point (2) here:[https://twitter.com/AbelAvellan/status/1432325262998388743](https://twitter.com/AbelAvellan/status/1432325262998388743)
* Also, [$GSAT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GSAT&src=cashtag_click) has been very clear on terrestrial use for the n53 band:
   * [https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/globalstar-receives-terrestrial-authorization-in-canada-brazil-and-kenya-2020-11-05](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/globalstar-receives-terrestrial-authorization-in-canada-brazil-and-kenya-2020-11-05)
* BE WARY of [$GSAT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GSAT&src=cashtag_click) rumors. Many prior rumors have bubbled up ahead of an important financing for the company. Magically [$GSAT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GSAT&src=cashtag_click) would be testing with [$AMZN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMZN&src=cashtag_click), [$DISH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24DISH&src=cashtag_click), [$GOOG](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GOOG&src=cashtag_click) and then equity would be used to refinance maturing debt - imagine that

* Finally, Starlink fans suggesting an Apple iPhone 13 may work with its service: HIGH powered dishes are needed to communicate via Ka/Ku spectrum to Starlink's satellites. That's why the service is primarily for FIXED broadband, not a tiny mobile handset.
* Wait, how does Anpanman know so much about [$GSAT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GSAT&src=cashtag_click)?!? I was a big spectrum investor during that time and made a lot of money on Clearwire, Dish, StraightPath... however Jay Monroe turned me into a big bagholder of [$GSAT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GSAT&src=cashtag_click) stock.

This honestly leads us to wonder when the next ATH will be, when will $AAPL hit 155, 160? $AAPL reached ATH recently near $151\~ range and seems to be consolidating for now.

While looking at open interests on AAPL options today, I noticed a whopping volume of 210k for 9/17 150c volume. Are the hedgies or MM's blasting $AAPL up to new ATH soon?  Yes even though $AAPL's trading average is 70\~80M shares per day, an influx of 150 ITM calls will create 21M more shares that need to be covered. (Not including the other weeklies 150c's) That's 1/3\~1/4 of the daily average. I strongly believe that if there is a major push to $150 on $AAPL, $AAPL can finally retest ATH.

Are we supposed to just ignore how much value Apple is returning to shareholders? 

This is why I almost think you can’t go wrong with $AAPL 2023 calls. Your contract is for 100 shares... by expiration, so many shares will be bought back that it is really like a contract for 120 shares. 

For those apes that are new and don’t understand buybacks, it is essentially the opposite of shareholder dilution. Companies purchase shares of their own stock and then “burn” them into thin air. 

What are some other good buyback stocks? I recently learned that 252 companies in S&P are doing buybacks, first time in history that the majority of them are doing so. But I want BIG, steady buybacks for my value LEAPs. 

I’d keep stacking shares and buy long expiration calls whenever apple dips 5%"

The stock I’m talking about is COIN (Coinbase)

COIN is so undervalued it’s insane. It has a 30 PE ratio while literally 11x revenue YoY when corn halved from it’s May peak. It’s priced like fucking AAPL or FB who are growing 30-50% YoY not fucking **tentupling**. Not to mention during the quarter where corn halved from its peak, they increased their profit by 4900% year over year, so the bear argument “if corn drops they’ll stop making money” has already been disproven.  

In terms of financials, COIN is literally the fastest growing stock I have ever seen. Let’s take a quick look

**Q2 Earnings:**

Revenue: $2.23 billion (up 1097% YoY)

EPS: $3.45/share 

Net Income: $1.61 billion (up 4880% YoY)

Net profit margins: 72%

Cash on hand: $4.4 billion

**Bear Arguments**

*Growth will slow down*

Obviously growth is going to slow down, but there has been no big tech companies that we see today (the FAANGs) that has grown nearly as fast it this is. They have so much money, they don’t know to do with it. Their profit margins are exceptional on that kind of revenue and even if growth halves, they’ll still be making an absolute metric fuck ton of pure revenue and profit. 


*Their money is dependent on transaction fees*

For now, but they’re branching out. This is a brand new company we’re talking about. I literally know somebody personally who had their company acquired by Coinbase. They’re spreading their roots to more revenue streams so they’re not entirely dependent on transaction fees. Not to mention they already have Coinbase Pro, so people who want low fees can already get them. 


*What if Corn drops*

Corn halved last quarter and they still saw enormous revenue and profits. The *only* reason why I think this could be a problem is if you think corn will flat out stop existing. Corn could drop to 10,000 and as long as people still trade the currency, COIN will be making money


*Competition*

That’s the bear argument to every single superior product. It’s a non-issue. Tesla has competition. Apple has competition. The market is big enough for multiple exchanges. Coinbase ranks up there as one of the best; literally the only better alternative (having a physical wallet) is so inconvenient that nobody in that community does it. The only thing bears can say is “fees” but it’s obvious they have absolutely no idea what they’re talking about and have never even used the app, because if they did, they’d know that Coinbase Pro exists and their fees are almost non-existent.

I think so.,76,119,2021-08-26 18:29:12,"BarkBox is the Trojan horse of the Pet Industry.  The competition is paying attention. 
Below is an explanation of BARK with some data that I gathered from my conversation with Matt Meeker, the co-founder of BARK. 
Overview
Barkbox is a brand that is synonymous with dogs and funtertainment gave the monthly subscription box of toys, treats, and chews. Nevertheless, Barkbox gets a reputation as a fad/niche business. A company that started as a hobby/passion for dog owners is now a business with over $500 million in revenues and 2 million subscribers.  I see Barkbox as a trojan horse business where you successfully have 1 product and then extend the line. Apple did this a few times, with computers, then MP3, then phones. Crox did it with their shoe and Deckers Outdoor with the UGG boot; both thrived.  The common denominator was a disciplined management team, a great product, and a strong brand. Barkbox has the common denominator in spades. 
Timeline of Barkbox
Three scrappy entrepreneurs started Barkbox.  They would tinker their product until they would get it right, and many times they would fail, and that is fine, but one thing they noticed was that entertaining the audience and making attractive toys were key selling points.  Sure, there are many treats out there in the industry, but the offer becomes irresistible when you mix toys and treats.  Over time they noticed that they lost subscribers due to a few factors: 1.	How many toys are too many toys?2.	The pet may be getting older and loses interest; it happens. 3.	The dog goes to doggy heavenIn facing these realities, the company had some hard questions to answer.  How many potential customers are there out there that would purchase this subscription?  What other products can we create or sell that allow the customer to stay frequently with us?  
Is Barbox special?
Well, if you own a dog, you probably have heard of them.  Their social media footprint is close to 9 million followers across all platforms. Their angle is entertainment, mixed with practicality and affordability.  The perfect recipe to cater to all generations of dog owners, from young to elderly.  Their toys range from WWE-themed toys to Weed paraphernalia to mainstream-looking toys that attract the mass market shopper at Target, etc. Barkbox is unique because it attracts a demographic similar to Pinterest, as most of the customers are female, more than 75%.  These are the soccer and pageant moms and millennials who choose a dog over having children or at least postponing having children.  This is not just a USA trend, but a global one, accelerated due to COVID as people realized being lonely is not fun and a dog brings all the benefits of companionship and entertainment. Customer opportunity
BARK caters to super fans, which is people who love and are borderline obsessed with their pets.  Although 65 million households in the USA own dogs, I think the market opportunity for BARK’s current subscription box is in the 30% range or 13 million subscribers.  They currently have 1.95 million and over ten years have had an additional 2 million already sign up and cancel, which leaves around 9 million left to go with the CURRENT subscription box offering; when you consider barkeats and barkbright and the other channels, they can keep growing the ecosystem.  The loss of a subscriber is not necessarily bad because if the brand is strong enough, it will get the customer to come back to maybe buy one toy, treat, or home product they are interested in or sign up for BarkBright or BarkEats, so yes they may have lost the $240 annuity. Still, they may be able to get them to buy $50 to $100 a year in other products.   That is less money going to Amazon or Chewy. Customer Revenue Channels

Subscription	Toys and Treats	Super Chewer	Bark Bright	Bark Eats	Combo of 2 of the above or more. 
DTC store – Barkshop.comRetail – Target, Costco, etc.
What is the Barkbox moat?
If I had to sum it up, it would be its ability to listen to its audience and cater to attract products they would be interested in buying or looking forward to in their upcoming shipment. Zappos started selling shoes and became so good at listening to their customer they got acquired by Amazon.  Service matters, and Barkbox has knocked it out of the park compared to peers. 
What did Matt and I talk about? Lots. 
Given my previous conversation with the Investor Relations department, Mike Mougias, I had already cleared up some of the housekeeping questions and wanted to take the time to ask Matt as many questions about the business, obstacles, etc. 

Let me be upfront in saying I have been sending a few e-mails to the management team, and this meeting was supposed to be 30 minutes and ended up being 1 hour. I think we could have gone longer, but I would prefer them to keep growing the business, and I appreciate the time they gave me.  I have also sent them e-mails regarding their interview on Cramer’s show, five pages of notes of their Investor Presentation that needs a lot of work; this may have been one of the reasons there was none after the quarterly earnings report.  My main concern or talking points revolves around the bear thesis, which is that the business model is a fad or niche and will not be sustainable and what is Barkbox’s plan to extend the membership from 16 months to 20, then 24, etc.  
The response I got was that BarkEats would help extend the average price per subscriber and extend the duration. Although I know, that is an easy response we have heard in conference calls and investor meetings, I brought up that changing people’s habits to buy dog food would have to offer a significant value proposition, whether it is a better price or better quality food.  People who routinely shop at Costco or Chewy will not cancel a monthly shipment of dog food so quickly.  I agree that a segment of customers will prefer the convenience of small packages, changing food as the pet matures and set it and forget subscription vs. not having to haul a 30-pound bag of food in a store, etc. However, for the segment of dog owners that aren’t too super fanatical, saving money counts. I explained to them my personal experience of how I buy dog food via Amazon and that the pricing for BarkEats was more expensive per pound, and I failed to grasp the added value of their offering.  They agreed they need to keep working on it, and this is why the BARKEATS has been tinkered with for over a year.  The program was initially launched in April of 2020 and has not grown fast because the company has been tinkering with the offering, or maybe they are seeing that people are not as receptive to it?  Sometimes you have to have the right balance of cynicism and optimism/vision. Could they grow this fast?  Yes, but then what they don’t want is massive cancellations after that, so I am ok with being patient in getting it right, but if the product offering was terrific, we should be pretty close to an actual aggressive launch.   
I then asked if there are any plans for a rewards program?  No, plans.  Now, I think that is a mistake because if you lose 2 million subscribers over ten years, there is a sense of no reward for the loyalty of any kind OR not enough products to warrant a program and pressed further.  How do you expect people to stay longer if you are not rewarding them, get their friends to stay longer, or reward other purchasing behavior outside of the subscription?  It ends up that the company had silo’d a lot of division within the company, and some were resistant to offering discounts on new products released, etc.  So, if I got a subscription and say added a bed, they would not give me a discount, but they would if I would try BarkBright.  They admitted that this was not the best approach and are working on combining or allowing additional benefits to subscribers via some discounting.  Nevertheless, I was disappointed to know there was no plan for a rewards program, and after the e-mail was so bothered by it, I sent a detailed proposal of a plan I think would work for Bark.  

Here is my e-mail below:After the call, I kept thinking of a few ideas on how to help bring back some old members and keep the current ones longer.  I think the best solution is to have the ultimate rewards program for Pets ever made.  Every airline and credit card has one, and why can't dog parents?  So, I thought of BarkBucks.  I know Apple does not have a rewards program or “discount” unless it’s a digital subscription. However, if you consider the cult following of Chik-fil-A, they have a rewards program and still have thousands of customers out the door every day, so I think a good program will go a long way and given your market is primarily women, you have to cater to their needs which is a mix of passion and competitiveness. Like you said, some would get jealous if their box didn't have a toy and someone else did. Below is more or less some brainstorming of how I think it could work at the surface but not sure about the financial impact if, for example, you go back to a subscriber that you lost two years ago that paid for two years and canceled, do you have them come back and give them a Tier below for one year? Perhaps this program works out better when there are more products released?  These are questions you will have the answers to or need to find, but I hope this is helpful to get the ball rolling. BarkBucksThe best loyalty programs are ones that have the following features:·        Competitive environment where higher status gets them more rewards and better deals or better toys?!?!?! Personalized with dog name on them?!?!·        Exclusive discounts to products or storewide.·        Exclusive events or products only sent to those Tiers (this encourages people to want to spend more within the ecosystem vs. chewy; this is why the key to keep launching home products, etc.)·        Allow people to accumulate points to spend on products within the ecosystem, outside of the ecosystem, and share the points with friends and family. ·        Transfer, gift, the points to anyone for a fee.·        Exchange the points for cash (gift card of AMEX, VISA, etc.) You can charge a hefty amount for this.Chik-fil-A has a good program that I think works perfectly for BarkBox, and I thought of more or less how it would work.Tier 110 Points for every dollar spentTier 2Earn 5,000 points in a year (paid $500)Earn 11 points per dollar spentReceive 5% discount at Barkshop.comReceive an additional 5% discount if you sign up for two or more subscriptions of 6 months or more.Tier 3Earn 10,000 Points in a year (spent $1,000)Earn 12 points per dollar spentReceive 10% discount at Barkshop.comReceive an additional 10% discount if you sign up for two or more subscriptions of 6 months or more.Exclusive products or access to products before released to product (use the points to get them)Access to special events in specific cities. Program info:Points expire within 24 months of the last end received.Points can be sent to friends and family as gifts with a 10% fee in matters. So, if they ship 500 points, they are charged 50 points (this helps get some of the “funds” back).Points can be redeemed for products at a rewards page which includes Bark products but also some products outside of it that are DOG specific (it will be the most UNIQUE rewards program in the world for Dogs and maybe even Pets) like working with local groomers small family-owned vets or perhaps a partnership with some companies.
End of e-mail. 
Other topics in the discussion:
Margins.  I asked how much their shipping costs were per box.  They said that $6 per box was a high number, so I am now modeling $5 to $5.50 in my model, which means that the TRUE gross margin with shipping drops to around 45% to 50%, which is still significantly better than Chewy and Amazon. Keep in mind that they sell one of the highest margin products at any retail pet store; this is why they don’t want to open retail stores but keep building a brand akin to Nike. 
Dog Insurance. The management team has spoken about this to investors and has said they do not want to do this. I think the mindset of BARK is the correct one in that it does not want to be the one to tell clients, “Hey, sorry, but we are not covering the vet bill for Sparky due to X, Y, Z factors.” It sounds like a poor customer experience, but in the insurance industry, you sometimes have to reject claims, especially if they suspect them to be fraudulent or abusive. However, there is a way that works for everyone involved in that the company works with an insurance company and collects a flat fee commission for every customer that purchases the policy with BARK. Trupanion paid in 2020 $200 a customer, and I don’t think it is unfeasibly for BARK to get 250,000 customers to choose the insurance option as part of their subscription.  Getting, say, $150 in affiliate commission per customer on year one and, say, $50 every year thereafter brings in 100% gross profit into the business straight to the bottom line, tens of millions per year. Also, it gets the customer to go back to the website to renew, etc. 

Home Products.  The company has launched products at a rapid pace and today has more than 30 products in concept, which means a rollout of around ten that could be rolled out per year as these products need to be tested and sourced economically to be feasible to maintain the 60% or higher margin for the business. This division is probably the most underrated today as this division along with a rewards program, can help extend the life of subscriptions but also get them to stay within the BARK brand of products. 
Conclusion, overall, I walked away confident in the BARK story.  Yes, there is a lot of work they have to do, and that is why you are getting a discount today.  There is a lot of fear, panic, and uncertainty of the business, and I believe over a few quarters of results will show the power of the BARK brand and revenue channels, etc.

As of recently its starting to break out of this range soon, and if yall ever seen what happens to a range bound stock thats been consolidating for months look at amd, apple, amazon , netflix etc. It gets extremely nasty for bears. 

Tesla has been looking bullish recently and has had a lot of good news coming its way , so first off q2 earnings. 

tesla used to make a shit ton of cash from its ev tax credits , it still did but it wasnt as much of its revenue . which is a good thing

next , tesla beat rev expectations coming in with 11.96 billion dollars with a net income of over 1 billion dollars for the first fucking time guys! This is huge because well you see, it pulled this off while facing supply issues and supply chain issues are usually problems that are fixed relatively quick ( depends how fast we get covid more under control)  so imagine what it can do when supply chain issues are fixed . Also just so yall know last year q2 tesla had a net of 100mil soo it 10xed it .

Its has 3 mega factories now , germany , china and the usa and when they are at full capacity they will be able to create an estimated 1 million teslas each which means atleast 3 million teslas per year allowing tesla to keep up with its demands and also possibly lower its prices due to volume . **Now this is important pay attention.**

**Tesla has a self driving subscription for about 100 a month.** Basically people can opt into a monthly sub and have self driving feature . This is amazing because a it makes tesla even more money on top of its car sales but b the data that tesla gets from the fsd will help improve its self driving and make it even better than before.

 Now imagine the factories at full capacity , 3 million cars each year say 90% of them are sold so thats like 2.7 million now from a conservative stand lets say of those 2.7 mil only 6% get the sub for a year that means 162k people have the sub. They pay 100 a month soo basically 1 year tesla raked in about 194 million off of that alone and they would be able to collect more data about driving from 160k more new people . AND this isnt even including the people who previously bought a tesla and have a fsd subscription that they will probably have for the following years aswell.

Now one last thing , tesla doesnt only make cars . They also work on being very efficient with energy storage and use.  Tesla has a solar energy sector that makes millions, tesla has its own insurance , and most importantly tesla is testing out and refining energy storage. Remember that tesla factory battery fire in Kangaroo land? Well that caused the stock to soar because it remined investors that holy fuck tesla isnt only a car manufacturer , its a fucking tech company . 

Either way tesla is about ready to make its climb from 700 back to 900s its just a matter of when.

TLDR- Tesla stock brrrrrrr

Below is a fairly in-depth due diligence on Lucid Motors, also known as Lucid Group, Inc and now trading on the NYSE as $LCID. I've been disappointed by most of the low-effort DDs posted so far and feel we need something more complete. I've made an attempt to be as neutral as possible but as a disclaimer I am long-term bullish (position discussion at the end). I've tried to be as neutral as possible with corresponding resources easily available so you can make your own decision. The boring stuff like company history and technology are detailed at the beginning, but for those of you just interested in share price you can fast forward to **MARKET OPPORTUNITY**, **VALUATION ESTIMATE** and **TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS** toward the end.

I'm posting this now because I feel the current share price makes for a potential great entry near the 200-day moving average, on top of other technical and fundamental factors outlined below. Upcoming volatility will also be useful to those of us playing theta strategies. LFG.

▶ **BACKGROUND:**

Lucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone\*.

In 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.

In 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site\*. Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase\*, with early construction already having begun\*. Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to > 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes\*.

Lucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a ""two horse race.""\* In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21\*, bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as ""post-luxury,"" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence\*.

▶ **TECHNOLOGY:**

***Motor***\*: Lucid utilizes a *permanent-magnet synchronous motor* which is much more efficient than a traditional induction motor (eg, those used by Tesla until the Model 3). Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire → more resistance → more heat → decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***

Lucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds\*. Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.

https://preview.redd.it/58e0bwpkkcj71.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c430e6b2db149da642c7e62784b7990523dbbb2d

https://preview.redd.it/m25tqedmkcj71.png?width=2155&format=png&auto=webp&s=a50a1d0566d8ff6872f588de307ce5a41a33870f

***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (""dumb range""). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I2R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)\*:

https://preview.redd.it/rlbjwa1okcj71.png?width=2191&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca1292576948128353dacebbbb24686bb98cb6c2

Higher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW\*. The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW\*.

For battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier\*. While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)\*. Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.

It should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells\*. This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week.

Some have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips—it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*—the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.

***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform\*. It allows compatibility with—and the maximizing of—charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).

***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their ""Full Self-Driving"" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities\*. Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available on Lucid's website\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**

**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:

[\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now\*](https://preview.redd.it/fsgu9uhpkcj71.png?width=2452&format=png&auto=webp&s=18cabbf7c21f7a9aeb8790fb65b7d5e5d53b664d)

**Gravity SUV**: ""Project Gravity"" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market\*. Prototypes have already been built\* using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.

[Project Gravity SUV](https://preview.redd.it/i728mi0rkcj71.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9bcf294372eb8ca630905dabc87ce31d1e3d181)

**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **CHARGING:**

Charging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships\*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \~20kW and DC charging up to \~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo\*.

Tesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.

Modern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

**▶ PEOPLE:**

Lucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resumés from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.

**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO/CTO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979\*. Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)\*. At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production\*. Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer (CTO) before being promoted to CEO in 2019\*. Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter\*; however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted\*.

**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021\*. Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)\*. She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.

**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy\*. Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally\*. Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.

**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors\*. At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.

Besides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com\*. There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly\*, expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**

**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020\*. This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.

**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.

**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of >500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.

**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid’s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:

* 2021 - 577 vehicles
* 2022 – 20,000 vehicles
* 2023 – 49,000 vehicles
* 2024 – 90,000 vehicles
* 2025 – 135,000 vehicles
* 2026 – 251,000 vehicles

*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021*\*. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year\*\*\*\*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.\*

**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026\*. Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**\*.

https://preview.redd.it/czx96l9ukcj71.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e18981f489b11a8a7ec5f4d4b3ca74d5cdc2561

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **FUTURE DIRECTION:**

Peter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California\*. They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they’re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life\*. Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.

https://preview.redd.it/6qetnfmvkcj71.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48148b612d6d7030ccd91419e5a574294483bc28

As a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.

Lucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022\* and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018\*. If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**

**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:

|*Company*|*Valuation (8/22/2021)*|*Total debt*|*Price-to-sales (P/S) ratio*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tesla (TSLA)|$673.5 billion|$11.1 billion (6/2021)\*|18.33\*|
|Toyota (TM)|$226.8 billion|$24.5 trillion (6/2021)\*|0.81\*|
|Volkswagen (VWAGY)|$144.6 billion|$219.2 billion (6/2021)\*|0.51\*|
|General Motors (GM)|$70.8 billion|$111.1 billion (6/2021)\*|0.51\*|
|Nio (NIO)|$57.9 billion|$2.7 billion (6/2021)\*|12.7\*|
|Honda (HMC)|$50.7 billion|$7.7 trillion (6/2021)\*|0.37\*|
|Ford (F)|$50.2 billion|$148.2 billion (6/2021)\*|0.37\*|
|Lucid (LCID)|$35.1 billion|$179 million\*|N/A *(see below)*|
|Xpeng|$30.8 billion|$2.7 billion (3/2021)\*|N/A|
|Li|$27.1 billion|$3.9 billion (3/2021)\*|N/A|
|Fisker (FSR)|$3.9 billion|$20.2 million (6/2021)\*|N/A|

This is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026\*. *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion\*. *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).

For comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.

With this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52\* so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

**▶ TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS:**

I personally don't put a lot of weight into TA--certainly not in the short term. That said, LCID saw a peak of $64 during the early SPAC rumors in February 2021, then crashed hard after DA was officially announced. Like a lot of the market (especially EVs and tech) it continued a downtrend through spring and summer until reaching a nadir of $17.25 on 5/13/2021. This had been followed by an upward channel through 8/16/2021 but has since broken the lower support and moved below both the 50-hour and 200-hour moving averages. On the daily chart we're also below the 50-day and just scraping the top of the 200-day. RSI is currently near the oversold side and MACD looks to be making a reversal. Historically there are several points of support around $21.30 and we're currently just above this lower bound. Personally I think this makes a decent entry point if you're looking to go long.

[Nothing fancy, just bottom trend-line, 1-hour SMA, RSI and MACD](https://preview.redd.it/nbfewd7xkcj71.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6a91f908af657fb38ec9813ab35713781fa067f)

Fundamentals are outlined above. PIPE lockup expires on 9/1/2021 and will likely create a good amount of volatility; however, since EPA/crash test results, press coverage and delivery announcements are expected in the very near future there look to be several factors either maintaining or potentially pulling the price upward. Motor Trend magazine will be publishing an article tomorrow (8/25/2021) regarding the first public test drive, with senior editor Jonny Lieberman testing out the 500+ mile range by driving between SF and LA this past weekend (tweet). If you're into high-end watches there's something there for you too\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **COMMON QUESTIONS:**

**Q:** ***When does PIPE lockup expire / will this drive down price?***

**A:** As per the most recent S-1 PIPE lockup should expire on 9/1/2021 (page 169). Here's a prior post thoroughly discussing PIPE lockup expiration and the effects it may have on share price. In brief, about 55% of PIPE investors might be considered long-term and 45% short-term. There are about 150 million PIPE shares, or 9.3% of all outstanding shares. If 45% of PIPE sells that's still only 4.2% of outstanding shares trading hands.

**Q:** ***When are deliveries?***

**A:** Lucid has only officially announced deliveries as second half of 2021. Motor Trend magazine's senior features editor Jonny Lieberman recently drove an Air Dream edition in tandem with Peter Rawlinson and was reportedly told Q3 2021, however he speculated it may be October (Q4).

**Q**: ***When is crash testing and EPA verification?***

**A:** No specifics at this time other than both are underway and ""near completion""\*.

**Q:** ***What about the chip shortage?***

**A:** Peter Rawlinson reports they have bought ahead, securing enough semiconductors for all production vehicles through 2021. They have additional mitigation plans for alternative sourcing and PCB redesigns if required. They have a relatively modest volume ramp for 2021, so they are less affected in the near-term than other manufacturers. You can watch Peter discuss the issue here (start at 4:00).

**Q:** ***What's the four-finger gesture Peter Rawlinson has been making in photos over the past few weeks? (examples*** 1, 2, 3, 4)

**A:** Jonny Lieberman claims to know and will publish the answer in tomorrow's Motor Trend article (8/25/2021). Best guesses are (A) confirmation of 1111 max horsepower, (B) big news on 9/4/2021as this is the ending date of the mandatory 40-day quiet period after listing on the NYSE, or (C) he's the last surviving member of Chicago's Four Corner Hustlers\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **PERSONAL POSITION:**

I won't divulge my exact position other than to say LCID represents 55% of my total portfolio with a DCA of $23.90. I also have multiple calls/LEAPS, mostly Jan 2023 including $15, $20, $25 and $30 strikes, with a few Oct and Nov 2021 calls sprinkled in as lottery tickets. I wheel a smaller stack on the side to collect premium during the slower months and I'm currently trading on the CSP side. I buy a small number of shares almost every day and intend to make this a 5-10 year investment. If mods would like ""proof or ban"" I will happily provide screen shots privately.

Short story:

˝Intel said Monday it had landed a U.S. Department of Defense pact for an undisclosed sum to manufacture advanced microchips through its contract-manufacturing unit for the first phase of a broader program.˝

First phase of a broader program...

Finally somebody figured out that having most of microchips being produced on an island that China has a hard on for isn't the best idea.  

As part of governments ˝made in America˝ program Intel will invest in new factories in Arizona and expand existing capacity. 

On Taiwan they screwed over Apple and AMD and booked most of TSMC's 3nm capacity for the next year.

In Q1 2022 they will also release their new gpus. Rumors say that Intel's top of the range gpu is on par with Nvidia's 3070. 

If they manage to pull that one of and flood the market with a decent number of graphic cards - they will be flying to the moon just based on that one.  

Plus generally speaking they are swimming in cash.

Yeah I know this post is a bit gay and requires reading one linked article but I just had to post some fucking alternative to endless stream of posts about fucking BABA - a company that can be fucking delisted with one snap of Xi's fingers.

Everybody is talking about how cheap $160 BABA is and I'm just here facepalming at endless stream of people basically giving away their money to Xi.

### Executive degen 🚀🚀 TLDR summary:

- New IPO (Dec 2020).
- Seeking to disrupt a huge market ($4.2 trillion).
- They have the best tech in the space, with a 9 year lead in lending AI/ML (very good moat).
- Exceptional leadership, with founders being high level Google execs who left to start the company.
- Incredible financial results reported in their Q2'2021, growing +10x as much as the likes of TSLA.
- No fear of regulation as they have a ""No Action"" letter from US government body.
- Still at the very tip of their growth journey, having only 4% market share of the unsecured personal loan space = massive growth runway.


### For visual learners:

I've also made a video about this review, if like me you're more of a visual learner, and can get over my monotonous voice feel free to watch my video on [Why You Should Own Upstart](http://youtube.com/watch?v=rartz8VcWjw).

# Intro

I've been heavily reading up on [Upstart](https://www.upstart.com/) for the last few months, and I believe we're looking at a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here (despite being up [362.37%](https://www.google.com/search?q=upst&rlz=1C5CHFA_enGB885GB885&oq=upst) since IPO already). From everything I've read about the technology, leadership and market and competition, I think we're looking at a future tech behemoth currently hiding in plain sight. 

I've compiled my notes in the report below, if you need the *executive degen TLDR*, or prefer visual notes you can head straight to the bottom.

# Company History

Borrowing & lending is a practice as old as time. Our economies are based on borrowing be it at government level, institutional level, or even at the individual level. Whats mind-blowing is that borrowing and lending remained largely the same for the last [5000 years](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9780230554511_1). The problem Upstart set out to solve is the question of how to quantify the borrower's risk of defaulting. In simple terms, there are a lot of ""[good borrowers""](https://www.upstart.com/about#credit-limits-2) out there, but lenders generally have a hard time identifying them using current systems which are [old and dated](https://www.fico.com/25years/). So just like shopping (AMZN, SHOP..etc), EV (TSLA) and consumer tech (AAPL),  consumer lending, a [$4.2 trillion market](https://www.notion.so/361e12bb766a4ad0bd38ffbd2ce37169), was due a massive tech disruption (UPST).

Key dates:

- Founded in 2012
- [Pivoted](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2014/05/23/why-upstart-abandoned-education-crowdfunding-to.html) from its initial niche (crowdfunding loans) to the larger [$84b](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomtaulli/2021/08/13/upstart-can-ai-kill-the-fico-score/) market of personal loans in 2014.
- Entered the auto-lending market in [2020](https://www.upstart.com/blog/introducing-ai-enabled-auto-loans?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_LfWzrC0S2PevMQ6xYcT2HwpIxXCbBEE0HeX9COT3a78-1629740458-0-gqNtZGzNAyWjcnBszQ-R)
- [IPOed](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/upstart-prices-ipo-at-20-for-market-cap-of-1-45-billion-11608092379) late 2020

# Leadership

The story of Upstart is quite unusual. The company was founded by three people with diverse backgrounds expertises, and even generations. Dave Girouard was the [former head of Google Enterprise](https://venturebeat.com/2012/03/16/googles-president-of-enterprise-dave-girouard-is-leaving-to-launch-his-own-startup/), and before that he was an executive at Apple. His co-founders are Anna Counselman, the former [manager of Online Sales & Operations](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2013/12/06/silicon-valley-40-under-40-anna.html) at Google and Paul Gu, a university student who dropped out of the computer science program at Yale to start the company (also a [Thiel Fellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiel_Fellowship)). For a founding story, its unusual for three people to come together and decide to build a company on the spot. But 9 years later, they are still at the helm of a profitable and disruptive company. 

# Upstart's Business

Upstart's business caters to two distinct segments: [Individuals](https://www.upstart.com/personal-loans) and [banks](https://www.upstart.com/for-banks).

Their offerings to individuals consist of a variety of personal loan products, examples of these include:

- Credit card and Debt consolidation loans
- Home improvement loans
- Medical loans
- Wedding loans
- and Moving loans

For banks, Upstart offers its AI technology as a way for banks to improve their archaic lending processes. This is kind of genius because instead of competing with banks, Upstart [partners with them and complements their services](https://vimeo.com/489878274). Studies completed with several  US banks suggested that Upstart’s model [could approve almost three times](https://www.upstart.com/about?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_52250deb9dc2f9889c94cd45e31c286d7522a9f8-1629210053-0-gqNtZGzNAuKjcnBszQvO#results-to-date)  the number of borrows at the same loss rate as traditional models, as well as make a reduction of 75% in defaults at the same approval rate, this is unprecedented in the lending business.

## The Problem

At the moment, [90% of the top lenders in the United States use FICO scoring](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-fico-score/) to assess credit-worthiness, this is a scoring system first developed in 1989 which is comprised of five components:

- Payment history
- Amount owed
- Length of credit history
- How many times someone has applied for new credit
- The variety of credit products you currently have

## The Solution

This old scoring system prevents many people from getting loans at a reasonable rate. By comparison, Upstart leverages [1600 different data points](https://vimeo.com/492637158) [fast forward to 05:35]  that have been trained on more than 10 million repayment events to reach decision within seconds. This machine learning model continues to get more effective as it processes more repayment data [!!]

And this is Upstart's competitive edge. Their AI and machine learning models facilitate *better* borrower selection and provides both *higher* approval rates as well as *lower* interest rates for customers. The numbers here are staggering: tested Upstart models were found to approve [26% more borrowers than traditional models whilst yielding 10% lower average APRs for approved loans](https://www.upstart.com/about?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_cDRNu2tNRiO1uogDDmRKdDE3YeeO2hfOn4Xr6m5gmrU-1629741551-0-gqNtZGzNAuWjcnBszQzR#results-to-date). This expands access to prime credit, which is great for customers (but its also great for banks as they would approve almost **twice** as many borrowers with fewer defaults). This is a [win win](https://leadersinlending.sounder.fm/episode/hybridized-banking-system-jeff-keltner?page=2) [start at 03:00] situation for both lenders and customers seeking credit, absolutely mind-blowing!

Upstart's AI also increases automation throughout the lending process for banks and institutional buyers. To illustrate this point they recently reported that [71% of their loans were instantly approved and fully automated](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) -[page. 4] - with no need for document uploads, calls or waiting! 

Upstart is using state-of-the-art AI technology to disrupt:

## How Upstart makes money

From page 101 of Upstart's [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1647639/000119312520313385/d867925ds1a.htm):

> Upstart’s revenues are primarily earned in the form of three separate usage-based fees, which can be either dollar or percentage based depending on the contractual arrangement. We charge our bank partners a referral fee of 3% to 4% of the loan principal amount each time we refer a borrower who obtains a loan. Separately, we charge bank partners a platform fee of approximately 2% of loan value each time they originate a loan using our platform. These fees are contracted for and charged separately, although they are generally combined for accounting purposes as they usually represent a single performance obligation. We do not charge the borrowers on our platform any referral, platform or other similar fees for our loan matching services.

> We also charge the holder of the loan (either a bank or institutional investor) an ongoing 0.5% to 1% annualized servicing fee based on the outstanding principal over the lifetime of the loan for ongoing servicing of the loan. Taken together, these fees represented 98% of our revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. In addition, we earn a small portion of our revenue from interest income and our securitization activities.

## The Competition

Another point that makes the case for Upstart's future growth is just how far ahead they are from the competition. As an example the scoring methodology used by Goldman Sachs, the underwriting partner of Apple responsible for Apple Card, has been the subject of much public scrutiny and criticism in a number of recent high profile cases. One example being the case of David Hansson the creator of Ruby on Rails who in late 2019 received [20x the credit limit of his wife despite sharing the same financial ability](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/14/how-the-law-got-it-wrong-with-apple-card/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE57fF0YBl-DFkXQ2li8zbbzDR75qwiW-PyKPzfrssfgJSecSj9o_GV8iZ5SNYQlRythx0XAAqN5CTuqpV6sAoDun3fsn4ohmiBUHrqN6ooT-_fgbOIcVN4wr9C4fQrbE26BqXrhl6ttnT1xTpUKj2GUkFzf4dKoCaNFGjiOSL1t). Another more recent example is when the CEO of Cloudflare, Mathew Prince [applied for an Apple card and received credit limit of only $4500](https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1426552810896871435?s=20) at a rate of 21.99% APR, [despite being worth $4.2 billion](https://www.forbes.com/profile/matthew-prince/#:~:text=REAL%20TIME%20NET%20WORTH&text=Matthew%20Prince%2C%20CEO%20of%20Cloudflare,Microsoft%2C%20Baidu%20and%20Qualcomm%20Ventures.)!

These examples may appear trivial, and they are.. after all we are discussing billionaires being denied credit, but they are high-profile examples of the competition's inferior AI offerings. Besides, the questions and concerns around lending and borrowing in the age of artificial intelligence are very much real, and touch upon very important questions about access and fairness, an aspect of Upstart's offering that is quite compelling. [Listen to Jeff Keltner](https://leadersinlending.sounder.fm/episode/digital-lending-sam-sidhu?page=3) [47:20], Upstart's head of Business development touching on Upstart's effectiveness as a fair lender:

# Financials

To better understand how the business of Upstart is doing, lets take a look at their [most recent earnings report of the second quarter of 2021 published just about a week ago on August 10](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347), I will preface this by saying that its one of the best earning reports I've ever read! 

- **Revenue:** In the 2nd quarter of 2021 Upstart reported revenue of **$194 million**, this is an increase of - get this-  **1,018%** from the second quarter of 2020 [!!!]. I can not stress how impressive this is, even by growth stocks standards, you simply dont see numbers like this everyday!

    To illustrate just how out of this world Upstart's revenue growth is, lets look at revenue growth reported by other more popular degen-type growth stocks for the same quarter: 

    - **[Tesla reported revenue](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/ZBOUYO_TSLA_Q2_2021_Update_DJCVNJ.pdf?xseo=&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22q2_2021.pdf%22) of** $11.69 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of **98%**.
    - **[SoFi reported revenue](https://s27.q4cdn.com/749715820/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/SoFi-Earnings-report_FINAL_081221_4.pdf) of** $231.3 million, representing a year-over-year increase of **101%**
    - **[Shopify's reported revenue](https://s27.q4cdn.com/572064924/files/doc_presentations/2021/07/Shopify-Investor-Deck-Q2-2021.pdf) of** $1.12 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 57%
    - **[Palantir reported revenue](https://investors.palantir.com/files/Palantir%20Q2%202021%20Business%20Update.pdf) of** $376 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 49%
    - **[Fiverr reported revenue](https://s23.q4cdn.com/749308338/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2_2021-Fiverr-Shareholder-Letter_FINAL.pdf) of** $75.3 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 60%
    - **[Etsy reported revenue](https://s22.q4cdn.com/941741262/files/doc_presentations/2021/08/[FINAL-NAP]-Etsy-2Q-2021-Earnings-Presentation-V2.pdf) of** $529 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 23%

    ...etc etc, I can go on. 

    Even if you account for this improvement being partly due to COVID, looking at the results sequentially you still see an improvement of 60% from $121 million in the first quarter of 2021 to $194 million in the second quarter. No matter how you look at it this is an incredible result.

- Transaction Volume Growth was up **69%**

    Upstart's bank partners originated 286,864 loans, totaling $2.80 billion, this is up 1,605% from the same quarter of the prior year. Conversion on rate requests was 24% in the second quarter of 2021, up from 9% in the same quarter of the prior year.

- **Income from Operations:** Income from operations was $36.3 million, up from ($11.4) million the prior year.
- **Contribution Profit:** Contribution profit was $96.7 million, up **2,171**% from in the second quarter of 2020, with a contribution margin of 52% compared to a 32% contribution margin in the second quarter of 2020.
- **Adjusted EBITDA**. Adjusted EBITDA was $59.5 million, up from ($3.1) million in the same quarter prior year.

In terms of financial outlook for 2021, Upstart expects:

- **Revenue of approximately $750 million (they have essentially raised guidance by $150 million since their previous report guided for $600 million)**
- **Contribution Margin of approximately 45% (vs prior guidance of 42%)**
- **Adjusted EBITDA Margin of approximately 17% (vs prior guidance of 10%)**

***Sirs, do you get it?***

I cant overstate how incredible these results are. As I was listening to the earnings conference call, I caught an amusing moment when the Director of Equity Research for Bank of America could not help but address the fact that he has never seen a four-digit growth figure reported in his career.. [have a listen yourself](https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/gn5dbj7b) [35:40]. 

What the bank of America analyst correctly pointed out was that Upstart managed to achieve such incredible levels of growth at a time when the personal loan market across the United States was actually down.

# Risks:

- In terms of risks to investing in Upstart, one of the main issues facing the company is business concentration. Cross River Bank is Upstart’s most significant partner, [with fees received from the bank accounting for 60% of revenue](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1edgjPy-jXuIhvLSFLkuvTMXxMDt_Kq0R/view) [p.9]. Having a single customer generating such a big portion of your revenue is a serious risk for any business. The good news is that Cross River’s concentration of Upstart’s business has come down meaningfully over the last year from 79% to the current 60%. The hope is that, increased Upstart partnership with other banks will diversify its funding base and thus reduce concentration risk.
- Another risk is increased [regulations](https://gfycat.com/coldcanineeyas-nate-dogg-regulator-warren-g) or legal scrutiny that can stop or restrict Upstart's AI models. This is obviously a real risk, particularly given how new AI lending is. The good news is that Upstart received a [no-action letter](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-issues-no-action-letter-facilitate-use-artificial-intelligence-pricing-and-underwriting-loans/) from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that essentially guarantees no supervisory or enforcement action against Upstart for the next few years.

## Future

- In terms of Upstart's future plans for expansion, the company plans to target the $635 billion Auto lending market. [They've already expanded to 47 states](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) (up from 33 states last quarter), thus having access to more than 95% of the US population. They've also increased their dealership footprint by 24% sequentially this quarter.

    But their biggest move in the auto lending space has to be the [acquisition of Prodigy Software](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2021-03-17/upstart-to-acquire-prodigy-software-a-leading-automotive-retail-software-provider) which is a leader in the automotive retail software space. Paul Gu, the co-founder of Upstart describes **Prodigy as the"" Shopify for car dealerships""** .

    Through acquisition of Prodigy Upstart was able to generate vehicle sales of over $1 billion this quarter, another very impressive result. They also already have five bank partners signed up for auto lending on their platform.

- Recently, Upstart filled a newly created [General Manager of Mortgage position](https://twitter.com/saxena_puru/status/1426859770833637380). This signals early stages of offering a mortgage product which would mean entry to a massive $2.5 trillion dollar category.

To conclude this section on the future of Upstart, I will leave you with [a short clip](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1697077/8693359-investing-in-ai-episode-10-dave-girouard-from-upstart?client_source=twitter_card&player_type=full_screen) of Upstart's CEO discussing how the company is setting out to be the biggest player in AI lending in the world. My main takeaway from this interview was just how early we are to the Upstart story [23:45].

# Putting my money where my mouth is

In short, [YES](https://streamable.com/73pefs). I am a mere mortal so no over the top yolos. I mainly invest in growth stocks and have recently been adding to my Upstart position like crazy, taking it from 11% to around 30% of my portfolio. 

# Conclusion

Upstart reminds me so much of Shopify at the beginning of its growth-spurt, in the sense that it is a future giant hiding in plain sight. Do your own due diligence on the company before making any investments, but after many many hours of consuming every bit of data I can get on the company, I believe it will a massive success over the next 5 years, and we will all look back and wonder why we didnt invest enough.

This is a once-in-a-life-time opportunity imho.

If you've read all of that I salute you friend!"

It’s got Peter Thiel (ROTH IRA gang) and Karp at the helm, two really smart and patriotic guys, who know what they’re doing. The IBM partnership was huge in expanding the private sector growth, adding almost 3000 to the sales team. There’s an ever growing log of government contracts meaning they have steady revenue.

Palantir’s retail investors are also a class of their own and Karp recognizes this as noted in one of his recent interviews. This I think is huge in cultivating an investor base that will buy, hold, and believe for years to come. It’s currently my largest holding and I only expect to be that way for the foreseeable 5-10 years. I have no intention of letting a single share go no matter how long boomers keeps it down.

Every other day there’s news of a new or renewed contract. One day it will be too much to ignore. Wall Street has either been too lazy to understand the company or, if they have done the research, they’re too stupid to act on it. At least Cathie Woods knows what she sees, currently owning over $872M of it...This is going to be her next Tesla call.

Constantly, being bashed by analysts but being scooped up by the same banks? Come on now, once these jamokes are done loading the boat and the upgrades come out its game over.

Karp and Thiel added over $57m in gold and they are pro digital currencies so that's a plus. No debt and \~2.4B cash on hand.

They are aiming to be Skynet...make of that what you will.

On the TA side of things, it's forming higher bases but bases none the less. The longer the base the longer the explosion to the upside. Once this gets hot the lid is coming off and this is gonna blow.

BarkBox is the Trojan horse of the Pet Industry.  The competition is paying attention. 
Below is an explanation of BARK with some data that I gathered from my conversation with Matt Meeker, the co-founder of BARK. 
Overview
Barkbox is a brand that is synonymous with dogs and funtertainment gave the monthly subscription box of toys, treats, and chews. Nevertheless, Barkbox gets a reputation as a fad/niche business. A company that started as a hobby/passion for dog owners is now a business with over $500 million in revenues and 2 million subscribers.  I see Barkbox as a trojan horse business where you successfully have 1 product and then extend the line. Apple did this a few times, with computers, then MP3, then phones. Crox did it with their shoe and Deckers Outdoor with the UGG boot; both thrived.  The common denominator was a disciplined management team, a great product, and a strong brand. Barkbox has the common denominator in spades. 
Timeline of Barkbox
Three scrappy entrepreneurs started Barkbox.  They would tinker their product until they would get it right, and many times they would fail, and that is fine, but one thing they noticed was that entertaining the audience and making attractive toys were key selling points.  Sure, there are many treats out there in the industry, but the offer becomes irresistible when you mix toys and treats.  Over time they noticed that they lost subscribers due to a few factors: 1.	How many toys are too many toys?2.	The pet may be getting older and loses interest; it happens. 3.	The dog goes to doggy heavenIn facing these realities, the company had some hard questions to answer.  How many potential customers are there out there that would purchase this subscription?  What other products can we create or sell that allow the customer to stay frequently with us?  
Is Barbox special?
Well, if you own a dog, you probably have heard of them.  Their social media footprint is close to 9 million followers across all platforms. Their angle is entertainment, mixed with practicality and affordability.  The perfect recipe to cater to all generations of dog owners, from young to elderly.  Their toys range from WWE-themed toys to Weed paraphernalia to mainstream-looking toys that attract the mass market shopper at Target, etc. Barkbox is unique because it attracts a demographic similar to Pinterest, as most of the customers are female, more than 75%.  These are the soccer and pageant moms and millennials who choose a dog over having children or at least postponing having children.  This is not just a USA trend, but a global one, accelerated due to COVID as people realized being lonely is not fun and a dog brings all the benefits of companionship and entertainment. Customer opportunity
BARK caters to super fans, which is people who love and are borderline obsessed with their pets.  Although 65 million households in the USA own dogs, I think the market opportunity for BARK’s current subscription box is in the 30% range or 13 million subscribers.  They currently have 1.95 million and over ten years have had an additional 2 million already sign up and cancel, which leaves around 9 million left to go with the CURRENT subscription box offering; when you consider barkeats and barkbright and the other channels, they can keep growing the ecosystem.  The loss of a subscriber is not necessarily bad because if the brand is strong enough, it will get the customer to come back to maybe buy one toy, treat, or home product they are interested in or sign up for BarkBright or BarkEats, so yes they may have lost the $240 annuity. Still, they may be able to get them to buy $50 to $100 a year in other products.   That is less money going to Amazon or Chewy. Customer Revenue Channels

Subscription	Toys and Treats	Super Chewer	Bark Bright	Bark Eats	Combo of 2 of the above or more. 
DTC store – Barkshop.comRetail – Target, Costco, etc.
What is the Barkbox moat?
If I had to sum it up, it would be its ability to listen to its audience and cater to attract products they would be interested in buying or looking forward to in their upcoming shipment. Zappos started selling shoes and became so good at listening to their customer they got acquired by Amazon.  Service matters, and Barkbox has knocked it out of the park compared to peers. 
What did Matt and I talk about? Lots. 
Given my previous conversation with the Investor Relations department, Mike Mougias, I had already cleared up some of the housekeeping questions and wanted to take the time to ask Matt as many questions about the business, obstacles, etc. 

Let me be upfront in saying I have been sending a few e-mails to the management team, and this meeting was supposed to be 30 minutes and ended up being 1 hour. I think we could have gone longer, but I would prefer them to keep growing the business, and I appreciate the time they gave me.  I have also sent them e-mails regarding their interview on Cramer’s show, five pages of notes of their Investor Presentation that needs a lot of work; this may have been one of the reasons there was none after the quarterly earnings report.  My main concern or talking points revolves around the bear thesis, which is that the business model is a fad or niche and will not be sustainable and what is Barkbox’s plan to extend the membership from 16 months to 20, then 24, etc.  
The response I got was that BarkEats would help extend the average price per subscriber and extend the duration. Although I know, that is an easy response we have heard in conference calls and investor meetings, I brought up that changing people’s habits to buy dog food would have to offer a significant value proposition, whether it is a better price or better quality food.  People who routinely shop at Costco or Chewy will not cancel a monthly shipment of dog food so quickly.  I agree that a segment of customers will prefer the convenience of small packages, changing food as the pet matures and set it and forget subscription vs. not having to haul a 30-pound bag of food in a store, etc. However, for the segment of dog owners that aren’t too super fanatical, saving money counts. I explained to them my personal experience of how I buy dog food via Amazon and that the pricing for BarkEats was more expensive per pound, and I failed to grasp the added value of their offering.  They agreed they need to keep working on it, and this is why the BARKEATS has been tinkered with for over a year.  The program was initially launched in April of 2020 and has not grown fast because the company has been tinkering with the offering, or maybe they are seeing that people are not as receptive to it?  Sometimes you have to have the right balance of cynicism and optimism/vision. Could they grow this fast?  Yes, but then what they don’t want is massive cancellations after that, so I am ok with being patient in getting it right, but if the product offering was terrific, we should be pretty close to an actual aggressive launch.   
I then asked if there are any plans for a rewards program?  No, plans.  Now, I think that is a mistake because if you lose 2 million subscribers over ten years, there is a sense of no reward for the loyalty of any kind OR not enough products to warrant a program and pressed further.  How do you expect people to stay longer if you are not rewarding them, get their friends to stay longer, or reward other purchasing behavior outside of the subscription?  It ends up that the company had silo’d a lot of division within the company, and some were resistant to offering discounts on new products released, etc.  So, if I got a subscription and say added a bed, they would not give me a discount, but they would if I would try BarkBright.  They admitted that this was not the best approach and are working on combining or allowing additional benefits to subscribers via some discounting.  Nevertheless, I was disappointed to know there was no plan for a rewards program, and after the e-mail was so bothered by it, I sent a detailed proposal of a plan I think would work for Bark.  

Here is my e-mail below:After the call, I kept thinking of a few ideas on how to help bring back some old members and keep the current ones longer.  I think the best solution is to have the ultimate rewards program for Pets ever made.  Every airline and credit card has one, and why can't dog parents?  So, I thought of BarkBucks.  I know Apple does not have a rewards program or “discount” unless it’s a digital subscription. However, if you consider the cult following of Chik-fil-A, they have a rewards program and still have thousands of customers out the door every day, so I think a good program will go a long way and given your market is primarily women, you have to cater to their needs which is a mix of passion and competitiveness. Like you said, some would get jealous if their box didn't have a toy and someone else did. Below is more or less some brainstorming of how I think it could work at the surface but not sure about the financial impact if, for example, you go back to a subscriber that you lost two years ago that paid for two years and canceled, do you have them come back and give them a Tier below for one year? Perhaps this program works out better when there are more products released?  These are questions you will have the answers to or need to find, but I hope this is helpful to get the ball rolling. BarkBucksThe best loyalty programs are ones that have the following features:·        Competitive environment where higher status gets them more rewards and better deals or better toys?!?!?! Personalized with dog name on them?!?!·        Exclusive discounts to products or storewide.·        Exclusive events or products only sent to those Tiers (this encourages people to want to spend more within the ecosystem vs. chewy; this is why the key to keep launching home products, etc.)·        Allow people to accumulate points to spend on products within the ecosystem, outside of the ecosystem, and share the points with friends and family. ·        Transfer, gift, the points to anyone for a fee.·        Exchange the points for cash (gift card of AMEX, VISA, etc.) You can charge a hefty amount for this.Chik-fil-A has a good program that I think works perfectly for BarkBox, and I thought of more or less how it would work.Tier 110 Points for every dollar spentTier 2Earn 5,000 points in a year (paid $500)Earn 11 points per dollar spentReceive 5% discount at Barkshop.comReceive an additional 5% discount if you sign up for two or more subscriptions of 6 months or more.Tier 3Earn 10,000 Points in a year (spent $1,000)Earn 12 points per dollar spentReceive 10% discount at Barkshop.comReceive an additional 10% discount if you sign up for two or more subscriptions of 6 months or more.Exclusive products or access to products before released to product (use the points to get them)Access to special events in specific cities. Program info:Points expire within 24 months of the last end received.Points can be sent to friends and family as gifts with a 10% fee in matters. So, if they ship 500 points, they are charged 50 points (this helps get some of the “funds” back).Points can be redeemed for products at a rewards page which includes Bark products but also some products outside of it that are DOG specific (it will be the most UNIQUE rewards program in the world for Dogs and maybe even Pets) like working with local groomers small family-owned vets or perhaps a partnership with some companies.
End of e-mail. 
Other topics in the discussion:
Margins.  I asked how much their shipping costs were per box.  They said that $6 per box was a high number, so I am now modeling $5 to $5.50 in my model, which means that the TRUE gross margin with shipping drops to around 45% to 50%, which is still significantly better than Chewy and Amazon. Keep in mind that they sell one of the highest margin products at any retail pet store; this is why they don’t want to open retail stores but keep building a brand akin to Nike. 
Dog Insurance. The management team has spoken about this to investors and has said they do not want to do this. I think the mindset of BARK is the correct one in that it does not want to be the one to tell clients, “Hey, sorry, but we are not covering the vet bill for Sparky due to X, Y, Z factors.” It sounds like a poor customer experience, but in the insurance industry, you sometimes have to reject claims, especially if they suspect them to be fraudulent or abusive. However, there is a way that works for everyone involved in that the company works with an insurance company and collects a flat fee commission for every customer that purchases the policy with BARK. Trupanion paid in 2020 $200 a customer, and I don’t think it is unfeasibly for BARK to get 250,000 customers to choose the insurance option as part of their subscription.  Getting, say, $150 in affiliate commission per customer on year one and, say, $50 every year thereafter brings in 100% gross profit into the business straight to the bottom line, tens of millions per year. Also, it gets the customer to go back to the website to renew, etc. 

Home Products.  The company has launched products at a rapid pace and today has more than 30 products in concept, which means a rollout of around ten that could be rolled out per year as these products need to be tested and sourced economically to be feasible to maintain the 60% or higher margin for the business. This division is probably the most underrated today as this division along with a rewards program, can help extend the life of subscriptions but also get them to stay within the BARK brand of products. 
Conclusion, overall, I walked away confident in the BARK story.  Yes, there is a lot of work they have to do, and that is why you are getting a discount today.  There is a lot of fear, panic, and uncertainty of the business, and I believe over a few quarters of results will show the power of the BARK brand and revenue channels, etc."

&#x200B;

As a general thesis, I believe the tech market (growth tech, although mostly focused on large growth) has 3 likely outcomes in the coming 2-5 years. A general market recession would mitigate this thesis as what falls in a recession is somewhat of a crapshoot (yes, I know certain things people need during recessions, is it a new iphone or macbook? Probably not, but they have other growth avenues outside of fancy hardware.

**Option 1**

Tech experience compound growth due to size. This is frankly my favored avenue the tech sector will take. There are a lot of acquisitions in the space, which is essentially less-risk R&D, imo. Essentially, you're outsourcing specific branches of R&D to 100 start-ups all aiming to address a major problem.

The size also includes infrastructure. Although storage is growing at a rapid rate, there is infinite data, essentially. So, the powerhouse nature of these large growth tech stocks will continue to expand with this \*\*massive\*\* head start.

**Option 2**

Tech is curbed by anti-trust and regulation. We've seen in before in financials and other sectors with specific anti-trust and regulation legislature. There's an inkling, a very evident one, of bipartisan support for tech legislature. Who knows about a tech tax - it's happening in Europe, but who knows if it will be appeasing to the voters and both parties. Old, grumpy politicians - from both sides of the aisle - do not know how to use an iPhone, let alone understand the complexities of legislature in the tech space.

**Option 3**

Tech scales and levels the playing field. It sounds ironic to say, but the innovation in the tech space has been relatively centralized as of late (Tesla, Apple, Alphabet, etc.), however, I do believe there is a time in the short to mid horizon where the ""knowledge"" transfer from mega tech to start-up tech is going to increase at a rapid rate. This would potentially bolster small growth over large growth, but I do believe there will be a natural brain drain from mega tech which will synthesize into an explosion of tech start-ups with significant backing.

Obviously, this trend is happening and has been happening for sometime. I simply believe there will be an uptick and shock to typical FAANG investors who have seen explosive growth since the Great Recession.

Frankly, I'm an asexual, low-cost ETF holder with aggressive tilts in the portfolio, rather than an active investor, but I'd be interested to hear y'alls view of mega tech in the coming years.

\---

TL:DR 3 options:

1. Large growth tech continues to boom (60%)
2. Regulation and the damn commies slow large growth and general tech (30%)
3. Tech becomes more equal across the spectrum, shifting gains from large growth to other areas of the market (10%)"

Forrest Gump is a testament to long term investing. People since the movie came out always think “I should have bought Apple.” And yet every year, Apple continues to gain value and the same thought occurs."

In their earnings call today, Wish said that they are seeing very unfavorable LTV:CAC ratios (basically spending too much on marketing to acquire new customers). As a result they said they will stop spending on acquiring new customers, instead focusing on increasing engagement among existing customers. If you look at the app downloads and website views, you can get a pretty good idea of when exactly they stopped trying to acquire new customers.

Their app downloads have been on a slow decline but started absolutely plummeting in August - probably right around the time management started panicking. The situation looks particularly bad on the Apple store (which management singled out as challenging, due to their new privacy regulations), where the Wish app has left the Top 400.

Together, let's hyperfocus on Matterport. This following DD is my PhD thesis that I've compiled on this stock. If you don't know about Matterport, start off with my [introductory post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ou2ap9/mttr_bringing_3d_photogrammetry_experiences_to/). Also, check out some other bullish sentiment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/owofq2/the_stock_that_mttrs/).

TLDR: Matterport is a software company that enables individuals and enterprise clients to efficiently create digital 3D models of physical locations.

\[The bot isn't letting me post certain links. Gotta remove em\] 

## Let’s Begin With an Analogy:

Amazon started selling books with a *vision* to expand into many products. Matterport is doing something similar. They’re targeting some specific industries such as real estate and a few others. However, the *vision* goes far beyond this.

## Indexing of 3D models:

Matterport’s CEO RJ Pittman (formerly at Google, Apple & eBay) [spoke in 2008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aH6q2NOTFAE) about Google’s plan to index the world’s images. This is the essence of what Matterport is going to do with 3D models. **They’re actively indexing the world’s fastest-growing database of 3D models.** This process will be automated and powered by AI.

Why does this MTTR?

## The Apex

Let’s talk about APEX Imaging Services \[Link blocked by Bot, just google it\]. Apex is [utilizing Matterport’s](https://matterport.com/industries/case-studies/apex-imaging-services-brings-store-experiences-life-3d-site-survey) products to bring 3D building information and visualization to storefronts.

**APEX serves multiple companies such as:**

* **Starbucks**
* **Home Depot**
* **Chipotle**
* **7 Eleven**
* **CVS**
* and even **Chick Filet**

These 3D models enable retailers to take measurements of the store without sending somebody out to do it in person.

Most importantly, the features of these stores are *MASS-SEARCHABLE* because of indexing. With indexed 3D buildings, you can search for every Starbucks that has a 5 sq foot bathroom. Instantly see specific features in stores. Corporate can click a few buttons and get whatever data they need.

**Indexing Applications for Real Estate:** These searchable features carry over to real estate. Want to find an apartment with large closets? Just click a few buttons. I don't actually have any idea if this applies in real estate I just figure that it will.

I mean, after all, newer generations value integrity and honesty in real estate listings. 3D tours enable users to experience a more transparent and honest representation of the space they’re looking into. Many agree that [pictures in real-estate are becoming misleading](https://www.macleans.ca/economy/realestateeconomy/real-estate-photos-are-distorting-reality-frustrating-would-be-home-buyers/).

Not to mention, being able to measure space to see if that couch will fit. It's a real value prop.

## The potential of searchable, indexed, 3D buildings is huge.

Just look at their partnership with Facebook AI. (Search ""Habitat AI Facebook"") 

That’s right. They’re [training AI on 3D datasets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDNamn-mYAQ). Matterport’s ever-expanding database of 3D buildings will fuel AI researchers in the coming years. Not to mention the datasets can be used for training robots in simulation.

This means Matterport could inadvertently accelerate our ascent towards an AI apocalypse. How could you not be bullish?

## Explosive Android Market Potential:

Android Capture is Matterport’s upcoming app which will enable a huge amount of onboarding onto Matterport’s subscription platform. Much of their growth can be attributed to their recent iPhone app, but that's only 20% of smartphone owners.

80% of smartphone owners own an Android device.  Matterport’s stock will pop when they release Android capture. I’m unsure about the specifics of how that'll work, whether it uses traditional photogrammetry, or will be supplemented with user-owned lidar attachments for Android.

## The Team:

>A goal without a plan, is just a wish. And they’ve got a plan.

New hires are coming in from Slice, Grubhub, and other startup companies. Their reliable and quickly growing team is the sole reason they’ll accomplish their plan.

## In-conclusion

Thanks for momentarily skimming through this post that I spent the past hour writing. I’ll continue to post fresh and relevant updates on Matterport as more news comes around.

This is  an entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a retard  posting on WSB  with a bias due to having a very large position of my portfolio in $F.  So, Don't act on anything posted in here and proceed on your own risk...)

**1- Ford's secret weapon unleashed:**

For the last **44 consecutive years**, the F-150 has been Americas **best selling Truck**. In 2019, the Ford F-Series was **second only to the Apple iPhone**, which  raked in **$55 billion**, in terms of **total revenue** generated. The F-Series **generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined**, Just something to think about.

On May 19, Ford has unveiled its EV F-150 after Biden had driven it a week prior. The EV's features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations (Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min ad video). It has all the features crucial for it's **target buyers** (Construction workers, Farmers, Free-lance delivery drivers, Basically hardworking Blue-collar Americans...) and it's **a Truck which actually looks like a Truck.** “Ford knows what pickup owners want,” IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. More importantly, it's an F-150 first, an EV second, Ford didn't abandon the F-150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years.

The reservation now have exceeded 120,000 since it's debut. An important point the CEO mentioned on the call was that **about 75%, or 90,000, are new to Ford, according to the company!** If anything, this indicates that Ford is the runner up for Tesla in the EV competition. almost every car manufacturer can make an EV, but only a few (I can count on one hand) can supply enough cars to keep up with demand with superb price and quality.

Now Ford's EVs are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla for the past 4 months with sales, more on this on #5). The F-150 starts at  $32,500 after Federal tax credit!! Cheaper than any of **""Potential(because they don't exist yet)""** competitors with superior car features.

It's relevant to mention that Ford's EV sales (counting electric vehicles and hybrids) increased 177% during June, capping off 56,570 units sold so far in 2021.

**As Ford promised, F-150 Lightning will deliver more features, and cost less...**

^(Don't forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs, and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year.)

**2- Ford Rivian Partnership:**

Ford-Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September. It's looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now 😂(Ford is 55.64B at 14.18$). Ford has initially invested 500$ million in Rivian, but it added much more of an undisclosed amount with **the most recent news being 902$million in Q1 of 2021.**

**On Jul 23, it was announced that Rivian closed a $2.5 billion funding round,** led by existing investors **Ford**, Amazon and T. Prior to it, they announced plans to open a second manufacturing plant and U.S States started submitting bids on it.

Farley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market. **As more companies continue to invest in Rivian, Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares,** ""but that's not why we invested,"" Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend.

Farley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV-SUV market too **with a Lincoln or Explorer-Rivian car**. He understands that **the first move is the most important one in the EV Game,** and with the Mach-E and F-150, Ford executed it's moves perfectly! Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices, high quality, while maintaining the demand(something which Tesla still isn't able to). Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1.3

&#x200B;

**3- Bronco capturing Buyers of other brands:**

Prior to the release of the Bronco, it had 190,000 reservations. **66% of the reservations were converted to sales!** Additionally, Farley mentioned in the earnings call that 70% of the 125,000 orders it has are customers of other brands.

According to Ford, dealers are keeping Broncos on the lot for an average of **15 days!,** with a big chunk of of the buyers coming from jeep. People are killing to get their hands on one. just go on Ebay and see for yourself. Bronco first Edition is going for 6 figures with the buy now being approx 150K$.

I would understand PS5 scalpers, but that happening with Cars, I never would've imagined. This shows how the demand of this car is insane and why Ford raised it's 2021 Revenue expectation from $3.5 billion, to between $9-$10 billion and they'll probably raise it again in the next quarter.

&#x200B;

**4- Ford's Governmental Fleet 3D chess Strategy:**

“Ford clearly has business and government fleets in mind,” Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said.

Ford revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F-150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday. Called the Lightning Pro, it’s equipped with a standard battery that’s good for an estimated 230 miles and costs $39,974, which is the base price for retail F-150 Lightnings.

Ford's vision to lead the EV market has a “no-brainer” component Elon Musk lacks: Targeting business and government fleet customers with new battery-powered trucks and vans. Ford’s focus on converting Gas fleet buyers to electric models builds on the company’s existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts. They know that they are already the best with no competitors when it comes to the quality or price of the F-150. They will literally destroy their competitors with this approach.

# 5- Valuation and Price target

Yes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.

$Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple

(Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- outdated)

TSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X

NIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)

GM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X

F - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X

**(Important part starts here)**

As you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.

If you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.

At that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **🇺🇸 🦅**.

**Ford is ready to dominate the EV market and it's just starting!**

When you walk through them and see that one is x6 leverage (🚀) and one is x35 (🚀🚀🚀🚀) it opens your eyes and makes you think a bit more carefully about what you're doing so you don't accidentally do something too safe. 

I like to follow the philosophy that if you can't teach something you don't understand it well enough so I made this into a video that explains this entirely using PowerPoint icons, which is linked at the bottom. I'm going to explain everything here though because I know clicking a link is a lot of work. 

When I did this math Visa was trading at $243.17 per share. Visa might not be a classic around here but look at that 5 year graph, you literally can't lose. You can buy a call (🚀) with a strike price of 240 that expires September 17th for $853. This call has a delta of about 0.59. I'm assuming the people here at least know that delta exists and where to find it. This means that this option currently moves up and down with the “power” of 59 shares. If this option moves deeper in the money this number will increase. If this option moves out of the money this number will decrease. 

Knowing that this option moves as if it were 59 shares is the key to finding its leverage (🚀🚀🚀). 59 shares at Visa’s current price would cost $14,347 but you only need to pay $853 for this contract, what a deal, which has the same ability to make or lose money. So with $14,347 you could buy 16 of these contracts (🚀) which means this contract has about 16 times leverage (🚀🚀🚀🚀). You can calculate this exactly by dividing $14,347 by 853 to get the amount of leverage at that moment, which is 16.82. So, every dollar you put into these Visa calls is going to gain or lose almost 17 times more than if you just bought shares. 

A 2 year call on AAPL could be as conservative as 2x leverage and a daily UPRO call could have 100x (🚀🚀🚀🚀). Know what you're getting yourself into before you throw your money into something like x2 leverage. 

For the big brains out there, this is a minor greek called lambda.

🚀🚀🚀🚀
TLDR: Option Leverage = (Delta * Share Price) / Option Price
🚀🚀🚀🚀

Example: Visa 240c 9/17 = (59 * 243.17) / 853 = 16.82

So let me begin with some TA or as I like to call it SA (Stonk Astrology) 

[$AAPL 1 day 2 year chart](https://preview.redd.it/7xofx6igqog71.png?width=2306&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fbdf6d7840b1e2f3c51c6ed2a0910dbd8bdc6a8)

&#x200B;

 What am I looking at? You might be asking and that's a decent question. So let me explain first starting with the 1 day/ 2 year chart. This chart I'm using to show that Apple tends to have its run ups preceding earnings. On that note if you have ever been wondering why you always get IV crushed at earnings its because Apple is so reliably profitable and has grown so consistently throughout its life span that Wall Street tends to price in that Apple will meet or exceed expectations well before they actually announce. This tends to be the pattern for most of the mega cap stocks that are highly globalized and have monopolistic tendencies. (think: MSFT AMZN GOOGL probably). 

 This second graph is the more important one as it actually shows actionable data. If you direct your goldfish-like attention to the 1 hour 30 day chart you can take a look at some things that I have laid out. 

1.)  The orange lines: they form a triangle if you didn't notice that than you definitely shouldn't be trading stocks, but if you have gotten far enough to identify a triangle than you can probably handle the idea of a breakout. As these triangles form they general lead to a breakout from the triangle formation and on to higher, highs or lower, lows. that's it, not that hard to understand

2.) Purple Lines: Just a trace of the prices to better visualize the patterns forming 

3.) Blue Lines: Simple moving avg I set my 3 moving avgs. to 20, 50, and 200, When the cross or spread out  they can help identify downturns or breakouts respesctively. 

4.) Red Lines: this is a fib retracement which uses the fib. sequence to help identify support and resistance levels between the highs and lows of and stock and beyond. The fib. retractions are the most difficult to explain because simply put I literally have no idea why prices using fib. levels as support and resistance. That being said, my research indicated to me that no one else could really explain it either, whether or not prices actually act this way or since everyone uses fib sequences that we cause price to act that way. Either way I have found these work really well when Identifying support and resistance. 

 Studies: I'm just going to clump these into to the same category but these are the charts that you seen on the bottom first one is volume, second one is the ATR which is relative volatility, and MACD which helps indicate refeversals and RSI which helps identify overbought and oversold conditions 

 The trade: so what this chart is telling me is that $AAPL has been consolidating for some months and could break out to new highs. What I am going to do is buy the oct 15 $155 call or the sept 17 $155 call if you are feeling confident like me. Something important I forgot to mention above is that $AAPL's implied volatility is not only historically low but also below the historical one year avg. What this means is that not only will your call option increase in value due to the run up in price but the run up IV that is likely to happen will compound your gains. Why is this likely to happen simply the law of averages? 

&#x200B;

[$AAPL IV vs. historical IV ](https://preview.redd.it/n03w9whpzog71.png?width=1914&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2505c6046090849e450eb4a84371f36fcad1235)

 Couple of notes: first I am not a financial advisor just a dude with a hobby, second obviously TA is a good look into what has happened historically it doesn't guarantee that it will happen. That being said, if this TA begins to bring down I would look at the $143.50 level as confirmation and as for confirmation on the upside you should look for the previous high of $150. To make this trade successful you might want to consider staggering your buys instead of the traditional balls deep all at once. For an example I have already entered this trade with 10 shares at an avg. of $147 and a sep. 17 $155 call at the same price. I plan to buy more 155 calls for both sept and oct. as the price drifts up to $150 if all goes to plan I am looking at a pt of around $160 

TLDR: I thing this is the begining of the apples run up before q3 earnings sep 17 $155 calls 

Positions: 10 Shares at 147.50 1 Sept. 17 155 call"

He compared 130 years old Merck(MRK) & 40 years old Amgen(AMGN).

And the market overreacted in co-ordination(BofA has long hands that can reach too far & wide)
See some facts below:
1) 130 years old Merck and 172 years old Pfizer could not make mRNA vaccine. Pfizer is marketing German BioNTech's vaccine. PFE did not invent it.
2) Moderna can not be assessed on age-old fundamentals. The same way Apple, Amazon, Tesla because their valuation is way over.
3) Insulin has increased more than 1200% since it was invented.
4) Gilead Sciences Sets US Price for COVID-19 Drug at $2340 to $3120
5) Gilead Sciences Sovaldi, a drug that can cure Hepatitis C in 90 days when used in combination with other antiviral drugs. The initial price was more than $1,000 per day, and the total cost of treatment could exceed $80,000
6) Moderna has only 1 product to sell. Which happens to be in the middle of a pandemic. Moderna was awarded some funding and it is keeping its prices down for Covid vaccines.
7) Moderna does not need to keep its prices down for future products since it will not meet with a similar pandemic.
8) Moderna has developed 100 proteins in the last 10 years but did not have enough funding to continue with the product R&D.
9) Now Moderna has the cash and can spend money for R&D so it can release many products in the years to come

Now how would you compare the company valuation when there are so many factors in play?
BofA’s Geoff Meacham said to compare its last 4 successful quarters – Moderna started selling its only product i.e. Covid vaccine from last Dec in the middle of the pandemic.

The insulin & Gilead was added for comparison that Moderna would not need to cap its future product price(Covid vaccine price is capped due to small government funding & Pandemic) and therefore will not need to sell many doses to make up the revenue 

This coordination looks very similar to Mani Foroohar from SVB Leerink that happened last year."

Sorry for the wall of text - but if you are serious about trading **please read through this -** I think you all could really benefit from a bit of intermarket analysis - and I see way too many victims of ignorance here who could prevent their losses by understanding these relatively simply concepts.

This sub is primarily focused on IWM names (Russell 2000/Small Caps). If you look at that stock - **it's been sideways for almost a year**. No secret you all have been losing tons of money as of late on your favorite names (Except MVST - nice one there).

In my eyes - for the best probability of success - you always want to be playing the names that are within the strongest index at the time (or simply playing the strongest index itself). I determine which is the strongest via charting plus some simple intermarket relationships.

Last year during the recovery we got a huge **everything rally** \- that is not usually the case. Money constantly rotates from sector to sector - this is how it usually is - and how it's been for most of 2021. For instance - notice today (8/102021) tech is dropping while financials, materials and other inflation camp names are pumping. This is one of many useful correlations.

# II. The Indices

The indices are large groups of stocks lumped in together that usually move in unison. Most of you probably already know this. I'm just going to list out what each index is and what it focuses on.

**S&P 500 (SPY, SPX, ES)**

*from Wikipedia*

""The Standard and Poor's 500, or simply the S&P 500, is a stock market index that tracks 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. It is one of the most commonly followed equity indices.""

Basically a compilation of most large caps in the United States. Great gage of overall market health - and sort of a cross between the other two large cap indexes (Nasdaq 100, Dow Jones).

**Nasdaq 100 (QQQ, NDX, NQ)**

*from Wikipedia*

""The Nasdaq-100 is a stock market index made up of 102 equity securities issued by 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock market. It is a modified capitalization-weighted index. ""

These are going to be mostly your large cap growth names (tech stocks) - but there are a few boomer names in there. Just more heavy on the growth side than the other indexes.

**Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA, DJIA, YM)**

*from Wikipedia*

""The Dow Jones Industrial Average, Dow Jones, or simply the Dow, is a price-weighted measurement stock market index of 30 prominent companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States.""

These are going to be your ""boomer"" names - I like to call it the boomer index. Value, materials, healthcare etc. Not really any growth names in there (except AAPL, CRM I guess). One thing I like to note is that **all the names in Dow Jones are present in the S&P 500 - the Dow is the most closely correlated index to the S&P** (about a 0.92 correlation iirc).

**Russell 2000 Index (IWM, RUT, RTY)**

*from Wikipedia*

""The Russell 2000 Index is a small-cap stock market index of the smallest 2,000 stocks in the Russell 3000 Index. It was started by the Frank Russell Company in 1984. The index is maintained by FTSE Russell, a subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange Group.""

These are all your small cap names. There is also a Russell 1000 and Russell 3000. Notice how many more companies are in here than the other indexes. This one isn't going to be moved by one or two stocks. Small caps usually benefit from risk on environments (they are perceived to be riskier) - but note the more speculative growth ones will lag in those situations.

These are also **meme stocks - pretty much every single one is in a Russell Index.** If you are someone who likes to play memes - you always want to watch IWM. When this one is popping off is when they will be making a run.

# III. Risk On vs Risk Off (Inflation vs Deflation Camp)

Moving onto more practical applications of this information. I could do a section on Forex, Bonds, etc. - but honestly you only need to know what they are to apply the analysis that I do.

The primary narrative driving the market in recent times is whether we are getting inflation or deflation - and this has dictated the flow of money.

**Risk On (Inflation Camp)**

Risk-On is described as a rotation from save haven assets into riskier assets. If market participants believe in high inflationary pressures, they will want to invest their cash into **""risk"" assets** including, stocks, real estate etc. to combat the residual effects of inflation on their money. Additionally, they believe we are now in a rising rate environment (rates already at zero, likely to increase in the future), which would help benefit **value stocks, financials/banks, energy, specific forex/currencies**, anything that benefits from low rates (currently).

More specifically, **banks benefit from a gradual steady increase in interest rates.** Banks make an interest rate spread on deposits received versus money lent. In a rising rate environment, they are able to pay lower interest on their deposits and make a larger spread on their loans.

Commodities, materials (energy), and consumer/defensive stocks **benefit from inflation** as they are able to pass on rising costs to consumers. Additionally, value/defensive stocks typically have a strong track-record of recurring dividends and share buybacks to provide yield to shareholders. Conversely, in later stages of rising rates, investors may divest from growth or tech stocks because rising rates have a direct effect on liquidity and cost of capital. **When rates are high, debt is heavier and money is more expensive.**

AUD/JPY is an easy forex pair to watch for risk on movements based on the Australian economy in relation to Japan. A**UD is seen as a ""risk"" currency**, whereas **JPY is seen as a ""safe haven""**. When AUDJPY is increasing, typically this is a sign of ""risk-on"". This is only one of many pairs to watch for in Forex Markets, considering Forex Markets are much larger than the stock market.

Remember, in the early stages of inflation, small caps or tech stocks will perform well because the negative impact of inflation on sitting in cash; however, if the federal reserve is required to combat hyper/stagflation worries, they will raise rates and growth or tech stocks may perform poorly in that environment. Furthermore, **Dow Jones Industrial Average (boomer)** names will usually outperform, and investors today may be pricing-in this effect.

Equities as a whole will generally do well in a risk-on environment. Stocks are considered a hedge for inflation, but watch-out for JPOW and his antics later on.

**Risk Off (Deflation Camp)**

This is the opposite of risk-on. Money rotates out of risk assets into safe havens. People in the deflation corner believe inflation is transitory, asset prices will decline, and virtually **assume the Federal Reserve won't have to raise rates**. In low inflation or deflationary environment, money flows **to safe haven assets out of risk assets**. Participants would hoard cash (increasing in value) and wait for asset prices to decline. They would invest in **bonds, safe haven currencies, speculate on an increase in volatility, and save cash to reinvest later.**

In recent times - growth performs well here because when interest rates are low - money is cheaper to borrow. **Growth depends on debt to continue it's operations. Most of them also don't make money and so they have** **no yield.**  An increase in interest rates will raise the cost of capital making it harder for companies to generate higher returns. With rising rates, a company has to pay a higher interest expense that lowers their overall profitability. Lower profits lead to lower cash flows, which lead to a higher required rate of return for investors, all of which lead to a lower valuation for the company's share price. Note this is primarily due to recent macroeconomic events - and in the past all equities have been considered risk on.

Bonds outperform because investors believe rates to remain low or fall further. They'd be able to receive a **""higher"" interest rate today versus in the future.** Bonds are typically safer than equity because they are first in-line in the event of a liquidation (bankruptcy) and earn a fixed rate of return. Additionally, the **USD, JPY, CHF** perform well because they are a 'safe-haven' currency. The US Dollar is still considered the world's reserve currency. (Trust in the US Economy/Risk Free) In addition, deflation has a natural increase in the dollar's value.

The VIX performs well because it's **essentially a measure of how hedged SPX players are**. If you are expecting deflation in assets - you are expecting prices to drop for the most part - and so you want to be hedged on your long positions (or make straight bear bets).

**In Summary**

Today, the Federal Reserve has created a low interest rate environment to stimulate the economy; through allowing participants to borrow funds ""cheaper"" or lower rates. This stimulates demand, supply, borrowing, lending... overall growth. Asset prices are attempting to ""price-in"" the future state of the economy.

If you believe that inflation is here to stay, then you'd want to shift into risk-assets. If you believe that inflation is 'transitory', then you'd want to move towards safe haven assets. Ultimately, you could assume that the Federal Reserve controls the narrative and that any major movements in the flow of money, cost of debt (change in rates), could have a positive or negative impact on asset prices. In either scenario (in the future), inflation can lead to higher interest rates causing a drop in asset prices or deflation worries can keep interest rates low and fuel the rally for longer than one would expect. I hope that makes sense.

<Risk-On>

* Financials
* Commodities
* Value
* Materials
* Real Estate
* **Basically Most Equities**
* AUD/JPY (AND OTHER RISK-ON CURRENCY PAIRS)

<Risk-Off>

* Bonds
* Dollar
* VIX
* Growth/Disruptor Equities (SOMETIMES - THIS IS A NEW CORRELATION STEMMING FROM COVID MAKING TECH NAMES SAFE HAVENS AMONG OTHER UNPRECEDENTED FACTORS)**

# IV. Practical Applications

First let me go over the tickers I watch for each rotation -

<Risk On>

* YM (DIA)
* RTY (IWM)
* CL (Crude Oil Futures)
* ZC (Corn Futures)
* AUD/JPY

<Risk Off>

* DXY (Dollar Index)
* ZB (30 Year Treasury Bonds)
* TNX (10 Year Treasury Index)
* VIX (The ""Fear Index"")
* NQ (QQQ)

Glancing at a watchlist of these will give you a quick picture of where money is flowing at the moment - but in order to predict the odds of future movements (and more profitable ones) - I perform technical analysis on all of these names.

Basically - I analyze all the indices and only play the one that is the strongest from a technical standpoint. I further filter these signals and determine position sizing by analyzing their correlated assets.

For instance - if **DIA** is breaking out - and **ZB** is breaking down - this is confluence for a risk on rotation. The more confluence - the higher probability you have of success in any play.

On the contrary, if **DIA** is breaking out - and **ZB** is rallying - this is a sign one of the moves is likely fake - and a signal I have lower odds of success. Subsequently, I want to size smaller.

***Let's take a look at one example in which QQQ (Growth, Risk Off) caught the rotation this past May. This is a perfect example of Bonds and Growth moving in unison to provide a high probability long trade in QQQ and TLT. Note: I just use trendlines and volume for my technical analysis. No indicators.***

QQQ - https://ibb.co/wwhXm2k

The red circle is Nasdaq on **5/13.** You can see that is the day it bottomed - and every day since then pretty much Nasdaq and Growth assets have been leading. Not only that - but on **6/22** it broke a huge technical setup (the big red line) - which triggered a ton more upside.

TLT - https://ibb.co/kyzWcsP

The red circle here is also **5/13.** You can see that is also the day that TLT (ZB or Bonds) bottomed - and every day since then except for the past three days - it's held the same uptrend. Not only that - but on **6/22** it also broke that big red line - which was a downtrend stemming from last year - triggering more upside here as well. We also broke out of that teal symmetrical triangle, which provided more confluence for the move.

I try to assign a signal strength to each move in order to make it easier for my monkey brain to understand.

* **Indexes:** 3
* **Bonds:** 2
* **Everything Else:** 1

You will see a lot of people say bonds are everything - and in my experience that is very true. Last year we had an extremely odd situation where risk parity was fucked - but in recent times it has come back. Correlations almost always revert to the mean at **some point**. Subsequently - you could watch just bonds and the indices and efficiently track the flow of money.

# V. Divergences

Correlations are not perfect. If they were - everyone would be a billionaire. There are times when we get divergences and things move opposite of the way they usually do. Like I said - they **almost** **always revert to the mean** at some point - but the catch is the divergence could blow your account before it reverts back. If you are good with technicals you can easily spot when a setup you are trying to play breaks down and stop loss accordingly - but the key point here is **always have a stop loss when playing correlations.** Lots of people think they can average down infinitely and eventually profit off the arbitrage that comes with assets reverting to the mean - but **the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.**

# IV. TL;DR

The main thing to takeaway here is the indices. If QQQ is weak - maybe you want to take a look at DIA. If IWM is sideways - maybe you want to take a look at QQQ. Keep your head on a swivel and don't be too biased towards one sector. **If you can effectively track the flow of money - you can theoretically catch every rotation.**

Also - you don't have to apply the technicals I do to track it. That's just my method. Lot's of people use complex macroeconomic analysis to assess these sorts of things, among other methods. I'm just too smooth brained for that.

I hope this helped you all - and if anyone has questions drop it in the comments.

\---

Edit: One final note since I know the more advanced people will likely comment on this. I know QQQ/Growth has not always been risk off - this is a new thing. I was trying to explain things from the perspective of recent times as correlations shift with macroeconomic changes.

We haven't had a true deflationary environment in over a decade - and subsequently the market rotations have been more about pricing in rate hikes/rate cuts than rotating in and out of equities as a whole.

Last Edit: Added some clarification - fixed some formatting stuff."

1. Many businesses in US depend on China. We may not be familiar with the names of the many SMEs in US that depends on or benefits from China’s cheaper production costs but we most likely have heard of the big names such as Tesla, Apple, Gillette, Levi’s, Barbie dolls, Ray Bans, Nike, Converse etc and the list goes on and on.
2. Game theory. US is not likely to fuck themselves, their economy and China is not going to fuck themselves either, exiting from such a large market. Both sides are going to suffer the loss of an unprecedented number of jobs and the effect of which is an unimaginable hit in their economies. The best outcome for both cums from co-operation.
3. If for any reason that the size of their genitals matters more to them than their economies and people, we must remember that the rest of world gets fucked as well. This shit could cause a recession that spreads faster than a STD in college, so that’s additional protection (pun fully intended). If all else fails, maybe the UN may just send Samuel L Jackson down as The Negotiator to diffuse the tensions. 
4. With all that being said, if push comes to shove. Imo for a worst case scenario, they may just go into a “you-do-yours, I-do-mine” mindset and maybe China stocks get delisted from US stock exchange. Imagine this: BABA, JD, PDD delisted from US markets. Guess what... $WISH is an American based e-commerce platform. Boom. Mic drop."

**This is not one of those times.**

As some of you already know, VIAC flew 7% today after a fantastic earnings report that blew the doors off nearly every metric. I know what you're thinking: welp, missed the boat on another one. And yes everyone, I'm the guy who posted the [10k earnings FD Yolo](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oxalfx/preearnings_10k_viac_fd_yolo/) couple days ago (sold those today and rolled them into LEAPS). Today was a GOOD day - aside from forgetting to screenshot BEFORE I sold for once in my damn life, typically I do the opposite and then never actually sell and lose all of it.

But this party is literally just getting started.

On Monday, Discovery (DISCA) [drilled](https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Discovery-Q2-Earnings-Snapshot-16359685.php) to the center of the earth off of strong earnings but dismal growth numbers, **falling 6%** and taking Viacom (which trades similarly to Discovery) along with it on the ride down. Ever since the Archegos collapse (more on that later but all of you know the Bull Hwang story by now), algos have undeservedly tied these two tickers at the hip. Subtract that undeserved 6% from today's 7% gain, and it pretty much cancels out: VIAC is **basically only up 1% off** of a truly fantastic earnings report. In fact, this stock was literally higher as recently as a week ago - and that's when earnings were a huge question mark, but no longer. For once, fellow apes would be getting in on the **GROUND FLOOR**.

**Q2 Earnings Highlights** (Don't feel compelled to read this part if you don't want to, TL;DR: they knocked it out of the park)

* Revenue: 6.56B (est 6.52B)
* Adj EPS: 0.97 (est 0.96)
* \+6.5M streaming subscribers (42M total between P+, Showtime etc)
* \+2.8M PlutoTV MAUs (52.3M total)
* \+45% watch time per user  (Roku's decreased)
* \+24% ad revenue yoy
* \+9% affiliate revenue yoy
* \+92% (!) streaming revenue yoy
* Paramount+ [officially launched in Europe](https://variety.com/2021/streaming/global/viacomcbs-sky-paramount-plus-europe-launch-1235035254/), expands in South America
* In this market you really need to pitch a perfect game to not get sold off on earnings. This was a clean sweep across the board: Viacom, priced like a value stock, just blew out all the growth stocks in growth metrics (looking at you Roku). And the best is yet to come (more on this later)

Ok let's review what Viacom even does for those who don't know. If you do know, skip this next part.

**1.** **The Business**

&#x200B;

[If you haven't watched something made by one of these brands there's just simply no way you live in America. ](https://preview.redd.it/k1j6my9sxmf71.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=69242a8e76eea2ce69f669d9d46ead5a9c0988cb)

Viacom basically owns every single TV channel you retards grew up watching. Nickelodeon, MTV, VH1, Comedy Central - from our childhood cartoons at Nickelodeon to the greatest comedy sketch show of all time (Chapelle's Show - no debate) to the shitty reality shows of the 2000's (Jersey Shore): Viacom owns ALL of it. It also owns Showtime which makes Billions, the unofficial TV show of WSB.

In a day and age where streaming content is at a premium, Viacom is sitting on an absolute TREASURE CHEST of content.

**How They Make Money**

* Advertising - Good old fashioned TV ads during programming (both traditional and streaming)
* Affiliate - The cut Viacom gets from the boomer retards who still pay their provider for cable TV
* Streaming Subscriptions - the 5 or 10 dollars a month from Paramount+ / Showtime
* Theatrical Releases - Did you know a Quiet Place 2 (made by Paramount) is the third highest grossing movie of the year behind Fast 9 and Black Widow? And cost a fraction of those to make? But yes, people still buy tickets to see movies (just ask the AMC apes, they know what's up).
* Licensing - Viacom doesn't keep all the content they make, they also license it out to others for LOTS of money. Much like a pimp that whores out prostitutes instead of keeping them all for his own sexual desires, VIAC is all about licensing money. HBO paid them half a BILLION for South Park. Amazon paid them 150 million for Coming 2 America, one of the shittiest sequels to a classic of all time. And as Netflix, Amazon, Apple all fight for content, fees are only going to go up. And all that money goes right back into fueling Viacom's sleeping giant: Paramount+

**Paramount Plus**

Even total retards know that traditional TV as we know is dying. Gone are the days where the whole family gathers around the tube to watch Modern Family at 9pm - these days everyone is on their own schedule, they mostly get their shows through streaming apps when they want it. More and more families are cutting the cable cord, opting instead to go with streaming apps like Netflix, Disney+, Amazon - with varying degrees of success. Streaming is the future - nothing new here.

Paramount+ is the brand spanking new streaming app that Viacom is banking on to contend with the big boys. The market has basically valued this venture at fucking zero - and you know what that was somewhat understandable: it's a crowded industry, the app hadn't existed for even a full quarter yet, the street wanted to take a ""wait and see"" approach.

Welp, Paramount just blew the fucking doors off all projections for their first full quarter and put to rest any doubts about the viability of the app. Between Paramount (and premium cable sister app Showtime), Viacom now has 42 million users, up from 36 when they last reported. And the biggest catalysts for growth are still yet to come!

Anyways, back to live TV's alleged slow death. There is one MAJOR exception to this. Sports. While we can catch our Billions episode on Tuesday night because we missed it Sunday and have basically the same experience, there is nothing more useless than a rerun of a sporting event. We need that shit LIVE, and it's basically the only kind of TV that has to be.

**Are you ready for some football?**

Did you know that the NFL accounted for 71 of the top 100 most watched live broadcasts in 2020? That's almost 75 fucking percent! In fact the NFL was responsible for $4 billion+ ad revenue for host networks in 2020 - and guess who just extended their NFL deal? When fall rolls around, P+ signups are going to fucking FLY as the CBS team broadcasts every AFC matchup this year, conveniently located in some top TV markets - Kansas City, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, and New England are all AFC / ViacomCBS territory, and all happy to look pretty decent this year unlike NFC teams New Orleans, Atlanta, and Chicago (but i'll save this convo for r/NFL).

Oh yeah, ViacomCBS also has the SEC college football rights too, the only conference in college football that even matters these days. American Football not your thing? They got the rights to real futbol too, including UEFA Champions league soccer and Serie A. More of a hoops guy? Guess who has the exclusive rights to March Madness. More of a boomer? Guess who has the PGA Tour.

With over 1000 live sporting events a year, Paramount Plus may actually be the most complete sports streaming app out there, surpassing even ESPN.

**Boomers still watch TV**

If you're reading this, take a moment to wipe the jizz off your pants from Viacom's sporting dominance as we review their more traditional businesses and check out some of these stats.

&#x200B;

[Wait, you mean to tell me ONE company has the top THREE dramas, top SIX comedies, #1 news show, and the #1 most watched show in the country on TOP of the NFL, SEC, PGA, NCAA, and soccer?! Even if you're not big on this stuff, you have to recognize how impressive that is. I for one don't watch a single one of these shows, but I know a lot of middle America \/ boomer generation absolutely still live by this shit. They aren't going away any time soon, as much as we might want them to. ](https://preview.redd.it/c32ujr09umf71.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=9170cca3860c60b53f42980660de08668eabc63e)

Don't believe this? Check out [Variety's report from May](https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/most-popular-tv-shows-highest-rated-2020-2021-season-1234980743/) about the most-watched TV shows on TV. Sheer CBS DOMINANCE.

[I'm assuming none of us watch any of these shows anymore unless it's to find new memes for WSB, but we all have a son \/ daugher \/ stepson as product of cuckery \/ sibling who is right in the Spongebob \/ Paw Patrol \/ Peppa Pig age range. No one, not even Disney, controls THIS much essential IP for the children's market. For parents, Paramount+ isn't a luxury, it's an absolute NECESSITY to shut their kids up.  ](https://preview.redd.it/45mxntowumf71.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaca6e55ff23254f30066b0c035aac5eaf949465)

The order isn't specified, but out of the [most popular children's television shows in America](https://www.fatherly.com/play/most-popular-kids-shows/), Viacom through Nickelodeon produces the vast majority of them.

Alright, enough about Paramount Plus. It's the key to VIAC's future, but we've covered enough of it. As P+ slowly begins to claim back it's IP it's licensed out to other streamers to bolster its own library and starts churning out some seriously great P+ exclusives (THE NEW [HALO](https://deadline.com/2021/02/halo-tv-series-latest-paramount-plus-move-1234698703/) TV SHOW for example) reasons to get the app will become more and more compelling over time - for sports fans, boomers, and parents especially. But what about for the poor people who don't want to pay even one penny for TV?

**Pluto TV**

Let me start this off by saying this: if you don't have Pluto TV, download that shit right now because it's free. Literally zero strings attached fucking free, don't even need to make an account with a fake email address, it's F R E E freeeeee. Whether or not you buy the stock, if you wasted all this time reading through all of this you will have at least gained the knowledge of the single greatest free cord cutting app ever invented.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v187qgwyvmf71.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=55c2638210fbbfa7b1f2268e90dced25e9570566

But how does Viacom make any money by giving you hundreds of channels and not charging you? You guessed it: ads. This nifty free app is expected to generate [1 BILLION](https://deadline.com/2021/08/pluto-tv-reaches-1-billion-annual-revenue-milestone-streaming-advertising-1234809600/) in advertising revenue for Pluto in 2021, well ahead of schedule. I have this on 8 hours a day in the background because BloombergTV is included, and it's absolutely fucking amazing. CBSHQ is a great ESPN replacement too for the sports fans that can no longer tolerate the irritating sounds of Stephen A Smith. Check it out, it's sweet. And free, you cheap fucks.

***TL;DR: Viacom is one of the most complete streaming TV stocks you can own right now, with something for everyone and strong competitive advantages in children's programming, live sports, and boomer television shows. It's the past, the present, and the future. They are taking the enormous cash flows that still continue to be generated from their linear TV business and investing the profits into the future of television: streaming - they're eating their cake and keeping it too.***

&#x200B;

2. **The Competitors (If you know the streaming space intimately, skip this part too)**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Contrary to popular belief, the SVOD pie is still growing even as we come out of the pandemic, and Viacom's share \(through Showtime and Paramount+, one of the only apps above to actually GAIN market share TWO straight quarters\) is expanding as well. Notice the 4&#37; DECLINE from Netflix between Q4 and Q2 2021 while Hulu and Disney have actually SHRANK as well. Time for a new sheriff in town?](https://preview.redd.it/uozq7ze0wmf71.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&s=6650e06867cfa58da7fee6c24c52cf5cb6492022)

**Netflix**

Those of you who thought Netflix runs this shit like Don Corleone are severely mistaken. While an early entrant and pioneer in the streaming space, growth has been hard to come by for Netflix thanks to a declining library, a refusal to compete in live sports or news programs, and more recently, a truly [bizarre foray into mobile gaming](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585802/netflix-gaming-mobile-subscription-earnings). As you can see, Netflix, while still #1, is in decline - as the most expensive app, they seem to be coasting more on the Netflix brand name. And on the off chance they make a show someone actually likes, it's probably [canceled](https://www.businessinsider.com/best-canceled-netflix-shows-one-day-at-a-time-daredevil-2019-6).

**HBO + Discovery**

You're probably most familiar with HBO as the channel that fucked up Game of Thrones beyond repair, rendering a once global cultural phenomenon to being completely wiped out from the entire pop-culture consciousness. Discovery makes all the dogshit reality TV such as 90 Day Fiancee that is tearing down the fabric of American society. Other assets include TNT (home of Charles Barkley and I really don't know what else) and CNN (the world's leading purveyor of fake news).

Welp, they're all joining together. As of [May 17th](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/att-to-combine-warnermedia-and-discovery-assets-to-create-a-new-standalone-company.html), Discovery is merging with WarnerMedia - a deal structured so poorly that it sent Discovery shares from the $41 it was at premarket that day down to a paltry $29.20 today. Not all mergers are created equal, and this [reverse morris trust merger](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reverse-morris-trust.asp) successfully transferred AT&T's HBO bags to unsuspecting Discovery shareholders, resulting in a debt-ridden entity that hopes to compete in the very long run.

I'm not going to bash Discovery too much because I do think it has a chance to be relevant down the line, but this merger isn't closing for a WHILE and there's just not a whole lot of upside for the stock in the short term. The potential of being acquired is now gone.

**Disney**

Disney has deep pockets, and Disney+ combined with Hulu and ESPN is a strong portfolio. Their dual theatrical release + Disney+ streaming release combo business model is also used by Paramount, and may prove to be the standard moving forward. Disney+ has two of the world's most valuable IP of all time in Marvel and Star Wars, so you won't catch me talking shit about them here. They're a strong player here, and is the only one that could challenge Viacom's supremacy in children's content (although IMO Paramount targets the 5+ demographic while Disney is more in the 13+ space). Then again, Disney isn't a pure play streaming stock either (Disney World, Disney Land) so it's not a perfect comparison.

**Amazon / Apple**

Both of these FAANG stalwarts have made half assed efforts to compete in the streaming space without really dedicating any sort of resources to it since they have so much other shit going on. Bezos at least pretended to care for a while, showing up to the Emmy awards and shit before getting bored and fucking off to space. Apple's AppleTV effort has been dismal to say the least, with a content library of around 50 titles and a userbase composed almost entirely of free trials that won't be renewed. More on this later.

**NBC / Peacock**The only reason to have this shit app is for Office re-runs when you invite a girl over to Netflix and Chill. Ironically Netflix actually lost the Office to its original maker (just another L in a long series of NFLX L's) but Peacock and Chill does have a better ring to it anyways. Otherwise, this app is basically useless and is the least likely to survive the streaming wars independently without some sort of merger. Which brings me to my next point.

**ROKU -** only a competitor to PlutoTV, not really a competitor to Paramount+. Have you seen their P/E multiple?

[Ok, I compiled the above myself and did my best to update through this quarter's ER's. It may not be ENTIRELY up to date or accurate, but I did the best I could since as far as I could tell there was nowhere else on the internet that had this info all in one place, I looked everywhere. Does not include Pluto TV, Tubi, Roku, or any of the free ad-based apps. ](https://preview.redd.it/hy2nnltqzmf71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdd1116b95dad14ad5388422ae22b3cb28d531db)

**VALUATION**

Ok, let's talk numbers, without which this is just paragraphs of drivel that no one is going to fucking read. If you apes made it this far by the way, I salute you. Here's where it gets fun. The below is sourced from a Google sheets template I built from scatch, sourcing from Google Finance and Finviz. I'll point out what I thought was noteworthy from each screen, but feel free to draw your own conclusions.

&#x200B;

[Check out that 52 week high column for Viacom and Discovery vs. where they are now. If you know the Bill Hwang story, you know what happened. If you don't, scroll down for a recap. This stock can get back there, we've seen it happen. ](https://preview.redd.it/ujkzehxh2nf71.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=22f72af4802f60044764a58e33dc92d4906cb565)

[Viacom's RSI yesterday was 34 before today's ER, while it's still basically trading below all three SMA's. While these numbers are terrible, you'll see they pretty much suck across the entire sector \(check out the SMA stats on the streaming ETF\). It's a downtime for the streaming sector coming out of the pandemic with money flowing towards reopening plays, while high growth tech has been mooning thanks to a second collapse of the 10 year yield. I expect this entire sector to recover H2 2021 via sector rotation back into communications when the 10 year yield goes back up \(it's projected to double by year end\). ](https://preview.redd.it/f6nictey1nf71.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=5770c797fbc24c8ffda3967c96ae80b07d7273b0)

&#x200B;

[The important thing to note here is institutional onwership aka \\""the smart money\\"". Viacom is a whopping 85+&#37; institutionally owned - asset managers, banks, hedge funds, pension funds, you name it. The short float number isn't high so I'm not going to lie to you about short squeeze potential. You'd have to be retarded to short here at 41 rather than back at 100 anyways.   ](https://preview.redd.it/pwc4c7ab4nf71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3f86afe54becb04fce814a784d500a8e2719047)

&#x200B;

[Yes you are reading this correctly - Viacom trades at a paltry 9 P\/E and just 1 times revneue!!! Even compared to its peers in traditional TV, this is ludicrously low. Why should FOXA be higher despite not having a paid streaming app? Why does ROKU deserve to trade at a whopping 239 P\/E and Netflix at 54 P\/E? I'm not arguing that VIAC should be anywhere near those P\/E's, but with everything it has going for it, 9 is ludicrous. You're not going to find better-hidden value than this ANYWHERE in the S&P 500. Run a screen and sort by P\/E if you don't believe me.](https://preview.redd.it/e8jgc35v4nf71.png?width=1368&format=png&auto=webp&s=1daf37f3492e539bb9db61202d35f5d26776bcbe)

**3. ARCHEGOS aka Bull Hwang gets Margin Called (Skip if you know the history)**

I don't want to spend too much time on this story because all of WSB knows it for the most part. Legendary fund manager Bill Hwang blew up his account in a matter of days in true WSB fashion by being levered 20 to 1 in names such as Viacom, Discovery, Baidu, Tencent Music, IQiYi, and other assorted hilarity. With the bath that Chinese stonks have taken lately and the precipitous fall from 100 to as low as 38 in Viacom, it's easy to dismiss good old billy boy as just another retard in over his head.

But this guy saw something in Viacom. Instead of telling the entire Archegos story, i'll lay out the sequence of events as relates specifically to VIAC's share price.

[A lot of times, retards throw out random price targets that stocks will never hit in their entire existence. Here, we already know what VIAC is capable of. Sure it took a 20-1 levered Korean fund to get us there, but this glimpse to the past is actually a glimpse into our future. I'll hold off on naming an end of year price target myself though, I don't like doing that without building a full model which I just don't have the time for tonight. ](https://preview.redd.it/rul9xc7v6nf71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=34643da441c29a25656d6a79683e40d63c08e2b1)

[This chart would probably be more useful to reflect this week's price action, however since I made this whole thing from scratch it's going to take too long so fuck it. As you can see, streaming stocks have mostly all taken a breather since March. Getting in now is a classic buy low situation, something us apes really need to start trying for a change.  ](https://preview.redd.it/h48bqj886nf71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=72cbacf88a2561531bf19d1685159119d8763346)

**4. MERGER MANIA!!?**

WSB might be composed of a bunch of retards that barely know how the market work, but everyone knows this: if you own stock or options in a company and it gets bought out, it is the FASTEST and most satisfying path to tendies. Strategic acquisitions are known to pay a [much higher premium](https://labusinessjournal.com/news/2021/jul/19/stamps-com-acquired-7-billion/) to what a company is trading for on the open market. There's no better way to exit a position than waking up to an alert that something you own has been acquired.

At least that's how Discovery shareholders felt the morning of May 17th before ***discovering*** they weren't getting bought out, they were getting CEO Zaslav's turd sandwich of a merger in which AT&T dumped HBO and all their associated debt on Discovery shareholders, who only get a paltry 29% of the new entity while AT&T holders get 71%. AT&T holders fared no better as the announcement accompanied the news that AT&T had to nuke their dividend to get this deal done, which was the only reason to own that POS to begin with. It was a rare deal in which everyone loses, except Zaslav himself.

But while DISCA owners were left holding their dick's, a world of possibilities were opened up for the remaining players in the streaming space to be acquired by the giants. Shortly after Amazon acquired the private MGM studios, which basically only has James Bond at this point. Much speculation ensued about whether the remaining players (VIAC, Lionsgate, AMCX, CURI) would be acquired by the giants of Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Disney etc.

I'm not going to sit here and lie to everyone and say a merger is imminent, I have no fucking clue. What I do know is Shari Redstone, chairwoman and largest stakeholder, is finally [open](https://www.wsj.com/articles/comcast-ceo-brian-roberts-and-viacomcbs-chairman-shari-redstone-met-to-discuss-streaming-partnership-11626743478) to shopping Viacom, something her father would have never considered. With a complete portfolio of sports, children's, and boomer linear, no acquisition would fix Amazon or Apple's lackluster TV efforts than Viacom. However, I don't think Viacom needs to be acquired, I think they have a legitimate shot of being a player in this space on their own.

**TL;DR We don't need to be bought out for tendies, but it sure wouldn't hurt. No acquisition would be more attractive than Viacom to immediately turn a tech giant into a streaming powerhouse. It's merely the difference between mooning sooner vs. mooning later. Either way, Shari's listening.**

**5. Analyst Price Targets**

Upgrades are coming. With earnings this good, we're already starting to see upgrades TODAY from analysts who weren't too lazy to pass in their work by EOD.

&#x200B;

[Bank of America also has a 53 PT from last quarter. I would expect further upgrades from the rest of the street tomorrow. ](https://preview.redd.it/mixl44gu8nf71.png?width=473&format=png&auto=webp&s=be78d48b7c413066e1372b36ce1a7646df207a58)

Even Without accounting for the new upgrades from today or tomorrow, the average VIAC price target is still $50.34, representing a 21% upside.

**6. Conclusion**

I wanted to get into some technincal analysis of this thing (cup and fucking handle anyone???) as well as risk factors but I'm out of time, I'll save those for a Part 2. Will be happy to answer any questions in the comments.

**TL;DR: Viacom has been consolidating for over 4 months and is finally about to fucking blow the roof off after showing phenomenal growth in a space primed for industry consolidation. This is the best positioned streamer as far as IP goes, and an acquisition would moon this basically immediately (while not essential to the investment thesis, it would be nice of course).**

**7. Position**

[ignore the XBI, this was the easiest way to fit it all on one screen since RH still sucks ](https://preview.redd.it/0sqeaecqanf71.png?width=341&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf0b8bcfe3b13a6a8b80fe3937769b6e0870e1bf)

EDIT: This blew up more than I thought it would. I've never posted DD here before but the overwhelmingly positive reaction I've received from this has inspired me to contribute more to the community. Now, initially I was going to make a separate Part 2 post but I don't want to be seen as spamming so I'm just going to put it as a comment and add it as an edit. Besides, it's probably important to have the risk factors of the trade as part of the original post.   


**8. RISK FACTORS**

Alright everyone. Some of you read the whole thing and YOLOed. Some of you didn't read any of it and still YOLOed. Most of you probably didn't do shit. And that's ok, because I want everyone to read this next part first before deciding. 

* **The entire market could crash** like the gay bears have been promising for months. This would of course take out everything with it, and VIAC is no different. The 10% Correction gets thrown out regularly, I'm not an economist so I really don't know if or when this is going to happen - although most of us will have way bigger problems than just VIAC if that does occur. 
* **The decline of linear TV outpaces the growth of streaming.** This is the worst case scenario for Viacom: advertisers pull their dollars out of linear which has been a cash cow and reallocate them elsewhere (i.e. NOT streaming), leaving Viacom underfunded for P+ growth. I must acknolwedge the potential risk of this even though I assign a very low probability to this in the short term since Viacom just completed the [best ad buying upfront they've ever had](https://deadline.com/2021/06/viacomcbs-upfront-paramount-pluto-tv-cbs-nfl-1234783415/). That article is a good read because it's not just Viacom tooting its own horn, it's the entire industry! If anything it paints a fairly rosy picture of where the money is flowing. 
*  **The P+ app fails to gain traction**. Paramount plus has seen two straight quarters of new user growth while Disney and Netflix have actually declined. However, it's certainly easier to gain new users when you're app is new. We don't know if something will keep growing at the rate it has. Reddit and Twitter do have their fair share of people bitching about the P+ app as far as content availability (some seasons of some shows are still [licensed out](https://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/2021/05/paramount-plus-missing-real-world-challenge-seasons/) to competitors and the short term) and bugs (the Playstation app is apparently abysmal while the other apps work much better - I've never had an issue on my Samsung or Fire apps). The bottom line is that while P+ has the same growing pains of any new app, the devs do need to figure their shit out, do their fucking job, and keep complaints at a minimum. 
* **Competition** \- The competitors in this space have DEEP pockets. All 5 FAANG names have some sort of video platform, Netflix is of course the leader here, and Apple and Amazon have at least made half assed attempts to be players in this space. A strategic shift from either Apple or Amazon to suddenly start pumping cash into these efforts could prove to be a threat for the survival of Viacom as a viable independent player. The silver lining here however is that should they choose to do that (Apple especially has done basically jack shit) - the easiest way to suddenly increase their position would actually be to buy Viacom's vast IP.  
* **Merger.** But wait, wouldn't a merger be a good thing like you said earlier before? Not always, and unfortunately Discovery already laid a very recent, very relevant blueprint for why not all deals are good deals are shareholders. I've seen a similar deal pitched in which Comcast unloads NBC Universal onto Viacom in a reverse morris trust merger; I would expect that to do to our share price what the Warner deal did to Discovery's. If we are going to get acquired, it better be all cash or all stock, and at a valuation that reflects our true value. I think Shari Redstone is actually our friend on this, she won't screw us the same way Zaslav fisted his shareholders. Conversely, if Viacom suddenly decides they want to be a buyer rather than a seller, history dictates that it's the acquiree's share price that moons while the acquirer's share price that takes a hit. There's no guarantee that the long-established 38 price floor will hold in the event of strategic M&A. Given the [ludicrous valuation](https://variety.com/2021/film/news/reese-witherspoon-hello-sunshine-sold-1235032618/) Hello Sunshine just got, I would much rather be a seller than a buyer in this market. 
* **Dividend.** In my infinite retardation I somehow managed to forget to mention this stock pays a fucking healthy dividend too, which is probably a factor as to why we have so much institutional ownership. A dividend cut of course would hurt the share price. I see the probability of this as basically near zero, the balance sheet looks pretty good right now. 
* **The Options Pinning Theory**. A lot of people are claiming this stock only exists to kill weekly options, but on most weeks I don't see enough open interest for that to actually be worth it for MM's. One thing is certain though, all calls bought after Archegos expecting a bounce to the 80-100 range got nuked. Thus far, call selling has been a more profitable trade than call buying MOST of the time. While personally I think shares and leaps look like the play here (my position currently reflects that also), any time this thing dips below 40 is when to go in with FD's as it very rarely spends too much time below there. For the more conservative investor, SELLING 38 puts is literally free money. 
* **Archegos -** Some say there is an Archegos curse, that nothing in the Korean hedge fund is ever going to moon again. I mean this is some voodoo shit but I feel like it has to be included here. The Chinese stocks he held are obviously down for entirely different reasons right now, and it just hasn't been a hot time for the value / comm trade, something I expect to reverse H2. 
* **The Growth Trade Never Fucking Ends.** As most of us know the tech trade was basically left for dead earlier in the year as shares of tech stocks tumbled as the ten year yield started to rise up steadily. This trade has reversed, and all the money has since gone back into tech, particularly the megacaps. The growth trade has been at the expense of the value trade, and make no mistake about it, ***VIAC IS A VALUE TRADE (LOOK AT THE P/E). It's listed on the NASDAQ, but don't call this a tech stock, it's a communications stock***. While it does look like the ten year yield has stopped drilling with today's nice bounce, there's no guarantee it doesn't once again reverse. However, I have a really difficult time seeing it going below 1%, and I'd be the whole house on the fact it ends the year closer to 2% than 1%. As the yield goes back up, they will shift the money from the growth trade back into value, which benefits VIAC. 
* **SPEAKING OF ALGOS** \- What does it mean to be heavily institutionally owned? Share price movements are more algo-induced from the big boys. They'll trade many stocks together simultaneously in the same industry, which at times can be unfortunate if you're grouped together with subar competitors. Layer a VIAC chart over DISCA between May and yesterday and you'll see what I mean, when one goes down so does the other. Today's price movement has been encouraging though, I have never seen VIAC green while DISCA is red I think ever. A decoupling here would be fantastic. 
* **The 38 Price Floor I believe in might not hold -** for all the reasons I included above, shit could go south, but this floor has stood the test of time and all sorts of wild shit this year. If it can survive the greatest margin call in history, and every retest after that, then this 38 floor is safer than any other investment I can think of since I don't know the floors of any other stock. But something only works until it doesn't right? So I'm including this as a risk factor since much of the thesis is based upon it. 
* **TL/DR:** There are risks to this trade as there are with any trade, and from the above it's wiser to go with a longer term trade in LEAPS form as much of this stuff takes longer to develop. I'd only go FD's if it dips below 40 as it doesn't spend much time below it. But when factoring in the growth potential, the safety of the 38 floor, the dividend, and the acquisition potential, this play really does have it all for me. Trade safely apes. "

In February 2020, the Company's Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to **$600 million** of the Company’s outstanding shares of Class A common stock. In February 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional **$1 billion** of the Company's outstanding shares of Class A common stock. The Company completed the February 2020 stock repurchase program of up to $600 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021.  During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired 18.6 million shares of its Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $431.9 million. This includes $200.0 million in repurchases of 8.6 million shares of our Class A common stock in conjunction with the issuance of the Notes, which was outside of our stock repurchase program.

Apple, Microsoft, and Google. People always bring them up so I figured id talk about it before one of you dumb fucks comments ""wHaT abOuT GoOglE Drrrrr."" 

They don't go after the same markets, Dropbox really goes after small to medium size businesses. This is their bread and butter. The other three fuckers go after larger size businesses. The cloud market is massive, there's room for all of them, especially when you consider that they have different client makeups.

**Last point**

If you haven't used Dropbox in a few years....you should. The products they are currently providing are fantastic. They have really focused on improving their services and it shows.

&nbsp;


What’s poppin’ bull-gang, Flux here with an options exit strategy “guide”. I wanted to make this writeup because more often than not, I see people making fundamentally sound trades, only to have their gains vanish due to having poor exit strategy. They either get too greedy and hold on for way too long, or they exit way too early and miss out on an insane runup and want to die for a couple of days afterwards. There’s two parts to each trade - an entry and an exit - and if you’re caught skimping on either end, you’re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. Although this part of trading isn’t glamourous, it’s absolutely vital to your overall success as a trader, so it’s crucial that you learn and study these concepts sooner rather than later. With all that being said, let’s get into it.

&nbsp;

#Types of Exits

There’s three types of exits that I tend to use when I conduct my trades, each useful in their own right. I’ll give a quick summary of them all, before providing an in depth analysis and examples of each.

&nbsp;

- **Fundamental Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding the change of a company’s fundamentals. These exits usually take place before the fundamental changes since you’re not going to be able to react to the changes in real time and you’ll end up getting front run by algos. Examples of this include taking an exit during an earnings runup or rundown, taking exits before company related news events, or taking an exit before any market-wide news events.

&nbsp;

- **Technical Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. Once I see a pattern or indicator pass a certain threshold, I know it’s likely time to exit my position. Some examples of technical exits may include exits taken around support and resistance levels, exits taken during gap fills, exits taken based off of technical patterns, and exits taken during the absence of any concrete patterns or indicators.

&nbsp;

- **Psychologic Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding market psychology. This is the simplest of the three categories, and is often used in tandem with the other strategies to provide yourself with the best exit possible. Some strategies include exiting around whole numbers, screenshot theory, and individual gain theory. More on these later.

&nbsp;

Obviously there are going to be a handful of strategies and categories which I’ve missed, but the ones I outlined above are likely going to be the ones which are most common to us retail traders.

#Fundamental Exits

**Fundamental exits revolve around one key idea - Sell the news.** More often than not, the results of a given news event are already baked into a stock's price well before the news event is confirmed or actually takes place. As a result, the price of a stock will almost always DROP even if this news is “confirmed”, because it was already priced in. This can be observed anywhere from earnings runups to product launches to fundamental news events. You may be wondering why this drop even happens in the first place - if the news is baked into a stock's price, shouldn’t it stay flat when the news is confirmed? Hint : Trading Algorithms.

&nbsp;

Algorithms, or algos for short, are always behind the inevitable tanking of a stock's price post news event. It’s quite easy to see why once you understand how these algorithms work. An algo can read through an entire earnings report / news transcript / whatever and fire off a corresponding trade in a fraction of a nanosecond, meaning that they’re at a huge advantage since they **have the ability to sell the news after the news event hits.** This means that algos don’t have to prematurely exit their position until they confirm that the underlying security was priced properly. If the underlying was priced to perfection, the algo takes its profits once the news confirms it (very common behavior among algos - take profits once there are no longer any catalysts in play), thereby causing the stock to tank. If the instrument wasn’t priced properly, and there is a huge upside beat, the algo just stays in the trade and reaps the rewards, exiting at a later date instead. This concept is pretty difficult to wrap your head around initially, so let's go through an example.

&nbsp;

**In our hypothetical example, let’s say $AAPL has just reported earnings.** 

&nbsp;

**Scenario 1 : $AAPL is priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and confirms that $AAPL was indeed priced properly. The algo then takes its profits (as per common algo behavior), and dumps the position as a result of the priced in ER. Many other algos do the same as well, and the stock price “tanks”, resulting in a gap down the following day, and many left holding the bag, even on a seemingly good ER. Welcome to “priced in”.

&nbsp;

**Scenario 2 : $AAPL is NOT priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and concludes that $AAPL was NOT priced properly. There was a huge upside beat. Instead of selling, the algo stays in the position because it knows that the underlying is undervalued based on the new news, and rides the wave up, exiting the position at a later date. $AAPL was not priced properly, and as a result, the news wasn’t priced in.

&nbsp;

In both cases, the algos win - they either escape with their profits, or ride the wave up for even more gains. **Us humans cannot act as quickly as an algo, and thus we’ll always be at a disadvantage when it comes to fundamental exits. We always have to exit our positions prior to news catalysts to avoid getting front run.** News events are almost ALWAYS priced in. We can’t sell the news AFTER the news drops because we cant digest and react to the news fast enough. We can’t front run the algorithms, so we need to sell BEFORE any fundamental news catalysts, otherwise we run the risk of holding the bag. If there’s one thing I want you all to take away from this article, it's that you should **always sell the news.**

&nbsp;

# Exiting Around Earnings

This is a very simple concept once we understand the mechanisms outlined above. If you’re in a trade, always look to close it out before earnings (unless you wanna get rug pulled, in which case go ahead, I'm not your daddy). If the news is priced in (which it probably is), you’ll get front run by algos and they’ll steal your profits. Do not gamble on the “priced-in“ news being wrong. You’ll lose that bet 9/10 times. Please note that even if earnings is a beat, that “beat” can still be priced in. Please, exit your trades before earnings, or you run the risk of getting blown out due to your own ignorance.

&nbsp;

# Exiting Around Product Launches

This is similar to the concept we outlined above. In this hypothetical example, let’s say $AAPL announces that they’re going to reveal a new line of products in August. If that’s the case, get ready to exit your position before the event. Every August $AAPL showcases their new iPhones for the year, therefore even though they haven’t explicitly said they’re going to reveal iPhones, the market is gonna price the event as if iPhones are going to be revealed. Once they reveal that their new products are in fact iPhones, the price will tank, because it was priced in, and algos followed the exact behavior outlined earlier. The only instance in which the price wouldn’t tank would be if they announced that they’re releasing a teleportation device or something. Believe it or not, the odds of that happening are astronomically low, so you’re better off just selling before the reveal instead. Unless $AAPL comes out with something totally unexpected, the price will drop.

&nbsp;

# Exiting Around Fundamental News Events

This pertains to market moving news as a whole, like an FOMC speech or some macroeconomic event. If you know that JPow is gonna speak on Wednesday, it’s probably best to exit your position before that since you’ve honestly got no idea what’s gonna happen as a byproduct of it. The entire market could take a shit or could fly green, nobody knows. Since we’re traders, not gamblers, it’s in our best interest to exit our positions or hedge in order to shield our gains. Fundamental news events are often crapshoots, and are the leading cause of solid gains getting unjustly erased in an instant.

&nbsp;

---

#Technical Exits

Technical exits pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. In order to have the ability to do a technical exit, you must have a basic understanding of technical charts, patterns, and indicators. The entire field of technical analysis is easy to understand, but hard to master, so even if you don’t have much experience in the area, I’ll do my best to explain it all in a way which is friendly towards newer traders.

&nbsp;

#Exiting Around Support and Resistance

This is often one of the easiest exits to perform, as it’s fairly straightforward to identify on a chart. **Whenever you start to approach an area which you’ve deemed as a key level of support or resistance, consider exiting your trade.** If the price has bounced off of that particular level five times in the past, it’ll likely hold true for the 6th time unless something has fundamentally changed about the company or the markets. As a result, you know that you should exit your trade as you approach the level, as it likely won’t keep going in the same direction once we get to that point. 

&nbsp;

An awesome example of this would be the [$CLF chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/9/9ymcqFZF.png) As we can tell, CLF trades in a nice ascending channel. In this case, we can use our trendlines to easily identify when to exit our trades in order to capture the maximum amount of our gains, saving us massive headaches. Once we get near any of the yellow trendlines, we should consider taking an exit since we’re likely going to bounce off of it. Another great example of similar price movement can be found in [$AMD’s chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/l/LzNxfKpr.png) It trades off of supports and resistances very consistently, allowing us to bag consistent gains. However, unlike CLF, AMD often has breakouts to the upside or downside, making it trickier to trade in the event of a breakout.

&nbsp;

You may be wondering if there’s any way you can capture the EXTRA gains in the event that the support or resistance levels don’t hold. Although I don’t recommend doing it too often, a well placed stop-loss can help protect your gains in the event that we reject off of a support or resistance, while simultaneously KEEPING you in the trade if we break through the support or resistance. Obviously, you’ll need some experience trading to know exactly where to place your stop, and it’s going to vary from ticker to ticker based on IV and the type of security or derivative you’re trading. A well placed stop-loss can help magnify your returns while also preventing you from giving up any gains you’ve already locked in. Be wary, too tight of a stop could take you out of a trade entirely before a run, but too loose of a stop could cause you to give up too much of your unrealized gains. It’s a fine line to play, and that only comes with experience.

&nbsp;

Another way you could play breakouts is by using a two stepped approach. First, you take your exit once you approach a given level of support or resistance to lock in your gains. You then set an alert within your broker slightly higher than that given level. If your alert gets tripped, you know that there’s been a breakout, and you’re clear to re-enter the trade to then capture any extra gains that may occur once it starts to run. If I run this strategy, I make sure to set my stop under the newly broken support or resistance in order to preserve my capital in the event of a false breakout. In the end, this method is much safer, but it requires you to sit at your computer twiddling your thumbs waiting for a breakout, so I personally don’t prefer it.

&nbsp;

# Exiting Around Gaps

Before we get into how to trade gaps, we need to understand what gaps are, and why they occur. [**Gaps are areas on a chart where the price of a stock moves sharply without any trades being placed.**](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/asVEHysx.png) Usually this happens as a result of a positive or negative catalyst affecting a stock outside of regular trading hours, resulting in a respective gap up or down the following day. A “gap” refers to a gap in the stock's price as a result of no trades being conducted within that range. Gaps are created because of low volume (technically no volume), and as a result, are prone to getting “filled” very quickly. Once we are within the price range of a gap, it’s very common that we will get sucked through the area with prices strongly trending towards the opposite side of the gap as a byproduct of the lack of volume.

&nbsp;

When trading gaps, we need to recognize two important levels, and understand how price will act around them. **The very last trade that took place before the gap was created will be a very heavy level of resistance, and the very first trade that takes place after a gap will also be a very heavy level of resistance.** As a result, we will be very prone to rejecting off of these levels, so we want to fully exit our trade around these levels, no exceptions. Once we’re past the initial resistance, we can look to re-enter the trade to capture the rest of our profits.

&nbsp;

Understanding all of that, gap trades are relatively simple. First, we ride our trade up to our first level of resistance (the beginning of the gap, aka the price that the first trade was conducted at), and then take our exit to lock in our profits. Afterwards, we set an alert slightly above the resistance, so we get notified once we’re past the resistance and are in the gap. Since we know there’s no trading volume within the gap, there’s a good chance we will get sucked through to the other side, meaning we should look to re-enter the trade as quickly as possible and then ride it to the opposite end of the gap (the end of the gap aka the price that the last trade was conducted at before the gap was created). Once we get to the opposite end of the gap, we fully exit the trade, because we know that 99% of the time we will reject off of this next heavy level of resistance. Gaps have a very rigid structure, and trade very similar to a breakout play. Enter a trade, exit at first resistance. Re-enter the trade after we break resistance, exit once we’re at the second resistance.

&nbsp;

#Clear Skies and Falling Knives

A clear skies situation refers to when a stock is on a tear and has recently carved out new all time highs - think [$AMZN’s recent run to $3750,](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/6/6E9FplY9.png) or [$CRSR’s initial run to $50.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/e/EHxx1rVZ.png) A falling knife is the flipside of that, and refers to when a stock is essentially in freefall - like $NKLA when people found out Trevor Milton is a rat, or $WKHS when they lost the government contracts. In both situations, it can be extremely difficult to know when you should exit your trade since we don’t have any technical levels to go off of, and as a result, we don’t know when to anticipate a bounce. Even if we did have a general idea of where it was going to bounce, the market often over reacts, resulting in us blowing past our initial mark before starting our initial recovery.

&nbsp;

**The simplest way to play these situations is with a trailing stop.** Trailing stops were invented for situations like these, and they’re honestly one of the most effective yet under-utilized tools. Set the stop, and it’ll trail the stock as it moves. When a stock is carving out new highs, or plunging to new lows, a properly set trailing stop will let you get as close to maximum profits as possible while still allowing you to stay in the trade if we experience some turbulence along the way. If your trailing stop is set properly, you shouldn’t get stopped out of the trade from natural market movements, and will only be forced out once we’ve found a new high or low. I’m not going to teach you how to properly set trailing stops as that’s beyond the scope of this article, but it’s something I may write about in the future given that enough people are interested.

&nbsp;

**Alternatively, if you want to abuse basic human psychology, you could also look to exit your position around whole numbers.** Humans are weird creatures, in the sense that we like “whole” things - stock prices are no exception. You better believe there’s going to be buyers or sellers setting up shop at nice, round numbers. Think $20, $50, $100, etc. If a stock is making a miracle run from $10, and is approaching $20, you better believe there’s going to be a large number of people looking to take profits at the $20 mark, and as a result, you should look to exit the position around there. Again, this isn’t a 100% concrete theory, and sometimes these levels won’t hold at all, but it’s still something to keep in mind. More on this later.

&nbsp;

#Technical Caveats

**Please note, that these technical exits won’t hold true given that a company's underlying fundamentals have changed. A stock's technical charts and indicators are only to be used as a summary of a company's fundamentals.** Technicals summarize the price action which is driven by the underlying fundamentals. If the fundamentals of a company change, the technical indicators and charts will also change, thereby making our old technical charts void. This is an extremely important concept that most traders and investors do not fully understand. Technicals summarize fundamentals.

&nbsp;

If $MSFT announces that they’re coming out with a time machine, don’t expect the stock's price to bounce off of the nearest overhead resistance, as that level is now void. $MSFT has fundamentally changed as a company, and as a result, the technicals will also need to change to reflect that. The same is true to the downside. If $MCD announces that they’ve been grinding up humans and putting them into their hamburgers, don’t expect the nearest level of support to hold - it’s void. The stock will plunge into free fall until $MCD is properly priced given it’s new fundamentals. Only then can we look to start re-establishing our technicals.

&nbsp;

**Technicals are only to be used as a summary of a company’s current fundamentals.**

&nbsp;

#Psychological Exits

Psychological exits consist of concepts and rules derived from how humans think and react to certain events. They are more conceptual in nature, and will vary from person to person. They aren’t necessarily as concrete as the other types of exits due to their ambiguous nature. Everyone will apply these exits differently, and as a result I can’t give you a consistent set of rules for each one. I can just explain the general concepts and provide different contexts regarding when to apply them. The rest is up to you!

&nbsp;

---

#Screenshot Theory

This is a very simple concept that I actually adopted from Wall Street Bets of all places - **If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell.** If you’re taking screenshots of your unrealized profits to flex on your friends, or random internet people, it’s probably time to sell out of that position. The only reason you feel the need to flex your gains is because it’s a life altering amount of money. I don’t care what the fundamentals, or technicals say at that point. Cash out of the casino, and realize those gains. If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell.

&nbsp;

# Individual Gain Theory

This concept refers to when you’re trading with money that you cannot afford to lose, and you come in on somewhat of a win. Profit or loss, this money is going to fundamentally alter your life (for better or worse) because you were put in a position where you had to “trade” money which you also needed elsewhere. If you’re ever in a situation where you’re forced to trade to make some extra dough, take those profits asap. A loss is often going to make your life a hell of a lot worse than a win will.

&nbsp;

# Exiting Around Whole Numbers

Humans are weird creatures - we like “whole” or “round” stuff, numbers being no exception. How often do you catch yourself submitting a buy order for 20$, or a sell order for $50. Unless you’re cognizant of it, you’re not going to think to yourself “imma buy $CLF at 21.83”. There’s a good chance you’re gonna round it up to $22, or down to $20, etc. The same goes for literally EVERYONE else. Just keep in mind that depending on the direction you’re trading, there’s often going to be buyers / sellers at whole numbers. $10, $20, $25, $30, etc. No number is safe. Look to time your exits before or after these numbers, as they may prove to be mini points of resistance. You’ll often see sellers step in at whole numbers on the way up, and buyers step in at whole numbers on the way down. Use this to your advantage.

&nbsp;

---

# Emotional Exits

This concept applies to two key emotions - Euphoria and Hope. **The instant you start feeling euphoric about a trade and it’s potential gains, step away from the trade.** You’re not going to be thinking clearly enough to make an optimal trade or exit. There’s a very high chance you’re going to continue to chase the victory. If the victory starts slipping away from you, you're likely going to stay in the trade hoping that it goes back up to the previous high that you didn’t sell at. In situations like this, by staying in the trade, you’ll almost always hold your position well past the top, and will be prone to “diamond hands-ing” your profits into the ground, ultimately coming up with a loss on a fundamentally sound trade. 

&nbsp;

You need to be conscious of the fact that you’re euphoric, and that this trade went awesome, and exit the position intelligently. Once you start feeling euphoria, and consequently hope, there’s no going back. You’re not trading on fundamentals, and you’re not trading on technicals either. You’re simply not trading rationally. In situations like this, it’s best to take a step back and exit the trade before you make a boneheaded move and end up giving your gains away. Emotions cloud judgement, and as traders, that’s the last thing we want. Sell out of a position once you start feeling intense emotion.

&nbsp;

#Conclusion

All in all, options trading is a difficult game with many moving parts - If you're caught skimping on your exits, you’re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. This aspect of trading is less glamorous and often overlooked, but is absolutely vital to your success as a trader. I hope this writeup was informative and useful to you all! **If you want some more in depth explanations of each concept, alongside some detailed examples, refer to my Options Trading Exit Strategies video, which you can find [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDKNRF_BZqQ)** If you have any questions, feel free to drop em below and I'll do my best to help you out!

(People being too afraid to post loss),35,24,2021-08-04 08:38:13,"Hey everyone so I’ve seen some systematic discrepancies between the loss and the gain flair. 

In a single given day you could have almost 30 times more gain post than loss post. This obviously doesn’t make much sense because I would almost guarantee that there are more people losing than gaining this sub alone. I don’t usually post gains or losses in the sub Reddit because usually they don’t really matter. You can make 100% gain or lose 90% but if it’s just simple trade it it’s not really interesting to post. Right like if you gain with Apple options than well yeah it’s a gain but it’s not interesting to post really. 

But the reason why I think this is a problem is because people especially new traders have this false sense of always making money. And I don’t know why the The lost porn became so dried because throughout the history of the sub posting your loss was basically an assured popularity and respect because not only did you make a bad trade but you were willing to share that with everybody else. Imagine if  analfarmer2 only ever posted when his spy plays made money. Or how deepfuckingvalues was posting his position a year ago when it was down 50%. 

To me it kind of feels like a lie and also kind of pussy behavior. If you are an investor and you will post literally any single gain you have ever made in your entire life conveniently scrub away all the losses—kind of makes it seem like you just want people to think you are good at reading right and you being good at trade. 

I don’t wanna call out the mods or or even demand a change and I don’t even know how popular the sentiment is in the sub right now because I know there are about 2 million people That actually remembered What does sub was like before gamestop. 

#My simple solution is to have a requirement that every gain post, or even every loss post, must include a second picture at least that shows the entire account to date chart. So if you post a gain from a trade, at least a second picture of your main chart with “all” showing how much you started with and how much you have now. 

I think it’ll show a better picture of how these traders are actually doing rather than simple gain trades overwhelming every single day. 

Again I don’t know how popular the sentiment is in the sub and I am certainly not demanding any change because I am but one person out of million here so I don’t know what every one of you want or even think about the loss and gain discrepancy a problem."

In full disclosure I lost over 300k on Chinese stocks in a combination of shares, warrants, and options. Yes, I am glad I sold because my losses would be even greater. 

1. Chinese entrepreneurs like to IPO in America because the entrepreneurs and VCs are given US dollars for their shares. For those that didn’t know it is almost impossible to move money out of China. This is true for American companies such as Apple and Starbucks, the money stays there. It is a closed capital account. IPOs in American markets means foreign investors (American investors) can get liquidity when investing in a Chinese company. 

2. The CCP was more than happy to allow American IPOs because they need US dollars. The world does not trust the Renminbi and it is only used in 1 percent of transactions compared to 60 percent for the US dollar. China must use US dollars to trade with the world. (If anyone is familiar with the Belt and Road you will know China uses dollars to fund such project). When Chinese investors and entrepreneurs are allowed to sell their shares in American markets they bring in US dollars. 

3. China has global ambitions of being a super power. After watching a certain guy (not trying to get political) get banned from social media and made irrelevant, Xi and the CCP woke up to the reality it could be next. The party then decided to crack down even further on its entrepreneurs, who the CCP believes may one day oppose it. The crack down on the Ant IPO was just the start. (For those who don’t know, China does not take criticism well. If Apple/Tesla was to criticize the CCP both businesses would fail to operate in China (this happened to Hilton for naming Taiwan as a country, but only for a week).This is why you see NO American CEOs or entrepreneurs criticize China. 

4. The SEC is finally acting. News has broke the SEC will not allow anymore Chinese IPOs without disclosure of the CCP’s control. Every company in China is subject to control by the CCP. You either comply or you are sent to a camp. You also have the threat of delisting because of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. 

At this point China has pissed off pretty much the entire US. From crashing internet money, to stocks, and don’t forget about their lies about COVID. I can’t imagine investors will bid up the price of these stocks again. Cut your loses and consider this market dead. Xi is a 1940s German leader reincarnated."

Regional lockdowns are happening. Florida just had over 20K cases in a day, the worst day since the pandemic started. 

Covid is far from over and we probably will go through another circle of rotating into tech and then rotating into “recovery” plays. 

As long as the covid is not over, JPOW is unlikely to taper. And the longer this pandemic stretches, the more the world will adopt technologies. And more will move from offline to online. Calls on AAPL for all kinds of electrical devices. 

After more people adopt technologies, more companies will upgrade their tech stacks to meet the new service traffic and reliability demand. Calls on tech cloud and infrastructure companies like AMZN. 

And once the world adopts technologies, it won’t be able to leave and tech just have that sticky magic. 

TLDR: Tech gonna moon and it just started. Covid is terrible for public health but it accelerated tech adoption by at least 10 years."

This Ape got you, I will try to make this DD a longer version of a TLDR! I'll try to make it concise and to the point as much as possible.(5 hours later, I failed at this objective lol)

**1- Ford's secret weapon unleashed:**

For the last **44 consecutive years**, the F-150 has been Americas **best selling Truck**. In 2019, the Ford F-Series was **second only to the Apple iPhone**, which  raked in **$55 billion**, in terms of **total revenue** generated. The F-Series **generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined**, Just something to think about.

On May 19, Ford has unveiled its EV F-150 after Biden had driven it a week prior. The EV's features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations (Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min ad video). It has all the features crucial for it's **target buyers** (Construction workers, Farmers, Free-lance delivery drivers, Basically hardworking Blue-collar Americans...) and it's **a Truck which actually looks like a Truck.** “Ford knows what pickup owners want,” IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. More importantly, it's an F-150 first, an EV second, Ford didn't abandon the F-150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years.

The reservation now have exceeded 120,000 since it's debut. An important point the CEO mentioned on the call was that **about 75%, or 90,000, are new to Ford, according to the company!** If anything, this indicates that Ford is the runner up for Tesla in the EV competition. almost every car manufacturer can make an EV, but only a few (I can count on one hand) can supply enough cars to keep up with demand with superb price and quality.

Now Ford's EVs are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla for the past 4 months with sales, more on this on #5). The F-150 starts at  $32,500 after Federal tax credit!! Cheaper than any of **""Potential(because they don't exist yet)""** competitors with superior car features. 

It's relevant to mention that Ford's EV sales (counting electric vehicles and hybrids) increased 177% during June, capping off 56,570 units sold so far in 2021.

**As Ford promised, F-150 Lightning will deliver more features, and cost less...**

^(Don't forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs, and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year.)

**2- Ford Rivian Partnership:**

Ford-Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September. It's looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now 😂(Ford is 55.64B at 14.18$). Ford has initially invested 500$ million in Rivian, but it added much more of an undisclosed amount with **the most recent news being 902$million in Q1 of 2021.**

**On Jul 23, it was announced that Rivian closed a $2.5 billion funding round,** led by existing investors **Ford**, Amazon and T. Prior to it, they announced plans to open a second manufacturing plant and U.S States started submitting bids on it.

Farley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market. **As more companies continue to invest in Rivian, Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares,** ""but that's not why we invested,"" Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend.

Farley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV-SUV market too **with a Lincoln or Explorer-Rivian car**. He understands that **the first move is the most important one in the EV Game,** and with the Mach-E and F-150, Ford executed it's moves perfectly! Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices, high quality, while maintaining the demand(something which Tesla still isn't able to). Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1.3

&#x200B;

**3- Bronco capturing Buyers of other brands:**

 Prior to the release of the Bronco, it had 190,000 reservations. **66% of the reservations were converted to sales!** Additionally, Farley mentioned in the earnings call that 70% of the 125,000 orders it has are customers of other brands. 

According to Ford, dealers are keeping Broncos on the lot for an average of **15 days!,** with a big chunk of of the buyers coming from jeep. People are killing to get their hands on one. just go on Ebay and see for yourself. Bronco first Edition is going for 6 figures with the buy now being approx 150K$. 

I would understand PS5 scalpers, but that happening with Cars, I never would've imagined. This shows how the demand of this car is insane and why Ford raised it's 2021 Revenue expectation from $3.5 billion, to between $9-$10 billion and they'll probably raise it again in the next quarter. 

&#x200B;

**4- Ford's Governmental Fleet 3D chess Strategy:**

“Ford clearly has business and government fleets in mind,” Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said.

Ford revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F-150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday. Called the Lightning Pro, it’s equipped with a standard battery that’s good for an estimated 230 miles and costs $39,974, which is the base price for retail F-150 Lightnings.

Ford's vision to lead the EV market has a “no-brainer” component Elon Musk lacks: Targeting business and government fleet customers with new battery-powered trucks and vans. Ford’s focus on converting Gas fleet buyers to electric models builds on the company’s existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts. They know that they are already the best with no competitors when it comes to the quality or price of the F-150. They will literally destroy their competitors with this approach.

# 5- Valuation and Price target

Yes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.

$Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple

(Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- outdated)

TSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X

NIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)

GM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X

F - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X

**(Important part starts here)**

As you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.

If you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.

 At that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **🇺🇸 🦅**.

**Ford is ready to dominate the EV market and it's just starting!**

We are now living a new tech boom in multiple sectors of the market, with TSLA and AMD being the favorites of everyone, and even AMZN being in the middle of everyone hearts, and what they all have in common? They manufacture tech products.

Ok, you already know all that, but what is the deal? The main thing with tech products are they all need metal to work, and while they all use different quantities and types of metals in their production, them being mainly cooper and zinc.

Electric cars in general use 4 times more cooper than a normal car and every tech product in the world use a combination of copper and zinc for heat dissipation, you guys know that because of PCs and stuff. The thing is everyone is looking at the final product going up that no one is noticing that the provider is getting even bigger with even less possibility to fail or go down because they aren't industries that are affected by how the public views them.

The general price of minerals in the last year to now is up 50% for almost every mineral.

I research mining companies and none of their shares went down, they went up at LEAST 45% in the last year, for comparison, AMD went up 31% with a lot of fluctuations and AMZN 18% with the same fluctuations, mining companies just don't go down, they just go up.

VALE3: 88,62% up in the last year, BHP: 45,01%, RIO: 45,27% in the last year as well. 

If we are going for the year overalls, TSLA went down 7,18% while RIO ended up being the worst performing mining one with a 14,58% UP just this year. 

I made my research and I ask everyone to do the same, but I really feel like mining companies shares are the future, they are safe, most of the time have no real competition at all and their products are necessary by pretty much every company, if AAPL makes a new product, they need stuff to manufacture them, the advance of electric cars will only makes their prices go up.

I don't know how to end this and I hope I wrote enough for not get caught in the auto-moderator."

I’m sure that most of you are familiar with Coupang, the “Amazon of South Korea,” and the most valuable foreign-based company to be listed on the NYSE since BABA in 2014. At the time of writing this, it has a current market cap of \~65B USD. When it DPO’d  on March 11th, the SoftBank backed company saw its share price jump from $35 to $63.5, an 80% single day increase. Since that time it has traded down, and stayed range-bound within a fairly narrow band. It currently trades for \~$38. Many analysts expect it to continue to perform at this level, with some opportunity to receive a valuation catalyst when they report earnings on August 11th. While this is certainly within the range of possible outcomes, there is also a convergence of factors that create a bullish thesis for the coming quarter and years to come. Some of these factors are outside of the sort of financials and fundamentals that drive a great deal of analysis for individual securities, providing some opportunity to establish strong positions before a change in analysts’ ratings and further institutional investment. Most of my analysis is based on global macroeconomic trends, with an emphasis on externalities, and “stock stories,” and I believe there is an opportunity to get ahead of the curve, an opportunity that I will endeavor to make the case for here through a somewhat traditional SWOT analysis focusing on the company, the economic climate of Southeast Asia, and greater market trends that make it a potentially excellent value

A summary of CPNG itself:

Coupang is based in Seoul, SK, and is incorporated in Delaware. It was founded in 2010 by Bom Kim, a Harvard Business School drop-out. While Coupang in its current iteration looks nothing like the company he first founded, this isn’t that uncommon for tech companies, and in this respect, it bears some resemblance to the company it draws frequent comparison to, Amazon. While this is the tech giant with which Coupang is most frequently associated and the one that it emulates in many respects, I think that there are arguments to be made that its future success is tied much more closely to Alibaba, AMD, Samsung, and Sea.

Like Amazon, Coupang has several different sectors. This includes their core business of e-commerce, where they are clearly taking some of the lessons of Amazon and applying them, offering their own brands of “essentials” on their platform, food delivery both in the form of groceries, where they once again have their own brands available for sale, and also from restaurants, small business solutions, payment processing, digital advertising, and through their recent acquisition of Singapore-based Hooq, subscription video-streaming services.

Strengths:

Coupang is already the largest online marketplace in South Korea. Their active customer base added 21% this last year, climbing above 16 million users in South Korea. These customers also spent more with Coupang than they did the year before, +44% Y/Y. There are 52 million people in South Korea, so there is still a large portion of the market for them to tap into. Furthermore, they actually have a higher dollar retention rate than Amazon of 346% to 278%. This means that after somebody first uses the platform, they come back and spend more money in subsequent years. In the case of Coupang and Amazon, considerably more. While we don’t have information about the dollar retention rate of Chinese customers with Alibaba, it is quite possible that these are the most valuable customers in the world. You want to talk about a moat? This is a moat.

Their goal is to make their customers unable to “imagine life before Coupang,” and they have built a very successful brand based on the rapidity of their delivery. 99.3% of their orders are fulfilled within 24 hours of the purchase. Even foreign goods are delivered within just 3 days. This is facilitated by their logistics network, which emulates the Amazon warehouse model, and the concentrated population density of the areas in which they operate. 70% percent of the South Korean population lives within just 7 miles of a Coupang fulfillment center. Returns are as simple as using their app to notify Coupang that you would like to return an item, setting it outside your door, and then within minutes, one of their 15,000 full-time drivers will have picked it up. It really is an incredible business model.

They already have created their own end-to-end logistics network of manufacturing, delivery, warehouses, and tech. What they haven’t built, they have acquired. They currently have over 100 fulfillment centers in 30 cities in South Korea.

Furthermore, in 2020, Coupang is still operating cash-flow positive with $302M, despite their position as a rapidly growing company. Analysts are expecting revenue to rise another +61% this year to $19.4B. This correlates to +26.3% EPS this year.

Weaknesses:

The majority of Coupang’s weaknesses can be described as traditional financials and the way in which they influence share price. Quite simply put, they won’t be profitable especially soon, particularly as they continue to expand into new markets. There are lots of bullish indicators, even here. While net loss increased 180%, operating loss declined 36% on a revenue increase of 74%, $4.2B. It should also be noted that their 2020 gross income was also +92% of what they did in 2019. They are growing quickly, but they are paying for it, especially as their labor force jumped to 50,000 employees. The company plans to double this workforce over the next few years as they continue to grow. They aren’t short on cash to fund this sort of expansionary effort however, as Coupang previously received $3B from SoftBank, and they certainly put it to work for them, yielding a $33B profit for their investor. They will be able to get infusions of cash just about any time they want.

EBITDA from 2020 provides the greatest reason for concern, as their operating, administrative, and general costs rose with the completion of their network, especially their fulfillment center capacity, moving from ($42M) to ($133M). This is fairly typical of a growth company, and I’m really curious to see what their EBITDA looks like on August 11th.

There are also, in fairness, some issues with these employees, and Coupang has been criticized for some of their labor practices. They also recently had a fire in their logistics warehouse.

Lastly, while I am unconcerned about competition in Korea, I would be remiss to fail to mention that they do not benefit from protectionist policies, and Amazon has recently tried to gain some market share in the country by taking a stake in 11Street. This is a non-issue for me, because they can’t provide comparable services to those provided by Coupang unless they are willing to make a considerably larger investment and dedicate a decade to creating a similarly structured logistics system.

Opportunities:

My enthusiasm for Coupang is based on the myriad diverse paths for future success, including possibly explosive growth over the next couple years. If you skipped the rest of the DD to get to this point, I wouldn’t blame you.

One of the chief knocks against Coupang has been the size of the market in South Korea. There are two reasons why this is no longer the factor that it once was. 

First, I am extremely bullish on the South Korean economy in general. Even if a market is small, as long as it has more assets in it, growth can be expected. A quick look at my post history will reveal that I am also bullish long on AMD, and I should probably be taking a good hard look at Samsung. This has a lot to do with the South Korean government’s plan to invest $450B into becoming a global chip-manufacturing powerhouse. For a sense of scale, this is 9x the investment that the US recently pledged to manufacture this increasingly valuable commodity. While their GDP growth rate is already nearly 3x that of Japan, this savvy national strategy is only going to bring additional discretionary income to many Koreans, among whom consumer spending has not been a historical strength, in part due to the historical division of wealth inequality among South Koreans. This is no longer the case, and the South Korean middle class now comprises 53% of their population. Over the last year personal disposable income grew at an average rate of 3.55% and private consumption jumped 2.4% from Q1 to Q2. 

Indeed, Korea’s strong COVID-19 response helped their GDP contraction rank among the lowest in OECD countries. South Korean exports increased as a percentage of the global market share, primarily driven by about a 4% growth in semiconductors. They are already Asia’s 4th largest economy, and while I don’t see an imminent reshuffling of this order, having already moved to the 10th largest economy in the world, passing Russia and Brazil in the past year, they should pass Canada and Italy in the next two to three years.

In short, even if Coupang stayed concentrated in South Korea, strong economic policy has them well-positioned to be the beneficiaries of a growing economy, with steadily increasing discretionary income for a (busy) Korean middle class.

This leads me to my second point: they aren’t staying in South Korea. They notably expanded their services to Japan and Taiwan this quarter, and just announced that they were about to begin their operations in Singapore, using this last expansion as a test platform to refine their broader expansion into the Southeast Asian market, with its population of 650 million. Coupang’s next target for expansion appears to be Malaysia. 

E-commerce is thriving in Southeast Asia, reaching a volume of $62B in 2020, up 63% from 2019. The expectation is that this market will be $172B by 2025. South Korea is already this region’s third largest e-commerce market.

While some would see this aggressive expansion as a logical next step, there are two considerations that make it particularly valuable at this moment in time for Coupang: the first is that they are already past the period of significant investment in their own infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities, as exhibited by their financials. Secondly, Alibaba, the region’s largest online marketplace is facing an existential crisis, which corresponds with market growth that fails to match e-commerce growth in the region. I won’t go into that here. What I will say is that while I do not expect Coupang to ever operate in China, the world’s second largest economy, the rest of Southeast Asia suddenly has a much larger contested market share.

Threats:

There are two threats for us to consider when assessing CPNG as a growth stock. The first pertains to its business: there is a lot of competition in Southeast Asian e-commerce, with a range of players, but particularly the well-funded Shopee and Lazada. Lazada is a subsidiary of Alibaba, and there is way too much here for me to provide any sort of concrete analysis, so instead I’ll focus on Shopee. There was a recent analysis on The Motley Fool, comparing Shopee’s parent company Sea Ltd. (SE) to Coupang, in which the analyst suggested that SE was the better buy based on their gaming business. I reached the opposite conclusion (shocker) of the analyst at The Fool, in no small part because of Sea’s connection to Tencent, particularly in regard to their gaming sector. Yes, Tencent holds 23% of SE’s shares outstanding, but it is more the potential issue with the licenses of *LoL* and *Arena of Valor*, both developed by Tencent, and which Sea publishes in Asia, that has me slightly concerned. I’m not the only one either, as SE has seen a share price drop of about -3.49% over the course of this week. Mitigating this concern to some extent is that Sea’s most important gaming title, *Free Fire*, the world’s most downloaded game in 2020, is self-published.

It should be noted that given the growth of e-commerce in Southeast Asia that I am also very bullish long on SE, but the value differential of EPS (TTM) for Sea -3.59 and CPNG -3.99 does not justify the market’s current concern regarding potential over valuation of CPNG as opposed to SE. SE currently trades at 18x this year’s sales, compared to Coupang’s 3x. SE currently has a market cap of 149.668B compared to Coupangs 65.092B. While I do expect Sea and Lazada to grow over the next several years, there is still a sizeable market for all three of these major players in the region.

This relates to the second threat: general market perception of CPNG. There are two stories being told here. One is the apparent share price, which again has failed to impress since it listed on the NYSE and the fairly widespread FUD coming through all the typical industry mouthpieces, and the other story is the massive institutional/ insider investment over the last 6 months, as well as some extremely curious options activity. Leaving the options out of it, because that is not how I am recommending playing this position, the reality of the 147,251,715 insider shares purchased over the last 6 months tells a different story than the one currently circulating among retail investors. 86.3% of the float is held by institutions. This isn’t a retail darling, and the low volume corroborates this. This is a company slowly being acquired into consolidated positions by the likes of Greenoaks and Blackrock, while the business makes significant moves not reflected in the share price. The 1.34B shares float are going to make this a very difficult stock to move quickly, so one should temper expectations accordingly, and also avoid anything but the most conservative options plays in the short-term as a result.

Why enter now?

I’m expecting a beat on August 11th, but that isn’t driving my urgency. What makes me want to expand my position in this company sooner rather than later is the revised thesis on Asian e-commerce due to Alibaba’s profound issues, the ongoing COVID crisis, and the trends in NYSE investment. Retail investors have to conduct their own research and make their own decisions, algorithms on the other hand can make massive acquisitions as soon as they are given a ‘buy’ signal, which in the case of CPNG could come sooner rather than later.

This is because of the anticipated shift over the next 10-18 months from ‘stable’ large cap to ‘speculative’ small/mid cap growth. We’ve been hearing a mixed story about the “rotation from growth to value” for a while now, and a cross section of ETFs can be used to make this case, that even with AAPL adding .5 T like it was nothing, value is up 16% YTD compared to growth, up 10% YTD, however, the “reopening” narrative seems to have shifted since mid-May, with speculative growth such as ROKU gaining 11% compared with cyclicals and banks, any of which provide ample evidence contrary to the popular rotational narrative. Alphabet notwithstanding, even with amazing ER beats, large cap tech is selling off their ATHs. While it is clear in recent days that some of these profits are flowing into fake internet money, I’m not here to tell you about that, instead to bring your attention to an opportunity in a company that actually makes things and provides services.

How to play it? LEAPS or shares only, both of which are extraordinarily cheap right now, and which probably won’t be quite as inexpensive in the near future as Coupang’s footprint in Asian e-commerce continues to expand, and investment in Asia further consolidates outside of China. I think you have about a quarter to establish a strong position before it becomes about 50% more costly to do so. This gives you some time to be patient with its growth, but not so long that I would hesitate to make the move. The real profits are made on surprise stories.

Disclosure: This is not financial advice. I have a small position in CPNG that I am looking to add significantly to. I am a degenerate and a moron. Do your own DD."

Bulls / Bears are welcome to respond.

Fundamentals:

Dec 2019 -> Dec 2020  (The year of the bulls, spax, tsla moon, nkla moon)

Net income - $7m

UserBase - 17m

Based on 2020 valuations 1571 P/E

Based on $38 IPO Price- 4571 P/E

(If we assume their income has tripled since Dec 2020, after taking on another $3bil of bailout debt with a 6% convertible bonds and assume that the user growth has grown despite Fidelity / Schwab  posting record amounts)

SPY P/E - 31

PLTR P/E - 118

TSLA P/E - 355

Bull Case:

1. Robinhood will innovate drastically and develop ways to make money that is not payment for order flow in the future thus increasing the profit margins and net income.
2. Robinhood will increase their userbase by 150x equating to 2.54billion people, all of which have an average balance of the current user base in USA where stimulus checks , money printers, and high disposable income go brrrr.
3. Robinhood increases the net revenue generated by each user by around 150x. Either 150x more volume is traded per user, or the bid/ask spreads from payment for routing exceeds 150x current.
4. A combination of the above. 50x user growth and 3x profit margin growth.
5. Assume that operating costs are fairly negligible and linear due to SaaS being economies of scale based.

Bear Case:

1. Robinhood is a ""Trading software that's thinly veiled as a technology company"" and should be given the P/E of a tech company that can scale exponentially.
2. Robinhood faces regulatory risk expanding outside of USA and even if every man woman and child deposits what the average APE has on the platform right now and trades at the frequency of an average RH APE- We would reach a P/E of 217.
3. If Robin hood abolishes the methods of: ""Payment for order flow and uses monthly fees/data charges"" it will lose a large part of the entirety of its' branding. It would be like if Apple abolished the iPhone. Free Trading is their Model.
4. As Order Flow is a linear business, 1 unit of order flow results in $1 extra. In order to reach 150x multiplier to reduce PE to 'reasonable tech company levels' we would be looking at 150x the net volume being transacted on Robinhood.
5. Robinhood

Excerpts from S-1 Filing:

We incurred operating losses each year since our inception in 2013 through 2019, including net losses of $6.1 million, $57.5 million, and $106.6 million for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. We expect our operating expenses to continue to increase in the future as we increase our sales and marketing efforts, continue to invest in research and development, further develop our products and services, improve and expand our customer support functions and expand into new geographies.

Moreover, as of March 31, 2021, options to purchase 18,096,127 shares of our Class A common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of approximately $2.23 per share were outstanding and 81,820,160 shares of our Class A common stock were subject to outstanding RSUs (including 27,663,658 shares subject to 2019 Market-Based RSUs).

There are currently > 96 million shares held by employees.

Bull Case 1:

Robin Hood has been growing at a very fast rate therefore its' valuations validate this. The insider investors are incentivized to hold.

Bear Case 1:

The insiders made anywhere between a minimum of 2.7 --> 24x already within the last few years, private firms typically take profits and reinvest in other startups. (Unless Robinhood grows at exponential rates going forwards)

&#x200B;

Selling Pressures:

Imagine if you're an Ape working at RH and you can cash in on a 10-20 bagger immediately in 30-days, would you sell?

An average engineer who worked at Robinhood for 4 - years on average holds \~ $400k-800k in RSUs (at a price of $2 per share). At the time of IPO we're looking at $4-8m if you sell. Maybe you hold, maybe not in.

If you're an investor who invested in Series G-1 , G-2 (the lastest bagholders). You've got yourself a 1-2 bagger already in 1 year.

&#x200B;

Personal Opinion:

Robin hood is being evaluated as a ""Growing Tech company"" at multipliers that seem unreasonable.

Robinhood does not have a roadmap that provides a way to reach earnings through their current model which is Payment for Orderflow.

Even with the introduction of their \[censored\]currency, Coinbase ambitiously is boasting a forward P/E of 30x.

Even as a growing Fintech like Square is at a P/E at 201x, and mature Fintech such as Paypal is at 30x.

&#x200B;

Positions: Short 500 shares of RH

This is not financial advice, tons of companies fuck over their customers at some point. GME/AMC - JAN madness aside, I'm short this on a pure autist basis. 🐻

For too long there’s been a load of DD about $CRSR on here, a lot of it is just parroting the same old points over and over again, giving only bullish sentiment and rocket emojis without any insight into the actual gaming industry.

Hopefully my DD will give you a better understanding of where $CRSR fits into the gaming market. This DD is meant to be balanced, all DD should have bearish points and bullish points imo, so this is not the DD to fuel your conformation bias, sorry, but maybe you'll get slightly aroused at certain points 🚀🚀

As for my experience - I’ve been gaming for the last 20+ years playing many different types of games. I actually have a degree in Computer & Video Games but don’t work in the sector these days. But I’m still a keen gamer and build gaming rigs, and game on PS5 as well.

I’d also like to point out from the start that I really like Corsair. I own shares and do build PCs using their components. They are not my go-to choice for every component, and i'll explain why later in this DD.

As always, this isn’t financial advice, it’s the ramblings of someone who’s spent too long scouring the internet for a 3200mhz stick of memory. I’ve also done a TL;DR at the end with nice bullet points for those knuckle-dragging retards who can’t read more than a few paragraphs at a time.

&#x200B;

# Corsair has been smashing earnings

We’ve seen this so many times before in other DDs so I won’t focus on it too much but it’s good for perspective. The rate at which Corsair has been increasing its revenue is pretty impressive.

In their Q1 2021 earnings, they reported **net revenue of $529.4 million**, which is a year-over-year **increase of 71.6%**

Their gamer and creator peripherals segment **net revenue was $175.9 million**. A huge **increase here of 131.9%**

Corsair’s gaming and components segment also grew, with a **51.9% increase to $353.5 million**.

Clearly the demand for Corsair products is there, with increasing demand, increasing revenues and profit. Most expect Corsair to beat earnings again in their Q2 report next week.

Their market share is also impressive, with (by Corsair's own claims and from research from NPD Group) a total component market share of 41.9% and about 20% for peripherals. I can’t seem to find very recent market share figures since IPO, since you need to pay for market analysis and I’m a peasant who can’t afford it, but from what I can find Corsair is:

**1st** in Keyboards

**3rd** in Mice

**4th** in Gaming headsets

**2nd** in Streaming gear

**1st** in High performance memory

**1st** in Cases

**1st** in PSUs (power supplies)

**1st** in Cooling solutions

&#x200B;

# How does Corsair fit into the gaming market?

As you probably know, the gaming market is a fucking behemoth. It’s bigger than the music and movie markets combined, and is only getting bigger.

The pandemic has further fuelled this market, with new gamers joining as they were sat around at home and needed something to do that wasn’t jacking off. So they built epic RGB gaming rigs. I think these new customers will stick around in the industry for years to come. Building a PC is a bit like smoking crack, your current rig doesn’t quite achieve the maximum FPS possible, so you’re always on the look out for the next component that will give you a slight boost, you’re always chasing that high.

The PC building market and console market vary widely in terms of generational changes. With consoles, you get a change of console generation, most people buy the new one all at the same time or within the same year or two. With PC building, gamers will be constantly upgrading bits and pieces of their rig to keep it up to date, there's no seismic generational shift like there is with consoles. It’s rare for gamers to throw an entire gaming rig away and build from fresh.

Corsair is a mid-tier component maker. Their products fit into the ‘not the cheapest, but not the most expensive’ category. This is the same in terms of quality, performance and reliability - they offer good quality products that have decent reliability and the performance is usually pretty good. In some cases, as I’ll mention later, their products are basically identical to other manufacturers. This mid-level position in the market is probably one of the reasons they make it to the number 1 spot in terms of sales for several component categories. Gamers want good bang-for-buck and decent reliability when it comes to components. They spend hours and hours researching this, and usually know exactly what they are buying, if it's a good deal, and if it's going to perform the way they want it to.

Also it's important to point out that the term *best components* is a relative and sometime subjective term. Taking price out of the equasion, the *best* component is the one that works in your rig to deliver maximum performance and not cause a bottleneck. Sometimes it's a cheaper one, sometimes it's a more expensive one.

&#x200B;

# Who is the Corsair customer?

The Corsair customer is a mid-tier (and sometimes high-tier) PC rig builder. Younger teenagers/kids often use Corsair as their marketing and branding appeals to them. They love RGB fans, and Corsair basically puts RGB in absolutely everything, these days even on RAM sticks and built into the GPU cables. Console gamers are also included in this customer base, mostly for headsets and streaming gear.

The extreme ultra-nerd PC builder who spends hours and hours pouring over spec sheets and benchmarks might not use Corsair unless there was a reason related specifically to their build like compatibility with other components, or perhaps a part was on offer at their chosen retailer. Have a look at some build guides online and a lot of the time their no-holds-barred builds often won’t include Corsair components, or only one or two. There are so many variables that go into building a PC, it’s not just a case of buy whatever components you like the look of. It all has to work together.

&#x200B;

# The misconceptions of Corsair

**The first misconception of Corsair is that their components and products are the absolute best in the industry** \- the ultimate in luxury component, the ‘Apple’ of gaming if you will.

Corsair is mostly a mid-tier component maker. Their components are good value for money, work well and are reliable but there are companies out there that make higher quality components, some that make lower quality ones and some that make pretty much identical ones.

The components market is extremely crowded, there are a lot of companies competing for the same margins on the same products: NZXT, CoolerMaster, Noctua, G.Skill, Fractal are just a few of the dozens of companies in this space. I'll go over the competitors later in this DD.

Once you start to peel back the surface of the gaming market, you’ll realise that actually a lot of these companies are pretty much the same in terms of the products they sell. In some cases the spec is almost identical and in reality some of the time it doesn’t really matter what brand of component you put in your rig (as long as its not a cheap knock-off), the performance will be roughly the same, or in many cases identical. For example, the Corsair Hydro Hxxxi series are basically the exact same products as the NZXT Kraken X series, just with a different fan arrangement, branding, exterior LED arrangement and exterior shroud.

**This leads me neatly onto my second misconception that Corsair has a massive moat.** Unfortunately it doesn’t have a huge moat against the other companies in the component space in terms of actual products that compete or compare with each other. The acquisition of Elgato was a nice move, though, and in the streaming market does give them an edge over some other competitors with an expanded product lineup. But in terms of their moat over other component manufacturers, in some cases, they don't have one at all.

**The third misconception of Corsair is that gamers have extreme brand loyalty towards specific component manufacturers.** Gamers usually want one thing when building a rig: the absolute maximum performance for their budget. Looks and RGB often come secondary to this.

While some gamers do have some brand loyalty (particularly some of the younger kids who are less experienced at building rigs) and Corsair strengths in branding and advertising help this, I don’t think there’s *extreme* brand loyalty amongst gamers who build their own rigs and have spent years doing so. I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone who exclusively built their rig with Corsair components because they specifically wanted to out of brand loyalty, except [Linus from Linus Tech Tips on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEIKFxHzzac&t=194s), which was a paid-for sponsor by Corsair.

The price is an important factor here, and in many cases gamers will just buy a stick of RAM, for example, from one manufacturer over another simply because the price is different, or the specific stick is on offer at the time they build their rig. They also might be limited to what kind of AIO cooler they can get due to the other components they are using such as the size restrictions in their case. There's a lot of variables that go into making a sale right then and there, and a lot of the time Corsair doesn't stand-out as the absolute leader in some components that warrant gamers spending the extra money if their parts are more expensive at that given moment in time.

I would say there is more brand loyalty around core components of a rig - like CPU or GPU.

&#x200B;

# Some Corsair components aren’t actually made by Corsair

Corsair doesn’t actually manufacturer all its components. Many of their products are actually OEM products, rebranded and built by another manufacturer.

Corsair AIO CPU coolers are all made by either Asetek or CoolIT.

Corsair PSUs are made by Seasonic, GreatWall, Flextronics, CWT or Chicony.

Corsair RAM have chips made by Samsung, Micron or SK Hynix.

So what does this mean? Generally it means that there is often minimal or no difference between some products that are sold under many brands within the PC component market. Gamers will often say “Look at the underlying product, rather than the brand” when comparing two almost identical products. You could compare a Seasonic PSU to a Corsair PSU, and end up finding that they are actually almost identical, and underneath it’s actually just a Seasonic PSU with a Corsair logo slapped on it.

Now this isn’t always the case, OEM rebrands are not always an identical item, the end brand may  modify the products they take from OEM before selling it to the customer. They can also request specific changes to an OEM part from the manufacturer. In some cases this can change the performance of the component, for example using different fans on an AIO cooler can cause performance increases/decreases depending on how said fans displace air through the radiator fins.

This is seen a lot with GPUs - for example Nvidia release a ‘Founders Edition’ of all their cards which is basically the standard card. Then all the GPU manufacturers such as MSI, Gigabyte, ASUS, Zotac etc will built their on shrouds and fan arrays onto the cards, with their own branding and brand-specific features. The base card and chip are always the same, but there can be slight performance differences between the cards in terms of active cooling and power consumption.

But rebranding OEM parts doesn’t mean the quality of the part is reduced, and this doesn’t seem to be the case with Corsair.

What OEM parts can do though, in the case of Corsair, is reduce its moat. For some products Corsair has little to no edge over the competition, and often if you go onto some of the PC building subreddits and compare an OEM Corsair PSU (made by Seasonic) and an actual Seasonic PSUs, most of the replies will suggest buying the Seasonic one since Seasonic are the original manufacturer. There are arguably slightly better offerings from Seasonic vs Corsair in terms of PSUs in some instances, even though the underlying product is similar, with better warrenties if something goes wrong in the future. Being the original manufacturer seems to also hold some value amongst gamers.

To further this, in some cases, you can cut out Corsair alltogether and go direct to the manufacturer to get almost the exact same product - this is the case with AIO Coolers, you can build-your-own direct from Asetek. Gamers don't usually do this, many of them probably never heard of Asetek, they are an OEM so don't really target end-consumers, their customer is companies like Corsair.

&#x200B;

# Corsair’s branding and marketing

By this point in the DD you're probably asking why Corsair has some products that have absolutely no moat, but are still best-sellers. And here is one way that Corsair shines over its competition: branding, marketing, collaboration and visability.

They sponsor eSports tournaments, give away free kit to increase exposure and work with streamers to increase brand awareness. Also just look at their website, it's head-and-shoulders above many of their competitors in terms of functionality, look and feel.

Their targeted marketing seems to be paying off. With collaborations and sponsorship with YouTubers, targeting younger audiences with their stylish, colourful branding and RGB unicorn puke, I think Corsair can continue to lead the market in terms of sales by continuing their marketing.

Corsair is not new to the gaming space, it was founded way back in 1994, so this long term pedigree in the market place definitly helps with their visability.

&#x200B;

# Corsair’s competitors

Corsair has a lot of competitors. Dozens of companies compete in the PC gaming space. Corsair is somewhat unique in the way that you can basically build an entire PC almost exclusively from Corsair components, so it doesn’t have a direct like-for-like competitor in that sense, but there are many, many competitors who compete with them for specific components.

**Logitech - Peripherals and streaming gear**  
Corsair and Logitech compete over peripherals and streaming kit. Logitech is often compared to Corsair on this sub, probably because it’s one of the only other companies relating to gaming that trades on the stock market, but they are actually pretty different companies, with different target markets and different products. While Logitech does target gamers for some products, it also has a substantial ‘productivity’ target - peripherals for people working from home or in the office, in creative fields and so on. Personally I don't find the two companies *that* comparable, but they do compete in some product lines so have added them here.

**Razer - Peripherals, cases, pre-built desktops**  
In terms of peripherals, Razer, Corsair and Logitech often compete for the top three spots on any ‘Best gaming keyboards/mice this year’ blog post. They make similarly good quality peripherals, but often where Razer falls down is their QA and longevity. They are often slightly more expensive than Corsair, many say Razer is ‘style over substance’. They also compete for the headsets portion of the console market.

Peripherals in general are very subjective, everyone has differing opinions on which one they prefer in terms of quality, usability and comfort so other than looking at sales figures, it's pretty hard to figure out which supplier produces the *best* peripherals.

In terms of their hardware, though, Razer are allegedly somewhat unreliable in that aspect, with users complaining of poor QA issues. Razer compete with Corsair for PC cases, which they offer two choices - a full sized ATX and a Mini-ATX. Recently Razer also entered the pre-built market, with the Tomahawk Gaming Desktop, a small-form-factor pre-built rig.

Razer in general are pretty expensive, targeting the high-end gamer who has money to burn. You could argue that Razer is the Apple of the gaming world, with stylish ultra-expensive laptops. Judging by user reports online though, their QA and performance doesn't quite live up to the price tag.

**Turtle Beach - Headsets**  
Corsair and Turtle Beach compete directly with gaming headsets. This is not PC specific, console gamers will also buy headsets from either of these suppliers.

Many say Turtle Beach is massively undervalued, it does trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker HEAR. Personally I find their headsets disappointing, I own one and it was expensive, not comfortable to wear, the audio quality isn’t great and has a cheap plasticy feel. That’s just my opinion though, they are a popular choice amongst many gamers.

**NZXT - Components and pre-built gaming rigs**  
I feel like NZXT is one of the closer ‘all-round’ competitors of Corsair. While they don’t sell all the products that Corsair offers, they do sell cases, AIO coolers & fans, PSUs, RGB lighting and recently motherboards (which Corsair don’t offer at all).

Their products are good quality, their cases are nicely designed, popular and easy to build in. NZXT also have started selling pre-built rigs, like Corsair, to add further revenue streams.

In my opinion NZXT could be one of the main rivals to look out for in terms of a major competitor in coming years, because they could increase their product lines to compete more directly with everything Corsair does.

In some cases, as I’ve described previously, NZXT and Corsair products are almost exactly the same. The AIOs sold by both companies are actually manufactured OEM by Asetek, with changes to the fans, exterior shroud and so on, but the underlying product is pretty similar/the same in some cases.

**Seasonic - PSUs**  
As i've mentioned elsewhere in this DD, Seasonic actually produce some of Corsair's PSUs, they are an OEM supplier. Seasonic make some of the best PSUs in the industry, in terms of quality, reliability and customer support (i.e. warrenties etc). This quality does filter down to Corsair's OEM PSU units, but many gamers will reccomend going to the original manufacturer when buying a PSU.

It's worth noting that when gamers buy a Corsair PSU, some of the money they pay for it goes directly to Seasonic (depending on model, Corsair gets its OEM PSUs from multiple suppliers depending on the model). I don't know the exact margin figures for these PSUs, so can't make a judgement on if this positive or negative (i.e. does Corsair make a tiny margin on their PSUs becuase they give the OEM manufacturer most of the money of the sale, or do they actually make better margins than manufacturing them in-house becuase it's costly to do so).

**A few other competitors in the component space**  
**Fractal Design** \- They make cases and a few AIO CPU coolers which are OEM made by Alphacool.

**CoolerMaster** \- Makes keyboard, mice, cases, AIO coolers (they are a main manufacturer), air fans, monitors.

**Noctua** \- They compete directly with Corsair in terms of air cooling. Corsair recently started offering the A500, a fan CPU cooler for those who didn’t want to use AIO cooling, but it doesn’t perform as well as many cheaper or equally priced Noctua or Deepcool competing products. In some instances a decent Noctua air cooler will outperform a Corsair AIO cooler for less money.

**G.Skill** \- Compete with Corsair on RAM. G.Skill are often used in high-end rigs, with built-in RGB, decent clock speeds and some of their sticks are ultra-low-latency for maximum performance. This RAM is quite popular at the moment, I regularly see it in build videos on YouTube.

**Crucial** \- Compete with Corsair on RAM. Crucial can be a slightly more budget choice, some of their sticks are bare, without RGB or fancy heatsinks, but their performance and reliability is good.

**Kingston, Patriot, HyperX** \- Compete with Corsair on RAM at mixed prices and performance levels.

# Revenue increases during the pandemic - a one-off?

One of the main reasons for Corsairs current sideways trading, in my opinion, is the uncertainty that has come from the pandemic.

Some analysts and investors have taken this huge revenue rise in the last year or so as a ‘one-off’ caused by the pandemic. To a certain extent, I’d argue that this is correct. The pandemic did cause a huge influx of customers into the sector in general.

The real test for Corsair here will be if they can continue to grow their revenue after the pandemic is completely over. It does look positive, with their revenue continuing to climb in their recent January 2021 earnings report. I feel that in the short-term we may see a slight slow in revenue growth, but over the long term it will continue to increase. The customers that built their first PC during the pandemic won’t go anywhere.

For that reason, Corsair is a long term hold. It’s possible we will see some sharp rises as the result of earnings announcements, for example if they absolutely obliterate the estimates to the point where no-one expected it.

&#x200B;

# How can Corsair grow?

Growth (of products, not revenue growth), is something that can hold back the share price. Many of the products Corsair sells might not see any further innovation. For example, a CPU air or AIO cooler is pretty much as good as it gets these days, it's unlikely we will see that many technological improvements in this area, so gamers have less of an incentive to upgrade. Cases is another one - you can literally keep PC cases for a decade without ever needing to change it.

For other components, however, there are more tech improvements. RAM is one of them - DDR5 memory will be coming out this year. This could offer further incentives to gamers to upgrade other components while they upgrade to DDR5 RAM. However, the changeover for RAM usually takes years, as we saw in the past with DDR4 RAM when it came out, so gamers might not all rush out to buy new sticks as soon as it comes out. Often the clock speeds on launch are often slower than later on in the generational cycle, and the prices are expensive so it's likely those top-tier gamers with high-end rigs who will upgrade their RAM at release but many mid-level gamers will wait a bit before upgrading.

Continuing doing what they are doing in terms of increasing revenue through existing product sales might not cut it in this instance. As i’ve mentioned elsewhere in this post, their moat for many products isn’t big, and in some cases non-existent, and I feel like many institutions and analysts have looked at this during their research, and it's made them uneasy. Future mergers and acquisitions could be the key. They’ve already acquired Elgato, which gave them a foothold in the streaming market, and acquired Origin to be able to sell pre-built rigs.

They also released the Corsair One a few years ago, a pre-build compact workstation/gaming PC. It has had a pretty decent reception from some of the online reviews. Although most PC custom builders turn up their noses at pre-builts, and yes you can build a superior performing rig yourself, they have a place in the market in my opinion.

There are plenty of gamers out there who want a decent gaming PC that's simple, compact, good looking and high performing, but don't want the hassle of learning about all the components and figuring out how to put it together. They also want the warranty that comes with a pre-built, and the ease and peace-of-mind that comes with sending it back to Corsair if it breaks. Corsair seem to have a pretty decent returns policy regarding this too - they will pay for the courier service both ways, you can drop it into a physical repair center and will even send you fresh packaging if you threw yours away when you bought the rig initially.

&#x200B;

# The elephant in the room

Yep, the elephant in the room is EagleTree. EagleTree Capital is the major shareholder of Corsair, and has helped them grow for the last 4 years or so. At one point they held over 60% of the shares of the company, and in recent months have been selling off sizable chunks of their position.

Obviously this probably isn't good for short term rises in share price, we could see them sell off larger chunks of their position in the coming months. The flip-side of this is that it could just be scheduled profit taking, and may not effect the share price whatsoever.

&#x200B;

# You can do your research on $CRSR here on Reddit

We are somewhat blessed to literally have a shit ton of customer insight right here on reddit, something we don't often get. There are several PC building and gaming subs that have millions of members who regularly discuss, at length, the pros and cons of every component and brand imaginable. Here are some of the biggest subreddits: r/gaming r/pcmasterrace r/buildapc r/battlestations r/Corsair r/Games r/pcgaming

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

**Bullish points**

* Excellent revenue and profit growth. The fundamentals are super strong.
* Earnings are expected to grow a further 21% in the coming year.
* Proactive expansion into new sectors such as streaming (which will likely grow in the future) and pre-built PCs
* Wide range of good quality, reasonably priced products, many of which are best sellers within the market.
* Strong marketing and branding that increases exposure and visability of their products globally.
* Did extremely well during the pandemic, increasing its customer base.
* In terms of financial fundamentals, very undervalued at the moment.
* The video games industry in general is only going to increase in size and revenue, and streaming will likely increase with it.
* In terms of share price, there’s decent support at this level.
* New generations of products entering the market could be beneficial to Corsair - for example DDR5 memory is just around the corner. This can have knock-on positivity for Corsair in that if gamers want to upgrade to DDR5 RAM, they might need/want to upgrade other components too.

&#x200B;

**Bearish points**

* Some suggest their recent revenue spurts are a ‘one-off’ due to the pandemic. We could see a reduction or slow in revenues in the coming months/years. The uncertainty surrounding the return to ‘normality’ after the pandemic could make investors hesitent to invest.
* Many of their products are almost identical to others from competitors in the same market, the moat in some cases isn’t significant or even existent.
* EagleTree dumping shares could have an effect on share price.
* The margins on many products in the sector are quite small.
* For some products, there’s a level of innovation that might not be improved upon. A fan is a fan, and that’s it. There’s no growth in some specific lines of products to obtain sales from users ‘upgrading’ when there’s nothing to upgrade to.
* The PC components market is exceptionally crowded.
* Corsair has a fair amount of debt, although it is well covered by operating cashflow.

&#x200B;

# Conclusion

As I said at the start of this DD, I really like Corsair. They are a well run company, with incredible revenue growth, solid fundamentals, decent products and a good foothold in the market.

Personally I don't buy the whole 'the pandemic is a one-off' take. We've already seen a continuation in revenue growth into 2021, even after lockdown restrictions are reduced or lifted, so I feel they will continue to make bank. While we might see a slight slow, overall Corsair will just keep growing in terms of revenue and profit. It will grow with the continuously growing gaming industry.

I feel like this is a long term play with somewhat short term uncertainty. But I feel it’s a buy. I only have a small position as am about to go through a divorce, but will be adding to my position as soon as is possible.

I don't suggest calls with short expiries, i've already been burned on this becuase i'm a dumbfuck. If you're gonna do options then leaps are probably ideal, or buy shares and sell covered calls against them. Shares is probably the play in general, but natrually that's jut my opinion, this isn't financial advice.

I’ve tried to be as accurate as possible with this DD, if anything is incorrect, feel free to comment below and I’ll amend it.

Why is this a big deal??? 

Well we saw the same thing happen with a lot of tech stocks including Microsoft dropped 3% in after hours (although it has since recovered) and with the Chinese markets continuing to get hammered, inflation on the run, and a lot of uncertainty about more lock downs, will we see a larger scale correction over the next quarter? 

One argument for this is that companies that still have high demand can’t fill their demand due to chip shortages. 

TSLA for example predicted they could only fill 35000 out of a 80000 demand for their newest model due to these shortages and AAPL also cited this as a factor to slower growth in their earnings call today.

Well given the current evaluations on American/Canadian tickers currently I think this is a mistake. 

You have companies like AAPL and MSFT trading at absurd multiples. So maybe be a bear you might ask? Well bears have gotten crushed all year long so I would argue it's to early to be a bear. So what the hell are you supposed to do? You can't buy, you can't sell and you just did three lines of cocaine and want to gamble. 

The answer: Chinese stocks, the Chinese stock market has recently corrected and seems to have found support at these levels. I think Chinese stocks are where one can find value currently. The TA looks good and if the numbers aren't cooked to oblivian you might even find some good long term value in BABA and other Chinese big cap stocks. 

So ya the summery is if you wanted to buy Chinese stocks in the last 2 months you will had a hard time finding value up until now. I think over the next day or two these stocks find a bounce to indicate a move higher. Just make sure the company you bought has been recently investigated for Fraud as these companies are probably less likely to try and cook the books in the short term with regulators breathing down their necks.

**ViacomCBS's BULL case**

VIAC is an established profitable company with high free cash flow and a RoE of 17.7%. Yet it remains profoundly undervalued following persistant negative sentiment after the share price plummeted in March (see lower). It is currently trading at a PE ratio of merely 9.3 (historically \~15) compared to a median PE ratio of 21 in the Media industry. ViacomCBS is a low-risk high-reward bet with hardly any downside left.

Note that earnings estimates were consistently beat the 4 past quarters. Current Q2 consensus EPS is a meagre $0.96, but I see no reason for it to be any less than Q1, and instead I rather expect blow-out earnings this quarter thanks to:

1. **sVOD (Paramount+, Pluto TV) popularity**  
Android app store [stats](https://www.androidrank.org/application/paramount_watch_live_sports_news_originals/com.cbs.app) may provide some insight in the popularity of the premium streaming service Paramount+. It is currently nr 4 Top Grossing Entertainment app (US). Assuming the total number of ratings has a linear correlation with number of downloads and therefore also subscriber count, extrapolation results in an estimated 3.5 mio new Paramount+ subscribers during Q2 (vs Netflix's +1.5mio).Using the same methodology we see further growth for Pluto TV, good for another +6 mio MAU's last quarter. That should convice at least a couple of analysts to raise their price targets.
2. **Post-pandemic ad-market rebound with ""historic demand"" resulting in historic pricing**  
ViacomCBS reported strong demand for live sports and CBS primetime programming. In addition, Paramount+ and Pluto TV reported significant interest as advertisers use AVOD to build incremental reach. *Variety* reported ViacomCBS was seeking slightly higher CPM increases that were in the low-to -mid 20% range.Source: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2021/07/14/the-advertising-upfronts-were-a-big-sellers-market](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2021/07/14/the-advertising-upfronts-were-a-big-sellers-market)
3. **Increased theatrical revenue** (was nearly zero YoY as result of movie theater closures)  
E.g. [A Quiet Place 2](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/releasegroup/gr3159642629/) ranked nr 1-2 at the box office up until 30 Jun, grossing almost $300M to date.

**What happened to the stock in March?**

https://preview.redd.it/595o0uhuwpd71.png?width=2013&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe46399280ad49280c978e9ef69c70f370f1892f

ViacomCBS shares saw a huge run up to $100+ at the start of this year after announcing its renewed Paramount+ premium streaming platform.

Bill Hwang's Archegos Capital Fund spotted the opportunity and accumulated VIAC stocks with enormeous leverage. ViacomCBS took advantage of its momentum and tried to capitalize by issuing new shares to fund the new streaming platform. This caused a modest price drop, unwittingly initiating a chain reaction: Bill Hwang got margin called. Multiple over-exposed banks (including GS, MS, DB and CS) rushed toward the exit and unwound Hwang's positions. Millions of shares were dumped simultaneously, tanking the stock price.

I should emphasize there was **no fundamental reason** for this plummet, rather an epic bid-ask imbalance. Remember: just days before, $3 billion ""smart money"" signed into the capital raise at $85 per share.

# SWOT

**Strengths**

* Huge content library with 140,000 television episodes and 3,600 films covering multiple genres
* Increasing advertising revenue thanks to steady subscription growth on Pluto TV
* Growing Paramount+ premium subscription counts
* Valuable NFL sports rights, Super Bowl in 2023
* Paramount Studios should benefit nicely from reopened movie theaters and has some top movies upcoming (Top Gun: Maverick, MI6)
* Plenty of cash flow
* Stable dividend of $0.96 per share

**Weaknesses**

* Negative market sentiment after the Archegos disaster
* High debt

**Opportunities**

* Attractive target for buyout/M&A
* Paramount+ and Pluto TV have yet to launch in India and most of Europe, both huge markets

**Threats**

* Increasing competition from Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney, NBCUniversal
* Cord-cutting leading to a drop in TV advertising demand

# TL;DR

The stock is currently severely undervalued compared to its industry rivals despite its excellent fundamentals, growth potential and free cash flow. As a bonus it is a potential buyout candidate for Amazon, Netflix, the newly merged WarnerMedia-Discovery or even Apple who are all in search of new content.

ViacomCBS is a coiled spring waiting to pop, and this might be your last chance to get on board cheap before Q2 earnings are released next week.

A: Well, no… Lucid was formerly known as Atieva, a battery and drivetrain manufacturer for formula E. They started in 2007, they later decided in 2016 that they wanted to throw their tech into a car of their own. They have been around a long time, and the Lucid team has tons of experience in the industry (Lots of ex Tesla, Porsche, Apple, Google, Lotus, etc employees)

Q: Are they just another Tesla ripoff?

We’ll start with a note that Tesla started in 2003 and released their first car in 2008, a similar 5 year development to that we are seeing with Lucid - 2016 - 2021 (With any luck). Lucid and Tesla are two very different companies reaching two different markets (at least for the moment). Lucid is luxury EVs whereas Tesla has a great EV for pretty much everyone (if you can afford it). Peter Rawlinson of Lucid has stated that he intends to eventually manufacturer affordable EVs as well as their SUV (Gravity) and other cars. 

Q: They’re way too overvalued and they have no cars on the road.

A: You’re right, but aren’t all EVs. Rivian has an estimated valuation of 70b, despite no cars on the road. According to Lucid’s timeline we should see some of the 10,000 preorders on the roads sometime around Q3."

What's poppin' bull gang, I hope you made some awesome money last week! The spreadsheet was spot on for nearly every company, and all of my plays came to fruition! **$MT and $X ended up bagging us anywhere from 300% to 500%, $JETS gave us 1100%, and $SNAP netted us 250% on our strangles and nearly 600% on binary options!** I’m looking to keep this momentum going throughout this week as well, and with all of FAAMG (I kicked $NFLX out for $MSFT after their disgraceful earnings) set to report, this week could prove to be more lucrative than the last! We’ve got a large variety of trades we can make this week ranging from educated gambles, to good old fashioned theta plays. We’ve even have a couple of opportunities to sprinkle in some collateral plays if we wish! Let’s get into it! 

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Pinterest is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $PINS has had an average post earnings move of **14%**. The options this week are pricing in a move of *roughly 6%* on both sides of the chain, which is likely going to shrink significantly going into earnings as theta eats away at the contracts. Even though I’m extremely bullish on $PINS, this trade could honestly move either way, so I’m personally opting to play a straddle like I did with $SNAP last week. Given that we get a historically average move, we’ll be making some money on this trade. Keep in mind, this trade *is* riskier than the one we played on $SNAP, since the average historical move is smaller. Don’t over leverage yourself, and don’t be afraid to turn the straddle into a reverse iron butterfly to reduce your cost basis on the trade.

&nbsp;

- **Over the past 24 earnings seasons, Shopify has gone up nearly 75% of the time!** The odds on this trade are phenomenal, and we have quite a few options for how we want to play it.  If you want to gamble directionally, call debit spreads would be your best bet from a risk to reward standpoint. Alternatively, we can also join theta-gang for this play by selling ATM put credit spreads allowing us to net some extremely nice premiums. If you want an even safer spread, $MSFT also has a similar win-rate (~65%) while having a historically smaller move, allowing you to defend your capital in the event that the trade goes against you. Since both $SHOP and $MSFT report on different days, we can look to make this play twice to ensure we’re not overleveraged on any given day.

&nbsp;

- **Counterintuitively, $XLE is NOT a good [collateral play](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays) this week!** $XLE actually has a *higher* IV than both $XOM and $CVS, so if you wanted to play oil earnings, you’d actually be better off rolling the dice on the individual companies. I’m not sure why this is the case here. Either the MMs are catching onto my bullshit (unlikely), or there’s some nuances to trading oil that I’m not aware of.  I’m sure there’s an arbitrage play you could make regarding the individual price and IV differences proportional to the ETF holdings, but I don’t have time to crunch the numbers nor do I think I’d have enough capital to abuse it. Regardless, I just wanted to bring this to everyone’s attention since this is one of the rare cases where the collateral play puts us at a disadvantage.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I haven’t had much time to review any extra trades given that I’ve been extremely busy this weekend. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.

#Summary and Conclusion

We’ve got another fun week of earnings ahead of us! I personally tend to avoid playing FAANG stocks in general, so my analysis was concentrated elsewhere. If you see any appealing plays, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment! If you want access to more trading tools, or have any specific questions or observations you’d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links within the spreadsheet or on my profile. **Happy Trading! :)**"

[Figure 1. My $DIDI calls bought close to the bottom on friday.](https://preview.redd.it/nd9dxf8gyed71.png?width=2458&format=png&auto=webp&s=211f9ba00daa18b3253db6ad870c8ba92bf3a721)

&#x200B;

**$REE and $DIDI are two good asymmetric risk bets with excellent upside.**

**PART 1: $DIDI**

$DIDI is China’s largest ride hailing company with a market capitalization  about $74.Billion. Investors include Uber which has 12.5% stake in $DIDI ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/uber-lost-2-billion-in-didi-stake-this-week-on-china-crackdown-threat.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/uber-lost-2-billion-in-didi-stake-this-week-on-china-crackdown-threat.html)). It’s IPO in the US markets was an immense failure. It reached a high of $16 within this month before being pummeled to around $8 by threats from the Chinese government and bans  from app stores 

([https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/07/04/china-bans-didi-from-app-stores-just-days-after-massive-us-ipo/?sh=23d571231202](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/07/04/china-bans-didi-from-app-stores-just-days-after-massive-us-ipo/?sh=23d571231202)).

I think this godsend for a good asymmetric return via call options. This company is going nowhere. It is China’s largest ride sharing company. China is a smart country that wants to grow its industries while keeping the CEO’s in line. This is a power move by China and DIDI will make concessions to the communist government and the stock will rocket to its price target of \~$25 by Q4 2024. My hypothesis is based on China’s power move with Jack Ma and Alibaba. They paid their $2.8 Billion fine and now they are back to signing record deals

([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-30/alibaba-nears-first-big-deal-since-record-antitrust-fine](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-30/alibaba-nears-first-big-deal-since-record-antitrust-fine))

$BABA is currently trading around $206

I believe $7-8 is the bottom for this sell off. I expect to see a rapid return to \~15-16 in the next few weeks.

**Recommendation 1:**

$DIDI 11/19/2021 15.00 C

&#x200B;

**PART 2: $REE**

[Figure 2. Boomer Lord and thought leader Cramer talks with $REE CEO Automotive CEO Daniel Barel on 7\/23\/201. $REE shares rose 7&#37; after hours and expect it to rise more on Monday.](https://preview.redd.it/g76s8yknyed71.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=12d442a915221da2d14f687d685b1d51c9960294)

$REE Auto is a next gen EV platform company based in Israel. It is rapidly growing and opening their US headquarters in Austin Texas near Daddy Elon in the near future. 

[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210723005215/en/REE-Automotive-Will-Open-its-U.S.-Headquarters-and-First-Integration-Center-in-Austin-Texas-as-it-Prepares-for-Production-in-2023](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210723005215/en/REE-Automotive-Will-Open-its-U.S.-Headquarters-and-First-Integration-Center-in-Austin-Texas-as-it-Prepares-for-Production-in-2023)

Their patented platform basically will act as the core components of the powertrains for EV's making their product versatile. Israel has been sending to the US a few unicorn IPOs and this is one to keep eye on.

$REE signed a deal with Magna in April. Magna has been rumored to be working on the Apple Car.

&#x200B;

So basically if you want to get part of the Apple Car either buy the $AAPL stock or $REE to get ahead of everyone.

Looks like the boomers will be buying $REE after their daily dose of Cramer. If the stock continues to hover between $10-$11 next week  I recommend getting call options.

**Recommendation**

Leadership: Peter Rawlinson: Current CEO/CTO - Peter has over 30 years of automotive experience. Prior to Lucid, Peter was Vice President of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla and Chief Engineer of the Model S, where he led the engineering of the Model S.

Derek Jenkins: Senior Vice President of Design and Brand - Before joining Lucid, Derek was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments locally and globally. He also spent nine years as the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America, and eight years with Audi, serving first as Lead Exterior Designer, followed by Assistant Chief Designer for Audi Design.

Michael Bell: Most recently, Michael was Chief Technology Officer for Rivian. He has 30 years in the tech field includes 16 at Apple and five at Intel. At Apple, he played significant roles in the development of iPhone, iMac, AirPort, and Apple TV products.

In short Lucid team is comprised of leaders with decades of experience in lead roles in automotive and technology industries.

Now, lets talk about the cars. Prior to the Lucid air, Lucid was known for Formula E racing. Lucid’s technology arm Atieva develops and builds the battery packs powering every car on the grid in the world's leading electric racing championship field. Currently Lucid's lineup with consist of 4 models: The Air, available in 2022, from $77,400. Air Touring model, from $95,000 Air Grand Touring, from $139,000 Air Dream Edition, at $169,000 Lucid Air EV has a battery capacity of 113.0 kWh and a range reported as high as 517 miles. That is more efficient than the Model S Long Range Plus, which has a 98.0-kWh capacity and 402 miles of range. Lucid's Dream edition will also boast a modest 1080HP. Lucid currently has reached 10,000 preorders, representing over 650M in anticipated sales. Lucid expects 577 of these to be delivered this year.

In November, Lucid finished building the first phase of its factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, with the capacity to deliver up to 30,000 units per year initially, with up to 400,000 units annually in the future. The site sits on 590 acres allowing for additional expansion. The next phase expected to begin later this year – enabling production of Project Gravity, a premium SUV, and is expected to be fully produced and delivered by 2023.

Lucid is also backed by the wealthy Saudi PIF (Public Investment Fund). They will be the largest shareholder, however there are also other companies in the pipe. Including Fidelity Management & Research, BlackRock, Neuberger Berman, Franklin Templeton, Wellington Management, and Winslow Capital Management.

However I've been focusing on the Saudi Fund, they currently hold over 430B in assets, and for such an oil rich company to be backing an EV, if that doesn't scream bullish....The pipe shares will also be locked until at least September 1, so I would not expect a selloff this week.

Lucid Currently has 8 showrooms but has plans to open 20 by the end of this year throughout the U.S. and Canada. Long before the SPAC Lucid also promised the Saudi's to build in factory in Saudi Arabia. Talks are the factory would be located somewhere around Jeddah, which would be mark a very significant move as the Middle East shifts its economy from oil to EV's.

Anyways this is my first attempt at a DD so....I'll be trying to read and respond to as many comments as I can.

Edit: current positions 400 shares@27.27"

The goal of this portfolio is to generate yearly returns that beat out market returns through a mix of buying calls options, writing covered calls and put options, wheeling, and holding a diversified stock portfolio in industries including banking & capital markets, consumer electronics, internet content and information, solar energy, oil & gas, information technology, aerospace & defense, tobacco, food & beverages, life insurance, software, credit services, and home improvement. Another goal is to collect passive income through dividends and compound that through dividend reinvestment.

As of 07-22, it is up $52K or 10.4% over the last month. Moreover, the portfolio also pays around $7,000 in annual dividends (all qualified dividends), which will be automatically reinvested through dividend reinvestment.

Overnight while all tards are sleeping tightly in the freedom country, Bloomberg reported that Chinese government is planning to turn education and online tutoring sector into **nonprofit.** It dropped the entire Chinese education sector by **50% - 70%**. RIP for EDU and TAL bagholders...

Well,  the scary thing is the public opinion in China always aligns with what the government wants to do. If you have friends in China, look up their comments on WeChat or WeiBo, they are cheering for turning education sector into non-profit.

The honeymoon with Chinese tech stocks are way over and the price Chinese stocks, even now for some, have priced in friendly, laissez faire regulation and CONTROL from the Chinese government.

And we can look at the data ""In total, more than $650 billion of market value has been erased from  the 98 stocks that make up the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index since  the gauge hit a record high in February."" - Bloomberg.

Without the regulatory pressure, I believe Chinese stocks would have been at ATH just like SPY and other indexes.

It might be the time to be greedy while the market is fearful. Chinese market is huge and with tons of growth potential for anything and everything. But maybe in the short-term until this muddy policy /  attitude shift is over, it's better to stay away from the Chinese stock to not have that gut wrenching feeling when one of your holding drops 50% overnight without any fundamental change to its business.

Edit: Added some data from Bloomberg

oq4q1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oq4q1q/fasten_your_seatbelts_massive_market_crash_is/,Fasten your seatbelts. Massive market crash is incoming next week and it’s going to be worse than the 2008 housing crash! 📉💥,0,99,2021-07-23 23:27:20,"Now that I got your attention, I’m thinking there is going to be a (possibly major) correction mid-way next week.

**FA:**

FOMC meeting is on July 28 and they will be, yet again, discussing fiscal and monetary policies. Fed funds rate could remain at <=0.25% or bump up. The rise in fed fund rate is pretty unlikely as JPow communicated that QE slowdown will precede interest rate hikes, but there's a good chance that tapering will be further discussed. US exports have climbed back to precovid numbers, US imports are higher than ever before despite DXY getting slapped meanwhile the GDP target has risen for 2021 signaling a sooner than anticipated economic recovery. Not to mention the continuous MoM CPI climbs in absurd amounts and the US operating at a massive trade deficit, all signal that tapering may start in the very near term despite JPow repeating how far we are from the economic target. However, officials have echoed on numerous fronts, the interest rate is not expected to see a hike until 2023; although, they predict that tapering plans will be announced in Fall of this year, but with everything seeming to go back to status quo sooner than expected, tapering or other bearish monetary policies could be announced and implemented shortly.

Tech earnings week is fast approaching. It’s unlikely the prices will hold when tech stocks sit at all time highs and the ER forecast for blue chips remain stagnant compared to its previous quarters.

**TA:**

TA says we’re reaching upper level resistance. Volatility is extremely high on the upside and can trigger HFT or quant funds to reduce inventory. We can expect higher levels of volatility (VIX futures that is only 1 week dte trading at roughly 20% from current levels).

[Reaching critical trend line resistance. Consider QQQ to have a upside of +1&#37; from here at $370\~$371](https://preview.redd.it/2pp016pjbzc71.png?width=1546&format=png&auto=webp&s=3248a4a2286ac3add6b4a7351682104e2ff5a773)

EWT says we’re reaching the massive correction cycle. It's the same shit when it comes to tech earnings run-up followed by the dump in spite of a decent performance.

Uncertainty creates risk and risk drives fear so the fact that ER release (granted a beat) by the blue chips might not be large enough to justify current prices, or the possible sector rotation that may ensue post ER release, or the possible tapering discussion which may change the macro, or reaching the upper level resistance of a major trend line could scare smart money away from the equity market in the near term. Call it quad witching if you will.

Bored of this, heard it too many times?  Not scared any more?

Well the virus and variants didn't get bored.

Reviewing the top five economies and their case trends -------------------------

Source : Worldometers.info

USA:  new cases curving upward, especially in FL

China:  they lie about their numbers

Japan:  new cases increasing at a roughly linear rate

Germany: new cases growing again, though off of a low base

France:  new cases surging and strong in the numbers, curving up

UK:  new cases surged though showing signs of starting to drop

Keeping your elder family members safe from your infecting them is still a cultural truth.

One political party in a given country wants to make another fail.  One party will weaponize the virus and threaten the other to take action.  This is what leads to restrictions.  Before it was the Democrats shutting down businesses to make the economy worse for Republicans.  Now it is the same, but Repub states will shut down and Dem states will want to keep businesses open.  In another country similar games will play out.

So all the potential economic shut downs are still there.

What is different is that all the technology that was bought to have the kids educate from home, such as tablets and web cams and online meeting subscriptions don't need to be bought a second time so soon.  So the 2nd set of restrictions on the population comes without a sector that gets an economic boost.  The exception is grocery stores and online shopping.

The extra unemployment benefits end on Sept 6th in numerous states, but investors know that and would sell effected stocks sooner.  The moratorium on evictions ends this fall, and so tenants will stop the games and scramble to pay their landlords, taking away their spending money.  If they don't they will get an eviction on their credit record.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

Now to valuations

[https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe)

shows that the Schiller PE ratio of stocks is 38.3.  The .com bubble was the highest it ever got, higher than this level for 2.5 years, and getting to the mid 40's.  Other then that, at no time in history was this valuation ratio this high.

Note also that in 1982 at the peak of interest rates 13 to 14%, the average stock had a PE of 7 to 9.

A book by O'Shoughnessy ""What Works on Wall Street"" studied 40 years of stock market data.  Its results shows that a price to sales ratio is 'the king of value factors', since sales can't be manipulated like earnings can.

[https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales)

shows that this valuation is higher now than at any time charted.  The book suggests that a price to sales of 1.5 is considered a good deal.  We are over twice that level on average.

The market breadth has eroded under the mega techs.  Not the Russel 2000 declined recently.

Here are the price to sales of the mega techs, using data at Reuters.  This can be hard to find in navigation, but a direct link will help, for example

[https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.N](https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.N)

use .N and .O at the end of the symbol for NYSE and NASDAQ.

price to sales:

MSFT = 13.3 ; FB = 10.4 ; AAPL = 7.5 ; AMZN = 4.3 ; GOOG = 8.76 ; NVDA = 25.2 ; AMD = 9.5

These clearly can fall and still be overvalued.

Some have sighted the growth in the money supply, such as M2, as part of what has pushed the market higher.  However, it is important to note that M2 was recategorized in 2020.  So even though you can go to the Mises Institute's site and see articles of big increases in the M2 money supply, much of that is due to the recategorization and strangely the articles omit this but for a footnote.

Inflation ----------------------------------------------

A large part of what we pretend to understand about inflation is the CPI and PCE.

We think that we know that the last CPI reading was 5.4%.  That is above the target of 2% of course when action by the recipe is needed.  This coupled with Powell not wanting to raise rates and desiring to de-prioritize inflation is ""bad enough"" from a stock perspective.  Jim Cramer described Powell as ""having a heart"" in wanting to prioritize helping people back to work.  Recall that interest rates have to be jacked up in response to inflation eventually.  Acting to late makes it worse.  From business school texts, higher interest rates put downward pressure on the value of future earnings.  Thus the forward looking value of stocks drops.

  But I challenge all of you to take the CPI by its percentage components and REBUILD it yourself with online research.  I did.  While the published number was +1.6% year over year at the time, I found no component less than 2%, and most were a good deal higher.  It is easy to find information showing education expenses rising at a +5% annual rate for many years.  Medical costs I found web sites saying +4% annually consistantly over many years.  At the time, only oil was lower than 2% price growth.  Today, with oil back up above $70 a barrel, that is not to be taken lightly.

  Recently the Fed has emphasized the PCE, the Personal Consumption Expendatures index.  Do you find as I do it strange that they publish the 'this month vs last month' number, making it look like small 0.1 to 0.3% rise, and not the more useful year over year number, which would show a larger % increase?

  The National Debt takes no small part in the desire to have inflation be low and keep interest rates low.  But that combination is impossible over time.

  I have been at individual stock investing since 1996 and I have sold most of my stock holdings.  I lived through the .com crash which I took on the chin (with small dollars since I was young and I learned from it such that I was 66% in cash for the crash of 2008.  If you have not been in the habit of thinking about economic impacts, valuations, and questioning what real inflation is, it is certainly time to start.

  The great bull market of the 1980's in the USA was spurred by the acceleration of women entering the work force and the personal computer.  The great bull market of the 1990's was spurred by implementation of the internet, immigration, and foreign economies developing.

  What is the story now?  5G networking is just a faster version of the same thing, but only over shorter distances.  Artificial intelligence is intended to replace humans.  Electric vehicles only reduce pollution after 100k miles according to an article in the WSJ.  I think to move on to much higher valuations we need a big economic story that just isn't there right now."

Open above 430 could see strength into large Gamma wall at 435. 435 could be significant resistance and push us back down to 420 over next few days Monday 7/26 in search of more liquidity.

This also falls in line with my thesis for the week where I expected a bounce on Tue/Wed then more selling as we get ready for AAPL ER and other big tech names in coming days

If we see 435 today, I will be taking a shot at some ITM SPY puts for Monday 7/26.

Short term Gamma also show strength today.

**Low market breadth and divergence:** there are fewer stocks rising versus ones declining, and a larger number of stocks are hitting the 52 week low than the ones hitting the 52 week high. 

**Overbought stocks:** such as AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, NVDA, and ARKK all have recently breached the 70 RSI overbought marker and are now dropping fast. This ties in well with the poor market breadth as allot of the money existing other stocks as they sell off is just pilling in few top stocks in an unstained way, hence the overbought flag. 

**Reduced volumes:** signal weakness in the market and provoke profit taking. For example the Russell 2000 average volume has dropped to just under 3 billion per day from a three months average of 3.7 billion. Incidentally this index tracks 2,000 small cap US companies which have been dropping for most of the last 3 weeks for a total decline of 7.3% thus far. 

**Major trend line broken:** for the second time in less than one month the S&P 500 has dipped under its major trend line. The first time on May 18th, it reversed and went back up on the back of decent labor and production reports plus earnings expectations. Now that earnings are underway and most economic indicators are pointing to growth peaking it might not be able to reverse the drop. 

Obviously all of the above are technical indicators that try to explain market behavior based on historical metrics, but they don’t explain the reasons behind such changes. We have to look at economic news to identify causes including: 

**Peaking economic recovery:** several reports this month point to an economy that has reached peak recovery. For example, both the services PMI 64.6 vs 65.2 vs 64.8 (actual, forecast, previous) and ISM 60.1% vs 63.3% vs 64.0% reports for June show a declining rate of expansion. Also, industrial production is showing similar pattern 0.4% vs 0.6% vs 0.7%.

**Mixed Q2 banking results:** also point to the same issue above. While the overall figures are up, the details point to absence of loan growth and net interest margin weakness. 

**Declining consumer sentiment:** while consumer spending came in higher than expected for the month of June consumer sentiment declined from 85.5 to 80.8. The main driver behind this is inflation.  

**Inflation rising:** the FED has been harping on inflation being transitory because of the “base effect” and some temporary supply constraints. Their timeline for all of that to sort out was few months. Now it’s more than few months and inflation continues to rage registering the highest figures in over a decade with Core CPI (the Fed’s favorite metric) registering 0.9%, the highest increase since 2008.

Furthermore, the PPI (producer price index) also continues to rise at a rate of 1% in June indicating that consumers are still going to see higher prices in the coming months and that overall inflation will overshoot the FED’s 2% threshold by a wide margin. 

**Reemergence of a new variant:**  the delta variant is causing allot of lock downs and interruption throughout the world. While its effect in the US might be limited, a slowing world economy does not bode well for stocks in general, hence perhaps the reason why bonds have gone up. 

**Bond yields going down:** usually indicates that an economy is slowing and investors are looking for safer assists. Many have pointed out that bond yields usually peak 3 months in advance of the stock which they did in March. Since we are in July and bond yield continue to decline many think the bond market is sniffing out something and reacting to it. Remember, the inverse relation between bonds and yields. 

**China’s Crack on tech:** has rattled some investors especially that it came at a time when that market was showing sign of bottoming out. 

All of those events point to a possible correction sometime in the near future. Most experts expect that sometime after Q2 earnings, but it could be starting as we speak, especially that corrections don’t play out in one straight line. They tend to move in a series of several lower lows and lower highs until bottoming out. 

It’s important to also point out that a correction is not a market crash. Corrections are a much smaller event, ranging around a -10% drop on the low end for the leading S&P 500 index and much more for individual speculative stocks. They are a healthy event that helps reinvigorate the market with new buyers. 

A crash on the other hand is a much larger event that’s usually provoked by a combination of events or a single major event. Crashes usually last much longer than people expect, well past the initial large drop. 

There are several catalysts for such an event such as the emergence of a virus variant that outsmarts vaccines or a collapse in the reverse repurchase facility. The most prominent of them however, is QE tapering (quantitative easing) and increase in interest rates. 

Massive QE and low interest rates have been the driving force behind this bull market. They are the justification given for the current astronomical valuation where the S&P500 Shiller P/E ratio is reaching a whopping 38%! That is a historic high only second to the Dotcom bubble in 2000 (44%) and is in general an unsustainable level in the long term. 

Some argue that the FED will manage to taper QE and increase interest rates gradually in a very controlled manner and avoid any meltdown, but given rising inflation beyond expectations, the FED might very well be forced to act much sooner than it would like. Equities and bonds expert Ray Dalio explains this process in his most recent video on YouTube."

Once spun off, GXO will become the largest pure play contract logistics provider in the world on day one. Every large company spinoff in the history of trading has unlocked huge value for shareholders. This combined with upcoming earnings on 28 July, makes this a potential multibagger, considering the stock is consolidating for last 3 months**

**Company Summary**
XPO is a global provider of transportation and supply chain solutions. It operates through two divisions - Transportation and Logistics.

Transportation provides freight brokerage operations that matches shippers freight with trucking companies and last mile operations including a network of ground, air, and ocean carriers. Transportation makes 60% of company revenue.

Logistics provides warehousing and inventory management services and generates 40% of the revenue for XPO.

XPO is positioned to capitalize on rapid growth of e-commerce and logistics outsourcing. For last 6 quarters XPO has grown sales yoy by at least 10%

**Catalysts**
**Company Spinoff** - XPO Logistics Inc. (XPO) has announced a distribution of (New) GXO Logistics, Inc. (GXO) Common Shares. The distribution ratio is 1.0 GXO share for each XPO share held. The record date is July 23, 2021; the payable date is August 2, 2021. The NYSE has set August 2, 2021, as the ex-distribution date for this distribution
Once it becomes a standalone company, GXO will be the largest pure-play contract logistics provider on day one and its customers include companies like Apple, Nike etc.

**Company Earnings** - 28 July after market

**Why it is 10x Bagger**
There are 2 upcoming catalysts - First is earnings on 28 July and second is $GXO spinoff on Aug 2. Now you know, company would not have announced a spinoff just 2 days after earnings if they were not confident of hitting it out of the park. 
And you all know what happens when there is a stock split or spinoff, there is never a successful company out there that did a spinoff, and it did not rocket.
As per the CEO, post spin off, the parent company will trade in $100 - $120 starting range and spin off company $GXO will trade around $65 - $70 range.
As per Deutsche Bank - GXO will be around $70 out of the gate.
That gives an upside of at least 20 - 30% post spin off. 
Cramer loves it too, what is there not to like about a logistics company especially during this ecommerce boom.

**What will happen to current Options?**
The current options will become XPO1 and will trade by adding the price of both the companies. The strikes will remain the same.
XPO1 = XPO + GXO

**Play**
-The stock has been trading range bound in between $140 - $150 for last 3 months and right now it's at the lowest of that range that is $140.  You can buy shares for a potential of 20 - 40% upside in next 2-3 weeks.

- You can buy $150 - $160 calls for 20 Aug for a potential multi bagger. By Aug 20 both earnings will come out and the spinoff would have happened and both companies will have decent time to do a runup. 

**My Position**
 $160 Calls for 20 Aug. ($79k) (700Calls)

I'm on 30mg of Adderall so the sooner I start the better. Alright here we go.

I see a lot of hate towards TA around here. I understand why a lot of you degens are skeptical, but I'd like to put TA into a perspective that people like us monke can understand. I know, I know, TA is like the boomer version of Astrology, and although both Astrology teen girls and TA boomers are very similar, there is still much for us to gain if we utilize TA properly.

I won't go into exact details on **how** you should apply TA, but I will touch upon an elementary school level of philosophy on **why** it is necessary and how it can increase your success by a large margin. (""Large margin"" as in ""More tenderloins"" not ""MARGIN CALL"". I know some of you might have PTSD and/or are illiterate)

In order to not overwhelm you, I will use the game of Poker to explain these concepts in a more digestible and relatable way. I'm assuming the stock market is either a replacement or a supplement to your casino gambling addictions, so most of you will already know the rules of Poker. If you **DO NOT** know the rules of Poker you're honestly a giant pussy and I'd rather you not read my post at all. **OUT! OUT! OUT!**

Poker and the market have many similarities. Yes there are boomer Stonks that only go up at a snails pace and you'll be a millionaire by the young age of 95, but again, let's assume you're not a pussy and you play the stock market like the casino it truly is.

In poker you get a hand from the dealer and you make due with what you got. You can fold, bet, check, and use positioning and mind games to turn any shitty hand into a winning one. The cards are luck, the actions are skill.

The market is very similar in that sense. The biggest difference (aside from the obvious ones) being that you don't need to let some random asshole (dealer) choose a stock for you. You get to choose yourself.

A notable similarity which will also help reinforce the analogy is the reality that no matter what hand you get in Poker, no matter how high of a chance you have to win the hand, there's always a chance of losing. You can buy Amazon today and it could tank 70% on Monday because Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates blew $300 Billion on dildo's and male strippers one night in Vegas to celebrate their divorces. And you can lose a hand in Poker with quad Ace's, or a straight flush.

With that being said, Amazon tanking 70% in a day is...possible... but extraordinarily unlikely. You see, the Stock market can be an easier game than poker. If you view each stock as a playing card, you will always go for the best hand. I like to imagine that if I bought an Amazon stock, it's actually an Ace of Spades (**A**mazon = **Ace of Spades**) and let's just say I buy Apple as well. Now I have the best starting hand in poker, (**A**pple = **Ace of Spades**) suited!

**(For the record, Amazon and Apple are only being used for the analogies sake. I do not, and probably will not ever own either of those two stocks.)**

Now that we know to associate picking stocks based on their first letters and consistency, we can finally bring attention to the other ways of ensuring we have a ""**likely** to win"" hand. ""Likely"" is very important here. Repeating what I said above, even the best hands can lose, and even the best stocks can fall. This is where TA is important. We use TA to know when to fold, double down, or check. **Buying the stock is choosing your hand, holding the stock is playing the game.**

Anybody who uses TA to predict the direction of a stock with 100% certainty is an absolute moron. Anyone who thinks NOT using TA will lead to a higher chance of a successful trade is **ALSO** a moron. We must meet in the middle.

From now on, we will view TA as a way of establishing our percent chance of winning the hand (trade). Just like how we know pocket Aces ensures an 81% chance of victory, we must use TA to find our percent chance of winning. If we use TA properly and see we have a good hand, BET (Buy more) or CHECK (hold). If our stock looks to be the equivalent of a 7-4 hand, FOLD (Sell) or BLUFF (Buy the dip).

I hope you learned something here. Obviously this is the best advice you could ever get but of course I must ensure you that this is NOT financial advice, it's actually a Brochure for a hotel in Antarctica (Get your warm and cozy Igloo now starting at just $19.99, Canadian Eskimo Included)"
oljz0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oljz0k/i_dont_date_chicks_from_china_thats_a_big_red/,"I Don't Date Chicks from China - That's a Big Red Flag (but Sugar, $FXI is Going Down)",0,12,2021-07-17 00:10:10,"Alright – I’m gonna keep this DD (donkey dick) short and sweet. I’m traditionally bullish but with the rotation out of meme stocks and back into SPY, there’s some fuckery afoot.. and this is on a global scale.

Unless your entire portfolio is FB / AMZN / NFLX / GOOGL / AAPL then you’ve felt the pain of watching your portfolio get hammered -3% to -10% daily. I’m here to provide a slight glimmer of hope that is actually backed up by some fucking fact, take it or leave, I won’t kick you out of bed for eatin’ crackers.

I don’t date chicks from China, because that’s a big red flag (get it?) but I am gonna fuck China and here’s why:

* **Inflation** – say what you want, but it’s looming. And in theory papa Powell can just keep printing all day long and as long as the $$$ doesn’t physically leave the fed, then we’re okay, HOWEVER this leads me to #2
* **Student Loans** – September 15th is right around the corner and our commander in queef has a decision to make… either extend the current relief where no one is paying anything, forgive *some* or *all* student debt, or say fuck it time to start paying again
   *  **It’s a LOSE / LOSE / LOSE** situation for the market. Extend the relief and the discussion around inflation becomes an even more real thing. Forgive some or all… all that money that’s been printed just flew out the fucking fed door faster than the dude I caught banging my wife…. Start paying again, all the “savings” people have in the market gets liquidated to start paying the student loans and #rugpull
   *  **Also** this announcement isn’t going to come on September 14th where ByeDon is going to surprise everyone and say, “no student loans!” or “start paying bucko” this announcement should come at the next fed meeting at the end of July or in August… which will obviously immediately get priced in and impact the market

**How does this tie to China?** Good question

Because the U.S & Europe have pursued extraordinary monetary policy in the last 2 years (low interest rates / other to support economic growth), this has caused a rise in commodity prices; creating an “imported inflation” issue for China.

I’ll go even farther.

**CHINA** is the largest consumer in the world of Copper and Copper prices have hit a **20 year high** with no signs of slowing down. We haven’t seen these prices in 10 years. I anticipate copper prices to keep rising. Just look at the chart. So as the price rises, so do production costs.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v8hr7paqjlb71.png?width=942&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dd699fd6eec4f27ca8db3b8dfc421ffc820ac0a

Still not enough? Alright while the greenback is getting it’s dick kicked in by Yao Ming and the world shifts away from U.S. denominated assets; let’s take a look at China’s housing market

China is trying to contain this smoking hot property market without capping the prices of the houses, they’re just requiring people who want to buy houses to put down more of a down payment. Essentially just limiting the financing opportunities. This in turn will just drive the principal price of the house up. So now we’ve got propped up housing prices, people who want the house need to put more down to buy said house… where are they gonna get their savings? The same place I’m gonna go to access my savings when I have to eventually pay off my student loans… the market.

**Okay, I’m interested… but what stock do I play?** ***$FXI*** why? Because it’s the ETF that tracks the top 50 largest Chinese stocks in a single fund. It’s used to express a single country view… similar to our good ‘ol friend SPY, but more representative of a country.

**TL;DR:** very real inflation threat triggered by student debt decision and rising commodity prices will impact the global markets; more so China due to them holding trillions of U.S. denominated foreign exchange assets and being the worlds largest consumer of copper. rising copper prices create rising production costs. couple that with red hot housing market and more $$ required for a down payment to buy housing, props up the housing price, creates a perfect storm in the Chinese market. 

**position & further proof:** I am long 100x FXI September $40 puts.

And at the beginning of this week - someone laid down a $500k spread on August $40 / $42p (22,500x each). I went out another month just to buy some more time and allows me to keep adding to the position if (when) I want to get bigger.

ol9ygr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ol9ygr/the_super_bullish_case_for_tech_stocks_long_term/,The Super Bullish Case For Tech Stocks (Long Term),25,29,2021-07-16 12:58:05,"This won't be a long post, I'm mainly here to stoke discussion and educated opinions.

The nature of technology is that of exponential progress. If you were to review the latest greatest tech of each era, it would be plainly obvious just how fast things evolve. TV to VCR to Walkman to Playstation to VR. The next new tech of today often makes the last thing look ridiculous. Even if you were to look year to year, you would witness growth that reaches far beyond any other sector. I'm going to make a few quick cases for technology being the highest value, highest growth, and simply the best investment of the next decades and beyond.

1. **It is being subsumed by everything.**

Technology is no longer a separate entity. Recently Bank of America claimed they are really a tech company. That's kind of a stretch, but the point is taken. Everyone has incorporated tech into their business model. Tech is what makes things cheaper, easier, more efficient, cleaner. And any company with intention of surviving is rapidly adopting technology into their models.

2)  **It was fairly stagnant for a very long stretch.**

If you look at QTEC or any of the other technology ETF's you'll see a ten year period from 2006 to 2016 where the value of tech more or less doubled. Doubling your money in ten years is nothing to sneeze at. However, if you look over the next 5 years, from 2016 to 2021, tech more than tripled from there. There are many who might claim that makes tech overvalued, but I look at it as more as coming into a 'catching up' phase. Tech brought a lot of prosperity to the world from 1970's to today. That was not properly reflected in share prices until recently. I think you could make a case that, especially when considering point 1 above, tech is still vastly undervalued. If tech was to disappear, it would not only be companies like Apple, Microsoft, Palantir, etc that would fall, but the value of every company on earth would fall as well. Ask yourself: How much prosperity on the S&P over the past couple decades can be directly attributed to tech?

3)  **The future depends on technology.**

If you were to ask someone what are the most sensitive issues going forward, you might hear things such as energy concerns, climate change, security, food shortage, water shortage, pollution. You'd hear a lot more answers as well. How will they be solved? To make an argument outside of technological disruption would be laughed at, and for good reason. We've hit an inflection point where all the problems we've gotten ourselves into can be solved only by technology. Will it happen? There are concerns around the viability of technology to solve our issues at the speed necessary. But what is the alternative?

**Conclusion**

Technology will almost certainly experience a pullback at some point over the next few years. It could be now, next month, next year: no one knows that. But what is almost certain is that for a young investor, technology is very likely to be the best investment you could make. Fintech, genomics, AI, VR, AR, cybersecurity, agriculture, EV tech, this list goes on. What are the chances these things do not play a gigantic role in our futures?

All opinions are welcome. I'd encourage people to stick to mature discourse since this thread is kind of lacking it at times. I'm really curious to hear any supporting or differentiating opinions. Thanks!"

2. This is not a team sport

3. Smallcaps do not in fact have the most potential upside. Apple was sitting at 120 (a PE of 28!!) literally all year, yet the sub was flooded with SPAC pump and dumps

4. Doing research does not mean scrolling Reddit and watching YouTube videos. Read the financial filings of the companies you’re interested in. Anyone who read Workhorse’s balance sheet would know they were a financial trainwreck

5. This is a gambling sub focused on get-rich-quick schemes, not a “BUY AND HODL” sub or a “IM NOT SELLING 💎🙌💎🙌💎” sub. Again, there is no glory or pride in bagholding

6. Chamath is not your friend. Branson is not your friend. Motley Fool is not your friend. Seeking Alpha is not your friend. Lowkey, when it comes to your money, no one is your friend. Trust no one

7. Don’t bet against the mouse. The house of mouse always wins

8. The majority of the market is in a highly speculative bubble right now. Hedge funds know this. Banks know this. Opportunistic companies rushing to IPO know this. SPACs know this. Do you know this? 

9. Investing based on fundamentals will never go out of fashion. Investing based on FOMO is just you buying a ticket to get gapingly asspounded when the market corrects (and it always corrects). Valuations matter. Profits matter. Don’t just buy into a story based on emotion

10. If you unironically use stocktwits, God save you"

QFIN Digitech 360 is a Chinese fintech specializing in microlending to the 37 billion people in Chyina. They’re transitioning to a capital-light model with much higher margins—in the 40-45% range—and have double digit revenue growth. Additionally, the lending business is taking full advantage of artificial intelligence and data processing platforms and it sounds like they’re trying to become the Palantir of micro credit data presentation.

Supreme sped master Xi recently knocked 40% off the stock after temporarily banning them from the android App Store. They are still on the Apple App Store but before any of you try and do some Peter Lynch self trial DD, their shit is entirely mandarin so good luck. 

Company has a few American MBA guys on their executive team and has Deloitte as an auditor which relieves some of the fraud/scam luckin coffee fears.

Position opened in Dec 2020 around $11 a share and bought all the way up until $25. Took some profits as we hit $40 mark but looking to add after this recent drop.

 This logic is erroneous on a few points:

1. Coinbase customers care more about security than low fees. Even today there are exchanges you can use to save money on trading fees. They're still raking in cash on trading volumes and growing customers and assets on platform. This is going to continue because the coinbase brand carries a lot of trust. At least here in the US, it feels like common knowledge that coinbase is the safest place for your assets, analysts aren't giving them enough credit for this.
2. Coinbase brings more utility to the table than other exchanges. Syncing with their wallet and earn services for example, is starting to feel like being sucked into the Apple ecosystem. It's too damn convenient, users won't leave. If you think they won't continue releasing value-add-services over time then you're just as retarded as your username suggests.
3.  AND MOST IMPORTANTLY; Coinbase isn't just an exchange. They're a tech company, and they're leveraging the work they've done that interacts with the underlying technologies and exposing them as an API; and guess what, they're going to make more money on this in 5 years than their trading fees (so says me). If you believe in the ""internet money"" economy, then you also believe there is a tidal wave of startups around the corner, and that all over the world people will start getting paid with ""internet money"" (instead of gum). If you're an entrepreneur, and especially if you're a developer who values their time, you're not going to work on stuff that's out of scope, you're just going to plug in something you can trust.

I literally haven't seen anyone talking about this, I think investors will wake up to it in the 2nd half of this year.

Maybe after Q2 earnings release if Coinbase cloud revenue is non-zero.

If you haven't listened to the Q1 Earnings call (of course you haven't) you really should.

I really don't see any legitimate competition to Coinbase, there are many exchanges, but Coinbase is building something much more important. In my mind the only real risk facing Coinbase is that the entire ""internet money"" economy never materializes and we just keep using fiat forever.

Tom Lee believes that the S&P 500 index is expected to continue its upward momentum and may surge 9% to 4700 points by the end of the year.

Tom Lee said, “I think FAANG stocks will be out of yield, which means they will have a glorious second half of the year, not because interest rates will fall, but because these great companies have almost nothing in the first half of (2021). Performance. We believe that if the S&P 500 index rises 25% this year and many of these FAANG stocks rise 5%, then they may rise 20% in the second half of the year, which makes their rating become'overweight'.""

FAANG refers to the abbreviation of five large technology stocks, namely Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google's parent company Alphabet.

At the same time, Tom Lee said that core stocks related to the reopening of the economy will be in the best position and are expected to rise further. ""The core sectors (related to the new crown epidemic) will rebound strongly as they are most sensitive to rising interest rates,""

Among them, Tom Lee is most optimistic about energy stocks. He believes that under the circumstances of economic recovery and high demand, oil supply may shrink, which may cause oil prices to continue to rise.

As of the close of trading on July 9, the S&P 500 index was 4,369.55 points, an increase of 1.13%.

ohzght,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ohzght/there_is_no_stopping_oracle_from_hitting_100/,There is no stopping Oracle from Hitting 100$.,3,26,2021-07-11 14:38:04,"$ORCL is currently at all time highs and is breaking out with 3% moves for the past few days. Here's a few reasons why I think this will keep going and if you do not want to miss another MSFT or AMZN, you should buy Oracle.

&#x200B;

1. Oracle is extremely undervalued with a P/E of 19.19 as a Cloud/Software company.  Usually Cloud/Software companies like Microsoft or Google have P/es in the high 30s/40s.
2. Oracle does massive stock buybacks with them announcing a 20 billion stock repurchase plan this year as well as having a dividend yield of 1.46% which is way higher than AAPL or MSFT.
3. Oracle is growing massively with 8% YoY growth from last year yet they are being priced as a boomer company
4. With the recent JEDI news being cancelled now Oracle has a shot of receiving this contract which should also boost stock price.  [https://www.barrons.com/articles/oracle-stock-defense-cloud-contract-51625863023](https://www.barrons.com/articles/oracle-stock-defense-cloud-contract-51625863023)
5. Stocks love round numbers. When was the last time you saw a stock at 80 or 90 and eventually never hit 100? Almost never. Stocks love to hit round numbers.
6. Options are extremely cheap on oracle with them sometimes being less than 10 cents even though the stock is at 80$ currently. This means there is alot of gamma squeeze potential with Oracle as it is extremely cheap to buy OTM options for Oracle and thus force MM's to buy shares.

&#x200B;

Tl;dr: Oracle is an extremely undervalued Cloud/ Software company that is currently breaking out right now with an extremely high chance of hitting 100 very soon. I would recommend buying calls on Oracle as they are currently very cheap with them being a few cents each for OTM calls."

ohe9eh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ohe9eh/critical_value_theory_why_virgin_galactic_spce_is/,Critical Value Theory: Why Virgin Galactic (SPCE) is at bare minimum a $100 Billion company + Monday price prediction,256,400,2021-07-10 15:30:11,"In this DD, I will attempt to prove through overwhelming evidence, historical trends,  market valuation, exponential growth, and more. That Virgin Galactic is criminally undervalued and is truly valued with other big name “potential stocks” while being historically comparable to the commercialization of the plane.


1. What is Virgin Galactic?


Virgin Galactic is an aerospace company that provides human spaceflight for private individuals and researchers. The company is focused on developing a spaceflight system to offer customers a multi-day experience culminating in a spaceflight that includes several minutes of weightlessness and views of earth from space. 

Easily summarized by themselves on their website saying their mission is

“to be the Spaceline for Earth, means we focus on using space for good while delivering an unparalleled customer experience”

They are a company attempting to commercialize space travel for the average person to be able to enjoy a trip to space.

This, by itself doesn’t give the company any value. Due to the unknown factors and ambitcious nature of this mission statement, it is understandable why investors would roll their eyes at the idea of this company and therefore making it not very valuable. 

However, due to the way Virgin Galactic is conducting itself and the way it presents itself as the first real attempt at making a commercial space traveling company, I believe this company has the potential to become one of the biggest travel line stocks in the world.


2. The market’s value system


Lets say hypothetically, within a certain sector, there was a subsection that only accounted for roughly 2% of the overall sector, and company A contributed 79% to said subsection. 

Now, it would be logical to assume that even though company A controls 79% of its subsection, it wouldn’t be a big player, as it’s entire subsection consists of only 2% of the overall sector. 

But what if I told you, that company A was in fact the largest company in its entire sector at a current market cap of 632 Billion dollars, and the runner up Company B, accounting for roughly 10% of all sells in the entire sector only had a current market cap of 248 Billion dollars.

As I’m sure you’ve guessed by now, this isn’t hypothetical. Company B is Toyota and Company A is Tesla.

Tesla. A company that controls a small subsection in the overall car market, has extremely low sale compared to other car manufacturers, and has never turned a profit off selling cars is over 2 times more valuable then the next runner up. Why?

While you could ague it’s valuation a hundred different ways from retail interest to the overall Bull market. Simply put, Tesla is valued so highly for 1 major reason. Their potential.

You can debate whether or not it’s rational, but it’s safe to say the market right now values a company primarily on its sector’s projected growth and the company’s own potential.

While Tesla is the most drastic example, almost all the big technology companies are valued similarly. 

Apple is the largest company in the world because of the belief in their potential to continuously innovate in news ways that drastically change their entire sector. 

Amazon is almost universal rated a buy by most top analysts due to the potential they have in becoming a modern monopoly.

Modern Criteria Value, is based not necessarily on current fundamentals and value, but the perceived potential a company has to grow within its sector.


3. Virgin Galactic’s exponential potential

On January 1st, 1914 the first ever commercial plane flew from St. Petersburg, Florida to Tampa, Florida. While not realized much at the time, this one flight would led to the creation 
of the multi trillion dollar industry that is modern day airlines.

And now, with interest in space travel at an all time high, and test flights like the one this upcoming Sunday making it more of a reality, one has to ask. 

What’s stopping history from repeating itself, and what will happen when investors realize this exponential market Space itself could potentially become. As Virgin Galactic push’s to make itself the number one most valuable space company, past private companies like SpaceX (with a market cap estimated to be 75 billion), the potential in this extremely lucrative future market will soon be realized by investors as they continue to look for huge potential stocks.




As far as Monday’s flight is concerned, how successful it is and the announcement afterwards are secondary for Monday’s price.

The main determinant in Monday’s price action will be how Virgin Galactic’s flight is portrayed by the media.

If it is portrayed poorly, or average. We will most likely see a rough sell off.

However, I personally believe will see an image of hope and excitement painted, As the media proclaims this to be a great leap for humanity as a whole (over exaggerating for attention).

In this case, we will see a massive run on Monday, with consolidation later in the week followed by more soaring.




I hope you enjoyed reading my personal take on the overall situation regarding $SPCE. And I wish all of you a good evening."

The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe).

(Could be a the powerhouse of China) Bonus: why you shouldn’t be worried about Chinese Regulators,4,31,2021-07-08 21:53:59,"CICC just upgraded to $69 per share because they believe NIO will sell 70,000 ET7s alone. Not counting the 3 SUVs they already sell 

NIO makes it to where customers pay a subscription for their battery so they can save around 8k and not worry about Battery degregation. As a customer you pay a monthly subscription for this service. You can also just buy the battery 

Battery Swapping: China has over 600 battery swap stations (I Believe).
80% of ppl in China live in Apts so having your own charger is pretty tough. (This was proven by multiple Chinese YouTubers who own Tesla’s, XPENGs, NIOs ect. 

China is also a sleeping E-commerce giant. NIO life products selling out in Minutes, they sell food, clothing, bags, all high quality. They’re wanting to change the view on Chinese quality. (NIOs are actually built with the best metals when compared to Tesla and others. (Respect to Tesla tho, they’re amazing) 

NIO vehicle margin: 21%+ compare that to other automakers and you’ll see why NIO is priced the way it is. Future earnings will be insane when they’re selling more vehicles 

NIO’s cult like following: William Li( NIO CEO) believes the culture of the company is most important. Sort of like Apple. Hundreds and thousands of Chinese NIO owners act the same way as American Tesla owners. Posting And what not. Also helping deliver cars etc. 

NIO continues to sell more vehicles every quarter by a ton. 

Just look up NIO house if you have no idea what it is. 

On Chinese Regulation: China doesn’t go for companies trying to get big. They go for Giants that are already at the top like Baba and Didi. Didi owns 90% of the ridesharing market. NIO has been backed by the Chinese Govt, something we haven’t seen much of before. China already claims it plans on being the EV powerhouse of China, why would they screw themselves?"

# Introduction (and Reese):

***As promised--Reese Freakin Witherspoon*** 😍(more why she matters and how it relates in just a quckie)

https://preview.redd.it/lc3xax597z971.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed6c378c6fc536a8161795394eac1313015fd5d8

Boomer's love it, you use it, your wife uses it to call her boyfriend, and we all need it: yes, an iPhone with 5G fresh dividend delivering cell service. **$T,** also known as AT&T, is a telecommunications service provider valued at over $171.8 billion. $T made headlines recently for the announcement of the media merger/spinoff/conglomoreate/absolute market share take over with Discovery last month.

Discovery--yeah, this one, remember?

https://preview.redd.it/vkwj4fra7z971.png?width=1462&format=png&auto=webp&s=755f4ad3a397674a5e119ef1cdc53eeb73228249

Prior to the Discovery deal, AT&T paid an annual dividend of $2.08 per share, putting the stock's dividend yield at 6.45%. After the deal, they upped it to 7.23%, it isn't much when we make 1000% on what were about to discover, but remember, Boomers. Love. Dividends. a lot. You know what Boomers hate? Meme stocks. $T is a Boomer Stock, and once this fuckin rocket boomerang takes off, the 66 year old in retirement will tell all his buddies at the croquet club, and they will soak it all up, all of it. In fact, they will laugh in our faces and say: ""**that's why Warren told you to hold good stocks that pay dividends.""** Meanwhile, they don't know that we were the ones who really discovered the rocket ship fueling up on the launch pad.

# The 200k OI for 7/16 calls:

Around 14:00 on 7/7/21 I was watching options flows and noticed massive amounts of $T options buying activity. I didn't think anything of it, but they kept rolling in:

This led me to dig deeper. I went to look at the option chain chart, and ***holy shit.***

https://preview.redd.it/n1rh2rkg7z971.png?width=1180&format=png&auto=webp&s=b61a69b0f090e752053e879d312b58a17f415a05

I didn't want to believe it, and thought it was probably some guy on WSB YOLO'ing. But then I went further, and what the actual fuck, it keeps going. All the way until September 17, 2021.

https://preview.redd.it/ulttb6xh7z971.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac89a1a1274ee0a1fd9d5935e65c042a798d624f

I still didn't want to believe it. Then I went digging further and stumbled upon *Bae*, and there she was.

https://preview.redd.it/4tfk4joj7z971.png?width=1832&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d8420ce4b486b48a4793d81df2c171764c2829a

Reese Witherspoon owns Hello Sunshine, a media company that produces your wifes favorite late night binge with her BF-Big Little Lie's, Little Fire's Everywhere, The Morning Show, yeah, heard of them? I thought so.

""*The company began pursuing a sale in recent months after receiving interest from multiple suitors including Apple Inc., one of the people said. People close to the situation say the company could be valued at as much $1 billion in a deal.*

*Hello Sunshine is working with investment bankers as it explores its options, the people familiar with the matter say.""*

# $T owns a stake in Hello Sunshine through its 2018 purchase of Otter Media. Emerson Collective, the philanthropic organization founded by Laurene Powell Jobs, also owns a stake.

Do I need to say it again: $T + Hello Sunshine + **Laurene Powell Jobs**

# Laurene Powell Jobs. STEVE JOBS WIDOW. (R.I.P. Steve <3)

In case you didn't know, $AAPL buys a company roughly every three to four weeks. Usually smaller companies, but none the less, still taking market share and slinging iPhones to TikTok'ers

https://preview.redd.it/nqyao9jo7z971.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=86aa5c965a442754a296ae496c01c744ba46554b

**$AAPL bought Beats in 2014 for $3 billion**. A massive deal that changed the way we listen to Tupac and look at fly honeys at the gym. Hello Sunshine's deal is at a valuation of over **$1 billion.** This is fucking huge for $T. It means that $T will not only own Shark Week, Naked and Afraid, but also **ALL** of HBO, and now **ALL** Sunshine Media Company's huge hits. **ALONG WITH A FUCKING DEAL WITH $AAPL. BOOMERS WILL EAT THIS UP, ABSOLUTELY DEMOLISH IT AT THE TENNIS CLUB.** Once this deal is set, it's off to the races, and it's happening FAST, get on the $T rocket cause it's fueling up in Tim Apple's front yard.

https://preview.redd.it/l3j00bxr7z971.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4cf7c22c8410af1cedeac329fa2dda05357b3b1

TLDR; **$T has over 201,240 OI on 7/16 $30c and 143,000 OI on 9/17 $30c. Reese Witherspoon owns a bitchin company ALONG WITH STEVE JOBS WIDOW-Laurene Powell Jobs, that is looking to be bought out by $AAPL AND IS CURRENTLY IN TALKS FOR A DEAL. THIS COULD HAPPEN FAST.**"

ofcwca,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofcwca/why_bidens_infrastructure_plan_is_not_a_ticket_to/,Why Biden's Infrastructure Plan is NOT a ticket to tendie town,317,191,2021-07-07 13:53:42,"Im an engineer, but Im also an idiot.  I literally almost flunked out cuz i was too dumb. I ended up in construction because i couldnt do anything else engineering related.  Take this opinion at your own risk because I might be talking out of my ass.  

I'm in construction, specifically on the municipality side (yea im *that* city worker) so I'm the one administering the federal infrastructure funds at the ground level. To date I've administered millions in federal funds on ""infrastructure"". Infrastructure is by definition the least sexiest thing.  Everyone shits, but we'd all prefer to not deal with it, that's infrastructure.  Here are a bunch of very common sense reasons why this isnt going to cash in. 

* I see a lot of posts about steel, concrete and other raw materials.  Clearly these are from people who know fuck all about infrastructure.  I'd argue that if you're looking to invest into Biden's infrastructure plan you should be looking at the other end of this supply chain.  Who do you think is more profitable, the no name company that supplies the raw material for 1 component of an iphone or Apple? If youre looking to jump onto the infrastructure bandwagon, I'd be looking at construction companies or engineering firms.
* But companies are also not a great bet. contractors and trades are specialized.  The company that paves the street is not the same one that does traffic signal upgrades.  An electrician is not going to do laborers work.  Large companies will need(either by choice or requirement) to subcontract out certain specialized portions thus diluting overall tendies. not to mention that profits are capped.  markup % is often literally defined.  ""Oh no Mr. Contractor you have a problem?  fuck you, sucks to be you"" (this is one of my favorite parts of the job). Not to mention that projects are parsed to all the states and from there into certain sizes in order to further dilute the tendies.  State and local governments may have additional requirements that even further dilute the tendies.  The government is trying boost an industry and the economy at large, not a few companies.  The literal idea of the plan is to trickle money across the country.  If you look at this fountain that slowly trickles down, if you place your cup in any one spot you're just gonna get a few drops. 
* Infrastructure means nothing because it means everything.  It could be streetlight poles in which case steel is very very relevant, or it could be a fucking sidewalk in which case steel is not important at all. If you just open your eyes when you go outside (huge ask i know) you will see that infrastructure is extremely varied. 
* Many of us with ties to the industry are feeling delays and back orders, but this is logistics related.  These issues were around before the infra plan and will remain after. I think the idea behind these ""DDs"" on raw materials is because they think this infrastructure plan will increase demand on an already limited supply thus driving prices and profits up.  Nevermind the contracting aspect of this money(a lot of it is fixed for a certain amount of time), Supply and demand still rules, but solving the global supply chain logistics will also increase supply. The supply chain logistical issues are a larger and more importantly, independent, factor.  
* Also surprise surprise Biden's infrastructure plan, while maybe bigger, isnt special. Trump had infrastructure plans and so did Obama.  Infrastructure is ALWAYS happening.  As i said, everyone shits and it doesnt stop.  Infrastructure never stops, you can try to clench your sphincter closed and it'll work for a lil while, but eventually you shit.  Its the same thing with infrastructure spending.  Biden's plan is not the big demand surge people think it is. 
* I think a lot of people underestimate the timescale of infrastructure.  it takes time to build shit and it takes even more time to renovate shit cuz you cant just blow it up and start over. Most people cannot shit on command and those that can dont do it instantly. This aint China.  We're not gonna build a covid hospital in 48 hours( mostly cuz our work isnt made out of garbage tofu-strength concrete but that is another topic). This shit is going to take YEARS. I will see Biden infrastructure money at my level 1-2 years from now and will start spending it 3-5 years from now. Think about this, after the money is secured someone gotta design the damn thing, someone gotta the draw the picture so my dumbass who cant read can knows what is supposed to be built.  Those assholes always fuck up too and they are the smart ones!!!  This isnt even mentioning how raw material suppliers, product suppliers, construction companies, design firms, are only a part of this timescale. 
* One dude can only use 1 shovel at at time, can operate one piece of equipment at a time. The pipe maker can only make pipes so fast and those pipes can only be installed so fast.  There is no exponential factor in infrastructure like there is in tech.  An app can be downloaded millions of times in a single night. You only shit one poop at a time. 

Tl;dr.  Infrastructure is like pooping. Everyone does it, it is always happening. Trying to cash in on infrastructure is trying to cash in on pooping. You can only poop so fast and so much, the supply demand is capped. You only shit one poop at a time.  Sure you get diarrhea sometimes but even then it has its limits. You cant cash in on analogous dry heaves. Infrastructure is regular, so in the long term investing in this industry is probably a smart move.  As long as humans are alive they are going to shit and if there are more humans tomorrow than there are today then there will be more shit, but if that is your tendie making strategy why are you even here?"

PUBM has been a name that has been floating around for a few weeks now, usually in the context of its high short interest. As we dug into the name further, we were pleasantly surprised to find out that this company is not dog-shit, is not failing, nor is it in a dying industry (as most of the other short interest plays that will remain unnamed), but a thriving company in an accelerating industry. This post will guide you through how we stumbled on the name, the company and its financials, the industry, the short-interest, and the plan. There are several angles of attack here, enough for everyone to get their grubby little hands dirty: traders, investors and gamblers. A summary:

&#x200B;

* Clean financials, with earnings beat and raised guidance
* Undervalued compared to peers
* Secular tailwinds as digital advertising expands
* Dual class share structure which disincentivize insider selling
* High short interest (anywhere from 20%-50% as of 6/24)
* High institutional ownership (74%)
* Small float with tight liquidity
* Bottoming chart pattern with reversal
* Options chain initiation on 6/25 - with more strikes to be added imminently

Plan: Shares for the conservative players. Options - the chain is limited because options were just introduced - pound any and all strikes - with focus on the longer-dated.

Disclaimer: Multiple people have contributed to this report, and most have shares in the $30 range when the idea of this play was first conceived.

**The Origins and Chart Analysis**

What caught our interest originally, was a volume scan. After market close on 6/7, $PUBM showed up on a scanner looking for relative volume increases. This is a scan I use a lot, as it’s a good way to follow the whales as they tip their hand when scaling into a position. When you see big volume moves (over the relative average), but little price movement, it’s usually a sign of institutional accumulation. The big players piece into positions slowly as not to price themselves out with a massive market order. In the case of $PUBM, despite a 3x volume spike, price only increased a modest 5%. These moves are often signs of trend reversals when an institution slams its wizard staff into the ground and says, “You shall not pass!”. The last three weeks have seen the most shares traded in $PUBM’s history - even more than when $PUBM IPO’d in December of 2020.

In addition to accumulation volume, the PUBM chart is a perfect example of both types of head and shoulder patterns (topping H & S, and bottoming inverse H & S) - see Chart 1. The original H & S called out the top, and now we see an inverse head and shoulders formed, which is typically a signal of a bottoming, reversal pattern. The breakout was rejected at the original “neckline” of the topping pattern, and retested the breakout point on 7/2/21 - and has held. This is the beginning of a text-book trend-reversal breakout. The chart setup is a buy.  But what is it we’re buying?

**So What Exactly is Pubmatic?**

In short, Pubmatic is an advertising technology company. For most of human history, business owners have been using ads to sell their products, inform their customers of a value proposition, or build brands. With the advent of the internet, “adtech” companies like Google have grown rich and powerful by allowing advertisers to communicate with any type of customer they want, virtually instantaneously, as much as they want. No other form of advertising offers these features and as such, the digital advertising market has become *extremely* complex with hundreds of billions of dollars on the line every year. This trend toward digital advertising is expected to continue (figure 1):

Figure 1 - Digital ad spending worldwide

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e5zfu5zk4l971.png?width=520&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cd713dbe7aad803d15b4b88c393138caede80a9

Pubmatic operates and competes in this space, specifically programmatic advertising. Before programmatic, digital ads were bought and sold by teams of people on either side of the equation, which was slow and cumbersome. Now there are scores of companies that have built software and infrastructure that allows digital ad space to be traded programmatically. The market share of programmatic advertising as part of all digital advertising has been on the rise (figure 2):

Figure 2 - market share of programmatic advertising

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bh073a1m4l971.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9444f4c9a7635ea35bfcd5b0cd76bdaef28c397c

Since Pubmatic is a programmatic ad company – it is benefiting from these two tailwinds: more ads are becoming digital and more digital ads are becoming programmatic.

Programmatic channels primarily have two sides to them: the buy side and the sell side. At a basic level, publishers generate revenue by selling digital ad space on their content, and advertisers/marketing agencies will purchase this ad space to place an ad in front of a potential customer.

Pubmatic is an SSP or supply side platform. Publishers will integrate and configure Pubmatic’s software to allow for the transactions to take place. Publishers want the best outcomes possible for their ad slots, so more often than not, they’ll integrate with multiple SSPs in an effort to increase their overall yield. I can’t stress this enough: the programmatic ad market is so complex, I would be willing to bet that a single person couldn’t wrap their head around the whole thing. It is mountainous in size. **Trillions and trillions** of programmatic ads are served up across advertising verticals, across global markets, and across billions of devices every month. Any sizable publisher that wants to efficiently sell their inventory at scale must work with an SSP and compete in the broader programmatic ad market.

Needless to say, most digital channels continued to grow as people spent more time inside and on their devices. Pubmatic’s revenue continued to grow YoY as overall advertising spend took a big hit (due to COVID). The most exciting part about this is that global ad spend is projected to return to its normal growth pattern – you can see this already taking place in figure 3.

Figure 3 - Global Advertising Forecast

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fxd9zrum4l971.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd922d833a0f3c6224f29144a3f9d59a3699e434

So not only did Pubmatic gain a greater share of the total advertising dollars in 2020, the overall advertising pie is going to grow as well. This rebound in ad spend is yet another tailwind for Pubmatic. If you’re keeping count – that makes three so far:

1. More ads are becoming digital
2. More digital ads are becoming programmatic
3. More overall ad spend in the future

**Shut up and talk about the short interest!**

Since short interest is what all the kids talk about these days, that was where we headed to next. In addition to looking at squeeze probability, it is good to know if a company is highly shorted. Most short-sellers know their stuff (except maybe Melvin), and if a company is highly shorted, it’s usually for a reason. $PUBM has short interest that is estimated as high as 50% in some places. We actually believe this to be an inflation due to a quirk in the public float involving share types, which the aggregators such as Bloomberg and others haven’t caught on to yet (will explain later). There is a chance we are incorrect about this, but according to our calculations, the short interest is closer to the 20% mark - which of course, is still very high. Price peaked at $77 during the first week in March, and shorts have hammered it ever since. The question is, why?

**The insider lockup**

Like most newly IPO’d companies, there was an insider share lockup. These insider shares were mostly of the class B variety; these were shares awarded to VC firms and investors that have been with the company since its inception in 2008. PUBM announced during the Spring that those insiders with class B shares (of which there are 40+ million of), were free to sell as of 6/1. While we don’t know if this is what short-sellers had in mind, it is probably a safe bet. A similar situation happened to PLTR a few months back when they had their own insider lockup expiration. So the next question is…

**Did the insiders sell?**

Some did, but not many. It is estimated that roughly 4-6M class B insider shares have been sold - only one firm has liquidated, the other big players are still in. Why are they still in the game? $PUBM has an interesting quirk in their share and voting structure where class B shareholders hold a 10:1 voting advantage over the class A (public float) holders. Their one class B share gets 10 votes per share, vs our 1 vote per class A share. If you want to still retain voting power within the company, you really do not want to sell your class B shares. Furthermore, if class B shareholders sell, it consolidates the voting power of the remaining class B shareholders. Why this is important is because everytime a class B share is sold, it converts to a class A public share; this is what is missing when everyone talks about the short interest. Some of these class B holders have sold, converting their shares into class A and thus increasing the public float, and diluting the short interest. However, most insiders have held - and will most likely continue to hold if they still want a voting stake within the company. Worth noting is that two of the biggest holders, VC firms Nexus India Capital and August Capital, both have seats on the Board of Directors - so it is unlikely that they will sell a meaningful amount any time soon. So the lockup has come and gone without too much damage - share price bottomed out and has now increased. Why else would someone be short?

**The privacy wave**

Consumer data has been called the oil of our generation. All of the data that is generated on your devices is sold, recorded, and analyzed. Companies do this in order to serve you targeted ads based on your spending habits and characteristics. In the past, all of this has been done without the full knowledge or consent of the end user (you). Once people started to realize just how far the tracking had gone, governments and individuals started to demand better privacy from adtech companies. Apple has been leading this effort across the board since privacy has become part of their brand image. Agencies and advertisers have become drunk off of readily available third party consumer data and as the privacy wave makes its way across the world, we’re going to see less third party data available to advertisers.

Last year, Google said they would start phasing out browsers from accepting the third-party cookies that help advertisers, publishers and data brokers profile you to help advertisers target ads toward you. The change would prevent an adtech company  (PUBM) that recorded your visit to a trading website from later showing you ads for that stupid day trader guy with long red hair and a beard (I know you’ve seen those ads before). This in effect would hinder all adtech companies from doing what they do.

But this dropped two days ago (6/23)

[https://www.cnet.com/news/google-delays-chromes-cookie-blocking-privacy-plan-by-nearly-2-years/](https://www.cnet.com/news/google-delays-chromes-cookie-blocking-privacy-plan-by-nearly-2-years/)

Google delayed this cookie phasing out until 2023 so the show goes on (Leo trading gif).

**But cookies ARE eventually going away, right?**

The adtech industry is addressing this with the use of identifiers, typically in the form of hashed email addresses or phone numbers that are collected upfront from the end users. Pubmatic has been working vigorously on getting these identifiers put in place through the use of their identity hub product, which is identifier agnostic. There is a lot of speculation surrounding which of these identifiers will end up winning, but since Pubmatic can integrate with any of them, they don’t much care which one wins out in the end. Pubmatic’s management will need to keep a close eye on the privacy developments as they move forward, because the sunset of the third party cookie won’t be the only problem. That said, the adtech industry is notoriously finicky, and Pubmatic has been able to keep up with the times. Management has repeatedly said that they take a long term approach toward their investments, and I expect them to continue to be able to deliver value to publishers and agencies as these investments like Identity Hub pay out. While the privacy wave is a headwind, Pubmatic has been working on addressing it for years now. In aggregate, Pubmatic has a lot more going for it than against it. Next stop… financials.

**Financials.**

*Revenue acceleration* (% are YoY growth rates - from right to left) :

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xatm11bo4l971.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=7309e0ed0a96f48232d5cdf267a3105088e86241

I’ve seen this sort of thing in the past (Etsy, Livongo, The Trade Desk for example) where a company finds its stride. This revenue growth is twice that of the larger industry, so we can assume that Pubmatic has indeed found its stride and is gaining market share. Management has echoed this sentiment.

One important risk to note is that Verizon Media accounts for 20% of their total revenue (taken from their first quarter prepared remarks):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ykm8t4at4l971.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=08551f2ffad273a1601db701fe558a671e050064

It’s good that this percentage has been coming down as they gain market share, but we’ll want to keep an eye on that over time to make sure it continues to trend in the right direction. Also the partnership is growing over time - this is an example of SSP consolidation.

*Gross Profit:*

Pubmatic operates with a high gross margin, as you would expect from a cloud-based software company. Their gross profit has also been trending upwards, so they are gaining more efficiency as they develop. Their long term gross margin target is 70%, which has already been achieved.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dc70fn7s4l971.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83f35e2160b8e1fe72a6a7265dddf7c7c16258bb

*Net Income:*

What’s more, their 2020 net profit fell in line with a highly efficient cloud computing company.

Wall Street analysts aren’t predicting their profitability properly. If we assume a 20% net margin on $200 million in revenue for 2021, earnings per share is going to be 81 cents based on 49 million outstanding. Current estimates are only showing a high estimate of 38 cents per share, much lower than what should be achievable for Pubmatic. They’ve already handily beat earnings for Q1 so they are well on their way toward the \~80 cents figure. If they can hit these numbers, **their PEG stands at .63** at the time of writing.

&#x200B;

*Financial summary:*

Pubmatic is a highly profitable company, in a growth industry, that is stealing market share, and has **no debt**. Wall Street is underestimating them, while trading at a lower valuation than competitors ([https://twitter.com/HsSajwani/status/1403342066445283330/photo/1](https://twitter.com/HsSajwani/status/1403342066445283330/photo/1)).

**In closing**

We don’t know why anyone would be short this company. Maybe there is something under the hood that we are not privy to, but we only know what’s publicly available, and everything looks really clean. I suspect shorts are closing - there’s no reason not to. But the beauty of this potential play is you can attack this from multiple angles. Want to play the short squeeze? Go ahead - it’s a possibility. Want to play the value investor? That works too - Pubmatic is undervalued compared to its peers. How about growth? The digital advertising industry is accelerating, and PUBM is still trading at levels below its valuation.  How about a market mechanics liquidity play (see the bonus section)? Want to play the chart? Easy reversal pattern and ride that trend with the accompanying volume.

Bottom line is, most trading opportunities offer one or two avenues for profitability - PUBM has lots of different pathways for success - pick a path that suits your risk tolerance and hope the market doesn’t shit itself.

A wise trader once told me,

“You can either trade for justice, or for profit, but not both”.

Pubmatic may just offer the rare opportunity to trade for both.

**The plan**

Shares and the limited calls are what’s recommended for now. As some of you may have noticed, PUBM did not have an options chain up until 6/25. Some limited strike prices have been added, but still not enough. Pound ‘em and make our friendly brokerages add more. PUBM managed to get to $77 without the aid of options leverage so I see no reason why a revisit of that price is unattainable by summer’s end with the company and industry tailwinds. Considering that any case for shorting PUBM has been removed, it appears a new trend is starting. Where things may get a little spicy is in the bonus section - and it is in regards to the restricted liquidity.

**Bonus section - “if it ain’t tight, it ain’t right”**

The liquidity for PUBM is very, very tight. If you’ve been watching the intraday movements at all, you’ll notice a barren orderbook, with share bid/ask spreads routinely above $.50, and sometimes even in the dollar range. Exacerbating the already restricted float is the high institutional ownership - which currently sits at 74%. With most of the shares sitting in the coffers of big players, there aren’t many shares exchanging hands on a day-to-day basis - which makes for wild price swings.  What makes this interesting is that as mentioned in the paragraph above - options were just introduced as of 2 weeks ago. This is very unusual for a $1.5B market cap company that has been traded for over 6 months. Only minimal strike prices and dates have been added thus far, with more additions anticipated. The more strikes that get added, and the more OTM call bombs that people lob PUBM’s way, the more interesting and volatile things can get. I say again, PUBM accelerated into the 70’s after IPO, without the aid of options dynamite. With the company and industry headwinds dulled for now, sprinkle in the FD leverage and anyone short should probably pack up their bag, cash in their tickets, and GTFO.

Trade responsibly and good luck!

(Kidding, [u/TheTendilorian](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheTendilorian/) did fantastic work and you can find their post on $AMD financials rightttttttttt: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe88ub/amd_su_bae_witness_me/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).

$AMD is easily my fav stock and I'm perpetually bullish on it, however there's a lot of catalysts that will have effects on $AMD both negative and positive at all stages. I'm not passing this on as financial advice, just my opinions:

**Chip Shortage**

This one is the most significant situation in regards to semiconductors and the wider tech industry. In many cases it helps the bullish argument since $AMD (and[ also $NVDA](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nvda/earnings) but fuckem) continues to exceed earnings estimates despite the rough environment. The[ expansion of $TSMC into America](https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmc-says-construction-has-started-arizona-chip-factory-2021-06-01/), in my opinion, is going to launch $AMD into the fuckin' stratosphere over the next couple of years. Though still based in Taiwan, TSMC is one of the biggest players in global semiconductor production. As of March, $AMD was [“TSMC’s number one customer in regard to purchasing 7nm wafers”](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-overtakes-Apple-as-TSMC-s-main-7nm-customer.528532.0.html).

Additionally, let’s talk about the economic giant we call China. I’m an International Relations student so this is right up my ~~asshole~~ alley. While current President Biden has mentioned reversing some of the hardline policies of his predecessor President Trump, however there has been little evidence of progress towards that goal. Two weeks ago, the Biden Administration [blocked an attempt by a Chinese firm to purchase Korean chip manufacturer *Magnachip*](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/06/22/biden-semiconductors-south-korea-china-trade-war/). A small company, sure, but we can extrapolate this stance to assume that TSMC could be off limits to Chinese acquisition in the future if the US and Taiwan can come to a formal agreement. Who knows how long this US-China measuring contest will go on, but the evidence suggests to me that it would not drastically affect the prices of semiconductor companies.

Being the massive pussy that I am though, I'm concerned about how an impending crash will impact overall liquidity and the supply and demand of semiconductor chips,[ which computing technology consumes about 1/3 of](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/devices/how-and-when-the-chip-shortage-will-end-in-4-charts). But obviously if we all lose our homes, we would have bigger fish to fry than worrying about $AMD share price.

**Innovation**

I'm an avid PC gamer. I literally have nothing going on other than my Steam account and my Fidelity account. This is (not) a cry for help. IMO, $NVDA has the best net technology for GPUs. However $AMD offers more consumer-friendly products. I believe that $AMD cards offer the best value per dollar paid. (Unless you're one of those idiots paying 5 grand for a graphics card. I mean c’mon, you can watch Pornhub Premium without an RTX 3080.) This catalyst is just going to be driven by overall consumer sentiment. If people begin realizing that their value is better spent on $AMD graphics cards, that[ market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/754557/worldwide-gpu-shipments-market-share-by-vendor/) is gonna be gobbled the fuck up. Oh and processors? Yeah, $INTC is a piece of shit that I'm not concerned with. No source, just facts. Kidding, here’s some cool charts [comparing processor performance](https://www.tomshardware.com/features/amd-vs-intel-cpus):

I won’t lie, the new i9 5.1 GHz is an absolute beast, but the difference is almost negligible compared to the Ryzens, which are priced lower.

**$NVDA Stock Split 20 June 2021**

Fuckin' $NVDA... always raining on the $AMD parade. I'm not angry, just disappointed. This stock split is actually pretty insignificant. Does this change any of the fundamentals between the two? Fuck no. Am I looking forward to it? Eh. Is there a point to me including this section? Kinda! As [u/TheTendilorian](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheTendilorian/) said to me, $AMD is a bit of a “late-bloomer” compared to $NVDA which can be seen as the current titan of the GPU space. I expect the price of $NVDA post-split (1:4) to be somewhere between $150 and $250 just based on previous prices and my exceptional arithmetic skills. While this is still above $AMD stock price, I think it will be easier to perform comparative technical analysis between the two companies when the prices are closer. Compare that with the fundamentals I wrote about earlier and you have got one bullish ass stock.

**Price Outlook**

If I was Michael Burry and had enough coke and psilocybin I would tell you guys the price target a year from now. But I'm a broke college student with no coke and only a little shrooms, so it's whatever.

\- Short term I'm playing AMD calls pretty close to the chest. Currently holding 7/9 $95c and 8/20 $100c. I roll up or down depending on how the week has gone. $AMD has been trading sideways since the run-up last June with a high of $99.23 and a solid floor around $72-$73. For a quick swing of shares I try to enter anywhere under $80 and exit above… let’s call it $86.50. As of now, I’m looking out for an announcement stating the date of the Q2 earnings call (I’m guessing August) and I’m looking for $AMD to continue its run and retest $95 before a post-earnings dip.

I’ve charted pivot points for our current trading range as follows:

$85.57

$86.10

Psychological resistance at whole values between $87 and $93.

$93.55

$95

ATH of 99.23

[Here's what my $AMD chart currently looks like](https://preview.redd.it/wvvxr1105h971.png?width=1039&format=png&auto=webp&s=218b06ed3e405ab02dea6a7770212d2bb15f1d69)

\- Mid-term? I don't fucking know, get back to me if the market crashes. If not, 6-12months out, $100-$120 with a floor around $85-$90 just based on how we've been growing and the fact that resistance->support. As mentioned I’m expecting a bit of a pullback soon since tech has been absolutely soaring the last two weeks, but seeing $85-$90 turn into support is not unreasonable in the near future. Honestly I’m much more uncertain about mid-term compared to short or long time frames.

\- Long term: $NVDA levels. I believe with all my heart that $AMD is the better company and should be valued as such. They are a company that continues to exceed expectations and make great connections in the computing industry. For shares I would just buy and hold until I retire. (Mod who reviewed my post in its baby stages told me that “buy and hold” was a questionable term to use. I’ve heard the term “investing” passed around other subreddits but hell if I know what that means.)

**Bottom Line**

Me and my good pal Tendo heavily believe in this company, as I’m sure many others do. No price target if I’m going to take a 1+ yr position. Under $80 if I’m going for a swing trade that will last one month or less.

So yeah, that's about it. Great DD[ u/TheTendilorian](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheTendilorian/). $AMD to the moon, not a financial advisor, blah-blah-blah. Who wants to see me lose half my portfolio this week? (Again.)"
oehww2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oehww2/nio_a_trillion_dollar_company_heres_whydd_with_a/,NIO - a trillion dollar company. Here’s why…(DD with a sprinkle of formulated opinion),195,131,2021-07-06 06:29:02,"This company is revolutionary, not just on products but it’s service.

Have any of you even seen NIO day and the enormous mass following on this company? Its walking in the footsteps of Apple. There are some people VOLUNTEERING to be a part of this. 

From its beginnings NIO has established epic foundations. Winning formula E and developing a super car (EP9) holding a lap record around the Nurburgring, more than once, might I add. Take a look at NIO House in Beijing - it is the epitome of what NIO represents. It’s a lifestyle beyond the car. 

NIO cars will soon have a 1000km solid state battery and incase that isn’t enough then feel free to visit one of the 300+ battery swap stations (increasing every day), 300000 fast charging stations over multiple cities in China or simply use power home 2.0. A swap station will have a fully charged battery in your car in 3minutes. They have now competed well over TWO MILLION SWAPS! This tech, while slower to scale than super chargers, is exactly what the EV market is lacking. This is one the greatest stigmas for EV, having to WAIT on your battery charging and worry about degradation. Imagine the continued scope for new service plans and flowing revenues with this model. EYE WATERING. You can walk into a NIO Space and save yourself 11k straight off the bat. We live in a subscription generation folks. Oh, and don’t forget a healthy tapped 2nd hand car market. Encore - Sinopec. 

As for the new ET7 sedan - Nio Partnered with NVIDIA to put their DRIVE Orin-powered supercomputer dubbed ADAM into their car. This supercomputer, will feature four high performance Orin SoCs in each of its EVs to achieve an industry leading performance of 1,000+ TOPS!!  Let  me translate: that’s equivalent to 7, yes you read that correctly - SEVEN -Tesla FSD computers. 

A total of 11 8MP cameras, a 1,550nm LiDAR sensor, five mmWaveRad, 12 USS and two GPS / IMU as well as one V2X and one A.D.M.S sensor are installed in the NIO ET7.

Aquila, is the name for the first high resolution camera (8 MP) that is installed in the vehicle. In comparison, Tesla uses a 1.2 MP camera. The higher resolution and display enables the NIO ET7 to recognize objects and obstacles at a greater distance and to let the system react accordingly. NIO underpins this with numbers, so the system is able to recognize vehicles at a distance of 687 meters; Tesla at 229 meters. Traffic cones would be seen at a distance of 262 meters (Tesla 87 meters) and people at a distance of 223 meters (Tesla 74 meters).

As I said before, you also buy into a service as much as a car with NIO. LIFETIME FREE ROAD SIDE ASSISTANCE. LIFE TIME FREE CAR CONNECTIVITY. UNLIMITED ON THE SPOT TYRE REPAIR AND BACKUP CHARGING CALL OUTS. LIFETIME WARRANTY WITH NO MILEAGE LIMITS. Oh, did I mention NIO house? What’s Tesla doing? **tumbleweed**

As for the market - do any of you truly understand how underpinning the success of a company is with the power of the Asian market? It’s ENORMOUS. It’s economy is now bigger than America, 30-40% of Tesla cars are sold here and with good reason. The demand is unprecedented. The supply simply can’t meet it. There’s room for both but Nio will dominate China and make waves in Europe and America. Heck, it would be immensely great with the Asian market alone. They now have over 1.5million active users on the NIO app, which was recently ranked No. 1 with the highest score of 4.5 stars on a list among 20 other mainstream automakers. This is a beautiful community. NIOs relations executive - Chavin Shens thoughts: “Buying a car is a less frequent activity than taking a flight or shopping at a supermarket. So we need to create more everyday activities to keep customers in touch.”

Loyalty and rewards, my friends. 

Tesla is severely lacking in build quality. Off-set panelling, windows not fitted properly, seats that wear down faster than toilet paper and some dodgy paint jobs along the way. JAC motors builds NIO cars and they are well renowned for quality being associated with VW. NIO has research and development, design, manufacturing and offices in San Jose, Munich, London, Shanghai as well as eight other locations. They are employing and working with some of the greatest talent on this planet. Kris Tomasson - NIO VP of design - This guy was literally a global director at Coca Cola. GLOBAL. AND the Head of exterior design at BMW. What a complete powerhouse (no pun intended). 

BTW - Yes, NIO isn’t Tesla. NIO is taking on its own completely different stance. It’s NIO within its own right. 

Believe or not I do love Tesla, I’m a massive fan! Elon is a visionary and I’d love to be riding shotgun to Mars one day! But don’t let that blind sight you from the uprising of perhaps one the biggest companies in the world. Infact...it already is. 

To summarise folks, what we are witnessing here is the best EV and lifestyle company in the making, bar none, that offers cutting edge technologies and innovations along with customer experience and satisfaction at its core business objectives. The impact of double shifts at JAC will start coming into fruition and before you know it NEO park will have eye watering production. Imagine 500k to 1million NIO cars/year. The Chinese government has backed NIO in more ways than one - subsidising AND bailing them out in times of birthing need. The writing is literally on the wall for ICE cars. NIO will keep delivering, keep breaking records and keep bringing world class innovation.

oeeiik,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oeeiik/fb_wish_drops_after_their_ipos_8_12_years_apart/,FB & WISH Drops After Their IPOs 8 1/2 years apart,284,112,2021-07-06 03:32:25,"Earlier, I wasn’t able to navigate creating a  DD post correctly to show the similarities between how FB and WISH were manipulated downward to shake weak hands off the stocks with massive long term gains ahead.

1. Compare FB July 2012 through Mar 2013 to WISH Dec 2020 to Present?

Market insiders who drove enthusiasm through the hyped FB IPO and the run up of WISH after its IPO make it their business to punish early investors with eyes on short term gains. They make huge profits on IPO run ups followed by shorting the very same hyped stocks mercilessly.

2. Why is this important?

In the case of FB then and WISH now you see two stocks - one that got punished then and another that has gotten punished recently such their valuation levels made no sense. Both companies had post IPO had very little debt while experiencing rapid growth but their market cap dropped precipitously and in the case of WISH, to around 1.4 x sales.

When valuations get out of whack like that and losses on individual investors force them to sell out of their positions, big investors always jump in to take massive long term stakes in which they reap massive gains.

This then says to me that you should be patient in your investing. You could carefully invest using a number of strategies to make money without losing your position in a long term winner. Here are a few approaches:

a. Average in your largest buys around large institutional investor buys as seen on level II trades
b. Join the shorts with with PUT orders when algorithmic selling or manipulative downward price action is evident
c. Sell LEAP covered CALLs if they are profitable
d. Balance trading on margin to avoid margin calls

Over time all that matters is that your trading account and positions in it are funded and not vulnerable to margin calls. A good early investment will usually prove to be one within two years.

3. What does this mean: Contrast manipulation vs value?

First, understand that in the long run valuations matter. To get the best value an investor should pay the lowest price for a promising stock. When a stock price drops while the fundamentals of the company is improving like WISH who reported 76% YoY revenue growth but fell to $7.52 after hitting a $32.85 high you have to wonder why. Well a buyer at $32.85 now has the worst value given the stock is now worth $11.78. A buyer on the other hand who bought at $7.52 or near about like I did has the highest value especially knowing that the company’s revenue is significantly increasing.

Second, we as investors must learn to follow the money. Big buy orders that we have seen since the 52-week low of $7.52 has produced massive trading volume. Massive trading volume with increasing price per share and algorithm-based pullbacks are signs of extraordinary long term gains as seen in FB. And, if you go back to AAPL in roughly 2004 and 2005 you see similar price action and volume followed by the enormous gains that APPL has since produced.

Manipulation is to me disingenuous price increase or drops against valuation. At either end whether through hype or unfounded bashing the unsuspecting and inexperienced investor is bound to lose.

4. Why did I deem FB and WISH price drops as manipulation?

When a disruptive technology enters the market and is run up early only to reverse and drop over  50% and sometimes down 90% there to me is no other explanation that big investor pump and dump market manipulation. I do not claim this to be scientific analysis but rather common sense. To make one feel as though their initial investment was a bad one only to later reveal sometimes 200-fold gains is similarity someone telling you your winning lottery ticket was a loser. To me it should be criminal when big investors colluded with unscrupulous Law Firms who file fake lawsuits and post them all over every brokerage site or financial website and paid bashers are employed to drive down a stock price to encourage individual investors to sell their stakes at a loss as I believe is being done in the case of WISH."

― Saruman the White

Since most of you degenerates have joined during the middle days of WSB (post 2M), I thought it might be helpful to remind you the stories of some of the OG degenerate legends.

u/1R0NYMAN, **the master of homeless box spreads**

['no money at risk'](https://preview.redd.it/21yvujixo9971.png?width=635&format=png&auto=webp&s=a990f594a9a435a6d80e230bb87550ca2a6fe917)

* Discovered an ancient spell of 'it literally can't go tits up' trading strategy called ""The Box Spread"", a multi-legged options strategy involving both buying/selling calls and puts at the same time.
* Through his wiseness, he came to the conclusion that Box Spreads, if sold at the right time, can get him credit with 'zero risk' because his blood magic told him so
* Out of all tickers, he chose $UVXY (because why the fuck not? It's not like Volmageddon ever happened). He was confident that he set up a play that would net him a guaranteed total of $38k of riskless profit in 2 years. With the right amount of leverage he could scale this up nicely
* Sold hundreds of Box Spreads on Robinhood using margin and got paid a credit for each box spread. His account went [from $5k of his own money to about $200k worth of risk](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/aeqcvt/i_dont_know_when_to_stop/)
* Proceeded to withdraw $10k in cash, because who woudn't?
* If a Box Spread gets held till expiry it's risk free, but that's not how option selling works because there is always assignment risk...and 1r0nyman completely forgot about that
* To make it worse, Robinhood didn’t pick up on the risk level of his box spread trade and actually echoed back to him that there wasn’t a big amount of risk on the trade. Much like other elders here, 1R0NYMAN found a glitch/cheatcode in Robinhood which ultimately added even more fuel to the fire
* Got assigned short shares, -$58k loss, account closed out. Robinhood banned box spreads after the fiasco and emailed its entire client base about its policy change as a direct result of what happened with 1R0NYMAN

u/analfarmer2, **the paragon of FDs**

* analfarmer2, a 19-year-old became the true paragon of how OGs traded FDs back in the elder days. He somehow got access to about $100k in his trading account (described as ‘online biz and margin’)
* His first FD was a $110k bet on $ALGN with 2DTE calls. The company announced a share buyback, and shares rocketed the next day gaining him $180k. His account went to $343k
* A couple of days later our guy dropped $170k on1DTE  SPY puts, and again got insanely lucky as the market tanked after a Trump tweet about the Chinese trade embargo. [**His trading account was up another $277k up to $646k**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cksrsf/spy_puts_277k_profit_in_1_minute/)
* He took another massive bet the following day, buying $600k worth of SPY calls 1DTE. analfarmer2 sold out of his position at a $500k loss. He made a few more unknown trades and found himself down to $41k
* [**3 days later**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/co31pq/my_final_yolo_40k_into_cgc_calls_expiring_next/) he bought $40k worth of $CGC calls in anticipation of earnings the following week. This was a more responsible trade -- he had an entire week until expiration, just imagine the possibilities. Earnings were shit, the stock tanked and his FDs were now worthless

u/ControlTheNarrative, **the wizard of GUH!**

* ControlTheNarrative was so wise that he managed to discover the 'infinite money cheat code' deeply embedeed into Robinhood's matrix and as a result redefined what some consider to be beyond their Personal Risk Tolerance
* He was so genius and so retarded at the same time that through his Robinhood Gold account he took his leverage level to 25x, well beyond the 2x allowed by RH
* From an inital deposit of $2k (minimum balance to access RH Gold) he bought 100 shares of AMD for $4k or so, with margin. He then sold an AMD Call Contracts with a $2 strike to get almost all his money back. He then used that money to buy TWO hundred shares of AMD because remember, margin doubles the buying power, then he sold 2 Call Contracts witht he same $2 strike price to get almost all his money back, which is then doubled again thanks to Robinhood's Margin
* Robinhood let him buy AMD stock on margin that is collateralized by AMD stock he's already sold. The AMD loop he went through made his buying power go up only because RH was absolutely retardedly (even more so than he was) still counting the AMD stock for his covered calls as part of his margin collateral to buy the options. He rinsed and repeated this process until sufficiently leveraged to his Personal Risk Tolerance (25x leverage)
* Finally, he used his increased buying power to 'maximize' gains by loading up on $AAPL put FDs to bet against Tim Apple on an earnings play. Unfortunately, $AAPL destroyed earnings and blew his account
* To make matters worse, [he recorded the market-open and the instant nuking of his account](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/)

u/MoonYachts, **the leverageborn**

* Credit. Debt. Equity. Leverage. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when u/MoonYachts attacked. MoonYachts was a disciple of u/ControlTheNarrative. Through his master's teachings, MoonYachts also understood that when selling covered calls on Robinhood and if he bought the shares, the stock wasn't subtracted from the buying power. The cash balance from the covered call got added to his cash balance – increasing the buying power by the premium he took in.
* Only the Fed Chair, master of all four elements, could beat him, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. And although his QE skills were great at the time, he had a lot to learn before he was ready to save anyone.
* So it happened, that MoonYachts' Personal Risk Tolerance was from the netherrealm and not even the Fed Chair could match him at the time. By using the 'infinite money spell', he managed to take his [**Personal Risk Tolerance to 250x leverage (a $1M leveraged position on $4k of initial equity)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/drqaro/robinhood_free_money_cheat_works_pretty_well_1/) (on $F stock out of all tickers)
* To this day nobody knows the ending of his adventures, but legend has it that banks still hate him for showing us the spell of infinite leverage"

In my post history you’ll definitely find me shilling for CLOV. Stupid piece of shit CLOV. 

Turns out, you’ll find most of these stocks are shorted FOR A REASON. THEY SUCK ASS. THINK YOU DAMN APES, THINK. 

AMC and GME actually did squeeze. But those are RARE exceptions. And they totally poisoned this sub with a bunch of Neanderthals looking for the next short squeeze. Stop. Get help. It feels like we’ve had 5 years worth of short squeezes in the last few months. It’s over. 

Why should you listen to a random nobody yelling at you on the internet? Because. People are making money out there while you baghold these crap stocks. SPY at an all time high. You coulda made more $$ playing Microsoft or Apple. 

Or actually, don’t stop. Lose your money please. And then fuck off to your lonely 9-5 daily cocksucking for that $500 weekly paycheck. And never come to this sub again. So I don’t have to read your bullshit. I just want to wake up, pull out my phone, and not see your dumb ass. Your wife/girlfriend however is invited. 

So, want to know why your “short squeeze” DD isn’t working?! Here’s the difference- AMC and GME are household names. If you want retail to pile on? It’s gotta be a household name. Retail loves nostalgia. They love familiarity. 

So is it a retail squeeze, or can you get the big bois on board? Here’s some facts for ya- they don’t need your shit DD. They have Bloomberg Terminals. They have 100x more data than we do, and they see it before we do, in real time, and they play market rotations and earnings. They’re not googling 1 week old short interest data. They got the real time shit. They play this game on another level. And if you can’t get them on board, and the stock isn’t a household name, then you fucked up. 

So this is what I’m saying- I blame all you fucks for missing plays like NKE last week. 

Come on. NKE was a fucking given. It was written on the wall in neon letters and most of us missed it. 

TL;DR- want to make money? You can be a millionaire without ever touching a short squeeze. 

Fucking rookie ass bitches.

EDIT MOTHERFUCKERS- 

Somehow my rant, which I thought would get me banned or downvoted to hell, has made it to the top in just a few hours. 

Sure, the comments are trying to wreck me. I also got a Reddit admin notice asking if I need mental health help lmao. Got a good chuckle out of that one. Fucking trolls. 

But you can see this is a place where we can still say fuck this short interest bullshit. And we can still find others who agree. I’m ok with conflict as long as nobody gets banned or their comments deleted. 

When you try to have a counter opinion on most subreddits you get insta-banned. So I’m just happy we have some freedom to talk shit here and disagree openly. It’s fun. Appreciate it you cunts. 

I know it won’t stop the shilling but 🤷🏻‍♂️. Let’s get some real fucking DD in here. Fuck short squeezes. It’s too easy for people to come in and manipulate this crowd on SI news.

FINAL EDIT- mods flair me. What’s it take? Who’s dick I gotta suck?"

Its valuation is lower than others in this space such as market darling The Trade Desk, while also growing faster.

Large growth prospects and a reasonable valuation, combined with a low absolute market cap, provide a recipe for a successful investment.

Buy potential multi-baggers while they’re small.



Investment Thesis

One of the core tenets of growth investing is a company’s relatively small market cap in light of a potentially large long-term opportunity. A small company with a differentiated technology or product in a large market could deliver supercharged returns if it keeps growing.
This may exactly be the case with PubMatic (PUBM). The company operates an adtech platform, has a reasonable valuation, is growing fast, and has the relatively small market cap that growth investors would look for.
I would contrast this stock with The Trade Desk (TTD). While they’re not exactly competitors, both operate in the adtech space. However, The Trade Desk has the opposite characteristics: while the company also reports respectable growth, it already has a much larger market cap and a high P/S valuation.
Put differently, though, the investment thesis is that potentially PubMatic could replicate on the sell-side of this market what The Trade Desk has accomplished (both as a business and as double digit-bagger on the stock market) on the buy-side.

Company overview

As indicated, PubMatic operates in the adtech space. The company provides a sell-side cloud infrastructure platform purpose-built for digital, real-time programmatic advertising. As such, the company should benefit from general ad spend growth as well as some of the higher-growth areas in this space such as programmatic CTV (connected TV). PubMatic also expects some acceleration tailwinds from the reopening.
In succinct terms:

PubMatic has created a sell-side ad tech platform that leverages data-driven algorithms and tools to help content publishers and app developers maximize the value of their ad inventory.

The reasoning behind such an infrastructure-driven approach is that advertising is inherently data-intensive, and also real-time. Hence, PubMatic can deliver increased value (such as higher revenue for publishers and higher ROI for buyers), and also innovate faster, by controlling the full stack from hardware to software. This also results in a cost advantage.
The alternative approach is using public cloud infrastructure, which only allows for controlling the software stack.
PubMatic also claims it benefits from consolidation of ad budgets on fewer sell-side platforms, resulting in increased market share. This occurs through Supply Path Optimizations or SPOs. As evidence for this trend, PubMatic disclosed that revenue from those arrangements nearly doubled in Q1.

Lastly, to come back to the term “sell-side”. This can be contrasted to The Trade Desk, which is a demand-side or buy-side platform. In simple terms, the buy-side are those who buy advertising inventory, while the sell-side are those who offer ad space, anywhere on the internet. As such, the thesis really is that PubMatic may become (both as company and as a stock) on the sell-side what The Trade Desk has become on the buy-side.

Q1 results

In Q1, PubMatic reported $43.6M revenue, up 54% YoY. In particular, mobile and omnichannel video grew 83%, and represented 63% of total revenue. CTV grew 55% QoQ. Gross margin also increased from 65% to 72% due to increased utilization. This signals a scalable business.
PubMatic’s accelerated growth over the last year is also evidenced by its increased TTM net retention, which has expanded from 112% to 130%, which is best-in-class for growth companies in general.

Guidance

PubMatic has guided for 33% growth for the year.
While this implies a slowdown, some part of it does seem like sandbagging or conservative guidance: as discussed, the net retention was 130% in Q1, and growth in mobile and video also grew markedly faster than the overall business.

Valuation

PubMatic’s valuation should be considered compelling. At the stock’s current ~$40 price, the forward P/S stands at ~10x, which is over 3x cheaper than The Trade Desk. Obviously, the bullish case would be that given that both operate in the same market, PubMatic could deliver similar growth as the former, which would result in both long-term stock and valuation expansion.
Although PubMatic certainly does not yet have same multi-year track record of elevated revenue growth yet as The Trade Desk, this stark difference in valuation arguably well offsets potential execution risks. At least in Q1, PubMatic was growing faster than The Trade Desk.

Risks

PubMatic’s growth has accelerated since COVID-19, and the company also expects continued tailwinds from the reopening, which should result in increased ad spend. However, a risk would be if growth would slow down to pre-pandemic levels; obviously, the best growth stocks, including The Trade Desk, are able to sustain elevated growth for years.
Another potential risk are some of the recent and ongoing changes in the ad space, including changes in Apple’s (AAPL) policy and the phasing out of third-party cookies. However, PubMatic reports that the majority of its revenue comes from different identifiers than those two. As such, PubMatic actually views this is a competitive advantage, similar to how The Trade Desk has been boasting about how the Open Internet will prevail over the walled gardens. PubMatic is in fact investing in a portfolio of alternative solutions to the third-party cookie, including The Trade Desk’s UID 2.0 as well as Google’s (GOOG) (GOOGL) Privacy Sandbox (which includes the contested FloC).

Note that The Trade Desk and PubMatic are not really competitors but rather partners, as The Trade Desk is a demand side platform. PubMatic says it is integrated with around 100 such platforms.
A last risk I found was that although PubMatic especially touts its infrastructure, the company nevertheless seems to get more mixed reviews (i.e. a lower rating than TTD). This could imply it still has some way to go to truly become best-in-class.

Primer on ads and cookies

This section serves for those who aren’t all too up-to-date on some of the terms used here.
As I would describe it, the core issues stem from privacy concerns regarding (third-party) cookies and tracking. This is leading to the phasing out of those cookies (now planned for 2023 by Chrome). However, this causes issues for the digital advertising market, which relies on targeted ads to increase their efficiency.
As such, alternative, supposedly more privacy-friendly, tracking solutions are being introduced. One of the most well-known is The Trade Desk’s UID 2.0. Google, for its part, is backing on a collection of a few dozen of APIs, which it calls Privacy Sandbox. One of those is the controversial “FloC”, even though it does (more or less) achieve its goal to provide privacy without sacrificing targeting accuracy.
Another point of dichotomy is regarding what some like to call the Open Internet vs. the walled gardens. The latter are the big ad platforms such as Google, Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN).
The gist is that those walled gardens have a privileged position given that they have an enormous amount of first-party data. Hence, they could survive the phasing out of third-party cookies quite unscathed.
Some claim, for example, that it is in Google's interest to phase out those cookies, which could put Google at a competitive advantage as others would lose the ability to serve targeted ads.
However, one might note that this dichotomy isn’t all that clear. For example, both Roku (ROKU) and Unity (U) (and likely plenty others) certainly wouldn’t be considered walled gardens among the likes of Google and Facebook. Nevertheless, both companies have said that given their own first-party data, they deem themselves to be quite unaffected by those changes in the ad landscape.
Lastly, given the observation that there are so many alternative tracking solutions being developed, which may or may not conserve privacy, ultimately there may be relatively little tangible changes in the ad landscape. As such, the bottom line may be that the recent rally by the likes of The Trade Desk (due to Google’s Privacy Sandbox delay) is overblown.

Investor Takeaway

PubMatic offers a compelling proposition, both with its full-stack technology as well as with accelerated business results. In general, the company operates in the growing digital advertising market, and by being at the forefront with its technology and innovation, seems to be well-positioned for market share growth as well.
The company has reported high growth, expanded margins, and a high 130% net retention in Q1. PubMatic is also capitalizing on the latest trends such as CTV, which grew 55% sequentially. While no stocks are risk-free, these are definitely signs that the company is able to capitalize on the growth opportunity in its adtech space.
Just as importantly, compared to other growth stocks I have covered, both the company’s market cap and P/S valuation are rather low for growth stocks. That implies the risk is reduced, while the potential upside could be significant.
Hence, bottom line is that PubMatic does not even have to exactly replicate The Trade Desk’s performance to deliver solid or even significant long-term investor returns. As I said about another small company a while ago, Sumo Logic (SUMO): buy potential multi-baggers while they’re small (and cheap)."

A few weeks ago I began posting on AMD. At the time, the stock was trading in the mid-70's.

Today, as expected, we crossed $90 price... but our trip is just getting **STARTED**!

The deal with TESLA was announced, as well as the next AMAZING technologies in Computex, including the stacked cache for Zen3, Fidelity FX Super Resolution, the 6900 XTX Liquid Cooled, etc.

There's a very simple reason why AMD will go past the MOON and MARS: **ENTERTAINMENT**

The world revolves around entertainment and in this new era, this activity is mandatory to deal with Covid-19, the lack of international travel, work from home, etc.

TESLA adopting AMD for its new Model X and S is HUGE. It will take a Navi23 and an APU (two chips) per car, likely becoming an optional for all other vehicles in the future. More automobile brands will follow, as TESLA is leading the way in the industry.

&#x200B;

[TESLA selected AMD chips for its upcoming vehicles](https://preview.redd.it/aekg7gm3u8871.jpg?width=2243&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c178f47df42b4159f92d1248ac9618a3f8440643)

With autonomous driving, gaming in a long trip will be mandatory. But even without it, the rest of the passengers can game, either with their fellow companions or online, from their car.

So, yes, the current automotive revolution will have AMD as a main supplier.

Then you have consumer processing, which includes CPU's and GPU's, where AMD is dominating (mostly on the former). The Zen3 architecture is a MONSTER. Intel just cannot compete. And with the stacked cache providing up to 15% more gaming performance, that lead will continue on AMD's side.

On GPU's, AMD's Navi31 is expected to be MCM (multi-chip module), aiming to repeat AMD's success with Intel, but now against NVIDIA. ""Chiplets"" allow for economies of scale to thrive. More silicon, with less defects, better binning, cheaper... it is an AMAZING IDEA. Just add cache and the latency problem can be mitigated.

On console gaming, AMD is the undisputed KING. They're in the PS4, PS4 Pro, PS5, Xbox model and series X/S. Also in the Aya Neo and expected in Valve's next handheld, which will be a MONSTER.

On Datacenter, AMD is groundbreaking. Epyc and the new offerings from **GOOGLE** for virtual machines is an INCREDIBLE deal. **AMAZON, TENCENT, ALIBABA, AZURE** (Microsoft), they are all buying chips from AMD. More CORES means MORE power processing, lower energy, lower licensing costs and certainly better SECURITY (as INTEL has been plagued by Spectre & Meltdown issues). AMD is now expected to go from 64 cores in EPYC to 96... and also 128. That's just ludicrous, 128 CORES and 256 threads. And X86 clients are THRILLED to buy more power in a more efficient chip.

[Google wants AMD Milan Epyc Chips for its Datacenter](https://preview.redd.it/36x8ygt6u8871.jpg?width=2284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d96e3eab884218203d9fbe906b9ba3474902e13)

Deals with the US Department of Energy (El Capitan), Singapore and Germany, all for public datacenters worth millions of dollars. That's just the tip of the iceberg, as private players are taking note of EPYC.

Last, **but certainly NOT least: MOBILE**

AMD will power Samsung's S22 flagship phone. Its GPU is expected to break records, as engineering samples already have it beating MALI and Apple's options, by **double digits**.

**Samsung** is delighted and **Google** also wants AMD chips for its phones.

&#x200B;

[Samsung wants AMD's chips for its flagship GALAXY S22](https://preview.redd.it/xu07hgobu8871.jpg?width=1919&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dfea79ba818835fb83a9cb5f51d5189cf2d034e0)

But enough on the PRODUCTS. What about the fundamentals?

Revenue growth is expected at 50% by the end of 2021. How many companies are growing by 50%?

And that guidance was provided with the Q1 results in April, which were exceeding expectations. AMD raised the guidance from 37% to 50%... and will certainly BEAT IT.

AMD is NOW a profitable company... and it literally CANNOT keep its products on shelves, as its clients are buying ALL THEIR CHIPS.

AMD's valuation is $110 billion, while NVIDIA (w/slightly more revenue & profit) is $500 billion.

How is NVIDIA 5 times the value of AMD???... Just because of a stock split?

It is currently trading at 38 times earnings, which if they grow by 50% in 6 months, will certainly drop.

So yeah, the stock is currently above $90 and aiming to reach its all-time high of $99 which was reached a few months ago, in January.

Analyst consensus of the stock is currently $106.54 ([https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast)) which is roughly an 18% upside, taking it to a mere $ 132 billion market cap.

If you ask me, AMD should be **at least HALF** of NVIDIA's $500 billion market cap.

Lastly, the Xilinx acquisition, which will aim to create synergies among functions (e.g. HR, Procurement, Engineering, etc.). It will also increase AMD's share of the silicon purchasing world, as TSMC will have AMD as its #2 client, only second to Apple.

Xilinx cancelled its dividends as its shareholders approved the merger with AMD.

AMD may choose to bring dividends back after the merger... yet in the meantime, they announced a $4 Billion share buyback program. They know their stock is trading **CHEAP**.

# On the positions (full disclosure): YES, I hold AMD stock.

I bought $25K back in 2013, when the stock was at $2.46 (on January 18th, 2013), a bit over 10150 stocks. I saw the stock go up to $20 and sold half of it in 2018. Later, I bought back a bit (crazy ape mentality).

Today, I stand with 7500 stocks. Certainly worth a couple of Lambo's, yet I drive a Nissan.

If you ask me, my next car should be a TESLA... with AMD chips (yet I'm not selling AMD).

WE ALREADY PASSED THE MOON, we will pass **MARS** (Tesla) and also our **Galaxy** (Samsung).

# Join me, together we will conquer the Universe!!!

Pack your bananas.... we're in for a journey!"

Thesis: Nikola is about to get bonked on the head by a falling apple and will capture part of the Infrastructure Plan and the USPS truck contract.
They have no real business started yet but sit poised at the forefront of a massive new industry.


I would like to attempt to draw some correlation between Sir Isaac Newton’s “discovery” of gravity and the concept of simply being at the forefront of the right thing at the right time. 
Back in the day, meaning several hundred years ago, all discoveries and inventions were really simple and could be discovered screwing around in one’s own backyard or basement. Why? Simple things were still being discovered.
Not unimportant, just simple.
These discoverers became giants in human history by noticing, documenting, making the easily discoverable at the right time: the idea is that they were carried onward by all the weight of what was the natural progression of their discovery. 



Fast forward to today. The greatest investment opportunities lie in companies that are at the forefront of major future industries, and will capture market share.



Everyone is well aware of the shortcomings of Nikola, namely their somewhat fraudulent lack of business; However, having no business means they can become whatever they want.


Nikola is going to shock the world by becoming one of the major hydrogen fuel infrastructure companies in the next couple of years.

SoFi was founded in 2011 by Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian Brady, four students who met at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. The founders hoped SoFi could provide more affordable options for those taking on debt to fund their education. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoFi#:~:text=SoFi%20was%20founded%20in%202011,debt%20to%20fund%20their%20education.

I am just a big believer in bringing personal finances to the masses and to teach people about personal finance and how to accumulate and build wealth, most parents and schools don’t teach shit on the subject matter. I absolutely love SoFi's statements/mantras:

- Our number one goal is helping our members get their money right. 

- SoFi's mission is to help people reach financial independence to realize their ambitions.

Let's go over some #s.  SoFi has been around and growing as a private company for some time now and has seen seven consecutive quarters of YoY growth w Q1 2021 producing 110% growth and ending w 2.281M members.  This is exponential to say the very least.

I will be linking the data and numbers, but that is all readily available for all the see and find.  The adjusted Net Revenue and EBITDA are increasing and trending in the right direction, with 151% and 70% growth YoY respectively.  The biggest factors to me are they are scaling and accumulating data.  These 2 things are what are going to set companies apart to not only produce growth but obtain profitability to the bottom line. 

The goal of SoFi is to be the one-stop shop for everything a person would need for finance.  Checking/savings accounts, personal loans, home loans, student loans, car loans, budgeting, investing in the markets, and on and on.  The total products used by members has grown by 121% YoY and financial products has grown 273% YoY.  It appears to this layman that they are figuring out to how grow members as well as total products used by member.  https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sofis-q1-earnings-beat-managements-guidance-as-company-prepares-to-trade-on-nasdaq-2021-05

SoFi acquired Golden Pacific Bancorp Inc in its quest to get a federal bank charter, which is cumbersome and tedious process.  This would be an upcoming catalyst for sure if/when this happens https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/sofi-s-bank-buy-presents-blueprint-for-more-fintech-bank-deals-63129976

The Galileo acquisition was a game changer and covered well by u/havocs2 in his DD, I would just add that this has seen 130% YoY (everything seems to be growing triple digits) growth as well. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9l9x6/why_sofi_will_be_sofly_my_78000_yolo_into_sofi/ 

$SoFi was brought to market under the SPAC model and coverage of the stonk has just began.  Coverage was initiated by Oppenheimer w an outperform and was also initiated by Rosenblatt w a buy.  TipRanks has it rated as moderate buy and a price target of $27.50, about a 40% premium to today's closing price.  https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast

I am not a bot, nor am I a shill.  I am very active (to fucking active to be honest) in the daily and I post almost all my plays in real time.  Check my post history and you can see that I have been in this play for some time and believe in the company.

Current positions: 5 $12.50 2023 LEAPS, 2 $20.00 2023 LEAPS, and 155 shares and no intention of dumping or selling short term.

Is there a high SI? is the borrow rate high? Was this targeted because it was a Chamath SPAC?  Probably, i don't know for sure and honestly don't give 2 shits if it is or it is not, I like the company and the stonk and think it is undervalued and will only grow in the future.  That is what the hell I think.  

To be a FinTech disrupter, you obviously need an app and great user-friendly UI and SoFi has a 4.8 rating w over 48K reviews on the $AAPL app store.

TL;DR There is no industry/s that need more disruption than banks and brokerages.  For far too long the poors and working class have been hit w hidden fees, outrageous fees, shit even made-up accounts.  SoFi is the just the company to do this disrupting all in one beautiful app!

o9r86e,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9r86e/why_im_so_bullish_on_vuzi/,WHY IM SO BULLISH ON $VUZI$,36,16,2021-06-29 03:15:01,"
Alright ladies and retards, listen up. Some of you have already seen u/Velociraptorsss DD on VUZI a few days ago and I have to say I completely agree with him. After doing my own research, I am extremely bullish on this company. Not just because Aunt Cathie bought a bunch but for the reasons listed below:

FINANCIALS-

The smart eyeglass industry is at it's beginning stages and VUZI is considered to be the front runner already. Other competitors are virtually not even close and we have seen VUZI's YOY growth grow from 2Q FY 2020 of 2.92% to 1Q FY 2021 of 104.5%. Any company growing this fast deserves to be looked at. Although the Gross Profit YOY is still sitting at (167%) in Q1 of 2021 it is trending in the right direction up from (337%) in Q1 of 2020. Operating income has stayed relatively sideways at (20.3)m which is to be expected from any future tech company trying to expand. In 2020 VUZI's sales grew 177% YOY and in 2021 Q1 should be around 49% YOY.

SHARE PRICE AND OFFERING-

They're sitting on approximately 150 million in cash which I suspect will be used for strategic acquisitions in the AI space. Not to mention they have next to no debt, and the CEO said in a recent interview that they will not be completing any more offerings as they don't need any more cash as of right now. This is always a good thing because in a small growth company their prices are often volatile. To know management won't complete any offerings is a good sign as momentum will be killed in any large price fluctuations. It is also important to note that the offering was done at $20.50 which usually acts as a price floor and VUZI is currently trading at $18.25 at the time of this post. Cathie Wood has been buying the ""dip"" so to speak as the share price this year went from $2 - $30 and now back to $15-18 ish. VUZI currently sits in a few different ARK funds as we all know because Cathie is bullish on AI. There are currently 63.07m shares outstanding of which 7% are held by insiders and 35% are held by large institutions. These are both solid numbers and both insiders/institutions have not been selling their stakes recently.

SHORT INTEREST/RATIO

Currently the short interest is sitting at 19.42% and the short ratio is at about 2.75. This represents approximately 10.07 million shares short as of May 14th or 18.07% on short shares outstanding as of June 15th. I believe this is important because as we have seen with MULTIPLE other ""MEME"" stocks with the same or close to the same SI a squeeze is inevitable at some point. 20% isn't absurdly high but definitely enough to get some solid momentum forward and see an upside of at least 70-100%. This being combined with the fact that VUZI is a legitimate company with some solid tech and some solid backing should make for some advantageous returns. My personal PT is $70 before I'd consider taking some profit but I am a longterm holder.

MISCELLANEOUS AND INVESTMENT THESIS-

I look at VUZI as a great growth story who is early to the party. If you look at Apple, in the beginning stages of the smart phone it was tough to forecast just how big Apple would become and here we are. Just last year there were 1.8 BILLION smart phones sold and whose to say smart glasses won't rival this? I am confident in the products VUZI produces such as the M4000, M400 and BLADE glasses. They are all already used and rapidly expanding. Some of these workplaces include, Manufacturing plants, warehouse solutions for amazon esque companies, Tele Medicine ie. surgical procedures and student learning centres, not to mention field services. These products are all utilized in many different countries such as US, Japan, Germany, Sweden, Denmark etc. and are available pretty much everywhere if necessary.
Also, if you look at the evolution of the cell phone or computer being morphed into one there has been one obvious transformation. That is they are both becoming smaller and smaller and require less touch and maintenance. The transition to touch-less or touch-free products is now and I believe VUZI's products can make this transition seamlessly. For these reasons I am extremely bullish on Vuzix Corp. and my current position is.

Huge market that is being forced by 2030-2035. NIO is in the biggest car market in the world, China, and the CCP has invested to save them from bankruptcy in the older days (whether you trust the CCP or not, they have power and can easily push brands or $$ to consumers (NIO has no issue with demand).
-Car design (beautiful especially the new sedan ET7) + Battery swap and battery as a service. Battery swapping is so new (money losing right now, built infrastructure. No other company has innovated this) and they have developed swap stations all across China. Battery as a service lets customers buy a car and lease the battery, so cars are a bit cheaper up front.
-European expansion, mainly Norway. Plans to come to US, but thats long term.
-Best customer service in the world… Wether its at the NIO houses, or providing a utility vehicle if you ever get stranded, NIO wins.
-Building an “Industrial Park” to ramp production to all new levels and have their part manufacturing done right next door.

NIO will take over China, no doubt in my mind. After all, theres a reason it was 90+% of my portfolio with the run from $3.33 to $66. I still hold ~500 shares and a bunch of LEAPS I got May 10th after selling shares. Moon is regardless, NIO is going to help my dad retire (I told him about the moon ride at $7) and myself and siblings to have a nice head start. I’ll throw a 🚀 cuz I know this is WSB 🦍

ALSO: WKHS needs more attention and legitimate diamond hands. Naked shorting, 40-60% SI, fundamentals, and an electric fleet contract stolen from them by under the table money (to a 90% hybrid company that doesnt make engines) I don’t want your support, I want your oath… we need to send the horse to the moon."

I  noticed some growth compared to the previous week in TSLA, SPCE and  JPM. With regard to TSLA, we can see that the sentiment is positive, but  going south for the past days:

Probably the most significant acquisition was Bell Labs with Alcatel-Lucent which means NOK's R&D is unparalleled. That acquisition was for around half of the current market cap, just to put it into perspective.

NOK has a similar cash flow and revenue to main 5/6g rival ERIC but a much lower market cap. This would be an initial target.

&#x200B;

I wanted to pose a question for the lovely people of WSB. What companies do you have extreme high conviction on for the next 10-20 years? Why do you feel so strongly about said company?

&#x200B;

Alternatively, if you can't think of a company, what about an industry specifically?

I find that investment themes including: cloud computing, robotics, renewable energy, 3d printing, and genomic sequencing are likely to be hot in the future. The question is, which companies are in a position to win market share in these sectors?"

How much power does the government actually have against these giants, and what is the plan to stop the “monopoly”?

My personal take that yes they are huge companies, and they so carry so much cash, however, without these big companies, the US economy wouldn’t be the same…. Thats just my take on it.

Finally, I feel like the government should focus more on providing a better work environment in Amazon since clearly it is an issue for almost everyone that worked there (including me).

Overview

	AMD is a global semiconductor company offering x86 microprocessors as standalone or integrated (CPU’s, GPU’s, server systems, Etc…) and intellectual property/ services.

Products

	AMD’s primary products consist of CPU’s and GPU’s which are on par or out performing NVIDIA GPU’s and Intel’s CPU’s. While these other two giants have dominated the market for sometime, AMD’s recent move has evolved from a slow creep to a brisk jog. 

Competition 

	AMD’s largest competitors are Intel (CPU’s) and NVIDIA (GPU’s). With the release of AMD’s Ryzen processors in 2017, AMD has been steadily over taking Intel’s dominance over market share. AMD’s current market share (over all CPU’s) currently sits at 44%, levels it has not seen since 2005. AMD took 20% of the market share in past 2 years with a significant jump in 2019. Since the release of Ryzen, AMD is now on par or out performing Intel chips and has gained a significant amount of sentiment over the soy boys at intel. AMD is on track to overtake the majority of CPU market share within the next year based on current projections.

	Now NVIDIA is a whole other beast who currently has a significant advantage over the dGPU market. Nvidia at the end of Q4 2020, held roughly 82% of the market share which was a increase of 9% from the previous year. AMD’s high end GPU’s do not come close to Nvidia’s high end models, UNTIL AMD’s Radeon 6000 series, which are now on par with Nvidia’s cards, either outperforming or underperforming in various tests. AMD catching up to Nvidia is the same move that AMD made against Intel in 2017, 4 years later they are on the verge of overtaking market share. While Nvidia is a monster of a company, I believe that AMD will begin taking more market share from Nvidia and establish a decent foothold over the next few years. AMD has already taken the game console market, console plebs.

	AMD has already proved they are able to take back significant market share with there current and future products, Lisa Su is a genius and I believe she’ll lead the company to Valhalla. What does AMD have that Nvidia does not? Aside from many differences, I think the fact that AMD has an ecosystem will play a significant role in catching up. Now that AMD can evenly compete with both of their rivals, AMD plans on leveraging the fact that they produce CPU’s and GPU’s. There are already incentives to using AMD’s CPU with their GPU rather than an AMD CPU with a Nvidia GPU. With AMD taking the CPU market, retail users will be more likely to stick with the ecosystem, and I’m a big fan of companies producing an ecosystem (laughs in apple). 

	A new player enters the battle. Intel has been working on their own dGPU and will surely be releasing in the next few years, but I believe this will be comparable to Sony vs Microsoft with Nintendo enjoying their best life staring at butterfly’s, covered in drool in the corner lol.

The Merger

	Nvidia set to acquire ARM, AMD set to acquire Xilinx. What are they and how are they expected to impact the company?

ARM - Create and dominate the mobile processor market, covering TV’s, phones, tablets, and other similar products as well as some software applications. I will not be covering much more of ARM in this DD.

Xilinx - Designs and develops programmable logic products. As far as I can tell this is some big brain shit that I’m sure some booger nosed, mothers basement living, neck beard having, nerd will easily explain in the comments cuz Wikipedia ain’t cutting it.  

	If AMD completes the purchase, which is likely and expected to happen by the end of 2021, Xilinx shares will become worth 1.723 shares of AMD. AMD is currently trading at 86.10$, meaning that shares of Xilinx will be worth 148.35$ if the deal were to go through right now. Xilinx is currently worth 133.71$, I’m betting heavily that AMD will continue to pump prior to this deal as well.

	ARM will be huge for Nvidia, but this is running into some major road blocks and is likely some ways off or will fall through.

Financials and projections (I had pictures but I’m reddit dumb)

Net Revenue
$9.8B(2020), $6.7B(2019), $6.5B(2018), $5.2B(2017)
Net Incum 
$2.5B(2020), $341M(2019), $337M(2018), $(33)M(2017)
	
	I like your growth G

	AMD decreased their debt to 338 million from 568 million.
	
	$1.6 billion in cash ($9 billion in total assets, I find cash on hand more important)

	GPU/CPU sales accounted for $6.5 billion while enterprise accounted for $3.3 billion, GPU/CPU sales saw a 37% increase over 2019 while enterprise saw a 65% increase in 2020. 2021 is set to continue this trend of growth.

	AMD has a high price target of $169.70, median $107.00, and an average of $103.92. I just read 100’s of pages of 8k’s and 10’ks, plus I’m super attracted to the ole doc Su Bae so I’m betting that it will get a target price upgrade, regardless $103 will make me rich. There is a lot more we could dive into on financials but idk what the fuck I’m doing so nah.

Risks

	I like to plan for more than 1 risk occurring at a time so keep that in mind. Ive highlighted the risks that I find most impactful/ probable. Also keep in mind of global shortages for damn near every company, especially with chips.

	- Intel/ Nvidia’s market share dominance (mostly Nvidia)
	- Seasonal sales can make for shit earnings in Q1/Q2
	- Reliance on third parties for manufacturing/ distributors
	- Xilinx deal falls through
	- Jim Cramer also likes this stock

	That’s enough risks, what am I, a gay bear?

TLDR

AMD will moon, Lisa Su is my mommy and is cooking up some tendies, AMD GPU’s are now in Teslas,  obligatory rockets (insert rocket emojis here), lots of words just buy it.

$WISH and $BABA both excel in selling chinese shit to american consumers. $WISH’s growth rate looks incredibly tempting. They grew revenue by 35% last year. 

However, $WISH lost $745 million last year. Ouch. Worst of all, nearly $400M of that is stock-based compensation to pad the pockets of management, as well as $265m in G&amp;A expenses for their new lofty salaries, a 300% increase in spending from 2019.

So $WISH is burning YOUR cash and diluting shares to grow its revenue. They’re paying management massive salaries, giving them stock compensation while stockholders suffer losses.

Wouldn’t you rather get the same exposure and performance from a company making money?

Let’s take a look at $BABA.

TTM Revenue $110B

TTM FCF $34.5B

TTM FCF growth 20%

TTM Revenue growth 40% vs. $WISH 35%

5 year average Revenue growth 45%

3 year average FCF growth 30%, $AAPL 20%, S&amp;P 25%

Price/TTM FCF 16.5x, $AAPL 23.7x, S&amp;P 25.5x, $WISH has no FCF.

Price/TTM FCF/3yr growth .5-.85, $AAPL 1.2, S&amp;P 1

Market cap $572B

Book value $150B

Bear Case: Assuming company maintains current FCF and dies in 20 years, generates $680B cash for shareholders. $680B + $150B book value = undervalued by $250B

Bull case: Company maintains 20% FCF growth for 10 years, $213B in FCF by 2031, generates $3000B over 20 years for shareholders = undervalued by $2500B

5-year DCF model using 5 yr averages with a 8% discount rate and 2% perpetual growth/10yr yield puts this stock at $350.

Oh, and all these valuations assume no Ant group IPO, which alibaba could own a $50B stake in. Not to mention the massive moat and diversity in revenue stream for $BABA.

No need to $WISH for gains or growth. They’re already here in $BABA."

Not a political post!

The Supreme court decision today is sending the financial relief decision back to the lower court but a favorable ruling regarding the unconstitutional FHFA director position.  In hours, Biden Admins have already removed the FHFA director.

**Quick history:**

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been in government conservatorship since the 2008 housing crash.  In 2012, the FHFA decided to take all the lambos for themselves and sweep the money into the treasury when the companies turned a profit.  The congress at some point realized that they could not end these companies because of stonks so shareholders still exist.  In 2019, Fannie and Freddie were finally allowed to retain their capital to the tune of billions.  Many apes agree that Fannie and Freddie’s current woes largely resulted from them being used as a political scapegoat but to top it off, the former FHFA decided the two companies would need to raise $283B to be released.

**Enterprise Value (EV):**

To give you an idea what these companies are worth, Fannie and Freddie service half of the mortgages in the United States.  They are a cash and dividend paying cow.

  

|**Company**|**EV**| **Market Cap**|Share Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Fannie Mae|4.1T|2.5B|$1.52|
|Freddie Mac|2.7T|1.4B|$1.41|
|Apple|2.2T|2.2T|$35.20|
|Saudi Armaco|2.0T|7.0T|$133.70|
|Microsoft|2.0T|2.0T|$265.28|

&#x200B;

**Institutional holders makeup 24.7% of total outstanding junior preferred.**

Top institutional holders include Paulson & Co., Pershing Square, Capital Management and Fairholme Funds, Inc.  These guys have diamond hands since 2008!

**Short Volume fintel:**

Short Volume   22M

Short Volume Ratio 4868%

&#x200B;

I'm curious what would happen if we send this stock to its proper valuation, $10, $20, $50, or $100+? Would this force the government to sell their senior preferred shares?  The relief sought by shareholders would entitle them to $124B, rapid raise in share price and future lambo paying dividends.

Here are three reasons why you should never participate in this cuckoldry:

1. People should be adding to their winners instead of doubling down on their mistakes.  People adding to Apple over the last ten years are way smarter than the people who “averaged down” on BlackBerry (no disrespect to the BB apes going wild on this stock today I love the work you do 🦍🦍🦍)

2. Changing the number you see on the screen doesn’t mean you lost any less money.  Actually means you’ll lose more money cause it’s gonna go down again

3. This is the most important reason.  When you average down it dilutes your loss porn.  It makes it way harder for me and the rest of us here on this sub to cum 💦 and I want to see those big beautiful red negative numbers light up while they’re edging me closer and closer… getting closer and closer to -100% 👀.

\*i might or might not change your life, or atleast your account balance.

today i will be writing about alibaba stock ""BABA"" and exlplain my thesis regarding the underlying.

# intro:

Alibaba Group Holding Limited operates various segments including : core commerce, cloud, digital media, entertainment, payment services...

business which Alibaba group own: Taobao, TMALL, Freshipo, Lazada, Ali-express, Alibaba, ele,me, 1688, youku, alibaba-cloud, alimama, cainiao network, dingtalk, ant group, ali-pay

Alibaba group does business in almost every thing you can imagine, therfore you can compare them to every big tech you know, they stand with the big dogs.(AMZN, GOOG, AAPL, MSFT) but they get less attention at the moment.  i think the sentiment towards alibaba is bound to change, very soon.

**Why BABA ?, why now ?**

baba showed negative performance relative to the other tech stocks at the moment (market sentiment due to politics - alot of impact on the stock) . but baba strength can be seen in a few areas: revenue growth, solid financial position with reasonable debt and very reasonable and cheap valuation. the profit margins are lower when comparing to peers right now but baba business have much to grow and much to be expected to fix that issue.

Baba stock experienced little decline in most recent quarter in comparison to performance from same quarter a year before, but i think the next earning this year will reveal growth in EPS.

Now, lets start of with the basics and take a look on baba financial and valuation.

&#x200B;

# valuation:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/anm5scpa30771.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a6194d33f1165898de0cc04ce59c7e736bb9dbc

so looking at valuations:

Mkrt value:  573B

p/e: \~25x

Fp/e: \~21x

p/s: \~5.2x

p/b: \~3.9x -> very attractive at this rate !

eps(ttm): 8.48

eps(ntm): \~12

next e/r : Aug 19

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pkphleqb30771.png?width=226&format=png&auto=webp&s=102d445ee3ce2b7d931e42e4e62ea38ee0ae9d5e

At BABA current stock price of $211, the market is expecting revenue to grow at 48.8% for the next 1 years. Over this period, BABA is also expected to generate an average Economic Earnings Margin of 13.8%

Baba have increased theirlong term debt looking at their financials but due to increase in future revenue i believe it is nothing to be bothered by. debt is not an real issue to baba.

\*\*very important note is that comparing baba to other big techs valuations at the moment proves that baba is dirty cheap and can be a good short/long term play . even is market goes sideways i dont see baba going any lower than right now. 200 price is pretty strong ressitence and still a good price.

revenue growth: 47.96%

eps growth : 14.42%

i will be including a look into baba Assets and Liabilities, which i believe is showing us a healthy company which keep growing and expanding and inceasing their cashflow, revenue and shareholders equity.

## Liabilities:

**Profitability:**

Profitability in baba business is quite larger comparing to peers.

# ANALyst reports:

most of the ANALysts recommend this stock. various price targets between 260\~350 price targets.

# Technicals:

52wk High: 319.32

52wk Low: 204.39

Avg volume (3M) : 15.8M -> breakout will increase volume obiously everybody watching the stock movement right now.

baba is down \~33% from the top at 319.32 (10/27/21).

I expect to see a bullish breakout in a couple days, can be happening anytime right now. good support at 209-210 level, every time we get there i can spot large money flowing into baba.

I believe that a price of 300$ before the year ends is possible and quite easy with a very little catalyst or sentiment change towards the company. right now from what im reviewing the sentiment towards baba is starting to chagne across the internet and financial market.

***TLDR: RKT is having its ""Amazon is just a book company"" moment.  Investors are over-discounting the MASSIVE upside from tech-ecosystem opportunities for this already highly profitable and fast-growing company.***    

First things, here is my position (\~$350k market value): 17,500 shares @ $18.54, 50x Sep 2021 $19.89c, 20x Jan 2022 $20.89c.  Now that you know I'm serious, let me start with some context.

What do the best tech investors look for?

I'll quote someone smarter than me: ""*Top tier firms like Vista Equity, Thoma, and Silver Lake focus on buying businesses with the following characteristics - mission critical products with high switching costs, growing end market, high ROI economics, market leadership, and sticky and recurring revenue base... Every software company can be run at 30-35% EBITDA margin*""  ([Twitter: sendoh34](https://twitter.com/sendoh34/status/1350163448663982081?s=20))

I work at Best Buy so I know he is right.  Whether the focus is early stage VC, tech PE or public equity, ***tech investors want nothing more than*** ***high-growth, scalable, recurring revenue*** and they look for companies with competitive advantages and moats within their industries to deliver and protect this tasty RR*.*

**What does this have to do with Rocket Companies?**

In case you care at all about what they do, Rocket Companies (NYSE: RKT) is a holding company of consumer-oriented financial services, real estate and mortgage businesses.  Most think first of Rocket Mortgage (formerly Quicken Loans) which is the #1 lender in the U.S. with \~10% share of the $3.5TN mortgage market.  Rocket Mortgage is known for their best-in-class brand, customer service and innovative, tech-driven approach to the industry.  About +/- 90% of RKT's $16BN of revenue in 2020 came from its core mortgage business.

***Rocket is currently treated by investors and analysts as a TECH-ENABLED mortgage company but*** ***not*** ***a FINTECH company.***  Read any analyst research report and it is obvious.  Why is this important?  Because while tech-enabled businesses can deliver significantly better operating results, market share gains and staying power than competitors, their core business is unchanged and so the valuation metrics by analysts and the institutions are unchanged.  This is evident by RKT's current valuation: **at yesterday's close of $19.22, RKT was trading at 4.7x 2020 EPS and \~9.0x consensus 2021 EPS.**  *Comparatively, fintech companies trade at 25-30x PE multiples or even much, much higher.*  Are they right? 

**Why Rocket Should Be Considered a Fintech Company**

I'll give 5 reasons why you should start thinking about Rocket as a Fintech Company.

**1. ROCKET ALREADY HAS AN EXTENSIVE TECHNOLOGY BASE BUILT OVER DECADES**

Many don't realize that while Rocket Mortgage is their largest business, Rocket Companies also includes dozens of other businesses formed over decades of investment.  Here are just a few of them: 

* [Amrock Title](https://www.amrock.com/) \- tech-enabled title insurance, valuations and settlement services. Industry pioneer in digital closings and eNotes which more than doubled last year.   
* [Nexsys Technologies](https://www.nexsystech.com/) \-  creates digital platforms for real estate appraisal (Nexsys Clear Path), insurance (Nexsys Clear HOI) and mortgage closings.
* [Rock Connections](https://rockconnections.com/) \- contact services provider leveraging technology and data to connect consumers and brands more effectively.
* [Lendesk](https://www.lendesk.com/) \- Canadian technology company which operates Finmo, Lender Spotlight, Gateway and Enterprise solutions, with more than 10,000 mortgage brokers using its products 
* Others include [Edison Financial](https://edisonfinancial.ca/) (Canadian digital mortgage startup), [Core Digital Media](http://www.coredigitalmedia.com/) (online consumer acquisition platform), [ForSaleByOwner](https://www.forsalebyowner.com/) and more

These companies and others in the [Rocket Ecosystem](https://www.rocketcompanies.com/our-companies/) create technology that Rocket can leverage in its core mortgage business which why ***Rocket consistently destroys its competitors on nearly every metric and has been able to scale a higher-margin Direct-to-Consumer business while others have not***.  These companies are also big contributors themselves already as you can see from the 1Q ER:  

* *Amrock, our title insurance services, property valuation, and settlement services company, generated 348,800 closings, up 110% from Q1 '20, representing the highest level of closings in Amrock's history. This record volume was the primary driver for the* *increase in other income in Q1 '21 to $466.1 million from $243.8 million in Q1 '20.* \[THAT IS A 91% YOY INCREASE!\]

**2.  ROCKET IS INVESTING A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL AND FOCUS INTO THEIR TECH**  

Over the LTM ended 1Q21, ***Rocket generated $12BN of EBITDA on $19BN of Revenue (\~65% EBITDA margin!) which they are investing right back into their business.***  Over 2/3 of their 276 current job openings are tech-related: big data scientist, software engineer, developer, designer, product manager, etc.  A little strange for a boring old mortgage company, eh?  Rocket has a technology team numbered in the thousands.

Rocket's management team has stated that their capital priorities are 1) reinvesting into the business, 2) strategic M&A, and 3) only then, return of capital to investors.  Given how much money they are making, they could do all like they did earlier this year with the special dividend.

Rocket is clearly focused on tech going forward.  In the past two weeks alone, they have announced several public-private partnerships including backing MSU Apple Developer Academy in Detroit and a partnership between *Rocket Innovation Labs* (yet another ecosystem company) and University of Windsor in Canada.  They have participated in virtually every Investment Bank-sponsored Technology Conference this year.  There are countless others I could mention but you get the point.

**3.  ROCKET AUTO AND ROCKET HOMES: THE LARGEST OPPORTUNITIES YET TO LAUNCH**

Rocket is quietly building massive businesses that could become multibillion standalone businesses.  

**Rocket Auto** currently provides third party technology services, but they are preparing to launch their own managed e-commerce marketplace.  Read from the 1Q21 release:

* *Rocket Auto, our automotive retail marketplace, facilitated the sale of* ***13,600 auto units, up more than 5,300 units, or 65%, as compared to first quarter of 2020****. Gross Merchandise Value for Q1 '21 was $360 million, which represents an annualized run rate of more than $1 billion.*

***ROCKET AUTO IS DOING $1BN OF AUTO SALES ALREADY AND HAVEN'T EVEN LAUNCHED OR MARKETED TO THEIR EXISTING MORTGAGE CUSTOMERS.***   On this topic, Jay Farner said, ""We wanted to construct a business that had all of the appropriate profitability metrics before really leaning in to our client base.""  Rocket Auto also has an existing strategic partnership with Vroom whereby they can earn up to 8.6mm shares in Vroom over 4 years worth about $365MM at today's price.

**Rocket Homes** is a proprietary home search platform and real estate agent referral network which did over **$6BN of transaction volume** in 2020.  It has all of the capabilities of a Zillow or Redfin with Rocket's massive footprint and data trove backing it and it hasn't fully launched.  This is another MASSIVE, sleeper opportunity.  Redfin and Zillow are currently valued at 6-8x *revenue.*

**4.  SOME OF THE SMARTEST TECH INVESTORS HAVE ALREADY BOUGHT IN**

The five largest public holders are Caledonia, Vanguard, Invesco, Blackrock and TCMI.  ***Wait who is TCMI?***  TCMI is an affiliate of [Technology Crossover Ventures](https://www.tcv.com/), one of Silicon Valley's top-tier VC firms.  Yes, one of the leading tech investors in the world held 4,450,000 shares of Rocket as of 3/31/21.

**5.  THE FLYWHEEL EFFECT IS ALREADY PROVING OUT**

If you follow Rocket, you'll hear management talk a lot about [Life-time Value (LTV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_lifetime_value).  This is a term which expresses the net profit earned over a customer over their entire relationship with the company.  **This is what it is all about.**  *Rocket has a customer retention ratio of 91% LTM as of 1Q21 which is roughly 4x the industry average.*  It is not hard to see why this is important.  **Think about those qualities that tech investors look for... ""***growing end market, high ROI economics, market leadership, and sticky and recurring revenue base.****""  Add to that an unrivaled brand, highly profitable existing business to fuel reinvestment, extensive customer base, and 2k+ tech force.***  *""We should be able to look out at every American and target market or have a specific message and value about how we can help them improve on their home, saving money in some way, shape or form, buy a car or help them with a real estate transaction,” Farner said.* ***“When you put those things together, that’s 30 percent of the U.S. GDP that we’re talking about here. All surrounded in a multibillion-dollar brand.”***    

**CONCLUSION**:  Rocket Companies is incredibly cheap for both the existing business at \~9.0x on 2021 consensus EPS and the upside opportunity.  Given the growth opportunities, it should easily command a 2-3x higher multiple as supported by fintech trading comps.  And to top it all off, RKT has tremendous short-term moonshot potential.  Third time is a charm...

I like the ecosystem and have enjoyed apple products. 

REcently, My cameras just random went out on my iphone 12 pro 512gb phone. Ive been working with the apple support team after tmobile sent me there due to a warranty issue. So i chat with apple through support, they give me 3 options. self service, send in for repair or express replacement.  

I ask a lot of questions, because if i can go to a store (self service option) and get a new phone, it will be a lot faster than express replacement. 

(This issue is rather minute, yet when i researched how many people are having their cameras randomly fail on the iphone, i was really stunned). 

So i setup an appointment with Apple to go get a new phone under warranty. The ""Genius,"" at the genius bar informed me that Apple HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED THEIR SERVICE SYSTEMS.  Instead of issuing replacement devices, they have to repair every single device. They have to fix it there and give it back, they're not in the business of replacement devices any more. I still don't believe this, but if it is indeed true. Apple is screwd. 

Here is why apple is screwed. 

After asking this guy a bunch of calibrated questions to get him to bend.. he really wouldn't. So i said fine, fix my cameras. But How can we get this done fast? I own a business and depend on my phone to help all of our flight crew.  

He looked me in the eye and said they don't have the parts and cannot get them for a while. I mentioned how i've seen hundreds of posts on reddit and elsewhere... people who have the same problem that I do. 

&#x200B;

Why is it that Apple cannot get replacement parts? Is the supply chain that bad? 

When i see the scale of the issue by searching online, it really makes me wonder if Apple has caused themselves a serious bottleneck. 

1. They change service to repairs when possible dont' replace...
2. Can't get replacement parts
3. Leave people hanging. 

I know this seems like a hit piece on apple, but as i searched more and more. I realized i'm not jsut one guy with a broken iPhone. 

I'm one guy of 10's of thousands who have a phone more expensive than a laptop and no way to fix it. While this may take months to showcase a real problem over time. It really makes me want to dig into the numbers at apple. No wonder why they are so after service revenue. No repairs. 

Id rather just buy a blackberry and an iTouch and get teh same experience. At least the price will match the expectations."

# How in 1930 Wyckoff Described What's Happening Today

[Richard D. Wyckoff](https://preview.redd.it/r0dndnl3zk671.jpg?width=324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=66b39741d9950f15d90c73b5b49e384104492e03)

**Who Is Wyckoff?**

>*Richard Demille Wyckoff (1873–1934) was an early 20th-century pioneer in the technical approach to studying the stock market. He is considered one of the five “titans” of technical analysis, along with Dow, Gann, Elliott and Merrill. At age 15, he took a job as a stock runner for a New York brokerage. Afterwards, while still in his 20s, he became the head of his own firm. He also founded and, for nearly two decades wrote, and edited The Magazine of Wall Street, which, at one point, had more than 200,000 subscribers. Wyckoff was an avid student of the markets, as well as an active tape reader and trader. He observed the market activities and campaigns of the legendary stock operators of his time, including JP Morgan and Jesse Livermore. From his observations and interviews with those big-time traders, Wyckoff codified the best practices of Livermore and others into laws, principles and techniques of trading methodology, money management and mental discipline.*

**Why I'm Including it in This Post?**

>*From his position, Mr. Wyckoff observed numerous retail investors being repeatedly fleeced. Consequently, he dedicated himself to instructing the public about “the real rules of the game” as played by the large interests, or “smart money.” In the 1930s, he founded a school which would later become the Stock Market Institute. The school's central offering was a course that integrated the concepts that Wyckoff had learned about how to identify large operators' accumulation and distribution of stock with how to take positions in harmony with these big players. His time-tested insights are as valid today as they were when first articulated.*

Basically in 1930 near his death he started writing books about what he learned during his life to make retail investors understand the market better, illustrating all his knowledge in a reddit post is impossible and today I want to focus only on market manipulation.

# Who Is The ""Composite Man""

>*“…all the fluctuations in the market and in all the various stocks should be studied as if they were the result of one man’s operations. Let us call him the Composite Man, who, in theory, sits behind the scenes and manipulates the stocks to your disadvantage if you do not understand the game as he plays it; and to your great profit if you do understand it.”* (*The Richard D. Wyckoff Course in Stock Market Science and Technique*, section 9, p. 1-2) 

Based on his years of observations of the market activities of large operators, Wyckoff taught that:

1. The Composite Man carefully plans, executes and concludes his campaigns.
2. The Composite Man attracts the public to buy a stock in which he has already accumulated a sizeable line of shares by making many transactions involving a large number of shares, in effect advertising his stock by creating the appearance of a “broad market.”
3. One must study individual stock charts with the purpose of judging the behavior of the stock and the motives of those large operators who dominate it.
4. With study and practice, one can acquire the ability to interpret the motives behind the action that a chart portrays. Wyckoff and his associates believed that if one could understand the market behavior of the Composite Man, one could identify many trading and investment opportunities early enough to profit from them.

# The Importance Of Liquidity

Let's say a stock is sitting at $20 but a ""Pro"" thinks it could make it to be worth $40, large investors may not accumulate a high number of shares at one time as this would cause a sudden change in the stock price. Instead they will take advantage of weak market sessions to slowly accumulate their target number of shares.

Once they have accumulated their target number of shares and want to sell for the same reason as before, they can't unload everything at once or they would affect the market again.

But how can they unload their shares at maximum profit? Through manipulation. They can do it by making that shady little company look like it will become the next Apple, and they manipulate the newspapers to do it.

[FOMO](https://preview.redd.it/4ikowb6j5l671.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=949686266619575afa3c565a32df772ddf11aa1b)

They create FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) in small retail investors, and that brings a lot of volume on that stock. If you thought the goal of the market makers was to inflate the stock price through this type of manipulation, you're wrong.

Consider an institutional investor who bought 5,000,000 shares of a company at $1 that now sits at $3, has a lot more information about that company than you do, and knows that company is bad and likely to release bad news in a few weeks. Everyone knows that in order to sell something you need a buyer willing to pay the price you're offering, so how can he dump 5,000,000 shares of stock unnoticed in a few weeks and get away with it? He's going to start making people think that this company has something very big coming up, that he's going to make a 500% move and you're going to miss out. People start ""FOMOing"" and bring huge volume to that stock, with more people willing to buy he can sell all his shares faster and get out of that stock as quickly as possible. He doesn't care if the stock makes a 100% move in the meantime because of this sudden interest, he only cares about getting out. And guess what, later on, when the bad news is released, the market maker will be the winner while a lot of retail investors have been burned.

&#x200B;

>“You have often noticed that a stock will sell at the highest price for many months on the very day when a stock dividend, or some very bullish news, appears in print. **This is not mere accident.**  
>  
>**The whole move is manufactured.** Its purpose is to make money for inside interests — those who are operating in the stock in a large way. And this can only be done by fooling the public, or by inducing the public to fool themselves.”

This was written in 1930! 90 Years ago! Buy the rumour sell the news.

# Market Manipulation 5.0 And How You Are Helping To Make It Happen

After what happened with meme stocks in the last month a lot of people started looking to invest, without any knowledge and trusting the advice of people on reddit and other social media many found themselves losing a lot of money on some stocks that look very good.

&#x200B;

What is happening now is that some big institutions probably pay influencers and use bots to make some companies look much better than they really are. The problem is that many people trust other DDs (Due Diligence) too much and end up thinking that a stock is really good and they buy some stocks. What's worse is that a lot of times people who have invested in some companies end up becoming like extremists and start ""propagandizing"" when they see that they are losing money. 

&#x200B;

Basically what is happening is that I (and probably you too) am noticing a lot of people or groups who buy for example a stock at $10 because it is full of potential (pumped by a market maker) and when they find themselves owning it with a 30% loss they start trying to convince people that it will soon go up. This is ethically wrong and to avoid getting caught in this you should ALWAYS do your research. If you don't know how to research ask the person who posted the sources.

# How Can You Stop Losing Money On Bad Stocks

* Don't trust anyone, do your own research
* Ask for sources from those who publish DDs
* Stay away from stocks that come from scam countries
* If you see a lot of people saying a stock is going to go up stay away
* Don't buy a stock that people say will CERTAINLY have good news coming (example: ""stock X will get FDA approval next week"" usually won't and will fall into oblivion)
* If you're losing on a stock, stop saying on social media that it will surely rebound
* If you buy a stock you MUST stay current on it, you can't just buy and forget about it
* If a stock has a news related to a sector unrelated to it stay away (for example a tourism stock says it will do something in the hot sector of the moment, this is usually done to temporarily pump up the stock)
* SELL THE NEWS

A lot happened this week, yet despite all the turmoil the SPY closed down less than %3 on the week, IWM a little worse off at under %4 and QQQ about unchanged. As we’ll discuss, there’s a different story lurking beneath the surface and it’s questionable just how much this volatility can be contributed to the Fed’s comments on Wednesday.

###Fed Reaction

At the risk of being labelled a Fed apologist, I have to ask what were people expecting? Those recently screeching about inflation risks should be happy: [the Fed has taken note](https://www.ft.com/content/0bf83e29-5ee2-415e-9e03-0edb38218bf3), though sticking to the narrative (seemingly supported by the bond market) that it’s transitory, they are guiding for possible rate hikes in 2023, two years from now. Though this view could change in the coming months as supply chain issues resolve and data “normalizes”, this recent adjustment in guidance shows that the Fed seems to be acknowledging current data and willing to quickly adjust it’s long-term view.  
Like, what more do you people want? This is not a bad thing, and given their current intention is to create some inflation (but not too much), I think they’ve been dead-on in their approach.

###Market Reaction

From a market perspective we had two catalysts this week: the Fed notes on Wednesday and a [quarterly Opex on Friday that involved a massive gamma roll-off](https://spotgamma.com/quad-witching-gamma-pinning/). Both caused noise in the markets and I think it’s important to understand what affected what in order to have an understanding of what to watch in the next week or two.  
To do so, we’ll need to look at the reflation trade that’s recently been in vogue, bonds, and index action.

So, let’s dive in to the charts…

#Charts

Sector Performance  


[Sector Compare 1y](https://imgur.com/OFVxgbz)

[Sector Compare 1m](https://imgur.com/PWNNCE8)  


The last week has marked a significant downturn in certain sectors, specifically those of the reflation trade: XLI, XLF, XLE, IWM all took big hits this week. Zooming in on the chart adds to this story: since the volatility in mid-May they’ve been flat and underperforming with downward momentum picking up into June. All that time, unprofitable growth stocks (represented by ARKK) have been on the up. 

###Reflation Trade Breakdown?

[BCI 1y](https://imgur.com/V4z58Ln)

[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/Lwbe1W2)

For a few weeks now the reflation trade has seemingly stalled. Wednesday and Thursday, quite obviously attributed to the Fed’s commentary, this trade had a major breakdown. Commodities, represented by BCI, which tracks the Bloomberg Commodities / BCOM index, sold off alongside major reflation themes in financials and industrials. Energy slid as well, and IWM (small caps) followed through on that failed breakout. 

Looking to bonds, US10Y yields shot up post-announcement and then came right back down:

But, the action in the 30Y/5Y spreads is what’s most telling, as they got absolutely hammered (flattened) indicating that _“…investors are pulling back on expectations of inflation remaining sticky and are beginning to price in a more benign inflation outlook in line with the Fed’s forecast of a transitory or temporary increase in inflation…”_ (source is marked as spam):

[US30Y less US05Y](https://imgur.com/uSb5asf)

So suddenly the market is realizing the Fed is actually going to react to continued “bad” data (inflation-wise; exactly what we mentioned above) and is pricing that in.

###Opex Volatility

Contrary to the action above, SPY and QQQ held up Wednesday into Thursday and then had moves to the downside Friday (though the latter held up well), which I think is more a result of the massive Gamma roll-off rather than reaction to the Fed.

###Takeaways: Summing It Up

The violent reaction to the Fed’s comments relative to bond spreads and the reflation trade I think is overdone (as usual). It is worrying that this trade has lost steam prior to this week, but the sudden pivot by markets to think that we won’t have any inflation does not line up with what the Fed has been indicating with it’s average inflation targeting - we’ve just gone from the markets thinking the Fed won’t be able to control or prevent runaway inflation to the Fed crushing any inflation at all (i.e. the last decade). I think we’re gonna be somewhere in the middle or the former: wage increases aren’t going to reverse and the Fed wants some inflation stickiness in the short-term - it’s a good thing!We’ll need to watch this trade for the next few weeks to see if it is truly done with or this is just a reactionary pullback.

The Gamma unwind sets us up for possible volatility, and downside risk remains. Analysts have been suggesting a pullback towards the %10 range for some time now, but markets have remained resilient overall. This could continue but the specter seems to loom larger the longer we go. Pullbacks are normally a healthy thing, and a buy-on-dip opportunity if we get one.

Overall, one or two days does not establish a trend and I think  we need to watch closely over the next week or two to see how things resume after this past week’s furor.

#Bonus Charts

In one of my previous posts I highlighted a possible breakout/breakdown in ATVI and APPL respectively and wanted to revisit these charts:

[ATVI 1y](https://imgur.com/rTFKb3d)

[AAPL 1y](https://imgur.com/feHpccF)

ATVI broke above my signal line at the $98-99 range and then immediately broke down [seemingly on news of a delay on a shareholder vote concerning the CEO’s pay package. Not a great look for the stock](https://www.ft.com/content/2049c3fc-bee9-490a-a317-f406a7419d57). 

Meanwhile, AAPL flirted with breaking below it’s 200DMA and then immediately reversed and established an upward trend. It’s hitting resistance around the $130 level, and I’d say we’d need to see this break out above the $135-136 level to be legit.

The disconnect and overvaluation in oil futures is so fucking nonsensical that I would bet come Oct-Nov the average national US gas price will be in the 2.3-2.4 range, if not lower. The disconnect we’re seeing is something I’ve only found 2 other times in the last decade plus. The last time was in 2018. [In June the price average was 2.98, by Christmas and into early 2019 it sat 2.35-2.45.](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=emm_epm0_pte_nus_dpg&f=m) Prior to 2018 it was 2008. A year in which the price of gas topped 4.11 avg. and by the end of the year was sitting in the 1.7-1.9 range, obviously the Great Recession contributed to it. Now here is 2021, the national average in May was 3.07 and the overvaluation is greater than 2018 but not as bad as 2007-2008 appeared. Food for thought.

&nbsp;

Next, the stock market is more overvalued than it has ever been. Ever. The [Total Market to GDP is 198% overvalued](https://www.gurufocus.com/economic_indicators/60/ratio-of-wilshire-5000-over-gnp). For reference ‘Normal’ would be in the 95-120 range. If we look at the Top Stocks by Index weight the sign is not pretty. Tesla has begun it’s crack and it may just be a matter of weeks before its 50 Avg. falls below its 200 Avg. (for the dumb, that ain’t good.) Amazon and Apple have somewhat plateaued in recent months and show signs that a regress is in store. Basically the big weights holding this shit together is looking not good. We can take a look at the Dow and SP500 individually and it tells roughly the same story with the both taking a dump in the last few days.

&nbsp;


[The Fed has already begun to say the will not hike rates next year](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/feds-kashkari-opposed-to-rate-hikes-at-least-through-2023.html), we’re walking on egg shells and nobody anywhere is doing anything worthwhile to prepare for the worst. We’re using a condom we know has a hole in it we put there and know the partner isn’t on birth control. We’re playing with fire and about to get burnt, well poor people mostly because I’m sure they will take the majority of the blame with [the BS stories they’re pushing with UI benefits.](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/07/truth-behind-unemployment-benefits-myth)

&nbsp;


Basically I am expecting over the course of the next year or so for the beginning of a recession on par with or worse than 2008. I believe 2020 will be looked at as the body ache before the actual flu sets in. The signs are all there and will just become solidified over the coming months. Early this year the war was on Short Sellers now it needs to be on the bullish and the greedy because they and the current system are going to fuck us all over even more. Just my two cents."

The new apple smart product the iTub. Ran by a legendary Chad…who we all aspire to be. iTub was very big talk on wsb and Reddit the past week but has since gone dark. 
Why?

Because no one has enough to say about it for their post to not get removed…

Anyways, those 7/16 8c whale orders everyone was talking about are down about 50% now. I myself have 307 7/16 8c at .09 a contract so I’m down about 54% or $1,500. But….

I’m not worried at all. Anyone holding these calls will see significant upside in the 7+ $range. Whales don’t buy calls to lose money, right?

iTub has decided to contest the allegations of currency manipulation that’s supposed to cost them a trillion dollars or whatever.

When we look at the chart, we see an upwards channel that has created higher highs and higher lows. This is Brazilian banking beginning to come out of the covid crash. Rates were just raised, Buffett is betting on Brazil, the CEO is named Chad, and whales are betting on this stock that also has roughly 20% short interest. This could easily move to the 7+ range in the next few weeks and I’m sure we are going to get some sort of news in that time period.

TLDR: Chad=iTub

Positions even though I already said it:

307 7/16 8c. They are cheap af so pick up some lottos while you can."

edit\* Here's a scratch off ticket:

**Key words to understand:**

**Inflation-** Things cost more, the purchasing power of the dollar is less. You probably already notice that  materials have cost more. Inflation as mentioned by the FEDs is temporary and here to stay, for now. Think materials like stock, people hoard, lack of supply, lumber hits $1000 per 1000 ft. The overestimated inflation is now coming back to to find a midpoint. Because inflation is here we need to take a look at the return on investments.

&#x200B;

>!Inflation short term, it's already here! Commodities are dumping from being over inflated. With inflation being here, better make sure you beat inflation.!<

&#x200B;

**Interest Hike** \- Everyone is talking about whether or not JPOW is going to raise interest rates to counter inflation. By raising rates you would make people spend less because you get more of a return from savings than spending. If people spend less, then demand goes and deflation will occur.

>!Interest rate hikes adjust from 2024 to 2023. More inflation?! Possibly, but the 5 year yields are going up and the 30 year yields are going down. More return on investments for 5 year vs 30 year. What does this mean?! Borrowing short term money will cost you more than borrowing long term money. The 5 year and 30 year. Growth is slowing so you get punished for not growing. With the rates of 5 years going up to pass the 30 year, an economic slow down is suggested. Better make sure you beat that short term treasury rate.!<

&#x200B;

**Reverse Repo-** June just provided the highest reverse repo of all time. Reverse repo is the buying of securities or equities and and promising to only sell them at a higher price. Think stocks now. Where will money go if you are guaranteeing you'll only sell at a higher price.

>!Repos and reverse repos are short term borrowed money. With such high reverse repos, better make sure you beat that increased short term borrow rate.!<

&#x200B;

**TOUR OF CASINO**

You walk into the casino, the thermostat is set at a mild temperature. Maybe a little too warm. The lights turn on. There is suddenly a halt and an announcement that there are table staff changes.

&#x200B;

Let's take a tour of the casino and look at the systems in the casino and see where we are positioned.

**Slots** (>!Dividend Stocks!<): People tend to like dividend stocks because the companies pay you for holding the shares. Dividends generally pay 2-4%. The issue here is that in an economic slow down, companies may see a reduced revenue and the dividend payout might not beat the interest rates. If you get 2% in a savings account, why risk the biscuit for the dividend?

**Roulette** (>!Defense Pharma & Research Heavy Stocks!<): To save money during inflation, there are generally budget cuts to stop spending. This affects the defense sector in many ways. Future grants are generally pulled and R&D is usually cut.

**Craps** (>!ETFs, recovery, inelastic holdings!<): Not sure what to hold, want to be safe, let someone else do it for you. ETFs generally hold some form of dividend stock or businesses that stay flat for stable growth. At times like this where there are still better investments on the table like hiked treasuries, foreign investments, and growth stonks. Who likes watching money burn in ETFs? Talk about .5% fees.

**Blackjack (**>!Meme stocks, trenders!<**):** Memes don't last forever, but we will forever remember the meme. The come and go, that's just the way it is. Big money, small money, no money, doesn't ever want to bag hold. Just here to win it and make a killing. With money moving away from the stock market going out, volume will be a lot less. It's one on one with the dealer. How many hands do you want to play?

**Poker (**>!Growth Stocks!<**):**  So you're telling me growth stocks don't need to spend much on R&D?! YES! Let's narrow down the list that has shown exceptional growth. Got dealt two aces, might as well push everyone else out. Ace 1( Growing Revenue YoY), Ace 2 (Growing footprint YoY)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Which game do you want to play? Seems like the casino is shutting down some of it's services and the others don't have many players.

&#x200B;

**I can't bluff well so I'm going to try the games:**

**Slots** You start playing and accumulate into year 2030. >!You're finally at your breakeven point, the bullmarket starts. Oh the joy of saving and making null.!<

&#x200B;

**Roulette** baby, here we go! Yolo is the only way of life, either get rich or die trying. >!You died!<

&#x200B;

**Craps.** Throw ten darts and land three, win some lose some. It's only money. Time to roll the dice. You start winning, then you start losing. Then you win some more. >!Radioshack bled out by accident. Fuck my life.!<

&#x200B;

**Blackjack**. Man, I don't really want to play alone, let's find a crowd.>! You find a good seat with a lot of players. The table suddenly goes out of service. You panic and rush to the nearest one and go all in. You died.!<

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ah.... you chose (**Poker)**

Not a bad choice. Fun game.

Let's look at what growth stocks there are that are generating great income and expanding the foot print.

There's large caps like: >!SQ, FB, NFLX, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN!<

There's small and mid caps like: >!FVRR, ETSY, PINS!<

There's proven foreign growth investments like: >!BABA, JD, TSM!<

There's semis who can't meet current demand: >!AMD, NVDA!<, >!oops \~\~INTC drank one too many drinks \~\~!<

&#x200B;

14 choices!? So many to choose from! Takes step back. (**over 9000 tickers**)

&#x200B;

**I'll buy the dip, no worries**....  >!who says there will have to be a dip for growth stocks?!<"

o2sa3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o2sa3e/knowbe4_knbe_cybersecurity_awareness_testing/,KnowBe4 - KNBE - Cybersecurity Awareness Testing & Training - Virtually No Discussion,15,38,2021-06-18 23:52:36,"This is not financial advice, I am retarded. I tried to time the bottom on the tech correction with calls and got bogged. I own shares of KNBE.

KNBE - Everyone is sleeping on this stock and this sector.

Sector DD:

As in industry insider (systems engineer) I am finding that cybersecurity insurance companies are cracking down on practices and minimum prevention standards. I've seen multiple customers of ours edged into security testing + training by the insurance company telling them its mandatory. The insurers seem to get more strict with every major breach - and we just had a nuclear weapons company breached this week.

My investing theory for 2021 is that insurance companies are going to compel massive amounts of cybersecurity spending and produce huge earnings reports.

If you're on LinkedIn, you might have noticed job alerts for cybersecurity jobs have gone up triple or quadruple since January as companies scramble to not be the next one on cable news for getting bogged by eastern european glow in the dark boys.

KNBE DD:

\- Barely recognized, almost zero results searching WSB or Reddit as a whole.

\- Good market cap but almost no volume.

\- Recent IPO - only two quarters. Price discovery still taking place.

\- Doesn't even have options yet.

\- Widely considered the industry leader for email phishing test campaigns.

\- HQ'd in Florida. Most employees are Florida Man / Florida Woman.

\- 45% rev growth YoY

\- Turned profitable this year - positive EPS

\- Financials: [https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/KNBE/financials](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/KNBE/financials)

The product: The main product is email phish testing. Fake scam emails sent out by IT meant to get Karen in HR to click on free Apple giftcards / etc. Some more advanced and believable templates as well and the ability to customize them to internal company branding / terminology.

They also have awareness training to remediate staff and departments that are falling for the scam emails, or to proactively introduce employees to email security concepts.

I did a short trial run with them for a few clients a year ago and was impressed with the platform. I also tried Microsoft's 365 equivalent.

Risks:

\- Not a monopoly. Already other companies in the same security awareness / testing space.

\- Competitors includes Microsoft - premium Exchange 365 licensing grants a similar but much less developed product amongst other security tools - but minus the remediation training.

\- The greatest risk from MSFT is that companies may ""already be paying for"" their phish testing tool as part of existing security licenses - similar to business onedrive / sharepoint vs dropbox.

\- First DD I ever posted so it's probably shit.

\- Stock already up 60% this week, might correct.  


tl;dr: Insurance companies are making small/midsize businesses spend money on cybersecurity and getting more strict about payouts. KnowBe4 has a good product and a first mover advantage. They're profitable already. Almost zero social media sentiment or press around KNBE and no options - this feels to me like an early bird special.

The daily suppression and manipulation of CLOV by the hedges is well known, and there are plenty of DD’s on why CLOV will surpass $50-150+ in the short-midterm. However, I’m not going to get into that. My goal with this post is to explain how CLOV is revolutionizing the healthcare industry, much like TSLA did in the auto industry, and give my perspective on why it will outperform its competitors.

**TL;DR - First, intro - they’re changing the game just like Tesla did back in the day. Next, they’re growing, but the haters gon hate. Why? Because CLOV is the first of its kind and troglodytes hate change! Wrap it up - be dead inside, cuz studies show the highest returns went to people who are dead or forgot their account.**

**This is 10% Luck, 20% Skill**

Have you or a loved one ever gone to the doctor more than once to get a diagnosis for a problem you can’t figure out? The doctor reviews your file each time, but always gives the same answer: “Let’s do another test. I’ll refer you to…” It seems like you’re never making progress because either your doctor has run out of ideas or isn’t familiar enough with your medical history. Now imagine an elderly person navigating this same system, trying to remember what tests they’ve had done and their results on their own. This is impossibly difficult for anyone to deal with, and it’s exactly the problem Clover Health is trying to solve.

Their AI learning and database, Clover Assistant, make it easier for providers to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive lab testing, repetitive diagnoses, and it consolidates a patient’s medical history into one platform. This not only saves the patient headaches from navigating our decentralized healthcare system, but it also saves both patients and insurance companies an enormous amount of money by avoiding duplicated efforts.

**15% Concentrated Power of Will**

Clover Assistant is offered for free, and currently they’re taking a yearly net loss to improve their AI, which will eventually pay off just like Tesla’s AI. One problem they may face in future is their competitors integrating machine learning into their platforms as well, but by then Clover will be years ahead of them with no hope of any of them catching up.

**5% Pleasure, 50% Pain**

Last week CLOV announced new partnerships with [Upward Health](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/upward-health-announces-contract-clover-124500091.html) and the [U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/09/2244291/0/en/Clover-Health-to-Scale-In-home-Primary-Care-Program-Through-Direct-Contracting.html), expanding their in-home and virtual service offerings. Considering the trend towards virtual healthcare, this is extremely good news and helps strengthen its fundamentals/growth. Everyone can clearly see how well Teladoc is doing with their in-home service, and this integration will only continue to improve and expand as they cater to our convenience/laziness. This is not priced in due to the volatility in the stock market.(Sidenote: If Hindenturd’s claims were even remotely true, CLOV would not be expanding their partnership with Medicaid/Medicare only for it to fizzle out in a year.) Besides, with all the fear of inflation, it’s important to remember that healthcare companies do really well during inflationary periods, unlike most other industries.

In spite of the evidence of growth, you’ll continue to hear nothing but bad press about CLOV, particularly being compared to its competitors. These comparisons are nonsensical for multiple reasons: first, this is not an outdated, dying business, it has a real future in the rapidly growing healthcare tech industry. Secondly, none of CLOV’s competitors currently integrate machine learning into their platform and are still using archaic methods of service delivery. Similarly, TSLA had bad PR almost daily when constantly compared to regular auto makers, even as the company continued to roll out new and improved technology like their autonomous driving tech. I did not let the bad press deter me from purchasing TSLA for $38-40 per share (price after split), and as the market and media has realized the nuance and innovation of the company my conviction paid off. CLOV is the same - it’s not just a regular health insurance company, it’s a disruptive tech company that uses AI to enhance its database for more profitable and superior care for their future growth. (Sidenote - One of my favorite investors Baillie Gifford has 5 million shares of CLOV, and he bought 2.3 million shares of TSLA at $8 a share during its bearish news cycle period.)

Circling back, why do so many analysts have negative sentiment towards Clover Health? It’s because they’re constantly comparing it to the outdated healthcare insurance companies, the same exact way Tesla was compared to Ford, GM, Toyota, and Nissan. In Tesla’s time, there was nothing else to compare it to - Tesla was the only one of its kind in its sector. Heck, Tim Cook wouldn’t even meet with Elon when he tried to sell his company to Apple for pennies on the dollar in 2018. Imagine passing on what would become a trillion dollar company - **MISSED OPPORTUNITY EEEEEK.** 

If the negative press was so convincing, it begs the question why didn’t institutions and Chamath dump some or all their shares at $28 per share? Because they’re not paperhand losers. These institutions rarely sell their stocks for a 2-3x return; when they invest, they’re looking to hold long for a much, much greater return. They base their investment decisions on solid fundamentals, therefore if they are still holding CLOV the company must have a legitimate future of success. **Institutions are not emotional.** Retail investors, on the other hand, are the real paperhands. Many get in for the short-term, make 100% return, give away 30% to Uncle Sam, and leave with 70% in change. This isn’t a bad return at all by any means, but a lot is left on the table when one makes emotional decisions. Take a look at any successful company and their stock volatility over its lifetime, and you’ll see MANY major dips. Folks who sold on those dips are probably filled with regret, but the Buffets of the world, who are dead inside, have reaped the rewards.

*""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""* 

* Warren Buffett

**And 100% Reason to Remember the Name (CLOVER HEALTH!)**

Like I said before, I’m not here to talk about the short-mid term potential of CLOV $100+, but rather the long-term potential of CLOV $100+. If y’all have been following Chamath as I have, you’ll know he's known for making conservative valuations. In 2018, he said Tesla would triple... it actually went 22.5x at its peak (currently at 15x). Whether you like the guy or not, he has a stellar track record. On top of that, he is one of the very few who stood with retail investors against market manipulation. This short-term volatility doesn’t deter me - I am long on this company, and will not sell my position for a measly 2-3x gain.

I’ll leave you with what I think is the most succinct outlook on Clover Health that’s been shared.

*“So when you bring all of this forward and you think about the future, here’s what I see in a nutshell: Number one… is a business that is actually delivering the promise of technology improving better outcomes and lowering costs in healthcare. Number two is a market that I think is huge and growing quickly. And number three is a business that is consistently taking share year over year over year. And so when you put all of these things together, in my opinion, this is one of the most straightforward investments I’ve ever made. It’s a business that I think will become extremely valuable. It will build a lot of enterprise value, and will be what I think is going to be our next 10x in 10 years investment.”*

The following is not financial advice.  I just love Daddy Karp, Daddy Thiel, and the PLTR Stock.

We all know **Daddy Karp.**  This is him forcing his employees to engage in combat dancing or some shit...right, lets carry on.

[Daddy Alex Karp is a character, PERFECT for the memes.](https://preview.redd.it/agr1i21kjq571.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7bf213a80de565ca37a90823e90e60d97c61e95b)

**So why does this matter?**  Because Daddy Karp is a founder and one of two influencial arms of Plantir.  He is the negotiator for one side of american politics.

This matters because PLTR relies on large govt. contracts and MUST maintain a neutral political position.

It's other founder is Peter Thiel, or **Daddy Thiel.**  You might say he is a powerful man, and he handles the other side of american politics.

[Thiel is an extremely influential and powerful billionaire contrarian known for playing 3D chess and looking decades out...PLTR is his baby.](https://preview.redd.it/knpdewpcht571.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e83e232d334be4533531385d1ed5fe15e8297495)

&#x200B;

**Why does the govt. buy their software?**

Their software can take unbelievable amounts of video data, and give predictions on where enemies might attack, and various other events on a battlefield like it's a videogame.  The **CIA** helped them create their technology, and **SOCOM** just renewed a $300M a year contract with them.  These orgs. don't buy anything that doesn't work.

&#x200B;

[This shit looks like it's out of the movies, or a real time strategy game.  It works and it forms the backbone of US military operations.  It also transfers very well to the enterprise software space...](https://preview.redd.it/a3kgc5j2pq571.jpg?width=1555&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9680a8142d5345a5b694a4467cb2af3387e20f4)

This is just one use case; their engineers have been refining this tech for 17 years where they could create a secret moat.  In-fact, Peter Thiel himself has a book and has given speeches on the power of moats and ""not competing, but forming a monopoly.""  Zero to One.

**So why all this info?  It's critical to understand the facts I am about to present to you.**

With a ton of hype, and plenty of meme power, PLTR rose to past $40 a share earlier this year.

Most if not all did not truly understand how special the technology was, and it fell on FUD surrounding stock based compensation and Daddy Karp selling shares.  We will get to this FUD at the end.

W**hy it's special:**

**MOAT:  I see people say, ""it's just data analytics, anyone can compete with them."" no.**

This is like people saying, ""it's just an airplane copy it and it should fly great.""  An analytics platform that is able to ""gameify"" real world problems in real time and present solutions using integrated Ai/ML is a MASSIVE engineering problem.  Think, a ton of PHD level skilled engineers making the highest salaries in Tech.  So much, that they can retire after a few years if they want.  Now imagine them working for 17 years on something before any other company even thinks to start competing.  This is a bigger moat than many darlings of the tech world have in their software, such as TSLA, which had google, apple, etc. working on competing solutions for years.  And it has saved it's clients MILLIONS in Skywise.  For anyone in the software space; you know how brutal implementation is for SAP and similar platforms.  Often it's unsuccessful and expensive.  PLTR is already demonstrating PROFITABLE implementations.  This is a sign of a massive moat for anyone who understands the enterprise software world.

[This is just a summary of one application of PLTR's Skywise platform; built on Foundry.  They are going to do this to every industry; true prescriptive analytics with rapid deployment of a custom solution.  If you understand that, it's insane.  If you don't, ask a friend that is intelligent and knows about software.](https://preview.redd.it/eg2qwmim1r571.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=26b9bdc63c34c5ad1b0fab1bfafe473444e34ee6)

**Earnings Expectations:  They are Sandbagging Sons of Bitches**

Right now we are pricing Palantir at about 40X revenue as a SAAS company.  Their margins aren't the best as they continue to invest and maintain future monopoly status, but they are landing $300M govt. deals (SOCOM) and expanding that business which is EXTREMELY STICKY.

Their revenue growth officially is about 30% per year.

However, as all SAAS companies do, internally they have a goal/target of around 50% per year.  That is absolutely achievable, in fact a few large deals can accomplish this, AND MUCH MORE.  I would argue this in itself is sandbagging due to the potential size of their enterprise deals (just ONE big deal would annihilate that number) and they have been offering their product for literally less than a year now...

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[With two Daddy's like this, what could go wrong?  Why is PLTR hated by the media?](https://preview.redd.it/wuid619x4r571.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=998b2feb59674afacc6dad5b7217cbde56e98e0c)

**FUD:  What could go wrong, why has the stock dropped after it's meteoric rise?**

&#x200B;

1. **It's custom software! That's expensive, time consuming, hard to scale!  Companies won't buy it.**

SAP is horrible and it's implemented all the time, takes years to implement, costs HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS to implement, and is often not successful.  It's actually a running joke in the enterprise software world.  Palantir has a history of successful implementations (it's custom but designed so low-code it can be developed and delivered quickly in any enterprise), a testament to the 17 years that Karp and Thiel spent training their team in high gravity (lul).  **This is like a SMART salesforce, which by the way, was the fastest growing software company IN HISTORY and is worth $400B now, and it has competition in the CRM space.  PLTR is the next evolution, and has ZERO competition.**

Salesforce was created to be a single source of truth in an enterprise.  Pltr takes that a step further by allowing you to simply plug in business units and allow it to act as your “sky net” and tell you what to do.  It literally is that incredible.  It’s true mass available prescriptive analytics, sprinkled across an entire company.

**Is it unreasonable to think the mkt cap of pltr could be a multiple of salesforce in the near future when it is the next evolution of data platforms, has no competition, and salesforce previously held the record for fastest growing software company in history?**

&#x200B;

**2.   Daddy Karp made the most of any CEO this year and he sold hundreds of millions of shares!**

The way he is paid, his Stock granted is income.  So he pays TAXES on it.  That means he has to sell shares just to cover the taxes so he doesn't go to federal prison.  The dude can't pay it any other way he doesn't have hundreds of millions of dollars laying around...he's spent 17 years building this as his baby.  This is all stupid media FUD because it makes awesome headlines and scares the shit out of boomers that aren't used to the financing around an insanely fast growing software company.  The numbers look crazy on the surface but make sense once you realize it's all because of the meteoric rise in the stock price.

**3.  They are compensating their employees with Stock! It Dilutes us!**

They are hiring the worlds best software engineer PHD Data Scientists to make sure their moat and monopoly doesn't even come close to being encroached on.  These people are expensive.  They continually train their models in their client's environments, without keeping their clients data, only evolving their own model.  This maintains privacy and creates momentum for their algorithm that makes it impossible to catch up to PLTR's Foundry.  Think google with their threatgraph for search.  They have too much data and too much time refining their algorithms for anyone to catch them in that category.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Price Targets:**

&#x200B;

[Holy Fucking Shit, look at that Q1 rev. growth despite being brand new to enterprise...](https://preview.redd.it/rkgyuszcuq571.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=14ea1be3ff5dbdbadd731a7ae8a69d94fcabe713)

If they grow at the internal, non-sandbagged rate they think they will hit **according to internal docs shared with public (google Q4 2020 PLTR business update, can't link).**

They will have $4B in revenue, in 4 years.  Imagine in 4 years, if a SAAS company was priced at just 10x Revenue with 50% + growth yoy....which will accelerate as proof of concept is demonstrated at large orgs.

**My price target is $80 EOY** because I believe at least one HUGE contract will roll in that will provide further proof of FOUNDRY as a concept and the impact will be undeniable.  Companies will be lining up to get Foundry and projected demand will show implied growth off the charts that no one has accounted for.  The Skywise project finalized my opinion on this, PLTR told them WHEN VALVES IN ENGINES WERE BEHAVING ODDLY AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED PRIOR TO FAILURE, OPTIMALLY, TO SAVE MILLIONS A YEAR PER AIRLINE IN SCHEDULING AND OTHER COSTS you can read about that on another subreddit, the info is out there if you do a google search on skywise.

**Price target in 4 years: $500.**  Because I think revenue growth will be more like salesforce was as a necessary platform to enterprises.  This would give it a larger MKT cap than Salesforce.  **If this becomes a hyped meme to add fueld to the fire, it will accelerate beyond what we can even comprehend, TESLA style.  Just the US GOVT. alone will be TRILLIONS of dollars potentially as they are investing trillions in Ai software solutions over the next 20 years.**   [Forbes GSA Article 2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2020/08/16/how-the-us-government-is-using-ai-to-help-procure-trillions-of-dollars-of-products-and-services-an-interview-with-keith-nakasone-gsa/?sh=22a1193670ac)  [2021 Article about AI spending push..$Trillions with PLTR as the clear leader](https://www.nextgov.com/cio-briefing/2021/04/biden-budget-requests-major-investments-federal-technology-and-cybersecurity/173262/)

**if this happens....then.....**

**Possible Price Target with hype and diamond hands TSLA style = $1000** when everyone figures out this Stock is literally magic because it will be bigger than google.  It's data analytics and threat-graph will be more useful to smart money and BIG money than google and it will rule the world.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Conclusion:** Both Daddy's have spent 17 years using the most advanced govt. resources (U.S. DOD spends the most on R&D of any industry or company in the world...by FAR) to craft a secret Ai/ML platform that allows companies and Govts. to play Starcraft in real-life, with WALLHACKS on that tell them what their opponent is going to do, and what they need to do to stay competitive.  They released  at the perfect time by going public when it was ready to scale and unable to be dethroned.

**This software will be mandatory for most large companies just to be competitive.**

**My positions:** 25x 40C 366 DTE, 762 shares at $24.57.  This is my entire account, i've seen enough to be 100% sure I don't need to day or swing trade anymore.  That $11k avail is just margin, i'm out of cash, this is how it displays in the TDA-TOS app.  I'm all in on this.  I actually want more leaps but I only have $26 dollars left in cash so I will buy 1 more share.

&#x200B;

[Based on my positions and an addiction to optionsprofitcalculator.com, I will make millions if the $500 thesis comes true in the next year.  in fact, at this thesis approx. 25 leaps worth $6k right now would make someone a millionaire.  Is that worth the gamble to you?](https://preview.redd.it/5jkde0871r571.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ac3de19f0e926adfe500397910270389bbce4d1)

o1lrzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o1lrzx/xpev_dd_a_true_evav_company/,$XPEV DD - A True EV/AV Company,27,31,2021-06-17 10:08:26,"In the EV Market, there are an increasing number of players vying for market share, so how is one to know which is the company to own if they wanted to consider investing?
 
The answer is simply....research. And today, I'd like to share some of my own thoughts based on the research I have done to date.
 
1. Tesla has arguably been the King in the EV Space for some time now and minted some individuals a tidy profit if they stuck with the company through thick and thin. Being first in this space from a mass production standpoint, has worked well for them. However the crown is starting to tarnish. 
There are quality concerns, and recently the Model 3 lost Consumer Reports Top Pick Status and IIHS Safety Award after stripping features. Safety concerns with the Model 3 is a big PR problem especially in the world's largest market...China. 

China is also worried about government employees owning Teslas due to perceived security concerns with surveillance. 

One also must acknowledge that Tesla makes its money, not from selling cars, but from the ""regulatory credits"" it gets from governments around the world in their push to reduce carbon emissions. Since Tesla only sells electric vehicles, they get these credits for free and can sell them at a huge profit to other auto manufacturers who can't meet environmental targets. It's big $ for Tesla, but what one cannot look away from is the fact that Tesla IS NOT profitable from selling its cars. At least, not yet.

2. Now on to Chinese Car manufacturers...and there are quite a few. The big names are Buffet-loved and held, BYD. Li Auto which is relatively new, NIO which has some similar roots to Xpeng Motors, but isn't the same. All mentioned here are true EV plays.

Xpeng/Tesla, and the race to autonomous driving. 

3. Autonomous Vehicles is truly the next play in this market and a necessary move for vehicles to go in. Removing driver error is huge for safety and will save insurance companies a TON of money. And in the AV space, the race is between Tesla and Xpeng.

4. Not long ago, Musk charged Xpeng for stealing proprietary tech after a senior engineer left Tesla to join the Xpeng Team. Same was said about a senior Apple engineer who left Apple's Car R&D division and joined Xpeng as well. Tesla sued the engineer and the linchpin was on the AV tech housed in Xpeng's XPILOT software. Tesla argued that their tech was in their software. 
In the end, both companies agreed to allow an independent tech arbitrator to view both company's AV source code, and guess what....it was proven that both Tesla and Xpeng have their own source codes that were designed by their own R&D efforts, and nothing was stolen or was being shared. That was BIG News!!

5. Xpeng in the quest toward Phase 5 self driving cars, liked the safety and accuracy that LiDar tech provides. Musk, on the other hand, scoffed at LiDar for years calling it a 'fool's' play. However, years later, Musk is now conceding there is something to LiDar and may even be developing with it.

But here is the rub, Xpeng has it, is using it, and their software works very very well with all the various sensors combined. Their new model, the P5, was showcased at the Shanghai Auto Show, complete with LiDar, and that show gave Xpeng 10,000 pre orders on reveal day alone. I can only imagine how that number has grown since, and in October, deliveries begin.

6. Xpeng has a new manufacturing facility set to go online in December of this year which will ramp up the ability to produce more cars. In 2022, they also have plans for 2-3 new models, one of which will be a new SUV type.

7. In the race toward full autonomous vehicle capabilities, Xpeng is targeting 2025 as the year for this to be fully operational, safe and complete. That said, they are logging thousands upon thousands of accident free XPILOT driver assisting kilometers with their cars doing a lot of the driving without needing help from the driver. No sleeping behind the wheel yet, but they are charting a significant course towards getting this done!

Tesla? Well...when was the last time you heard of an accident or life lost? Probably not long ago, so they still have  a long ways to go I think, and now Musk is backpeddling on his timelines for full AV capabilities. 

SCALE 

8. Like China or not, with the GREEN push throughout the world and everything drivable going electric, there really is only ONE country that can help to meet the demand...China. They are a manufacturing powerhouse, and Xpeng is ramping up to get the world and humanity, the cars they need.

SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE

9. A big hope for Tesla is that they can sell the software for their cars to have the capabilities they “can"" have. You want software assisted driving? That’s going to cost you like 4 grand as an option. It’s smart, if it works well.
Xpeng has a similar hope, but is really successful already in this strategy. They also deploy OTA upgrades on what seems to be a weekly basis almost, which is exciting like when your phone gets an Over-the-Air update and new features, that same excitement is happening with XPeng’s car owners, and it is translating into more sales. 

And while we are on the topic of sales, you can’t help but notice that Xpeng was the first Chinese EV Car company to start selling vehicles in Europe in Norway, and plan to expand their distribution in more parts of Europe before the year is over. 

In Conclusion...
 
Xpeng is an impressive company with huge goals for itself and they make technologically superior vehicles from many different angles. Entertainment, Drivability, Safety, Comfort, etc.
 
I remember reading a quote of a comment that He Xiaopeng (Xpeng CEO and Founder) said to Musk, and it went something like this...""We will destroy you in China, and we will be an absolute nuisance to you in Europe,"" and I think it won't be long, if not already, that He Xiaopeng lives up to his statement. 
 
Xpeng is worth a serious look and currently has price targets north of $50 USD. A great opportunity for a company of purchasing value today. Do your own research and I think you will come to see the true Tesla competitor, if not successor!

The biggest financial services company in Brazil welcomed new CEO Milton Maluhy Filho. Just 44 years old, Maluhy took over from retiring Candido Bracher, and becomes the youngest bank boss in Brazil.


Despite their tremendous market power, Brazil's giant banks did not move to take advantage of the rapid spread of broadband internet and smartphones across the continent in the early 2010s.

That is all about to change.  Itaú has now launched app adapted for the M1 chip.  Since the first Macs with an M1 chip hit the market, Itaú customers were basically unable to access their accounts from their computer using the app — having to use only the iOS app or, of course, the browser. **This week, the bank released a version of the App Itaú no Computer duly adapted for Apple.**  (For Macs, two independent versions of the app are available for download: one for Intel (compatible with macOS 10.12 Sierra or higher) and one for M1 (compatible only with macOS Big Sur 11).

MOREOVER:  Itaú has partnered with fintech Rappi to provide greater access to financial services and products for retail and mass affluent clients in Chile. The agreement will allow customers to access the Brazilian bank and asset manager’s investment strategies digitally through Rappi’s phone app. 


MAINTAINING CONTROL OVER SMALL BUSINESS MARKET CAP: In Brazil, Itaú and Omie launch support platform for small and medium-sized businesses. The platform, called Itaú My Business, will feature several services for entrepreneurs, such as sales and service order management, financial management, automatic invoice issue, and integration with accountants.

CHAD CEO:

Brazil’s Itau Unibanco Holding SA will be more active in making acquisitions and forming partnerships with smaller competitors this year, Chief Executive Milton Maluhy told journalists on Wednesday. The bank is eying deals with companies in sectors such as payments and investments, he added, which will complement the portfolio of Brazil’s largest lender. Itau’s chief financial officer, Alexsandro Broedel, said that despite fierce competition, the bank sees its net interest income growth accelerating by year-end, with trading gains reaching the upper part of the outlook range, close to 6.4 billion reais ($1.26 billion).


WHO IS MILTON?  Milton Maluhy Filho became a director on January 1, 2019.  Previously, he was CEO of Rede S.A. (former Redecar S.A.), a card-processing subsidiary, and Executive Director at Itaú Unibanco, responsible for the management of the credit card segment and retail store alliances.  Prior to joining the bank, he worked at J.P. Morgan, Crédit Commercial de France (CCF Brazil) and Lloyds.

Cause personally it's been far too many times for me and that's why I have developed a plan to finally make enough tendies to retire off of.

Fuck squeezes I've had it with those DDs and honestly, I don't think buying a stock bc another idiot dumber than you told you about the new Tesla he bought with AMC tendies is a good investment thesis. Instead, I want to invest in something real, something that has a backbone in the actual world that isn't empty movie theaters, and that something is the TESLA your fellow ape just copped.

Back in the day (1 yr ago) when there were only 1 million retards instead of 10, an individual known as u/WSBgod  showered us with his glorious TSLA gain porn.  Today I am going to tell you why and how you can get your own glorious TSLA gain porn and finally fuck your own wife for once.

&#x200B;

DD: The only reason TSLA has the market cap it has today is the potential it has in the autonomous driving market. If TSLA was only priced for cars it sold it wouldn't be a multi-billion dollar company, worth more than every other automaker. This is because TSLA isn't just an automaker and realizing this will be your greatest asset. **High conviction in a stock strengthens the diamond hands holding it!** Anyway, Musk himself believes that when they solve FSD (Full Self Driving) and update all their cars overnight to be able to drive autonomously that TSLA will see the **largest overnight asset increase in history**. IDK about you but that sounds way better than a squeaker screaming ""squeeze"" about the latest stock they saw on somebody's shirt. Elon has reiterated in earnings calls that he is extremely confident they will solve FSD this year and my own knowledge of watching FSD driving videos they have now along with Elon saying the next new update has 100s of improvements and is supposedly coming out this month tells me that autonomy is much closer than most people realize.   

TLDR: FSD --> Stock to the Moon

DD: Pretend everything I just told you is a lie and TSLA never has autonomous driving ever, is the company now worthless? No. TSLA announced and showed on their Battery Day all the manufacturing and engineering improvements they made to producing batteries which reduce the battery cost by almost 2/3rds (66%). They already have a pilot plant of these new battery cells along with new battery production plants being build at their new Gigafactories in Austin and Berlin. Hopefully, by now you can tell the world is transitioning to sustainable energies and EVs are becoming much more prevalent across society. All the EVs made by other car companies will require battery packs to make and operate. The only problem is these other car companies do not have the battery technology that TSLA has. Currently, TSLA is unable to produce cars like the SEMI due to a lack of batteries as they wish to prioritize vehicles with a smaller battery pack like the 3 and Y. Once they get all their battery plants online they will produce more cars than they ever have, along with SEMIS and CYBERTRUCKS. Other car manufacturers will run into the problem TSLA is in right now. They will not have the batteries to produce all the vehicles they want to make and if they try buying excess amounts of batteries that are 200% more expensive than the batteries TSLA is using they will not be able to keep up in margins/ pricing. ( This is why the high-end F-150 Lighting is more expensive than the high-end Cybertruck)

TLDR: Batteries --> Stock to the Moon

DD: Pretend everything I just told you is a lie and TSLA never has autonomous driving and they blow up all their own battery facilities, is the company now worthless? No. TSLA has all the top engineers in the world working for them (this is an underrated aspect of the company in my opinion) and they employ these engineers to do whatever they need to be done. One important team working for TSLA right now is the AI team. TSLA is currently in the development of **DOJO,** a neural net trainer. I'm not gonna pretend to know everything about this because it is way beyond my realm of understanding but what I do know is that **AI runs on DATA.** The more data you have to train your NN, the smarter your AI is. Currently, TSLA has the largest data lead as their cars have **billions** of miles driven on the road whereas the runner-up of Google's Waymo has a laughable **millions**. When DOJO is available TSLA will be able to train its NN with all its data which will result in the best autonomous driving technology available. Beyond training FSD, Dojo can be used to train any NN that Tesla or other companies will have uses for. Dojo is one of the most valuable assets for AI that will exist and that should be valued extremely high in my opinion as I believe AI will be the next largest breakout in society.

TLDR: AI & DOJO --> Stock to the Moon

&#x200B;

The crazy thing about this DD is that I still haven't covered many of Tesla's massive opportunities such as its entire energy business or the future MODEL 2 that will eventually come out. Note that the MODEL 2 is a 25k Tesla which after factoring in the cost savings and any EV incentives that may come out will be the most affordable and best EV for its price and utility. (will hopefully be autonomous as well)  I think basically anyone with a brain will buy the MODEL 2 and it'll kinda be like Apple unveiling the iPhone. Basically, everyone uses an iPhone for their phone now and I think once an EV like the Model 2 comes out everyone will be whipping a Tesla for their car. 

More points if somehow you still aren't convinced

\- Giga factories almost complete in Berlin ( one more month) and Austin (by end of year) this will result in crazy amounts of cars being made and more importantly CYBERTRUCKS

\- Gigapresses at these factories will manufacture cars faster than anything that has been done before. This translates into the CYBERTRUCK ramp being extremely fast.

\-Tesla sells every car they make and yet many terrible news sources say TSLA has demands problems. Elon himself has stated demand is the least of their worries.

\-SEMIS are being slept on, they will start coming out by the end of this year and probably take over the trucking industry the next year. Autonomous truck convoys are the future as they are so much more cost-effective.

\-Overall TSLA is trying to save the world and make it a better place by transitioning to sustainable energy and solving crazy intense real-world problems like FSD which will reduce the driving death count drastically. If you disagree with this please comment cause I would like to understand your perspective on how I am wrong.

\- WSB says they like meme stocks so much well what other CEO is constantly posting memes on Twitter?

&#x200B;

If you actually read all this and still think TSLA is overvalued please reply why after buying puts or if you really are a man sell some naked calls.

POSITIONS: TSLA 1/21/2023 1500, 1600, 1700 strikes

note that u gotta buy leaps, not weeklies cause ELON loves to lie about the timing of things. Although they might be late, they always come you just gotta diamond hands till then. The man literally made rockets land I think he can make cars drive."

Given that the consumer prices have jumped 5% in May making it the fastest increase since summer of 2008 and the Federal Reserve’s June meeting is expected to conclude on Wednesday (they might tweak their forecasts for interest rates), I figured it was time to dive deep into

**What are the best strategies we can use to hedge against inflation?**

**Data:**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/9v1yt7xcrm571.png?width=1057&format=png&auto=webp&s=44706a74f62cee1bd1f263e8aa2d69d4b13629fe)

Even though slightly higher inflation was expected due to the stimulus checks and the reopening of the economy, the current trends are worrying. As we can see from the chart, even though inflation trends till March were manageable, now it seems to be picking up pace. May’21 CPI is almost 2.8X May’19 CPI. (2020 CPI was down mainly because of the strict lockdowns following the pandemic)

Keeping an inflation-hedged asset class in your portfolio during this transitionary period can work out well in case we go into a steeply rising inflation. This brings us to what are the  

**Best asset classes that can be used as a hedge against inflation**

**Stocks**

Stocks are a good long-term investment to hedge against inflation. Even though you might have a short-term impact due to the uncertainties surrounding inflation, great companies would be able to pass on the increasing price to the customers. You must look into companies with pricing power (think Apple) to raise prices on their customers without significantly affecting their overall sales. One important type of stock to avoid is high-growth stocks as the valuation of the company is heavily based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company thereby detracting a lot of value investors.

**Commodities**

Commodities are raw materials used for creating the products consumers buy. It provides both inflation protection and diversification to your portfolio. Because commodities are “real assets”, they tend to benefit from rising inflation. As demand for goods and services increases, the price of those goods and services usually rises as well, as do the prices of the commodities used to produce those goods and services. As you can see from the below chart, commodities have a weak correlation to both Equity and Bond markets.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/icm0brnerm571.png?width=363&format=png&auto=webp&s=754c5ee41a429861f4cfe25acef728f31c8a2618)

**Real Estate and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)**

Real estate income rises with inflation. As inflation rises, so do property value and the amount you can charge for rent. Given the normal forms of real estate requires high initial investments, an alternative could be REITs. A REIT consist of a pool of real estate (commercial, residential and industrial properties) that pays out dividends to its investors.

According to [this study](https://realestate.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/716.pdf) conducted by the Wharton School of Business

>Consumer price inflation (CPI) in the U.S. was 13.5% during 1979, the worst year since 1947. Dividend income from REITs traded through the stock exchange averaged 21.2% that year, and total returns amounted to 24.4%, more than preserving for REIT investors the purchasing power that they had lost to inflation.

**Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)**  

Never in my wildest dreams, I would have imagined writing about treasury bonds in wallstreetbets. Yet here we are! 

TIPS are a type of treasury security issued by the US govt which is indexed to inflation. As inflation rises, TIPS adjusts in price to maintain it’s real value. To make it simpler, if you invest $100 in TIPS and the coupon rate is 1%, if there is no inflation you will receive $1 for coupon payments that year. If inflation rises by 5%, they will adjust the coupon so that you get $1.05 instead of the $1.

**International Diversification**

There are several well-developed economies outside the US that do not rise and fall in relation to the US market (Italy, Australia, etc.). Adding stocks/bonds from these or similar countries can help hedge the portfolio against sudden local swings.

**Gold**

Gold is often touted as one of the best methods to hedge against inflation. I have kept it last as the performance of gold during previous inflationary periods has been spotty.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/gdwkgb9grm571.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0785e15a993d10e35490f424afa862fa9a45e44)

Gold investors lose 10% on average from 1980-84 when the annual inflation rate was 6.5% and lost 7.6% from 1988-91 when inflation was 4.6%. But the performance of gold was spectacular during the period of 1973-79(when the inflation was 8.8%). The mixed record raises some concerns about using Gold as a hedge against inflation.   

**Conclusion**

Whether we like it or not, inflation is here. The only question right now is whether it’s going to transitionary as the Fed’s explained or whether the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force Fed to increase their interest rates. The Federal Reserve meeting that concludes today will finally give us some insight into how they are going to tackle the current spike in inflation. Whatever their decision may be, it’s a good idea to prepare some hedging strategies for your portfolio!

Hello degenerates, 

I like you have been watching the roller coasters and rocket ships that is this market and think I've found something very early with great upside. 

**LET'S START WITH THE BASICS** 

Canoo is an EV startup that will be selling commercial and passenger vehicles that are in production and are slated to be released next year. They have had a lot of unfounded trepidation surrounding their SPAC debut which has lead to shorts bombarding this stock to well below it's fair cost. As far as EVs go it is one of the healthiest EV's on the market currently with $641.9 million in cash and ONLY $6.9 million in long-term debt with a market cap of just $2.3 billion. This is huge in terms of long term potential when $GOEV can easily be a 10 bn mkt cap stock. 

**Let's talk shorts**

The current float available to short is **0.15%**, you apes know what this means, borrow fee is 24.5% meaning the demand is HUGE. A buy and hold can cause a monumental squeeze here and there's only 11 days to cover. I'm going to refer you guys to /u/ny92 post here because he did a great write up:

**Does it meet key conditions for a squeeze?**

High short interest: Yes, ~29.7% short interest [link](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GOEV)

Low float: Yes, total float of 99.9M. 58.2% shares outstanding being held by insiders and 9.9% shares outstanding being held by institutions (23.7% of float) [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOEV/holders?p=GOEV)

Decent volume (also because of the high short interest there's a medium-high short ratio): Yes, Nasdaq has the avg. daily share volume at 2.6M, [link,](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest) Yahoo Finance has previous volume at 3.8M and average volume at 5.4M [link,](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOEV?p=GOEV&.tsrc=fin-srch) marketwatch has the average at 5.59M [link](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/goev)

High short ratio: Yes, based on the volume numbers above – we’re looking at anywhere from 5.3 to 11.3 so shorts really shouldn’t be able to cover within the week, possibly even two weeks [link](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=goev&submit=Short+Quote) Nasdaq 11.3 [link](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest)

**Other points of interest**

6/17 will be Investor Relation's day, a potential catalyst as the company is urged to share some good news because of short attacks.

6/25 GOEV/Canoo will be added to the Russell 3000 index along with our other favorite meme stocks like GME. This is a tremendous catalyst for volume. 


**Keep in mind that half of the short interest here is ALREADY under water. They've been short since April and at $9 or under they have been paying a 25% rate. There will be MASSIVE covering.**


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok so, what about the long-term? 

Besides their very healthy balance sheet and being vastly oversold they seem to be getting a lot institutional attention and insider ownership, in my experience this is a **VERY** bullish sign. The top institutional investors in Canoo are Vanguard, Invesco and Blackrock. Institutional holdings are at about 22,661,541 shares but more importantly $GOEV stock had 55 **NEW** institutional investments in for a total of 18,683,793 shares. This is a sign of bullish optimism in the long term. 

**The Covid Killer Car** [Canoo is starting to release positive news and this is the first of many](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-debuts-air-purifying-climate-control-with-uv-technology), their new interior enhances interior air quality, attacks odors and kills viruses instantly, including Covid-19, and will be pre-loaded in the Premium and Adventure packages of its Lifestyle Vehicle. Their vehicles will have both luxury and more affordable models along with a commercial line. Coupled with **INNOVATIVE TECH** the designs are so good that Apple wanted the designer which leads me to my next point.. 

The juicy **speculative rumors**  - **Apple Partnership** - The co-founder and CEO of Canoo Ulrich Kranz has stepped down and been hired to help with the development of the Apple Car. A lot of people initially thought this was bad for Canoo but I see it as a bullish sign. He is still a major shareholder and his design's have been implemented into the vehicles that will be released next year and they were good enough that Apple hired him to design theirs. More importantly there have been rumors of Apple teaming with Canoo to use their self-driving software or parts of their already developed hardware since it's trademarked by Canoo. Limited Apple partnership could be imminent. This can be a HUGE partnership for Canoo and can easily 10x their stock. 


**SEC investigation** - I think I should cover this even though it's entirely baseless. This initially made the stock take a huge hit and has more or less been deemed to be nothing. There is so much positive news boiling up that once people reinvest and realize nothing will come of this I can see a lot of FOMO from previous sellers. 

The Long and short of this stock is bullish, if you were just to buy it and forget about it you would do well, if you were to play an upcoming squeeze you would do well, this is a healthy and innovative company that has been unfairly shorted way below it's fair market value. I will be updating this post with more information but I want to post this on a dip, my position is shares and calls bought @~9.60.

**For a brief overview** - Canoo is a Los Angeles-based company that has developed breakthrough electric vehicles, with over 300 employees from leading technology and automotive companies. [link](https://www.canoo.com/about/) Their unique selling point is a modular platform purpose-built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space and adaptable to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses. This ‘skateboard’ platform is largely what drew Apple’s interest. The platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car’s electronics, allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design. It also features steer-by-wire technology, which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry. [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev)

Canoo is bringing its first vehicle to market next year with its electric microbus/van available at a base price of $34,750 before tax incentives or add-ons. It’s now taking preorders in the United States for the “lifestyle” vehicle, as well as for its round-top pickup truck and multi-purpose delivery van. Canoo is taking a different route than many other electric vehicle manufacturers, which played a role in the interest from Apple and Hyundai. Canoo’s trio of vehicles all have the same proprietary “skateboard” platform architecture that houses the batteries and electric drivetrain in a chassis that sits under the vehicle’s cabin. This contributes to a similar design language between the vehicles, which all have the same wide front windshield and relatively low profile. [link](https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/canoos-electric-microbus-will-start-under-35000-when-it-comes-to-market-next-year/)

A quick glance at its balance sheet shows that they aren’t at risk of running out of cash anytime soon. Their total assets are $717.8M (of which cash and cash equivalents are $641.9M) and total liabilities are $107.6M (of which long-term debt is $6.9M).[link](https://investors.canoo.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001558370-21-007431/goev-20210331x10q.htm#CondensedConsolidatedBalanceSheetsinthou)

**Does it meet key conditions for a squeeze?**

1. **High short interest: Yes,** ~29.7% short interest [link](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GOEV) 

2. **Low float: Yes,** total float of 99.9M. 58.2% shares outstanding being held by insiders and 9.9% shares outstanding being held by institutions (23.7% of float) [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOEV/holders?p=GOEV).  

3. **Decent volume (also because of the high short interest there's a medium-high short ratio): Yes,** Nasdaq has the avg. daily share volume at 2.6M, [link](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest), Yahoo Finance has previous volume at 3.8M and average volume at 5.4M [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOEV?p=GOEV&.tsrc=fin-srch), marketwatch has the average at 5.59M [link](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/goev). 

4. **High short ratio: Yes,** based on the volume numbers above – we’re looking at anywhere from 5.3 to 11.3 so shorts really shouldn’t be able to cover within the week, possibly even two weeks. [shortsqueeze 5.3 link](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=goev&submit=Short+Quote) and [Nasdaq 11.3 link](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest)

**Additional points**
 
1.**There’s room to run** - a squeeze would not initially be setting an ATH since the stock is currently down 51.5% [link](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=goev&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2) from its ATH with a market cap of $2.3 Billion. This is primarily due to an overhaul in management as well as a change in the business model which favored protecting Canoo’s IP instead of providing it to other OEMs, still ended up bring the SP down short-term since it was radically different from when they went public. 

2.**Shorts running into a wall** - 150,000 shares are left available to borrow at a rate of 24.5%, which is 0.15% of the entire float so shorts are about to hit a wall in terms of how easy it is to manipulate the share price. [link](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/goev)

3.**Possible PT** – unlike all the other information which is part data part speculation, this is **pure speculation** since we're talking about pre-revenue but I really think you could easily 10x the current share price if it’s a momentum based squeeze since it's a short-term event that isn't based on technicals. Valuations based on fundamentals aren’t really the same as they were a couple of years ago, and given the low interest rate / easy access to cash the question really is how high can it go? Since institutions don't hold the majority of the float (they currently only hold ~24% of the float but have increased their position by ~120% in the last month) and there should therefore theoretically be a smaller likelihood of shenanigans with lower price manipulation, this could easily 10x the current share price to $100 if more retail become aware of the company's potential and buy-in to their long-term vision, and additional institutions start buying in. Personally speaking, I like to look at market caps to see how high things can go – with GME and AMC both were hovering under a $20 Billion market cap before AMC blew open the gates a couple of weeks back. Other tickers that went up in the last week like WISH and CLOV however hit around a $10 Billion market cap before coming back down. If we use that $10B market cap to be conservative, that still gets us to almost $50, which is 5x the current share price – and since you can make a case for Canoo’s short interest being higher than the previous two cases, I don’t see why it couldn’t reach that by the end of the month, or even within a week if shorts start to cover and bring the house down.

**Upcoming catalysts**

1. **Upcoming investor day this Thursday (June 17th)**, which will be a ‘hybrid in-person and virtual journey into Canoo’s product portfolio and business strategy.’ [link](https://canooirday.com/)
 
2. **Canoo is being added to the Russel 3000 index,** [link](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/russell_3000_index_additions_-_2021.pdf) meaning that the stock along with other additions could be expected to ‘trade more than their average daily volume in the Nasdaq Closing Cross on June 25, and some will trade an entire week’s volume on “Russell Friday”.’ [link](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-small-caps-should-know-about-the-russell-rebalance-2020-06-22).

On a final note, this is not financial advice so please don’t treat it as such – do your own due diligence, read your own news, study their financials and evaluate multiple perspectives (bullish and bearish) to see what others are saying. Don’t invest money you’re not willing to lose, and do so at your own risk.

**TLDR**:  Canoo is among the healthiest EV startups out there, $641.9 million in cash, only $6.9 million in long-term debt and a market cap of just $2.3 billion with a <$10 share price. This is the company that Apple wanted to buy and Hyundai wanted to partner with. Other EVs have the same market cap and may not even have the cash to make it through the next 3 months so Canoo really should be trading at multiples of where it is atm.

They listed out several reasons and China basically said that’s cap and said that they view the United States as having “sinister intentions.”  So like cool, China drama happens all the time right? But here is where it gets interesting, while the G7 shat on them we started moving a navy carrier group into the South China Sea.  Now this is a routine war drill type thing, but it has always increased tensions.  If you remember a few years back China started increasing their claim to this sea by building artificial islands.  After we just condemned them for human rights violations, supported Hong Kong, and recognized them as a threat due to their growing presence; will they take nicely to our navy in waters that they believe are theirs?  When there were just rumors about a trade war apple stock dropped 4% in one afternoon, and since cell technology is the biggest import from China any event would cause large damage to this industry.  As well as Walmart having 80% of their products from China both are almost reliant and shit bricks over 10% tariff. We don’t really recognize these islands and the territorial waters that come with typically sail through them, but not typically at a time like this.  If this provokes a response I think it might drop? Idk i am kinda retarded, but I bet on space etfs before ufo report and made 50% on calls, and that was far more retarded."
o023f9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o023f9/qa_notes_from_recent_qa_w_ceo_of_fubo/,Q&A notes from recent Q&A w/ CEO of Fubo,31,8,2021-06-15 09:16:22,"Q&A was with the CEO of FuboTV, a leading OTT sports streaming service with +85 live channels of sports-focused programming.

* **Company fundamentals:** FUBO has 35k+ SVOD assets and 50k+ live events including the largest football package in the US (NFL & NCAA) and the highest number of regional sports networks in the US. Key drivers for growth include: 1) secular decline of traditional TV 2) shift of advertising dollars from traditional TV to connected devices 3) online wagering / betting 4) FUBO is a young company (founded 2015) compared to peers such as NFLX / ROKU (25 years old) and KPIs are growing at triple digit rates.
* **Subscriber metrics:** Total subscriber count for vMVPDs is \~11mm households vs \~73mm traditional paid TV households. Over the next 10 years the executive expects the secular decline of traditional TV will continue and for the subscriber count to drop to as few as \~25mm households. He expects vMVPDs to capture a significant amount of these traditional TV cord cutters as “subscription fatigue” sets in for SVOD and AVOD services – this will become especially prominent as monthly sub prices increase (e.g Disney+ increased $1/month in Mar’21). He anticipates 2026 (\~4-5 years from now) will be an inflection point where vMVPDs will become larger than traditional cable services. The executive highlighted that FUBO’s sub count typically declines going into Q1 but picks up significantly in Q3 & Q4 as fans become re-engaged with football season – in Q3’20, FUBO added \~165k subs, Hulu 700k, YouTube 500k, Sling 200k.
* **vMVPDs vs SVOD:** The executive identified headwinds for SVOD services which will likely limit their long-term growth, requiring them to more widely distribute content on other services including vMVPDs. These are: 1) for SVOD services (excl. NFLX), the cost associated with producing content coupled with the low hit rate of shows is too capital intensive to limit content to their own platforms 2) as the growth in SVOD sub counts slows their profits will decrease but production costs will remain the same or increase. In addition, long-term, the executive expects more simulcast on cable + vMVPDs in order for the cable companies to maximize the value of their content. The need to distribute content on vMVPDs will “spark a second wave of growth on the vMVPD side”.
* **Betting / Wagering:** The executive remains highly optimistic on FUBO’s entrance into sports betting due to:  1) FUBO has brand awareness within sports and enormous sports content – “I do not see why we could not get to 5% of the betting market” which is a $70bn market 2) Vigtory acquisition – the asset is a fully functioning sports book that FUBO has continued to build upon and improve 3) state licenses – FUBO secured 3 licenses in Q1’21 (IA, IN, NJ) and could launch in \~80% of markets by the end of 2022 if needed 4) competition – FUBO’s core vMVPD competitors are giants such as GOOGL / YouTube, DKNG and other pure betting companies are much smaller 5) upward trend in vMVPDs gaining sports betting share – vMVPDs had 2.8% of the market in 2019 → \~5.5% today. Long-term, FUBO’s betting platform will have key competitive advantages which include: 1) authenticating the video user with the betting app – FUBO will have the betslip open directly to the game being watched on TV vs opening an app and having to find the correct game 2) prop betting – FUBO has engaged users watching live games which opens up more opportunities within prop betting vs competitors (e.g. if a user loves field goals, FUBO will bring up a quad view of 4 NFL games all close to having a field goal attempted).
* **ARPU:** FUBO started at $6.99/month in 2015 → $61.00/month today. He attributes the 10x ARPU increase to: 1) strong product / platform 2) targeting customers who understand the value of FUBO’s bundle – \~40yo males 3) branding – FUBO has 10-15% more sports content than competitors 4) value-added functions such as 4k, quad view, calendar view for sporting events, etc…
* **Price inflation:** FUBO dropped churn in Q3’21 despite raising prices and continues to see q/q growth. Peers such as Sling and DIS saw lackluster sub growth in Q4 & Q1 and highlighted the headwinds they are facing were based on price increases. Long-term, the executive believes FUBO will continue to be more shielded from price inflation vs peers due to: 1) 95% of FUBO’s users are sports fans – if only 30% of consumers who have cable watch sports, a price increase due to sports programming will isolate the other 70% of the audience 2) adding wagering, which is at a 50% gross margin, will be another revenue stream to handle price inflation 3) media companies who are paying 60-100% more for broadcasting rights will pass this on to users which will shrink their audience and decreasing advertising revenue → they will need to distribute further to make up for this lost revenue so vMVPDs will benefit.

**Direct Q&A:**

* **There have been customer complaints about uneven video quality on FuboTV, can he discuss this? A:** “Because we control our own video coding and delivery, there was a point in 2019 where we were 12 or 13 seconds from the edge and there is a FCC broadcast rule which requires a delay of 9 seconds in case of emergencies. We found people cared more about the quality of the video rather than the lag. We could always change it back whenever we want but for now we still find customers continue to care more about the quality”.
* \*\*Explain the Net present value of a subscriber of a traditional cable sub vs a virtual cable sub? A: “\*\*The number of attachments sold was 1.23mm in March 2021. With 129 hours of viewership, we will continue to be able to improve our ability to sell more attachments. Right now we are at about $840 of revenue on a run rate basis and we will probably hit \~$2k long-term including wagering and any additional attachments we would be selling. It would also include commerce – we added a button on videos which leads consumers to a commerce platform if clicked so it is like a “mini Amazon ecosystem” where sports and betting are the hook.
* **Outside of soccer and possibly gambling, what exclusive content does Fubo have? A:** “I believe content should be fully distributed in order to be fully monetized. In terms of what we have today - de facto exclusive - is all NY hockey, the Knicks, all Boston local sports with the Bruins / Red Sox / Patriots / Celtics, Chicago Cubs, Pittsburgh Penguins and Pirates, the Houston Astros and Rockets, and Pac-12 teams”.
* **In the shorter-term, can Fubo become a greater aggregator of content where they bundle OTT streaming services and integrate them for on-demand viewing? A:** “It is certainly possible but not rational. The entertainment piece is important because it drives usage and stickiness. Sports-only is basically about PPV and the churn rate is \~35%. Even with this churn the service still showed value because these consumers signed up, had a great experience, rated 5 stars, and dropped after their team lost in the playoffs – they got what they wanted. Entertainment allows us to improve our retention because it is an expensive product so it is important to have the consumers come to our platform consistently. That is reflected in our churn numbers in which we have had 8 quarters of sequential churn decline”.
* **Most smart TVs are fairly limited in the number of buttons on the remotes, how do you approach this from a UI/UX perspective when competing against phone-based sports betting apps? A:** “As long as you have anything with a pointer and arrows you will be fine. You’ll see it on Roku in the next 5 weeks or so when we are launching our free-to-play predictive games. Apple will be different – we are not planning on launching them soon because it is a more robust platform so we will do more with it”.

but the fact that much of the loaned money goes into stocks

which artificially drive up their value. (This is known as “asset inflation”. No wealth is being created here, the numbers are just being unnaturally propped up by the money printing)

So it's imperative that you take profits. I know diamond handers won't ever sell, but if I can reach one poor soul to wake up, and to put their profits into assets that will hold it's value.

And if you just prefer stocks, even putting them in say, companies that will be around 20 years from now would be far less risky, such as Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft ect.

The alternative is to completely chance it and see how long you can ride this bubble, but the odds are totally stacked against you. You will never be rich this way.

Good luck"

It's no question that Canoo has been beaten down the last few months. It's down over 50% from it's pre-merger highs and dipped well below it's former NAV of $10. The big question is : why?

The news of their cancelled deal with Hyundai during their first earnings call is what caused the most recent downward move, but was it really negative news? Why have your engineers work for another car company, helping them develop a car and giving them your valuable IP? It makes more sense to focus on your own products, which will lead to much more revenue over the years. 

Their original CEO, Ulrich Kranz, leaving was also a contributor to this movement. But again, the move makes sense. Ulrich is an iconic engineer and designer. That's where his focus should be. Having him step down and putting a business oriented CEO (Tony Aquila) is the right move. Not every engineer is Elon Musk. Kranz decided not to retain an engineering position with Canoo, leading me to...

 **Apple Hires Ulrich Kranz for It's Rebooted Car Project** [see here](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528448/apple-ulrich-kranz-canoo-bmw-electric-car-autonomous)

Lots of speculations can be made here. If Ulrich had left on bad terms, most speculation would be bad.

However, both publicly stated the departure was made on GOOD terms. 

As you know, Apple tried to acquire Canoo in early 2020, which means their technology is the real deal. What do I think they're targeting? Canoo's **Skateboard Platform**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3vrul6ibmo471.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6448dc4281f18423835ddb8ac2d068b03e7f9c3

If Apple had this, it would speed up their creation of the Apple car since they would only have to design the piece that goes on top. And since Apple couldn't buy Canoo, how could they get their hand on this?    Hire Ulrich and have him make one? : No, Canoo has their technology (a.k.a Ulrich's own tech) patented. 

I speculate a deal is in the works where Canoo licenses out their skateboard platform to Apple to build a car on in exchange for some royalty they receive for each sale. And hiring Ulrich Kranz helps them because he knows how to build a car on the platform because **HE MADE IT.**

Of course this is highly speculative, but I believe it's the simplest explanation.

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

1. **Investor Day**

Canoo is holding their Investor Day next week on the 17th in Texas where they are actually letting investors attend and see their vehicles. They currently have 3 that we know of : the delivery van, pickup truck, and lifestyle vehicle(a.k.a minivan or BANGBUS). They have teased a sedan model in the past, and it's speculated they will unveil it at this event.

2. **Manufacturing Announcement**

Canoo's CEO said that their contract manufacturer would be announced in Q3, likely during the Q2 earnings call. This is the only thing holding them back right now. Their product is much further developed compared to the other former SPAC EV's, with 3 models that have drive-able prototypes. They may provide an update to us during Investor day.

**Long and Behold: The Short Interest**

Ortex is showing a current short interest rate of 30% of the share float, up 300% from their 10% short interest rate in January. They are betting against Canoo, and there are a few upcoming catalyst that could drastically change the market sentiment and blow them up.

**Disclosure:**

This post contains highly speculative predictions, and I encourage you to read up on Canoo and do your own research. This is not financial advice."

With 5G and everything running off of fiber, Is this a good stock to invest in and why?",0,10,2021-06-12 02:51:25,"[https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/12/15/should-you-buy-corning-stock-at-36/?sh=6117ec611813](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/12/15/should-you-buy-corning-stock-at-36/?sh=6117ec611813)

Should You Buy Corning Stock? With 5G and everything running off of fiber, Is this a good stock to invest in and why?

The global spread of Coronavirus has impacted the sales of Corning due to a decline in capital spending from some of its customers as well as pricing pressure for its display glass products. That said, the company is now seeing a rebound in demand, and it posted a 2% y-o-y sales growth in Q3. The company’s total revenue in the first three quarters of 2020 was down 8.4% y-o-y to $8.0 billion, while the adjusted earnings of $0.25 per share reflect a 77% decline over the $1.10 figure reported in the prior year period, primarily led by higher operating costs owing to the pandemic. Looking forward, with economies opening up gradually and availability of vaccines, the capital spending on 5G is expected to rise, boding well for Corning’s optical fiber business, while the company will also see higher sales of its glass vials that are being used for Covid-19 vaccines. Also, the new Apple iPhone 12 uses ceramic shield, manufactured by Corning, and iPhone 12 sales alone are touted to be in the range of 80 to 100 million units by October 2021, again boding well for Corning. That said, much of these factors appear to be priced in the current stock value of $36, despite the expected recovery in demand post Covid. In reality, 2020 full year revenues are estimated to see a decline of 3% to $11.3 billion, while earnings are expected to be down 22% to $1.37."

—————

First, I’m going to lay out what we absolutely know to be true about the connections between Apple and Canoo, **then I’m going to speculate. A lot.**

**Please don’t wyl-out and YOLO your entire life savings into anything, ever, but especially don’t do it here.**

With that disclaimer out of the way, I’m gonna give you a few reasons why I YOLO’d a lot of my life savings into GOEV and why I’m reasonably confident I won’t feel like an asshole when all is said and done.

Okay … Because I’ve had this conversation too many fucking times, I have a good sense of the questions people ask when walking down this path. So I’m gonna to try and anticipate and answer them in advance. If you still think I’m delusional after reading through this, hit me in the comments and I’ll try to fill in whatever gaps I can.

Here we go.

**QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:**

**How do we know Apple was really interested in Canoo? Wasn’t that just a rumor?**

* Apple was absolutely interested in Canoo. There’s no question about that at this point, and you should slap anyone who suggests it’s a debate.
* This January 2021 [article from The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev) lays it all out, but I like you guys, so here’s the TLDR:
   * Apple was talking to Canoo because they wanted their patent-pending skateboard.
   * Apple was interested in investing in, or buying them.
   * Canoo didn’t want to sell.
   * Talks fell apart.

**Didn’t Apple ghost Canoo?**

* We don’t know who ghosted who. The article only says “talks fell apart.” But we have enough information to speculate on why they didn’t get a deal done.
   * According to [The latest Verge article](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528448/apple-ulrich-kranz-canoo-bmw-electric-car-autonomous), Apple wanted to buy Canoo, but Canoo was like “nah, we’re good”.
   * Wut? Why the fuck would Canoo say no to Apple?
   * We don’t know for sure, but if we assume the execs at Canoo are logical, rational business-people, it would have been some variation of “fuck that, we can make more money if we do it ourselves.”
   * It’s also possible the talks never advanced to the stage of Apple making or discussing the parameters of an offer, but there are a few reasons I find that hard to believe:

1. Apple has $204B IN CASH. There’s no way they would have been “priced out” of buying Canoo if they wanted them bad enough. Canoo’s market cap is $2.3B. Apple could pull that out of the cushions of the lobby couches in Cupertino.
2. This is when smooth brains say, “yeah, see, that proves Apple didn’t want to buy them!”
3. Sure, that’s one way to read it, but if that were true, why did one of the most valuable companies in the history of mankind trip over their multi-hundred-billion dollar dick to hire the dude who co-founded Canoo and created the skateboard to HELP RUN THEIR ENTIRE CAR BUSINESS within weeks of him hitting the market?
4. The most logical answer is: they LOVED the technology he helped to create at Canoo and wanted as much of it as they could get their hands on without getting sued into the abyss, and hiring Kranz allowed them to buy the brain behind the patents, if not the technology itself.
5. At a minimum, they value his expertise and want him to help them create (or refine) something similar to what he created at GOEV.
6. But there’s at least one other reason they may have been so eager to hire Canoo’s former CEO.
7. Because they still want the skateboard, and no one would be better positioned to help them integrate GOEV’s team and technology into Apple’s plans than the guy who co-founded and led the company.

**But Canoo fired the former CEO right? Why would he want to work with them now?**

* Well, he definitely wasn’t fired, but among us CanooBros, the working hypothesis is he was pushed out because GOEV's new CEO Tony Tequila wanted to run the show.
* Now, I’m petty af and wouldn’t want to work with anyone A) named Tony Tequila, or B) who pushed me out of the company I fucking co-founded and built from the ground up.
* But Canoo’s former CEO is the ultimate wrinkle-brain ([seriously, just look at this picture of his galaxy-sized brain cavity](https://images.app.goo.gl/pfNL8UuCZRBT4TCk7)), and assuming he’s more emotionally mature than me — a five year old — then he might realize he could make a metric-fuck-ton of money by swallowing his pride and helping Apple to get a deal done with Canoo.
* Adding fuel to that fire, he still owns at least 1,257,987 shares of GOEV, which is currently worth $12.3M, and would assuredly multiply if a deal between Apple + Canoo got done.
* **Disclaimer**: There could be all kinds of reasons this is a stupid hypothesis, from Apple’s internal corporate policy on self-dealing to laws that preclude this kind of transaction from occurring, but I’m not smart enough to figure that shit out, so if someone drops legit proof that this outcome is an impossibility, I’ll edit for accuracy and clarity.

**SO UR SAYIN APPLE n CANOO MAKE CAR TOGETHER AND APES GIT LAMBOS?**

* No, I am absolutely not saying this is *going* to happen. But *I am* saying “I don’t see why it *couldn’t*.” And if Apple wants to get to market sooner rather than later, it's the most logical platform investment or acquisition they could possibly make.

**ONE QUICK, BUT IMPORTANT SHOT OF HOPIUM**

* In a February 2021 article, [CNBC reported that the Apple car was “designed to operate without a driver.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/apple-and-hyundai-kia-driving-towards-deal-on-apple-car.html)” This, CNBC said, could indicate that the Apple car’s first customers will be food delivery services and self-driving taxi firms — not the general public.
* Why is that important? Because if it's true, [Canoo is literally the best-positioned EV maker in the world](https://twitter.com/canoo/status/1311385584724619265?s=20) to help [Apple create vehicles that address those segments of the market](https://electrek.co/2021/02/22/electric-vehicle-companies-you-may-not-know-canoo/).

nxfaf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxfaf9/canoo_apple_speculation/,Canoo + Apple speculation,19,19,2021-06-11 20:53:31,"What we know. Apple shelved their car project in 2016 to focus on Autonomy development that could be eventually licensed to car manufacturers. Now they have hired Kranz, co-founder of Canoo.

From the very beginning, Canoo vehicles were designed in such a way as to easily accommodate autonomous technology such as LiDAR.

Kranz knows the Canoo vehicles inside and out better than anyone else, now he will have full access to the Apple autonomous program.

My speculation is that with Kranz at Apple, this could make the perfect match to make Canoo vehicles autonomous equipped at launch and compete directly with Tesla.

nwnysp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwnysp/amat_dd_and_why_semiconductor_stocks_are_a_great/,$AMAT DD and why semi-conductor stocks are a great play right now,15,17,2021-06-10 21:42:20,"As usual for me, I took some of my adderall prescription and it drove me to write a DD on my most watched stocks at the moment.

Applied Matterials Inc ($AMAT) is a large-cap stock, and I base my play upon it's high quality and strong momentum; as well as confidence in semi-conductor stocks. AMAT provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display and related industries.

Applied Materials is the leading producer of equipment and materials for producing microchips, TV's (OLED's/LCD's), and solar panels. They also have their services business which offers manufacturing consulting and automation software. They are based in California, but have factories around the world, with Asian customers accounting for 80% of it's revenue.

To summarise:

- Semi-conductor systems make 60% of revenue, this is for equipment used to manufacture semiconductor devices such as microprocessors and memory.

- Applied global services provide a quarter of revenue. This is for integrated solutions to optimise equipment, performance and productivity,

- And the display markets account for 10% of it's revenue. Providing products for manufacturing LCD's and OLED displays.

- It's customers include Apple, HP and Dell.

With the current silicon shortage, I expect the stock to surge further when this shortage slows down.

- AMAT has been stair stepping higher in the recent bull trend, as a leader in one of the stronger industry groups in tech (semiconductors), I believe it among other semi-conductor stocks are a great buy for a long right now.

- AMAT's 5-year return on Capital Employed is 25.1%, which is a strong indicator that it has the power to grow profitably. AMAT's share price has had a 72.1% return relative to the market over the past 12 months.

- Furthermore, it's earnings outlook is improving. Analysts are still raising their earnings estimates for the company. For the year, the stock currently has an earnings estimate of $6.53 per share, up 56.59% from a year ago.

- AMAT is testing the 10 week line on the weekly chart, after declining recently. This has formed a handle, and if you rebound from here to get above the handle, there could be a breakout.

- As Nvidia recently broke out we could see other semiconductor stocks such as TSM, AMAT, LCRX, and ASML following this pattern.

- ASML is also in the buy range after finding support at the 10-week line.

Why semi-conductor stocks are a good play: 
- The Innovator IBD Breakout Oppurtunities Index (BOUT) jumped 152% from March 2020 lows before pulling back in February. This ETF is now integrating leading components manufacturers such as DELL, ZBRA, AMAT, LRCX, UCTT, and TER.

Jim Cramer himself is now looking at AMAT, TSM and AMD.

""Cramer recently said that if investors think chips are truly in short supply and we need capital equipment, then the company they most need is Lam Research (LRCX), other than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)""

""Jim Cramer recently named chip equipment major Applied Materials (AMAT), as one of the stocks that got away.

He called out the bull market in semiconductor equipment. We need to make more chips, he said, and companies like Applied Materials can make that happen.

The semiconductor equipment major reported mixed fiscal-second-quarter earnings and received a number of positive reviews and price-target upgrades from Wall Street analysts.""

Anyway, aside from Cramer there are many other reasons to own semi-conductor stocks.

One of my primary reasons is the growth in data centre demand. This was why I bought NVDA calls at $620, aside from the stock-split. AMD is also bringing out new data-centre GPUs.

- There has been a huge growth in demand for data centre equipment, due to the rise in work-from-home driving data centre's to increase their cloud-storage capacities. This has fuelled demand for data-centre chips from data centre operators.

- The data centre market is expected to grow to $519.34 billion during 2021-2025, driven by the growing clout of cloud services and digitization. Further, increase in adoption of multi-cloud and network upgrade to support 5G is fueling growth.

- New semiconductor manufacturing processes from 10nm, 7nm, to 5nm and 3nm has opened new business avenues.

- 5G deployment is spuring further sector growth.

- VR and AR devices, gaming, wearables and drones, have grown in use due to Coronavirus - hence leading to a increase in usage of online services globablly.

- Improvements in DRAM and NAND pricing are fueling semi-conductor stocks catering to the memory market.

- AMD, and TSM delivered good performance in the first quarter driven by data centre demand.

I think my adderall has worn off now, but I will update with a part 2 later on. I'm going to open a position in TSMC, AMAT, LCRX, and ASML today. I will look at AMD also."

&#x200B;

West has already raised his net worth to 6-7billion so far... his stake in the gap and this 10-year deal will change the game.... but how will he get 40+ billion to buy UMG? 

&#x200B;

Lets travel back- thru kanyes sales historically.... 

\- Kanye West has sold: 

o 21 Million albums and 100 million digital downloads world wide

o 2019 Yeezy Sales for Adidas: 1.5 Billion

\- Could Kanye announce a new album to go with the launch of Yeezy Gap?

&#x200B;

I believe Gap is current sandbagging estimates for Yeezy merch- that ugly cotton candy jacket crashed their site at $200.

\*\*\*Big assumption:   .. I will preface that this multi-year analysis assumes that in a couple of years most of the sales will come from mass-produced clothes at lower prices! millions and millions of yeezy shirts/jackets in the $35-75 price range for the masses.....

Quantitative

\- Yeezy projected addition for 2021 Revenue; 1 billion. 2022 Revenue; 2 billion. Making yeezy a conservative 8billion segment for gap

\- Projected Yeezy revenue total 2021-2025; $13.4 Billion. 30% growth after doing 2billion in 2022. 

&#x200B;

\*Attached picture of earnings projections quarterly and yearly- you can make your own price targets. but mine is 8x FY 2022 Earnings. About $70 per share- conservatively in 2 years from now.... A compound annual growth rate of 48%

Twenty years ago, HP’s market value was 10 times that of Apple, but now Apple’s market value is 60 times that of HP. HP is the founder of Silicon Valley, and its history is much longer and more brilliant than Apple. The following recommended reasons for purchase:

1. HP’s printer business still has a lot of room for development, especially 3d printing technology. Its personal computers, servers, and tablets are all developing well.
2. HP is the true representative of Silicon Valley, which has influenced generations of Americans and even people all over the world
3. HP’s current price-to-earnings ratio is 10. Apple’s is close to 30. Even if it’s just comparing hardware, HP is cheaper.
4. HP’s option prices are now very cheap. If you want to get quick returns, HP’s short-term and long-term options can be considered.
5. HP’s current market value is only more than 30 billion U.S. dollars, so it is not very difficult to reach 100 billion U.S. dollars.

So, let’s make HP the center of Silicon Valley again!"

What happened today reminds of what happened in Mid-May when Ark exited their $SPCE position. The short interest of shares outstanding was \~16%. After Ark completely exited their position, the **stock went up 6.36% the next day and the second market day it was 35.74% up!** The second jump was mainly due to the catalyst news of an upcoming test flight and it jumped. After the success of the flight, **the stock is now 150% up from Mid-May.**

Now for Huya, Ark is almost completely done of their sell off. Yesterday, 877,347 shares were sold and **what's left in their portfolio is \~151K shares from a peak of 6.8 million shares!!**

As I mentioned in Part 1, $HUYA is criminally undervalued and it's primed for a moon launch with the upcoming catalyst news of the Merger. If the CCP doesn't fuck us and the merger goes through, there would virtually be no competitors to $HUYA in the streaming world!! (It's like Apple joining Microsoft in the Operating system market...).

I often times find myself watching tesla at market open and analyzing it on a macro scale while wearing my tesla short shorts and admiring my elon musk stickers that adorn my laptop. 

Upon my in depth analysis, both social + fundamental, as well as technical, i have come to the conclusion that tesla is nearing another giant burst up relatively soon. There are some low IQ short sellers that have been stacking up recently that believe tesla is going to drop hard, but the EV sector has honestly been booming and the market has not reflected this yet. People are more afraid of an “EV bubble” because of some angry short selling hedge funds who lost a lot of money shorting TESLA, funny thing is those hedge funds were the same that shorted Apple when it went public because they thought the idea of having a computer that fits on your desk is a joke and again when they released smartphones.

They also provide cyber security, remote work and threat detection services.  

At today's WWDC Apple rolled out some updates to iCloud under the name iCloud+. Existing paid iCloud users are going to get those iCloud+ features for the same monthly subscription price.

In Safari, Apple is going to launch a new privacy feature called Private Relay. It sounds a bit like the new DNS feature that Apple has been developing with Cloudflare. 

When Private Relay is turned on, nobody can track your browsing history — not your internet service provider, anyone standing in the middle of your request between your device and the server you’re requesting information from. 

This will be offered for Free with existing iCloud subscriptions. Some press already has access to the iCloud+ features and looks like iCloud+ private relay is just Cloudfare's [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1) Warp VPN Service.

and other Twitter sleuths/users are confirming this. 

This is huge news for Cloudfare since every iCloud user will be using their service and platform.   Apple's recent push on privacy could be amazing for Cloudfare. Apple is relying on Cloudfare for a global implementation of iCloud+.  Apple has \~ 800M iCloud users.

This could easily add significant recurring fees (so far undisclosed) recurring revenue to Cloudfare's bottom line. This is going to be a great catalyst for upgrades by Analysts tomorrow and Cloudfare is already one of the best infrastructure plays as businesses/governments get more serious about privacy, security and remote work. 

I think this deployment with Apple seriously increases their market potential and opportunity and this is a great price at $86 for a nice swing trade to $100."

It's a money making machine but stock goes higher because of future earning / innovation potential and not because of how successful the company in the past. The headwinds include: epic trial, chip shortage leading to reduced iPad shipment and reduced future revenue, and possibly reduced iPhone 13 shipment due to no breaking changes. 

In addition to all these, already highest market cap in the market and inflation fear looming the tech sector. Since AAPL is such a big part of many indexes, the downward of indexes will affect AAPL a lot. Also, three top car division executives just left AAPL and it does not seem AAPL has made much progress in the car business which could be next big growth area for AAPL. 

Among a dozen of professional analysts, only 2 are bearish and last week New Street’s Pierre Ferragu gave a $90 price target EOY. No major banks have downgraded their outlook for AAPL and the consensus median is $160, average is $157.10, high is $185.

Blackberry acquired the company in 2010 from Harman and has continued leveraging QNX's assets in embedded systems for transportation, defense, medical, grids, robotics, and mobile devices. 🚀

In 2012 BlackBerry released forward vision videos on what they believed to be the future of QNX and the automotive industry. In recent years this vision is coming to fruition no pun intended. Video linked below.🚀

An example of this forward looking mentality of the automotive industry is BlackBerry's recently awarded patent for methods and systems for autonomous vehicle refueling. Article linked below. 🚀

For anyone that doesn't already know, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are applications built atop of QNX OS. And even Android Automotive will utilize QNX's components for securing the vehicle even if it's not directly used for infotainment. 🚀

This is  an entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a retard  posting on WSB  with a bias due to having a very large position of my portfolio in $F.  So, Don't act on anything posted in here and proceed on your own risk...)

# $F: Ford

3 months ago, I spent so much time on part 1 and after posting it, I sadly realized that people are lazy 😂 Apes don't want to read mountains of DD, They just want a 5th grade level TLDR. This Ape got you and this DD will basically be a Long version of a TLDR! I'll try to make it concise and to the point as much as possible.(5 hours later, I failed at this objective lol)

**Though, if you are interested in my initial DD which took 2 days of research here's the** [**link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsh9fh/ev_play_buying_leap_calls_on_america_for_the_next/)

FYI, I will not include any points mentioned in part one, like for example why it's grossly undervalued, etc... Spoiler Alert, it predicted F-150 EV pump!

Let's jump into it:

“Our ambition is to lead the electric vehicle revolution” \~ CEO Jim Farley

**1- Ford's secret weapon unleashed:**

For the last **44 consecutive years**, the F-150 has been Americas **best selling Truck**. In 2019, the Ford F-Series was **second only to the Apple iPhone**, which  raked in **$55 billion**, in terms of **total revenue** generated. The F-Series **generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined**, Just something to think about.

On May 19, Ford has unveiled its EV F-150 after Biden had driven it a week prior. The EV's features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations (Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min video). It has all the features crucial for it's target buyers (Construction workers, Farmers, Free-lance delivery drivers, Basically hardworking Blue-collar Americans...) and it's a Truck which actually looks like a Truck. “Ford knows what pickup owners want,” IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. More importantly, it's an F-150 first, an EV second, Ford didn't abandon the F-150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years.

Now Ford's EVs are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla right now with sales, more on this on #5). The F-150 starts at  $32,500 after Federal tax credit!! Cheaper than any of **""Potential(because they don't exist yet)""** competitors with superior car features. Moreover, on May 26, it was announced that 70,000 Trucks were already reserved!

As Ford promised, F-150 Lightning will deliver more features, and cost less...

^(Don't forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs, and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year.)

**2- Ford Rivian Partnership:**

Ford-Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September. It's looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now 😂(Ford is 62.50B at 14.94$). Ford has initially invested 500$ million in Rivian, but it added much more of an undisclosed amount.

Farley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market. **As more companies continue to invest in Rivian, Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares,** ""but that's not why we invested,"" Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend.

Farley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV-SUV market too with a Lincoln or Explorer-Rivian car. He understands that the first move is the most important one in the EV territory and until now with the Mach-E and F-150 Ford execute the mission perfectly! Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices and high quality. Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1.

**3- Ford-SK Recent Partnership:**

On May 20, Ford and SK Innovation announced that they have signed a MOU for a joint venture(to be called BlueOvalSK) to manufacture battery cells and arrays in the U.S.

BlueOvalSK to produce approximately 60 gigawatt hours (GWh) **annually with potential to expand.** To put that into perspective, By 2030, Ford expects annual energy demand for its vehicles to be up to **140 GWh annually** in North America and up **to 240 GWh globally.**

They are Taking the Battery development seriously from now and preparing to eat the EV market share.

**4- Ford-Government contracts:**

“Ford clearly has business and government fleets in mind,” Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said.

Ford revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F-150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday. Called the Lightning Pro, it’s equipped with a standard battery that’s good for an estimated 230 miles and costs $39,974, the same as the base price for retail F-150 Lightnings.

Ford's vision to lead the EV market has a “no-brainer” component Elon Musk lacks: a vast base of business and government fleet customers it’s targeting with new battery-powered trucks and vans.  Ford’s focus on converting fleet buyers to electric models “builds on the company’s existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts.

^(Ford is in bed with the government and they could easily scoop up most EV vehicle related contracts with their connections.)

**5- Recent EV sales:**

Today, Ford has reported a 184% jump in electric vehicle (EV) sales in May. Overall total sales for May, including EVs and non-electric vehicles, grew 4.1% year on year. Total sales were up 11.3% for the year to date.

Now for the surprising Mach-E(Ford's first EV this year) sales, The Mach-E is eating up Tesla sales. Morgan Stanley shows that Tesla's share of the US EV market fell to 69% in February, down from 81% a year ago. ""Mach-E accounted for nearly 100% of the (Tesla) share loss,"" said Adam  Jonas, Morgan Stanley's auto analyst.

Now for international sales, Mustang Mach-E was the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Norway in May, the first full month of sales. On the other hand, Tesla Model 3 was sixth on the sales list.

Ford is not Fucking Around and they are doing it right in the EV space...

**6- Price Target:**

For the price target details, refer to Part 1.

&#x200B;

So I'm brand new to WSB but bear with me. Once upon a time, when I was very down on my luck, I walked into a temp agency and asked for any job they could give me. What they had was a factory assembly worker on the line at Blackberry in my hometown of Waterloo, Canada (yep...Canadian alert!). It was a 12hr job with day/night swapping shifts. It was a repetative, monotonous job putting screws into things and doing it all in style in a zero static white suit and blue boots. It was most definitely NOT what I had envisioned for myself for the rest of my life. However, that job would turn out to be one of the most rewarding short-term jobs I've ever had because I sat next to some truly wonderful people on the assembly line.

With nothing to do for 12hrs but shoot the sh\*t, I soon discovered that I was sitting next to doctors from Iran, lawyers from Indonesia, CEOs from Pakistan. Each of them had come to this job out of desperation just like me. Each of them were deemed ""overqualified"" by most other jobs just like me. Each of them had worked hard, invested in company shares (BB had an amazing employee share program) and had made more money there than they could have dreamed. BB had given them the promise of a real future in Canada and you could see the passion they had for this company in their faces. Also, BB once a year rented out the Air Canada Centre (or Rogers or whatever the hell its called now...) and rented a rock band for their employees! Like...ALL of their employees...not just management. I saw ACDC, Steven Tyler, Van Halen and the Tragically Hip. All thanks to BB. They wanted to spread the love.

So I got over myself and how I wasn't where I wanted to be, and I used this job to give myself a crash-course on global politics from the amazing people I worked with. I learned about the so-called ""scary"" parts of the world and how beautiful they actually were. When the time came to leave that job and move on to other things, I left with a profound appreciation for hard-working immigrants and just how much dedication it takes to sit down at a factory bench with a $200k salary potential education, and screw things together for $14/hr. I'll never forget those people. And I'll never forget that company. Blackberry gave life, employment, education grants, city improvements and other amazing opportunities to my hometown of Waterloo. When the time came that Apple overtook them and Blackberry faltered, my hometown and the rest of Canada turned its back on them, and that disgusted me.

THAT is why I am investing in BB today. Not for a get-rich-quick scheme, but because I genuinely hold a special place in my heart for that company and can find way more emotional attachment to it than a TV channel I used to watch, and a place where I used to buy Ace Combat as a kid.

TLDR; BB was once the bright future of Canadian tech industry, it carried me through tough times as an employee, and I respect it.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*Update: Wow folks! What a day. I've never had a harder time trying to NOT look at my phone while looking after the baby as the wife was at the salon. You guys were so thoughtful and supportive today and I truly appreciate all the gifts, karma, props and personal stories. I was even stoked to find some fellow KW/RIM employees in the mix! So happy to see that this community is alive and well. I continue to value BB as a future major player and I'll hold my shares because I truly believe in what this company can do, and how we can help it succeed.

To the folks that thought I was a corporate plant or some sketchy conspiracy, I giggled a bit. I can assure you I'm a regular dude and this was a regular post. I hold a very MODEST amount of BB shares because that's all I can afford, but I know other folks invested heavily and I wish them the very best of success in the weeks and months to follow. As always, I can't give any financial advice. I'm not a pro. All I can say is invest in something you truly believe in - not just because it can make you rich. I'm a proud Canadian first and foremost, and I can't wait to see how this company can exceed all of our expectations no matter where we happen to live.

All the best friends!!! Thanks for making today one of the coolest and craziest days of my Reddit life! Much love to all of you :) BB to the moon!!!!

\*\*UPDATE #2:  For all the posters who doubted that I actually held BB stock, here's a screenshot of the only three stocks I hold - BB, AMC (but I think I'll sell tomorrow for BB), and EMO.V (a really undervalued Canadian mining stock - I know \*yawn\*- but I've been holding for seven years and its finally moving!)

I know a lot of folks are focused now on AMC and GME, and I don’t blame ya, but want to share with you a ripe opportunity with VIAC that shouldn’t be overlooked.  

Three simple reasons to buy:

1) It is transitioning to a streaming company, but theatricals are also big part of their business.  This is a reopening play in this regard.  It will benefit big as theatres reopen.

Viacom released “A Quiet Place Part 2” last weekend already earned $58 million in the US in only 3 days, a new post pandemic record.

ViacomCBS has lots more big theatre releases that will definitely be huge hits as things reopen.  Mission Impossible 7 coming later this year, and Top Gun 2 early next year.

Streaming biz is doing fantastic as well.  Growing 60%+ annually, 36 million paid subs (Paramount+) plus 50 million ad supported users (Pluto TV).

2) Valuation 

ViacomCBS trades for less than 10 PE.  It pays a dividend of 2.3% (if you buy the stock before June 14, you get 0.24 cents per share).  Among the cheapest stocks you can buy in it’s class.  

ViacomCBS has a market cap of only $28 billion, revenue last qtr of $7.4 billion and free cash flow of $1.6 billion.

Compare this to Netflix which has a market cap of $221 billion, Its revenue last qtr was $7.1 billion.

It has so much going for it, yet it’s stock has been pummeled and punished due to Billy Hwang’s margin call and has yet to recover.  There is still decent short interest of 9-10% for some fuel when buyers appear (usual short players, including Melvin).

3) Buyout candidate

Content is king, and it’s increasingly more expensive as studios do exclusives for their own streaming channel.  As an example, Amazon just bought MGM studio for 8.45 billion.  ViacomCBS has Paramount, Showtime, Miramax, Nickelodeon, among other studio assets.  There are few assets left for sale with the scale and quality of content that Viacom has.  It makes sense a bigger player like Apple or Netflix could buy this out for a big price.

As this has been dead in the water for months, Volatility is now relatively low.  You can buy Sept 17 50 calls for only a 1.80.   If people get interested in this, it can easily revisit the recent highs of almost $100 earlier this year before Billy got shanked by his brokers.

TLDR: Check out VIAC if you’re looking for a well priced stock with lots of potential, it’s a bargain and ready to moon.

Long with 100 calls, $40 Sept."

For those who don't know how a RTOS microkernel operates let's explain with minor detail. QNX is one of the most adopted embedded OS's in the world it's installed in defense systems, power plants, municipal grids, robotics, rockets, rail and 175 million vehicles and rising.🚀

The reason for it's adoption is because of the way a QNX Neutrino RTOS operates compared to what we consider typical everyday operating systems. Most operating systems including IOS, Windows, Linux(Android) and MacOS to name the most apparent run on monolithic designs or hybrid kernels.🚀

A true microkernel architecture like QNX Neutrino RTOS has full memory protection which is built in meaning that any component can fail and be restarted without corrupting the microkernel or other components in the system. If failure does occur, QNX has the ability to rectify the problem without affecting any other part of the system through process monitoring and recovery components. This feature and ability equals extreme reliability, security and being a microkernel the OS is also modular.🚀

So what is the big deal your probably asking, Apple, ABC, and Microsoft might enter the space? Not exactly, in fact there has been work in this space from all three companies. Apple opened a facility across from QNX in Kanata and hired the ex creator of the OS Dan Dodge in 2016 to work with Mansfield on the autonomous car project called project Titan. The need for a secure and stable software is where Dodge and his decades of experience from QNX come into play.🚀

The need for a software system as reliable and secure as QNX should be a big flag to the sheer potential of QNX. It is clearly a threat and tough competition for even the biggest software companies. Not only this but project Titan continues to be illusive revealing possible setbacks and interference in trying to compete but also Apple lost several top managers from it's Apple Car project causing a potential setback to the launch revealing some attrition in the project.🚀

QNX version (7.1) is years ahead and analysts predict the next competitor is still 5 years away from anything even remotely close.  QNX hypervisor 2.0 is 61508 SIL 3 certified and has been recognized as ISO 26262 ASIL D compliant making it the world's first ASIL D safety-certified commercial hypervisor. 🚀

As other's race to catch up, BlackBerry has been filing patents on it's system.🚀

The QNX Hypervisor utilizes patented and patent-pending technologies that simplifies how elements are shared on the system. Multiple OS's can use 1 display controller to render content onto multiple displays, aka digital instrument clusters and infotainment.🚀"

Vizio is an American company founded in Orange County California in 2002. It focuses on producing smart televisions, sound bars, and accessories.It also operates Platform+ that comprises SmartCast, a Smart TV operating system, enabling a fully integrated home entertainment solution, and data intelligence and services products through Inscape. Its SmartCast delivers content and applications through an easy-to-use interface, as well as supports streaming apps and hosts its free ad-supported video app, WatchFree, as well as VIZIO Free Channels. In addition, the company provides support for third-party voice platforms.

Sector: Consumer Goods/Electronics

Vizio went public 03/25/2021 at 21$ since then it ranged from $17.25-$28.80 and currently sits at $21.84.

Market cap of $4B with 2020 sales of $2.04B and a P/E ratio of 40.

Net revenue increased 52% year over year to $505.7 million. With a forecasted annual earnings increase of 46.9%

Vizio has no debt compared to 5 years ago when its debt to equity ratio was 89.4%.

Short term assets ($750.8M) exceed its short term liabilities ($523.4M).

Gross profit increased 82% year over year to $86.7 million 

Net income declined 64% year over year to $3.3 million. (Vizio attributes this to problems with importing goods during the pandemic)   

SmartCast Active Accounts grew 57% year over year to 13.4 million

Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) increased 76% year over year to $14.52

Platform+ net revenue increased 120% year over year to $52.2 million 

One potential issue is Smartcast is only 3 years old and is not as well known as Roku, Amazon firestick or apple tv. People could opt for what the know rather than give smartcast a shot.

Vizio has strong financials and is focusing more on the ad revenue generated by smartcast. I don’t have much stake in Vizio but I do see potential. With some volume this stock can move."

If I keep doing this I'm gonna need a better title  


##Where Is The Correction?

Seems like over the last week or two (or three), there’s been some media attention around a possible correction. It makes sense: we’ve had some volatility lately, seasonality is upon us, markets have looked somewhat extended at all time highs. And yet, it seems like we just can’t get a meaningful pullback. Two weeks in a row we touched the 50DMA on SPY, the Nasdaq found support about 8% down from its ATHs, and the Russell has been trading in an ever tighter range, but there’s been no urgency to the selling and just a week and half after hitting some recent lows we’re back just a few points off ATHs. 

Analyst calls for a pullback are still out there, but even they concede that they’ve no idea when and we could possibly see new ATHs before such an event occurs. After the recent weeks of scary inflation data (bonds aren’t buying it), a _digital asset_ crash, and recently Fed taper talk, you have to wonder what would be the catalyst to initiate such a pullback if we’re still just a few bps off ATHs after all that. 

Close to six weeks on, the picture looks different. We’ve reset some of the stretched technical indicators, the inflation data looks temporary (for now), and the market held up well through some choppiness. To summarize the thoughts of other, more knowledgeable people: perhaps we’ve had the pullback we’ve been looking for, just more controlled and constrained to the sectors and stocks that needed it. 

Alright, let’s move on and look at some charts…

##Charts

[Sector Performance, 1y](https://imgur.com/dIqgt1V)

Performance has been relatively flat lately, with the exception of ARKK - it’s had %12 bounce in the last week and a half, since the most recent bottom on the 19th:

[ARKK, 1y](https://imgur.com/xUqyEy2)

There’s also been an uptick in meme stock bullishness, and there seems to have been a broad bounce in risky / non-profitable growth stocks, perhaps correlated to the recent unwind in _digital asset_ markets?

Running down through the major indices:

[SPY 1y](https://imgur.com/bLsKX9P)

[QQQ 1y](https://imgur.com/6WgjYPv)

[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/xv8eyhX)

- SPY trading in a narrow range since mid-April; since the last bounce we’ve been drifting upward which seems to be the direction of least resistance. Will be bullish if we break above the recent ATH at ~422 (~4238 on /ES), but could be range bound for awhile.
- QQQ in a similar situation; support at ~316, but expect to need a break above 335 (~13750 on /NQ) to warrant a bullish stance. 
- IWM still range bound, but had an encouraging week - moving through the 21 and 50DMAs, but this could just be another head-fake within this range.
- Since the recent lows on 05/19, we seem to have lost all selling conviction and are simply drifting higher. You can see MACD crossovers and rising RSI on all indices, indicative of a momentum shift. 
- However, I’d be careful about being too bullish here until we’ve had a close above the top-side of the ranges here - we may not crash but we may need some kind of catalyst to push us higher from here.
- Keep an eye on the risk-on trade: is this a momentum shift or just a bounce?

Based off the action the last few weeks and how things look now, it’s hard to have any bearish conviction in the short-term. The same could be said for the bulls, and I don’t see any catalyst to spur further upside on, though there is some argument that a Fed taper announcement would result in a bullish move; we could always just melt up as well.

###Bonus Charts

[ATVI - Possible Breakout Ahead](https://imgur.com/q56t73d)

With positive analyst sentiment (just one example), a valuation lagging in some aspect to peers (e.g. P/CF), and some consolidating/range-bound action since late February, this could be primed for a run, but only if we see a close above 98 - above 99 would be even better. I’d be wary to take much of a position here until then.

[AAPL - Possible Breakdown Ahead](https://imgur.com/LXmL4QJ)

AAPL’s been in this sideways range since late December, and perhaps worryingly it hasn’t matched the recent bounce-back in tech and instead is wobbling in a tight range between it’s 50 and 200 DMAs. It’s current valuation metrics are far above it’s 5yr averages, though that’s perhaps attributed to their expansion into services among other things. If we close below the 200DMA

BB:
60 $30c 01/2022 at $0.27
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀


Already powering many of the telematics of current cars, BB is poised to benefit from their established relationships with big automakers. Getting certified with an automaker is not easy, so it is a barrier to entry for other companies wanting in on the action. Security and reliability are top of mind for these companies. You don’t want your car to get hacked easily, so what better than a cybersecurity company that happens to also do EV software, and already has experience with ICE cars. I did a long DD here 4 months ago and still stand by it: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


SONY:
100 shares at $101
🚀🚀🚀


I wouldn’t call this the Japanese equivalent for BB, as they aren’t a cybersecurity company. But Sony has a thriving consumer and B2B business that benefits greatly from consumer demand: the fact that they are literally selling every single PS5 they make is amazing and image sensors going out on many cell phones, including Apple using both image and lidar sensors from Sony. Great solid volume of sales to stabilize the company after some stagnant years.

On PS5, it’s actually a good thing that there’s a chip shortage. As Sony loses money on the hardware (and earn on game royalties and licenses), they are buying time to refine their manufacturing to lower costs, and lose less money on hardware sales. And because demand is so hot for the PS5, they are on track to build a bigger platform than even PS4 to charge 20-30% on every game they sell. That’s some fat margin.

Now, you’re probably wondering…wtf, I’m here to read about EVs, why you telling me about PS5s? Yeah, you’re right but a conglomerate like Sony is multifaceted. While they build up their EV software platform, they have cash cows in imagery and video games. And if Apple is really building an EV, I would bet (am literally betting) that they would rely on currently trusted partners like Sony for their imaging needs. You sit inside an Apple car and camera recognizes who you are and where you’re sitting? Well that’s probably a Sony camera…or 20 of them. There will be so many cameras inside and outside of any Apple car. I mean…my iPhone 12 has 4 cameras, and it’s a tiny slab of glass and my family can’t sit inside and drive down the road with others in the environment.

And when Japanese automakers get into EVs, they’ll look into a Japanese partnership. Guess who’s probably in pole position?

Full disclosure, I also have 150 AAPL.



VW:
200 shares @ $33.32
🚀🚀🚀🚀

You are all excited about Ford. I am too but I’m not buying into them because I think they are overhyped. But what’s interesting about Ford’s EV play is that they are partnering with VW to do so. That means…even if Ford can’t sell that many cars, VW will probably still benefit from joint research development and cost sharing. We also know how much more climate change is viewed as reality in Europe, and that’s VW’s home territory. VW already launching EVs under Audi, Porsche in the premium sector, VW, Skoda and Seat in the value sector, and Bentley and Lamborghini will likely have their ultra premium EVs soon.

But you might wonder…what about Tesla? They are so great! Well yeah they aren’t that bad. But VW is a goddamn monster. It’s kind of cute when Tesla announces a new plant, oh this is my 4th plant! We now have Shanghai and Fremont and building out Berlin and Austin. That’s cute. VW has 136 plants around the world. The economies of scale is insane and will be able to source materials for incredibly better deals. Oh and there’s that other partner called Ford who builds millions of cars a year also jumping into to beat on suppliers to give them both better pricing. Welcome to the big leagues, EVs.

VW is likely to launching 5-10 EVs per year, the equivalent the full Tesla line up every year. And they have Electricfy America network (and Canada) and similar in Europe.

And one more thing: VW also does trucks. Like 18 wheeler trucks. They are one of the biggest manufacturers, behind brands such as Man, Scania, and Navistar. And trucks have even more of a compelling business case for EVs…Will merge this part with Volvo.


Volvo:
800 shares @ $26
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀


Going to keep this briefer because this is already a novel. Now, when I say Volvo, I don’t mean Volvo Cars. That’s bought by Geely and yes they are making EVs under Volvo and Polestar brands. But I’m taking about AB Volvo, still out of Sweden, building trucks, mining equipment, backhoes, haul trucks and cranes.

EVs are so more more compelling because of the use and mileage they get. It’s not uncommon for a one year old truck to have a million miles. And as cities around the world clamp down on urban center access (congestion or polluter fees common in Europe, and allow EVs in for discount or free), EVs increasingly make more sense. You save so much on lower op/maintenance costs, avoiding tolls and tax credits. Oil prices will be going back up so saving on fuel costs is the smart thing to do.

Another thing is, governments around the world are spending trillions on infrastructure stimulus. What do these trillions buy? Concrete, steel, Volvo construction equipment, labor. Where does the concrete, steel and other commodities (like rising gold and silver prices) come from? They get mined out of the ground with big Caterpillar, Liebherr and Volvo equipment. Yep, there’s Volvo again!

So if you believe stimulus is happening, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe inflation is real, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe EV is the future for hauling shorter distances and/or heavy loads, Volvo is a good choice.

All my opinions only, not financial advice. Currency amounts all written in USD.

Obligatory rockets 🚀🚀🚀

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead."

Also, this past week AAPL has been testing it's 200 day moving average. If we continue the rally strong from this area then it will invalidate the head and shoulders pattern outlined above. If we close below that (currently @ $123.69) that would give more confirmation of this head and shoulders break to the downside.

Another point of interest is that the SlowRSI is currently @ 33.29. Typically a bottom is put in when this reaches the 20 level or below. This itself is no reason for a pullback, but everything said put together strengthens the pullback argument.

All said and done, I am bullish on AAPL but believe we need to see a deep pullback in order for it to be more attractive to the masses and drive more volume into the stock. After this potential pullback I can see AAPL rallying hard to the upside, so pay attention and be patient for a good entry."

I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

Here is a guide to the EV landscape today.

tesla =  comedian nerd,
Makes a scene, looks like an idiot, does better than you'd expect with the ladies

Rivian = Wyoming rancher,
Looks like a Ford truck for the most part, just costs $80k, bought by Amazon

canoo = pretty girl, 
Gets great press for its Apple like designs (the ""cutest pickup"" was a CNN headline) has the lowest market cap, gets picked on by the jealous uggos (the shorts) and tried setting up an only fans letting Hyundai take a look at the goods cheap before spac funding

Arrival = sexy accountant,
Small practical British company that has practical designs and has small trial contracts with ups/hyundai. This is the same Hyundai deal that canoo backed out of because Hyundai kept trying to grab its ass. Arrival isn't as pretty so she puts up with it.

Lucid = my dad is rich 

Sleek, expensive, refined. The full blown blue chip factory right from the start. A bit on the bland side, but make no mistake driving a lucid  is  sure to put the riff raff on notice that your daddy can buy his daddy.

Fisker = the Donald of electrics 

Went bankrupt the first time when their Chinese funder had capital issues for their bold design , they are back again for their second try.

Nio = Chinese exchange student 

Pretty bland, doesn't say much. Just an average car that happens to be electric.

Bollinger = big dumb guy 

It's a big truck that doesn't look good that costs $125k. Shrug. You do you.

Lordstown = unemployed guy in fancy suit

Being investigated by the SEC. Testing prototype burned to a cinder, car entered in a race dropped out because it couldn't finish.

Nikola = your wife's boyfriend

They rolled the truck down the hill because they didn't have a product. Still not the lowest market cap of the bunch, company fired the old CEO because they said he misled investors."

I also make note of where I got recommendations when I buy stocks, and I'm starting to realize how bad his recommendations often are and how dishonest he is about his bad calls. A few examples:

&#x200B;

1) Last night, someone called into to ask about Aeva and he said he couldn't recommend it. Oh really? Actually, HE DID recommend it just several weeks ago. I know because I bought it soon afterwards and it tanked. I understand things change and he's entitled to change his mind but how about at least saying something like, ""I know I recommended this one before, but I can't now because of inflation or whatever...""

2) XL Fleet. Same story as above. He recommended it, then he didn't and pretended like the earlier recommendation never happened.

3) Tech meltdown. In the runup to the 2020 election, Big Jim was pimping hard for Biden. Okay, fine, everyone's entitled to their opinion. But he kept repeatedly claiming that Biden would great for tech stocks, especially Apple, because he would improve relations with China. This call has been catastrophically wrong, at least so far but no acknowledgment of this whatsoever from him. As a so -called expert, shouldn't he have known that the policies Biden was calling for (huge increase in government spending, massive stimulus checks, enhanced unemployement checks, etc, etc) would cause inflation and inflation would be bad for many of these high multiple tech stocks? 

&#x200B;

Yeah, I know. I shouldn't be taking recommendations from Cramer and other so-called TV experts. That's on me...but I just wanted to add my thoughts here in case others take him seriously. And yes, I'm sure some of his recommendations also pan out well but I wish he would man up and admit when he makes bad calls."

nbkat0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nbkat0/why_boomers_and_millennials_like_uwmc/,Why Boomers and Millennials like $UWMC,154,48,2021-05-14 00:12:36,"Boomers and Millennials agree on little nowadays. One is lazy, doesn't listen, already knows everything, and only thinks about themselves. The other are millennials. But $UWMC is a stock both can buy and hold for short term or long term. Here's why:

**The millennials case for $UWMC:**

Stock Deeply Undervalued: millennials love stocks that hedgies have (allegedly) artificially pushed down the price. UWM is a growing company and Wall Street has positioned itself as if UWM is shrinking.

Share Buybacks: millennials will recognize this buyback is different then say Apple. With $300 million in buybacks, UWM can reduce the whole float by almost 40%.

Option Open Interest: There are 131,934 open interest in options (as of this morning) with strikes at $10 and under. That is a lot of shares that the sellers of those options would need to find. The float could be reduced significantly by share buybacks at that time. Institutional investors easily control 20+million shares and they aren't selling at these prices. Gores holds 15.8m shares they bought for $10 a few months ago.

CEO: Mat is pissed Wall Street doesn't love his company as much as he does. He will do what it takes to get the price to what he needs it to be with the buybacks. He is game to play.

**The boomer case for $UWMC:**

Mortgages: Boomers love mortgages, the bigger the better. UWM is the largest wholesale mortgage provider in America. The mortgage industry isn't going anywhere and boomer's small brains can at least understand that.

Healthy Financials: UWM runs a tight ship and is very profitable. It also trades at a low P/E around 6 or so. Boomers love low P/E's cause they hate tech and tech is ""expensive"". They buy low P/E companies like T cause they are much smarter than millennials at investing.

Dividends: Boomers love dividends. They think it is free money. At a $7.5 stock price $UWMC pays a 5.3% dividend. But even better, UWM pays a dividend on its class A shares only. Class A is only 7% of the outstanding shares, so it costs UWM $42 million to pay a 5.3% dividend. For context, their net income Q1 was $800m+.

Share Buybacks: Boomers love getting their capital returned in a slow, and boring way. UWMC has a $300 million share buyback underway right now.

Mat Ishbia: Mat is a CEO boomers love. He played team sports and won an NCAA national championship riding the bench at Michigan State. Boomers love reading stories like that because they always preached hard work to their own kids from the couch.

So either a short term or long term investment, boomer or millenial, $UWMC looks interesting."

DUH. Yo2Y makes more sense as I demonstrate here.",24,18,2021-05-13 23:49:09,"Note that I am not a fan of CPI. Inflation was already here a long time ago. So please spare me from using CPI. I am just sick of the media choosing to play easy journalism, in turn, putting so much pressure on ape stocks. BUT, this is a great buying op and here's why.

TLDR: CPI %Change number is COVID-biased. The actual number is not high. Inflation is already priced in.

Since yesterday all the channels have slammed ape stocks with the CPI data saying its YoY number was ATH since 2008. It's not fair to use YoY numbers because COVID messed up the trajectory of the CPI. The YoY 2019-2020 April number barely changed (from 255.548 to 256.389)[ https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/), which created stored energy that MUST be realized once the economy started recovering. The latest number of 267.054 is justified because it put the number back into the previous trajectory. In simple terms, the +4.2% seems huge because April 2020's number was frozen by COVID.

It's more appropriate to use Yo2Y number in this case (actually, in many other cases too as broader scope = more smoothened/accurate, less squared error). Think of it this way, without COVID, the number would not have been different than what we have now. The number should still be in the range of 264 - 268.

YoY, It's fair to say +4.16% is huge as it has not been this much since 2008 Sep.

[YoY](https://preview.redd.it/q1exbb7s2wy61.jpg?width=1892&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a6d0ff66f3c9da03fed8f0217ce8431eb057668)

However, if we smooth the data with a Yo2Y calculation, an increase of +4.5% over a period of **TWO** years is so common. The average number is +3.8% (this means +3.8% in **TWO** years).

[Yo2Y](https://preview.redd.it/ft5ukqtt2wy61.jpg?width=1892&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=17854220026ae80337519a3b9c356fa06a1cb3fd)

Please shut the fuck up about CPI. The use of CPI is retarded, but the way it's being brandished is even more retarded.

IMO, Inflation has already been priced in as, currently, KO has a higher P/E than AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, BABA by more than 10%. These are not ape stocks, but my point stands as ""value"" stocks are overpriced than these tech stocks.

It's important that you know this because stupid journalism is making the price discovery process fucked. Investors flee to safe big cap stocks, making them overvalued. These big cap stocks then use these undeserved overvaluations to:

* afford massive ads budget so that it can shove stupid just-to-be-seen ads in your face. I don't want another Coke or Fanta ads to sell me the same message over and over for decades. It's an absolute waste of time and resource.
* lobby. Boy oh boy, where do I even start?
* take over other small companies.

The list goes on.

Is there anyone who could take a look at my analysis of AAPL stock? Now I do not know any of the indicators, this is purely based on my first impression on the chart employing the EW analysis I have been studying. 

Any opinion will be greatly appreciated, please help this boy out!

Please ignore the small writings, as they are basically me rambling to myself- 

 so in short, I think that the wiggly price action after wave 3 is wave 4 manifesting in a triangle, almost coming to an end, ready for a breakout to fib extension 1 of wave 1.   
I did also consider the sharp low after the wave 3 being the wave 4, but since it is too sharp in relation to the wave 2 and it took such a short time to do so, I figured it would be more reasonable to consider it wave A of a triangle, and so far the trend lines are supporting my theory. 

If it does breakout below C, then I would think that it might be the wave A of a correction, which could possibly retrace all the way back to somewhere between the extreme of wave 1 and wave 4, and that whole impulse being the wave 1 of a strong uptrend. 

This is my possible anticipation, it might sound absolutely stupid to some of you Elliotticians, as it has been only three days since I've started studying EW, and I don't know anything else about trading, this is the first point of my study. So please do give me generous criticism, how to improve! I tremendously appreciate your time, thanks for reading this long ass post.

-The most recent 5G cell cycles is not even close to over as most 5G users are still predominantly in developed countries.

-QCOM’s bread and butter business is from royalties which contributes up to 60% of revenue. This is generally a stable and predictable stream.

-QCOM’s biggest opportunity is in connected automobiles and autonomous driving which is expected to explode in the next 5 years.

-It was announced Apple, QCOM’s biggest customer will be developing their own chips. Fine, QCOM develops the technology behind the chips and doesn’t really produce much as they rely on 3rd parties for production. Again, QCOM is basically a patent troll and could still/likely will collect on royalties even if Apple does produce/engineer their own chip.

(collectibles that we treat as currency, commodities etc). I wanted to explore is if there are certain categories of stocks that are better positioned against Inflation.

So I came up with a short-list of they type of stocks I might look for in a period with volatile inflation.

1. Established Brand Name. This gives the company pricing power because clients are going to buy their product because of what they are getting is also associated with the brand and not just the product. Think AAPL, MCD, KO.
2. Commodity selling stocks, industrial sector ([https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings)). Think metal mines, lumber, companies that produce commodity byproducts that are used in industry (no discrete product firms, like jewelry makers).
3. Capitalist Europe. If it goes down in the USA, it all goes down - true, but there is a place where it will go down less relative to others. So, I'm looking at European companies that do not have diversity and inclusion in their 10K. These are actually young companies that are thirsty to grow and will do anything and everything to move up. Alternatively, I look at cultures who are still capitalist, think Russia, Poland, Ireland, Estonia.
4. Companies with more fixed-rate debt instead of floating rate debt. If the interest is fixed but there is more money in circulation the lenders are in trouble not the borrowers.
5. Government-backed stocks. Especially those that have defense contracts. I think that bad times create civil unrest with a potential for internal and external escalation. Think Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Lockheed Martin ([https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings))

1. MVIS short interest was at 20% when that shit blew up to $28. What's FINRA showing us?

Unless all of these calls running from 15 to 20 are all WSB, the people that bought these aren't in the business of losing money. There's only 2 weeks until all of these expire, and going from 14 to 20 is no small feat.

The Elliot wizards say the next run up will is looking to be soon, and could go to 18 this week and 28 before the 21st. Can I back this up? No fuckin' clue. The info is out there, and it confirms my bias, so I put it in here. The wizards say that the price may likely (or hopefully) hit 12, as whenever MVIS hits the triple bottom support line it likes to rip the fuck up like nobody's business.

4. Other indicators show signs of a run up soon.

&#x200B;

[On the 4 hour, Stoch RSI, RSI, and MACD are on their way up.](https://preview.redd.it/o25pc1l7f9y61.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fda48bf05e1517d24e26318881527dadd19c353)

Also, Mr. Fibonacci says that the next resistance point upward from 14.27 is between 16.93 (38.2% retracement of the 4 and 13 week low) and 17.51 (38.2% retracement of the 52 week high).

5. No earnings report. Apparently any sort of earnings report will tank a stock shorted or owned by citadel, regardless of how good or bad it is just to put us 'retailers' in our place(example- AAPL). But good news! I heard that several darkpools have been closed, so no more or less of the ""buy from the darkpool and sell on the open market to only impact the price negatively"" tactics. Is that what a short ladder attack is? IDK. Seems like Citadel can just nakedly short whatever the hell they want without repercussions anyway, so take with grain of salt.

Anyway, I don't pretend to fully understand all this shit, so it probably has more holes and a weaker foundation than a jenga tower ready to fall. Disclaimer- I have 40 19c's expiring on the 21st, so I need the hopium more than all of you.

1. Earnings out earlier than scheduled which is very bullish
2. They   just did a $305M raise priced at a 25% premium to market which was led   by Mr Li Ka Shing (29th richest man in the world) who put up $105M of   his own money
3. Completed   the CRH Medical acquisition which analysts anticipate will bring the   company to over $300M in revenue and $50M in free cash flow.
4. JP Morgan the largest healthcare bank in the US extended the CRH credit line from $200M to $300M
5. 0 debt on the balance sheet and $80M in the bank after the recent financing
6. What looks like a partnership with Apple? They are now the first Canadian company to offer EMR records on Iphone.
7. They have historically beat earnings guidance and I think could do the same here given how strong of a close they had on Friday.

&#x200B;

I decided to take it one step further and dive into the charts. Canadian company so I'm going with the Canadian ticker ""WELL"" as it seems to get most of the action. 

I like to start my TA by zooming out to the maximum relevant period for any story. This last year given the pandemic seems like the most logical time frame for this... The stock performed exceptionally well throughout the pandemic and is now finding itself consolidating in the $7 range. 

Now the key for me is that within this consolidation period the company has made immense progress as I stated above. This is an entirely new story , management was able to use their operational skills and really take advantage of this situation. 

1. They raised an additional $305M led by the 29th richest man in the world who has invested in every single round to date... This one priced at a 25% premium. 
2. They used that capital to acquire CRH Medical which is going to bring revenues to $300M and free cash flow to $50M 
3. They acquired Circle Medical - a leading silicon valley company which is going to allow them to compete with any US Healthcare company. 
4. They are now the first Canadian healthcare company to directly integrate into Iphone. 
5. and still they have 0 debt and what I calculated to almost $80M in cash... 

To put it simply - they are on a hot M&A streak and doing it very very well (no pun intended lol). 

SO this is where it gets interesting for me - If we zoom out a year to the point they last started bolstering up M&A activity around March/April we see WELL is sitting clean on its 200day SMA before making a monster move for the better half of the year. 

Now this is where they stood apart... Unlike other companies who experienced monstrous returns over the year and didn't focus on the operational aspect (Cough cough CLOV) WELL was able to use this time to focus on operations and exponentially increase its revenue, brands, cashflows, and ultimately justify its stock price up here. 

Now here is where the TA comes in... A year ago they were sitting flush on the 200 Day SMA right as they started increasing M&A Activity... Now again, after making hugely successful acquisitions with CRH, Circle, etc while in this consolidation period WELL is again sitting clean on its 200day SMA and has double bottomed with a higher low and  is further shown with the RSI being oversold and coiled in the right direction. .. There is also a massive Bull Flag forming... Further suggesting a huge breakout

[1Year\/Daily \(200day SMA confluences\) ](https://preview.redd.it/rloh016ij5y61.png?width=2874&format=png&auto=webp&s=b480d9d3d67d44c2c757dd4234ed8803d9072309)

Now obviously one time frame doesn't tell the whole story so I went deeper. 

Right, 6 month/Daily shows the same thing - Massive consolidation - Bull flag - Higher low - and a clean on its 200 day SMA. 

[6Month\/Daily - Higher low - Bull flag - Double bottom.](https://preview.redd.it/wejhg81hn5y61.png?width=2876&format=png&auto=webp&s=79e205d5e494309bc55812d0a8a74f2210136d02)

10 day/Hourly - WELL Closed on strong volume right below its 50 day SMA - The last time was on 04/23 when it closed just below its 20 day SMA on strong volume and proceeded to move 10% + (Caused by a failed short report). 

[10 days\/Hourly](https://preview.redd.it/bzzwkfayn5y61.png?width=2874&format=png&auto=webp&s=a81147d55aaa39ab985e6b88a0323d5be4ed0601)

So that led me to look at the volume... Which we see is roughly double the week prior. 

&#x200B;

[Volume Increase 04\/09 - 05\/07 ](https://preview.redd.it/0d1flpjho5y61.png?width=2482&format=png&auto=webp&s=573ba72ecbdc124b99ebddf9f92860e17c6fd40b)

Analysts are expecting record earnings Tuesday so that's more than likely the cause. 

Now that brings me to my final question? Where can this go? 

On a short term we see an inverse H&S and a next resistance at 7.18 (Likely opens above that I think) 

https://preview.redd.it/vffo46n3p5y61.png?width=2860&format=png&auto=webp&s=256fa9d69a481aacc997a97dd96fe378a0894415

Now this 7.18 level is key to break so the next stop would be 7.80 as we see here (+10%) 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2oktpnxep5y61.png?width=2872&format=png&auto=webp&s=509a680d5f995a9009e64078c057aec47b500404

Once that 7.80 level is reached which I believe earnings will help us achieve then we need to zoom out again and look at where this really could go... The answer to that is obviously subjective based on what happens in the business but I think as they are exponentially increasing the value of their core business via M&A activity the very same thing could happen with the stock. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/snwojxnzp5y61.png?width=2634&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a929096195ed04fb7402f0879c6e964fff8f345

I believe if earnings are positive that WELL could break out of this $7-$9 consolidation zone and find itself trading in a new zone, likely blue skies somewhere in the teens or 20s. 

I really have conviction in this because they just raised $305M priced at a 25% premium to market at the time ($9.80) which the 29th richest man in the world put up $105M of... 

Now the question is to load up before earnings or watch and see what happens but potentially miss out on this move."

That works out to a market cap of approximately $45B, *but* you don't even need to purchase the entire state, or even half of it to own it outright. The Federal Government already owns 48.19% of the land in Wyoming in one form or another, and they have little to no interest in its internal affairs. That reduces the total capital necessary to own all *available* land to only $22B. Now consider that an additional 3MM acres are Indian Reservations (which are their own entities, legally) and you can reduce the price by another $2BB, leaving us with a sticker price of $20B to own the entire state of Wyoming. With 10MM ~~apes~~ jackalopes, that works out to just $2,000 per jackalope (or $1,000 if we just want to take a controlling interest) and we can have our own WSB Polity.

This is a great opportunity for us as ground floor investors. WY has no personal or corporate income taxes and some of the lowest property tax rates in the country. Combine that with one of the lowest costs of living as well. If we purchase the state and live there as well (paying minimal rent to a newly formed REIT, which we can get back in the form of dividends) it's basically living for free, eat your heart out FIREtards. Your FD budget just grew in size by your current rent payment, or spend the savings on that pair of Grand Tetons you've always wanted to help with your gender dysphoria. You're welcome. 

Given that Wyoming has a GDP of $35B, it has gross revenues 75% *greater* than its equity value. Currently the state is only able to capitalize on $2B of that via taxation, but I have a better idea. Using TSLA's *minimum* P/E for the last few years of 550 as a benchmark, we get a price target of nearly $20T or over $1MM per acre. -an order of magnitude greater than pitiful little companies like AAPL, who have a market cap of a measly $2T. If we take shares of WY public I estimate we could *easily* see an ROI of 500x. Asset classes can be based on the primary use of the land. Common shares can be rangeland, the least valuable, with arable farmland comprising A and B classes (irrigated and non-irrigated, respectively), and residential/commercially zoned acreage making up preferred shares.

But, aren't there already people heavily invested in Wyoming? Well, the current population isn't even 600,000 people, so we already outnumber them over 15:1, and that's not taking into account that statistically speaking, *some of us are already in the trade*. If we're quick about it, the level of buying pressure we would generate can only be good for us, since Real Estate takes more time to respond changes in demand. Shortly after we snap up the available land *it will have substantially appreciated in value due to market forces alone*.

In conclusion, buy WY. The state. Buy it all. It's cheap AF, but if all 10MM of us work together we can squeeze the shit out of it, have a 500 bagger, and set up shop in a place where we'll never have to worry about the cost of reloading our accounts again!

After digging a little deeper I think they might blow them out of the water. 

If all is accurate this is what I found. 

1. Earnings out earlier than scheduled which is very bullish 
2. They just did a $305M raise priced at a 25% premium to market which was led by Mr Li Ka Shing (29th richest man in the world) who put up $105M of his own money
3. Completed the CRH Medical acquisition which analysts anticipate will bring the company to over $300M in revenue and $50M in free cash flow. 
4. JP Morgan the largest healthcare bank in the US extended the CRH credit line from $200M to $300M
5. 0 debt on the balance sheet and $80M in the bank after the recent financing 
6. What looks like a partnership with Apple? They are now the first Canadian company to offer EMR records on Iphone. 
7. They have historically beat earnings guidance and I think could do the same here given how strong of a close they had on Friday.

And here's where we are **(LOSERS IN BOLD;** *N/A, draws, or otherwise flat trades in italics)***:**

&#x200B;

1. **$CLNE:  This one got ugly.  Real ugly.  Volume completely dried up, which gave the shorts free rein to walk it down into oblivion all week.  They had an earnings call on Thursday, which was actually quite good (missed on top line EPS, but beat on revenue, upgraded forward guidance, and opened up more about the 1.5bln $AMZN contract, which sounds better and better the more I hear about it.  It actually traded up for a while this morning, but then just got absolutely assaulted the rest of the day because everybody was sitting it out.  I've averaged down - hard - on this one at this stage to make sure that I'm always within a day or two's striking distance of at least breaking even on the June calls.  I have started buying September calls at the same 13 strike.  I also started buying up more shares at $8.85 this afternoon.  I love a sale.   I'm going to re-evaluate how I feel about the June calls in the coming week.  Given that this stock has had 6 red days out of 7, any moves I make right now would be reactionary.  Further, one interesting thing I noticed was that, in the last 5 or 10 minutes or so, other whale buyers showed up HARD at the $8.79 price.  For a stock who's order book all day was just a series of 3-digit and low 4-digit offers, to see 50,000 share bids show up tells me that the shorts who had been fucking this thing all week were covering AND the buyers were coming back in (probably the same assholes who shorted it).**
2. *$MA:  I'm still yet to open a position here.  I just haven't liked the price action, and the charts have been very choppy.  If you've played it, let me know how it worked out for you.  Looking back at the weekly, I see some openings NOW, but they weren't real clear in the moment.*
3. $BABA:  I took the opportunity at 226 to finish filling out my call position as referenced in the last solo stock DD.  I know I said in that DD it was impossible to screw up, but apparently I underestimated the internet some, because I've had people messaging me saying they bought in at 234 and are down and ""feeling pain"", when I explicitly said not to buy at those levels.  It's interesting to me that the Chinese stocks, which are universally accepted to be underpriced, are moving in sympathy with domestic growth stocks.  That's broken.
4. **$BE:  Bought more August 31's on Thursday when it was at the bottom.  Sub-$20 was too good of an equity price to pass up.  I really liked the price movement on it yesterday and today.  Their earnings call was SPECTACULAR, and their leadership said all the right things.  I feel really good about this one to finally start moving independently of the rest of the green energy sector. Loser for right now, but I'm not getting shaken out**
5. $CAT:  Those July 230's were made of latinum.  Closed out today for fat profits.  I consider this trade over until $CAT comes back down into the 220's.
6. $EXPE:  Bought in yesterday morning.  Closed my position at about 2 pm EST today.  I sat on this trade a little too long and left about $3 a share on the table, but profit is profit.  It was a very nice trade.  This trade is closed
7. *$AAPL:  I never actually got into my long position.  I closed my pre-existing short on Tuesday and have been eyeing an entry, but haven't found one I like yet.*
8. $ALGN:  In Tuesday @ 575-ish, out today at 600.  Trade is closed
9. $PSFE:  As discussed in last week's post, I ended up removing this because the apes started trying to meme stock it, and I replaced it with $CVS, which has made me enough tendies to spring for the top shelf lube for when I fuck.  The $CVS trade is still ongoing and a good one to eye an entry, IMO
10. $CVX:  Jumped in Monday, and I'm still in the trade.  I like the movement on this one.  Still a good trade to enter, IMO
11. **$ENPH:  I'm upside down on this one, largely because I've been unwilling to average down on it.  My bags aren't super heavy, but I do have some Samsonites right now.  Going to just store it away and let it marinate.  The price action is still downwards here, so if you're eyeing this one, let it come in further**
12. $TSCO:  The price action on this has been amazing.  I've actually been holding this for quite some time, so my entry is way in the rear view mirror.  But I love how smoothly it's run and feel it's still got a lot more room to till.
13. **$CAR:  This is another one I've been holding forever, and just don't want to create a taxable event on.  The price action has generally been flat, if you remove the fact they had earnings this week, and we all know what earnings means in this market.  I still like this one for a buy and hold**
14. $KMI:  We don't talk about $KMI.  But if you're interested, maybe go look at a chart, because it'll make you wet
15. **$BB:  I haven't done anything with this, and honestly, couldn't even tell you how it's performed.  Probably poorly.**

&#x200B;

# The shorts:

1. $TSLA:  I jumped in at $712.11.  Everybody in the daily told me I hated money.  I got out at 666, even though I was swearing up and down it was going to 650.  The price action just looked like it was turning, so I took tendies.  Then it went to 650 like I thought it would.  Could have done it better, but profit is profit.  I'm eyeing a re-entry to the short side on this one.  I'm thinking 685-690 I'll likely re-establish.  Related note:  Think I've finally got a grasp on this one - 6 successful trades in a row, and I was even able to call the closing bell price within less than a dollar this morning.  This stock is finally starting to play by the rules.
2. $UPST:  My most reliable short  I'm twenty-some dollars a share in the green already and still holding.
3. $TWTR:  It's been SUUUUUPER choppy this week.  I got out at 52.80 for a nice gain, but I've hated the price action.  Staying away from here on out
4. *$CLOV:  Never had a good opportunity to play it.  Still watching*
5. $SPCE:  Death, taxes, and $SPCE tanking.  Still holding for a modest gain with stop losses in place.  Been pretty flat.  Probably still a good short if you can time it.
6. $PTON:  God bless that Shortbus All-Star kid who got eaten by the treadmill.  Lambo squad trade.  Closed out, and consider the trade done unless I see it in the mid 90's again
7. *$TSM:  Never entered.  I thought I had a price target in mind, but I wussed out at the last moment.  Doesn't matter, Theta Semi living up to its name*
8. $BLNK:  30% gain.  I'll look for re-entry at 35.
9. **$GS:  Defying the odds.  Trimmed my position to hedge losses, but this one isn't working out so far. Will look for weakness to re-establish in full**
10. $PINS:  Closed half my position at 60 for a nice gain.  Holding the other half with tight stop losses, but I'm optimistic it's got further to fall
11. *$BMBL:  I missed it.  Kicking myself for it, too.  I knew it was gonna fall.  Not sure how much downside is left*
12. $EGHT:  Oh the sweet sound of an equity dying.  This one is printing for me hard, and I think it's still got another 3-4 dollars to the downside in it
13. $MDB:  See $EGHT.  Exact same story
14. $PCG:  Riding it down like a submissive whore.  I'll probably run this one the entire month.  Printing nicely, still plenty of room to drop
15. $DASH:  LAMBO SQUAD!  Oh man, this one has been magnificent.  And it's still got downside.  Fair value IMO is 80.  It'll never hit it, but I think 110 is entirely doable.
16. $GRUB:  Reliable gainer to the downside, but not as nice as $DASH.  Still holding.
17. $WORK:  Quietly dropped on no news.  Just shows how broken the market is, because the buyout price is baked in.  I was following this so I could see news to potentially short $CRM, but none came.  $CRM, however, fell nicely on the week, but I wasn't there to catch it.  Trade is likely running out of breath
18. *$CAN  Never entered it, which is sad because it could have been a good gainer.  I'll rectify that mistake on some upwards momentum*
19. $BYND:  Yacht squad.  What an amazing loser.  Still holding.  I want to see 95
20. $AFRM:  I love the concept, but I hate the business model.  This one has been a great gainer for me, but I want to see 44.  Still room to drop
21. $COUR:  Inadvertent earnings play.  Didn't realize t hey were reporting this week.  Happy accidents.  2 bagger, excellent play.  I covered this afternoon.  I think there's probably still another 10% to the downside possible, but I actually like the model and don't want to tempt fate.  This trade is closed to me.
22. *$HEP:  Got in and got out at dead even.  Thought I had a good entry but then things got choppy and weird.  Removed it from my watch list.  This trade is dead to me with a draw.*
23. *$CSCO:  never entered.  Which is good, because it's run up.  I'm eyeing an entry*
24. $PLNT:  Another great winner.  I wanna see another 4 dollars to the downside  Trade still live
25. $QS:  Patently obvious this was gonna drop like a rock.  Ask me when it's at $10 and I'll probably still be shorting it
26. *$WMT:  I got cute and walked into a flat trade.  Will exit next week, win lose or draw.*
27. **$ADT:  Took the L here.  Entered at $9.27, got scared off this afternoon with a small loss.  They treated me like Ned Beatty in Deliverance.  Took it off my watch list, trade is dead to me just like that dude who wanted to fuck a pig.**
28. *$TW, $RTX, $COF, $NOC, $ADM, $AAL, $WHR, $LUMN, didn't enter any of these.  $COF, $AAL and $WHR are the only ones I'm even still tracking.  The others are dead to me*

&#x200B;

Wild card:  Scalped some nice puts on Brooklyn Pharm.  But any idiot could have done that.

Unexpected long:  Entered into $ON again with 1500 October 45c's and 300 1/22 45c's.  The price was just too good.

Any good news causes the stock to take a massive shit. 

Yes, you heard it here. Any news that would otherwise cause a stocks value to rise actually makes it take a huge dump. 

Tilray: acquired Aphira, prospects to be the worlds number one weed supplier look great. Stock drops 4 bucks and stays there.

MVIS: currently the only company with a working (and best in industry) Lidar and has prosect to either get massive contracts or even be bought out by Microsoft. Plummets like 15 fuckin bucks and hasn't gone anywhere since. 

GME: Hired top E-Commerce figures and booted their old dusty ass Board. Poised to be an industry leader in online sales and paid off their debt. Shit dropped from like 250-275 to 150-180 and has struggled to get anywhere since. 

But what's that you say? Bad news should make the stock rise then?

Fuck you for even thinking it.

Tonix pharma: rejected trials, failed formulas. Shit was once 4 grand a piece and now it's struggling to hit 1.20.

Apple and others suffering from Chip shortages, fell from 140s to 111. 

So whatever you're invested in, if you are expecting to hear ANY news about it coming up, wether earnings, announcements on product trials or if the CEO was caught at the boarder with drugs, prepare for a kick in the balls.

Exception: Alibaba ... Massive law suit, CEO disappears for weeks, suspected killed by China's Gov for calling them out, shit skyrockets ... 

None of this is advice for anything, least of all investment or financial."

I've been collecting premiums for a few months until AAPL popped 13% in 9 days. Although I had to roll my call options with a loss of 600 USD I still had a positive delta and made some unrlz gains. 

Now AAPL stock felt down to its corridor where it's been since August and my long-term options have \~0$ of unrlz profit while I have realized a 600 USD loss which almost equals all premiums I've collected so far.

Am I doing something wrong or is it just AAPL that is fucking me over which is fluctuating in it's price range but still takes away my premiums with a quick pop-up."

Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play.

I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint.

*The Fab Ahab:*

Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king.

Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making.

Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys.

*Hail Mary:*

I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade.

At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders.

*Intel’s Fab Focus In Question:*

Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD.

In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision.

And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing.

Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish."

($SONY *formerly SNE*)

Given the GME interest, here is an investment idea.  Sony makes & sells games direct to consumers, without relying on a middle man (like Apple). Sony makes & sells the most sought after gaming machine - demand will likely exceed supply all year (at least). They're also into VR (and make & supply the small OLED displays that power VR headsets & viewfinders).

Sony has a well established music & movie studios.  They  recently signed large streaming deals with Netflix and Disney.

Sony is also the top producer of image sensors - from mobile phones (iPhone) to high end cameras (they also produce their own line of stills & cinema cameras and lenses) to industrial sensors for cars & other machinery (ahem MVIS).

In addition to car sensors, they are now road testing their own EV - way ahead of Apple and many of the recent TSLA-wannabe startups.  They are a key supplier for other companies (Apple, Nikon, Panasonic, et al.) and they use their parts for their own products (the competition helps to subsidize their own products like Samsung).

n2ojmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n2ojmq/cohu_the_plug_for_your_favorite_semiconductor/,Cohu; the plug for your favorite semiconductor companies,122,57,2021-05-02 02:44:15,"What if I told you that Qualcomm, Intel, Skyworks, Texas Instruments, Samsung, and Analog devices all had something in common in their supply chain? They all buy their testing capital equipment from Cohu. 

Cohu offers a few different products. All of them are within the market of testing computer chips. Why is this market important? Well on the customer end, imagine if you spent 2500$ on a laptop and the intel chip inside didn't work. You'd return it to BestBuy, who would return it to HP, who would return it to Intel. A long and expensive chain of returns for a nonfunctional product. This issue can also be more than just an inconvenience. What if you bought a self driving tesla and one of the chips in the sensors didn't work? What if a Boeing airbus had some faulty chips in the navigation system? In short, it's very important that the semi manufacturers know that their product is working when they send it out. 

**Bullish trends**

1. Semiconductor volume is increasing in the following industries, **mobile phones** (5g needs 2x the chips), **Computing**, **Automotive** (electric and self driving need exponentially more chips than cars of the past), **Cloud computing** (basically a warehouse of semiconductors) **AI** (not sure how this works, but it's going to need computer chips). Here's my main argument: ***Each of those markets is rapidly growing, and at the same time chip volume is rising in each of those markets***. This creates a sort of exponential effect for the semiconductor chain. Not only is there a strong catalyst from increasing volume in existing markets (phones, pcs), but we also see rapidly growing new markets that also have high density. (cloud, auto). This is very bullish for the entire semi supply chain.  But the key feature that benefits testing in particular, is increasing complexity of chips. A more complex chip requires more complex testing, which demands a higher premium. 
2. Semiconductor shortage. We all know demand for computer chips is very high. And supply has just about run out. This means that prices for semiconductors should increase due to scarcity. This is great news for Cohu, as it leaves more margin to charge for testing. If you were ford would you pay a premium on chips in order to produce your vehicles?
3. Increasing chip complexity, on smaller wafers, demands a higher price for testing. AMAT recently noted on April 6th analyst day that capital intensity (% revenue spent on capital equipment) is returning to the 2000 highs of 16%. This increased capital intensity seems especially true when we consider the global chip shortage. Intel and Tsm are opening new fabs in the last couple months. These factories are going to require a shit-ton of capital equipment. For example TSMC announced they'll be spending $100 billion over the next 3 years on capital equipment, as their fabs have been running at 100% for months and still can't keep up with demand.
4. Trend of strong growth. Cohu has shown strong growth in the last year. In Q1 2020, revenue was $138.9 million, and gross margin was 41.7%. Q1 2021 revenue was just reported at $225.1 million, and gross margin was 45.6%. This is annual revenue growth of 62%, and margin growth of 9%. Business outlook in only getting better as the semiconductor shortage worsens, and demand continues to grow across sectors.
5. Very high accounts receivable. Accounts receivable is up 30% annually to 197 million$. Recurring customers represent 48% of Cohu's revenue, so this is a very strong sign in my opinion. 

**Bearish trends**

1. The company is on a huge downturn in the last few trading days due to announcing 42-45% gross margin for Q2 instead of 45%+, like Q1. This is on increased revenue of 234-250 million forecasted for Q2. A decrease in GM on growing revenue is never a great sign. The reason for this change is that much of the forecasted growth is in the automotive segment, which is lower margin than other segments I mentioned in the last section. Essentially the chips in cars aren't as complicated as the chips in PCs or phones, so they are less expensive, and therefore have a lower margin for testing. I will point out that the firm is likely to generate more gross margin dollars next quarter than this quarter, albeit on lower gm %. (.43x240=$103.2 gm, vs this last quarter 225x.456=$102.6gm). 
2. Recent stock offering. Cohu sold 4,950,000 shares at 41$ at the start of march. This diluted the shares available, but raised $202 million for the firm. They used this to pay off debt, and fund future growth. 
3. strong competition. Cohu's main competitors are advantest, and teradyne. These are two large global firms that have significantly more financial resources than Cohu. Cohu does have some advantages over these strong competitors, it's the global leader in Radio frequency power amplifier. RF amplifiers are a key component in mobile phones, and are increasing in volume with the 5g rollout. (more chips per phone, and more complexity) Essentially Cohu is in the dominant position in this growing market. Cohu is also the leader in automotive handling. (handling is a process where chips are moved into the testing device, then sorted based on results).

**Fundamental analysis**

I use a ratio similar to p/e. I use gross margin/market cap. (If I was buying the whole company, I'd want to know how much profit I'm purchasing).

Cohu annual gm=$316,000,000. Cohu market cap=$1,925,000,000

$316 million/$1925 million=6.09

This is a very attractive price/gm ratio. Lets compare it to some other companies ratios. 

Cohu-6.09

aapl-19.12

amzn-18

ter-11.3

advantest-7.19

swks-17.9

If cohu were trading at the same multiplier as it's large cap competitor, Teradyne, the stock price would nearly double.

Taking a look at the balance sheet, Cohu is in a much better position today than 1 year ago. They have $290 million of cash, almost double from a year ago. They also have significantly lower long term debt. \~$200 million today versus \~$300 million a year ago. 

&#x200B;

**Technical analysis**

[Cohu 1 year chart](https://preview.redd.it/pav84wurgjw61.png?width=1504&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d65ce5a266334b6f1c8a9cd3fb344509441451e)

As we can see from the 1 year chart above, Cohu seems to find support around the $40 mark for the past 6 months. Currently it's chillin out on the support line, so this indicates to me that it's a good time to purchase cohu, as I love buying dips. We can also see it's found resistance at around $50, having tested that line 3-4 times since the start of the year. I cannot say with certainty that it will break this resistance line, but I do expect it to at least check this number again some time in the next 2-3 months. My expected range for this stock in the next 3 months is between $50 and $65, which leaves room for some nice profit if one were to buy at $40. 

In conclusion, cohu is a small cap in an extremely hot market. It's got some big competitors, but it holds certain key advantages over them. The financial position of the company is really good currently, and it's growth should continue for the foreseeable future. It's strongest catalyst is that semiconductor density is increasing in existing markets, and new markets are emerging with high density, which has the potential to create enormous growth. For this reason, I think COHU is a great choice. (Even if you disagree on Cohu, you will want to have some semiconductors in your portfolio for the next few years). 

Disclaimer: I'm holding call options on this company. 

cheers

I spent 10 years with the company, now off and not under any NDA or limit to trading, so I’m now happy to throw some money at the share.

Nokia results this morning show good growth and strong pick up in profitability! Beating the estimates with a comfortable margin. With the house cleaned from bad leadership and product transformation well on its way, I think there are a few benchmarks that support price doubling.

Base business alone supports 50% up: Look at Ericsson: Although Nokia’s business is broader (I come to this why the real gem is there), at the heart is a business similar to Ericsson: 5G Networks. Ericsson trades at double the valuation. This should not be as customers, Operators, want to keep their vendors balanced to avoid paying massively more for their equipment and SW. This valuation gap will close as the roadmap gap has now been closed. Nokia is well ahead on future technologies such as Open RAN and Cloud RAN. 

In addition to Ericsson, Nokia has a better licensing and patenting business being a stronger brand and getting all the patents from Alcatel-Lucent as well. Also in terms of 5G patents, the long term money maker, Nokia is well ahead. This business is basically revenue=profit, thus its key to keep in mind.

Then there is the gem of the business: IP and Optical Networks. This is the crown jewel here, this part is always forgotten by analysts and investors. These guys are brilliant, top engineers and researchers sitting in Mountain View and Belgium, and as shown by the Q1 results, in a growth area. They make incredible products. Go and have a look at the valuation of Cisco (200B company), Juniper. Back? Good, these guys absolutely smoke both companies when it comes to technology alone. Have a look at Arista. Now Network Infrastructure division also provides similar dc networking equipment to the webscale companies like Apple and Microsoft. Arista alone is worth as much as whole Nokia, so there is massive upside here. The worst case is that this part is sold to a Private Equity investor, I know some are after it. This means maybe 10-15B valuation for it. Great, but I think this has potential for so much more. 

Why it has underperformed: Bad management and badly managed merger with Alcatel lucent. Nokia was held back for years by really incompetent management - that management has now been cleaned out. How incompetent? Think hiring senior people based on private life matters…Think throwing half of your R&D budget on a single customers request… New CEO, new Business Group presidents, transformation well under way (since 2,5 years in 5G), and potential in the share to double when executed right. And way beyond that thanks to that nice IP and Optical business. Think Cisco scale. 


Excited to see how the market takes to this today. The fundamentals are solid, and engineering competence is there, the results are coming in!!"

Alright Canootards,

EVs are out of fashion these days, which is all the more reason to Go EV bargain hunting. GOEV may have just been used and tossed out like a cheap SPAhhhC h\*\*ker, but we can transform her into our own Pretty Woman Julia Roberts. There’s countless amounts of DD on the groundbreaking tech GOEV engineers as well as the cat calls they receive from the likes of Hyundai and allegedly Apple, so I won’t go into their actual product, because if you know you know. Aside from mentioning that GOEV titillates my inner teenager that spent years bluntsliding paint off of municipal curbs, with their “Skateboard” design that allows for unlimited interchangeability. This is to say, normal car production can take 3+ years, but with GOEVs design they’ll be able to just swap out shells and have new designs in one year. Heels are out? No worries. GOEV will be able to keep up with the trends. Gas is out. Electric is in.

These are the upcoming catalysts for GOEV.

Short interest is at 30%. 90 million share float in which 30 million shares are short; according to NASDAQ and Market Watch. I know ya’lls favorite word is squeeze...especially when you can hold positions in a promising company.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Goev truck pre orders coming out very soon, Q2 of 2021. This will be a catalyst in itself. Estimated starting price is $32,000. Affordability creates huge market share as we've seen with the Model 3.

On whale wisdom, GOEVs Put/Call ratio is only .58. That’s an extremely bullish sign, as Nio is 1.06, AAPL is 1.05. This means there is roughly 2x as many calls as there are puts. With this amount of bullishness on GOEV I think it imprudent to be shorting Canoo.

&#x200B;

They were projected to burn through 14 cents a share last quarter but their burnrate was only 8 cents a share. Not a good thing, as they don’t have production yet, but they are being more frugal than analysts thought.

**Potential Drawbacks** CEO Ulrich Kranz just stepped down and was replaced by Tony Aquila. Although Aquila has quite the impressive resume, and was personally involved with the design of their truck, I was enthused by Ulrich’s extensive experience with BMW. BUUUT remember that Martin Eberhard was also CEO of TESLA before Musk. Also, John Sculley when he douched Steve Jobs. Also, Aquila said he would forego compensation and be paid in Stock. I love when management stands behind their work.

Also, Canoo is under litigation due to spreading rumors that they would be working with Hyundai. Aquila said that they were just rumors. No doubt Canoo benefited from these rumors at the expense of their investors. I still like the product but I will admit that this was a real nutslapper.

I fucking love earnings season. It’s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

This week, more so than others, is extra spicy, with all of $FAAMG (I kicked out Netflix for Microsoft after their disgusting showing last week) reporting alongside loads of other mega cap companies. There is a *stupid* amount of money to be made this week, for traders of all skill levels and styles.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades, I've enlisted the help of my buddy /u/laseryellow and [**compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Enphase fucking MOVES! On average, the magnitude of any given move for it is 15%**!!! An awesome play here would be a long straddle, or reverse iron butterfly. You don’t know which way it’s gonna move, but you do know that wherever it does, it’s gonna fly.

- Although a relatively young company resulting in less data points, **Pinterest also moves with similar magnitude**. You could consider doing something similar on this ticker as well if you think these premiums are better.

- At the opposite end of the spectrum, we’ve got stocks that *dont* move whatsoever during earnings season. The IV on these tickers is unreasonably jacked up for no good reason, so we can look to *sell* options on them to amass a small fortune. **Sirius XM, General Dynamics, CME Group, etc, all don’t really move, but the options are priced as if they are going to anyways**. Use this to your advantage.

- **Over the past 25 earnings seasons, Shopify has gone up nearly 75% of the time**! If you want a “safe” gamble, selling ATM put credit spreads would net you some *insane* premiums. BP also follows a similar pattern, clocking in at a 68% beat-rate, allowing us to make this play one two separate days, ensuring we’re not over-leveraged.

- Lastly, **Microsoft also follows an extremely similar pattern, clocking it at a near 70% winrate**. It’s IV is considerably lower than the other two however, so one may want to use standard call / debit spreads in this case as they are pretty cheap relative to the stocks price and implied move.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 60 fuckin’ companies, theres plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We’ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there’s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll hit up /u/laseryellow and continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**"

Cisco, one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand. 

Cisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could “...\[take\] another six months…” for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware. 

The effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW’s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, “...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter…” So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.

The United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders earlier this month to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.   
Meanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC has announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang’s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap. 

The increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reports earnings on Wednesday. Analysts are looking for the technology giant to post earnings of $0.98 on revenue of $77 billion after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple’s first product showcase of the year last Wednesday, and the company’s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it’s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat. 

Microsoft will report earnings Tuesday. Analyst estimates place earnings around $1.78 per share over $43 billion in revenue. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft’s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector."

FuboTV is a live TV streaming company focused primarily on sports which offers subscribers access to thousands of live sporting events, news, and entertainment content. The FuboTV platform allows users to have access to their content through streaming devices such as SmartTV's, mobile phones, computers, and tablets. This company gives the option to purchase additional features/packages that include more DVR cloud storage, number of simultaneous streams, international sports, adventure channels, etc. The base package provides a mixture of channels which includes the top 50 Nielson-ranked networks that span across sports, news, and entertainment. In the summer of 2020, they enhanced their sports offerings with the addition of ESPN and ABC as well as programming from Disney. In addition, FuboTV supports 4K streaming, although much of its content is streamed at 720p and 60 frames-per-second video quality. Since live TV requires a sophisticated technology infrastructure, Fubo utilizes industry standard digital Rights Management Technology and geographical rights requirements which enables them to meet blackouts if they were to occur. With all that content, FuboTV is one of the most expensive live tv packages that you can buy. Their competitors include the likes of YouTube TV ($64.99), Sling TV ($35.00), Hulu Live TV ($65), and more. Fubo's growth strategy is focused on acquiring new subscribers who are attracted to the sports and entertainment offerings that they provide. They monetize their subscriber base through subscription fees and digital advertising and in 2020 the majority of their revenue came from monthly subscriptions. Furthermore, in January of 2021 Fubo announced that they plan on acquiring sports betting and interactive gaming company Vigtory (see recent acquisition section) and they expect to launch a sportsbook before the end of the year.

# Total Addressable Market (TAM)

Live TV streaming is changing the way people watch their favorite sports, shows, and other entertainment content. As a result, more people are deciding to stop paying for traditional TV. Due to this disruption, billions of dollars in subscription and advertising revenue has shifted to streaming platforms. The global video streaming market size was valued at $50.11 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of roughly 21% from 2021 to 2028. In addition to the streaming market which Fubo currently operates in, their commitment to providing sports betting has expanded their total addressable market. The global sports betting industry reached a market size of $203 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow by $144.4 billion from 2020-2024 (11% CAGR). What hinders the growth of this industry is the fact that sports betting is still illegal in many parts of the world. Sports betting is currently legal in a number of states in the US and in countries such as the UK, Denmark, Italy, China, and a few others. While sports betting is legal in a number of countries, often times people have limited access. For example, in Costa Rica you can only bet online and in India only a few states allow sports betting.

If we add together the total addressable markets for live TV streaming and sports betting in the year of 2020 we get $253.11 billion. Compare that number to Fubo's revenue of $268.8 million in 2020 and we see that Fubo has a huge opportunity ahead of itself. As Fubo scales their new sports betting business and more countries and states make sports betting legal, we should see Fubo ramping up revenue growth significantly. Of course their is a risk to all this as it is very costly to scale both businesses that Fubo operates. Thus, their financial results will give us an idea of how they've been growing and if they can maintain the level of growth they've seen in the past.

# Important Points to Address

* Revenue was up 83% YoY as advertising revenue grew to $29 million (up 133% YoY) and subscription revenue increased 73% to $230.7 million. As we can see from the numbers, this company is growing at a fast clip. Although the revenue growth they reported is impressive, when looking at their balance sheet they still reported an operating loss of roughly $480 million which was a drastic increase from the prior year which came in at $39 million. Additionally, as this business has scaled they saw their operating expenses jump from $43 million in 2019 to $698 million in 2020 and their goodwill reach $478 million. What these numbers show me is that while this company is growing fast, much of that growth isn't necessarily organic. They spent $63 million on advertising in 2020, while only spending $491,000 in 2019. Also, their general and administrative expenses jumped from $13 million in 2019 to $78 million in 2020. While some investors may argue that this business is taking on significant costs short-term so they can succeed in the long-term, I'm worried that heavy competition will slow down their growth. One final thing to note about their expenses is that currently they're losing money on the subscription plans that they offer as their subscriptions revenue was $184 million for 2020, while their subscriber related expenses totaled $204 million. Fubo is up against some strong competitors such as Google with their YouTube TV platform, Sling, Roku, and other streaming services. In the future, we'll see how those expenses change in relation to their revenue as they scale their new sports gambling business.
* Fubo reported reaching 547,880 subscribers in 2020 which was a result of them growing their subscriber base by 261,754 subscribers. As they scaled their subscriber base, average revenue per paying user increased by 17% YoY to $62.84 and total content hours streamed grew 82% YoY to 544.9 million hours. These numbers are impressive as well, but I question how much of that growth was a result of the Covid lockdowns. 2021 is the important year we're going to have to pay attention to in order to get an idea of how this company operates in more 'normal' times.
* The final things I want to mention about Fubo's finances has to do with their current ratio and goodwill. Fubo reported current asset and liabilities of $156 and $227 million respectively, which puts their current ratio at 0.6. For any company to have a current ratio of 0.6 is worrisome in my eyes. Additionally, if you go a bit down their balance sheet you will notice that their goodwill is $478 million. Goodwill arises when one company purchases another. Goodwill is an intangible asset that is calculated by subtracting the fair market value of one company's liabilities from the amount the acquiring company pays for it. The amount of goodwill we're seeing with Fubo is quite high considering their total assets would drop by 50% if they didn't measure it.

# Recent Developments/Acquisitions

* In January of 2021, Fubo announced that they will be acquiring the sports betting and iGaming company Vigtory. The CEO David Gandler stated that, ""We don't see wagering as simply an add-on product to fuboTV. Instead, we believe there is a real flywheel opportunity with streaming video content and interactivity."" I agree with this move made by the CEO as betting is a great compliment to their sports-first TV streaming platform. Fubo's sportsbook is expected to be released sometime mid 2021 and they could see adoption in three states by the end of the year. It'll be interesting to see how this all plays out considering the heavy competition in the sports betting market. Some of the biggest names in the sports betting market include DraftKings Inc (DKNG), Penn National Gaming (PENN), Bragg Gaming Group (BRGGF), and more.
* In April of 2021, Fubo announced they were acquiring the exclusive live streaming rights to the South American Qatar World Cup 2022 Qualifying Matches. CEO David Gandler said, ""By offering the best of South American soccer in advance of Qatar 2022, we are further differentiating FuboTV’s sports-first content portfolio enabling us to engage with more consumers than ever before.” Once again, I agree with the CEO and this move highlighted his dedication to making Fubo a sports streaming giant. This deal will help Fubo's brand name as this company will be advertising to millions of viewers. David is coming into the sports streaming market aggressively and investors will be awaiting to see how this acquisition will play out financially.
* In December of 2020, Fubo announced that they acquired Balto Sports. This deal marked Fubo's first move into the online wagering market. At the time the CEO was quoted saying, ""We believe there are significant synergies between consumers who enjoy wagering and our subscribers who enjoy streaming live sports, creating a flywheel opportunity. As we’ve previously expressed, one of our goals with wagering is to expand our total available market (TAM) by developing another important revenue stream for fuboTV, as we are doing with our growing ad sales business."" While I don't doubt the strong connection between sports wagering and Fubo's subscribers that enjoy streaming live sports, I question if the ad revenue investors are expecting will come to fruition.
* In April of 2020, Fubo announced the closing of their merger with the sports focused virtual entertainment company FaceBank Group. The CEO of Fubo had said, ""With today’s closing, fuboTV is well-positioned to redefine the virtual MVPD space. Technology-driven cable TV replacement services are more important than ever, especially at this time when people are staying safe at home watching television for needed information, entertainment and escape.” FaceBank is quite an interesting company and developed some unique projects such as the virtual Michael Jackson show at the 2014 Billboard Music Awards. This deal not only marked an interesting point in the development of Fubo, but gave the company access to $100 million in funding in the form of a revolving line of credit. I wonder as to how Fubo will leverage the virtual reality and live-entertainment technology that they now control.

# Management

CEO - **David Gandler**

David was appointed as the CEO and director of Fubo in April 2020. He has been part of the team since 2015 when Fubo was simply a streaming soccer service. Prior to his role at Fubo, Gandler worked in the advertising industry for over 15 years at companies such as Scripps Networks Interactive, Time Warner Cable Media Sales, and NBCUniversal's Telemundo Media. David has won a number of awards which includes *Goldman Sachs' 100 Most Intriguing Entrepreneurs* (2019), *Variety's Dealmakers* (2020,2019), and *Broadcasting & Cable's Power 100* (2017). David's vision for what Fubo could become is interesting and the first of its kind. Looking forward I hope to see Gandler scale this company and integrate their acquisitions successfully. Undoubtedly, David has a grand vision for what could become one of the largest sports betting and streaming companies.

Co-Founder/CMO - **Alberto Horihuela**

Alberto is the co-founder and chief marketing officer at FuboTV and is in charge of their branding, user engagement and retention, and overall marketing vision. Prior to his co-founding of FuboTV, Alberto was head of Latin America at DramaFever (a video streaming provider). Alberto has an entrepreneurial spirit as he also co-founded Primerad Network, a digital video advertising company that connected brand marketers to Latin American audiences. In addition to his experience in marketing and entrepreneurship, Horihuela worked as an economist and analyst at Morgan Stanley and DeMatteo Monness. Both Gandler and Horihuela have extensive experience in marketing, entrepreneurship, and media to which should serve this company well going forward.

Management not mentioned: Simone Nardi (CFO), Mike Berkley (CPO), and Gina Sheldon (general counsel).

# What could go wrong

**Fubo can't keep up with the competition** \- As previously stated, Fubo is up against some heavy competition. AT&T TV provides more channels at the highest subscription level, but Fubo still offers more sports. Also , FuboTV's DVR only lets you record 250 hours of content while AT&T TV lets you record 500 hours of content. YouTube TV and Sling TV are two other competitors that are well equipped to steal market share from Fubo. The main differences I see between Fubo and the rest of the pact have to do with cost and product focus. Sling provides the cheapest plan which starts at $35 and is compatible with many of the existing streaming devices such as Apple TV, Xbox One, etc. In terms of the rest of the cohort, they all provide plans that are priced similarly. In terms of the products they offer, Sling, YouTube TV, and AT&T TV haven't differentiated themselves like Fubo. When it comes down to it, sports fans should gravitate to FuboTV as they provide the largest sports network. We'll have to see how this all plays out in the coming years to get to know which companies emerge as the leaders.

**Fubo fails to turn a profit** \- While this risk factor applies to any company that isn't profitable, it's important to highlight how early this company is to having a profitable business model. In their last earnings for the twelve months ended December 31st, Fubo posted $184 million of subscription revenue and $204 million in subscriber related expenses. Thus, this company is not making money on their services and I can't quite predict when or if this company will be profitable any time soon. That's not to say Fubo is a terrible service, but rather their financial standing isn't one that currently strikes me as sustainable.

# What we want to see in the future

**Contribution margin increasing** \- As noted in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 financial results, this company's contribution margin for 2020 was 10.1%. The contribution margin is the difference between subscriber revenue and what it costs Fubo to provide subscribers their service (ARPU - ACPU). While the contribution margin for this company sounds reasonable, the problem comes in when you factor expenses. Expenses such as sales and marketing, depreciation, technology and development, and a few others are hindering this company substantially from making a profit. Once you factor all the expenses of Fubo, they came in at an operating loss of $479 million. What we need to see from Fubo these next five years as they scale is them being able to at-least report a positive income from operations. Let's also remember that Fubo has a recurring revenue business model which means it is predictable and reliable.

**Fubo scales their sports gambling business** \- While this point is rather obvious, I wanted to note a few things about this side of Fubo's business so we can better understand it. Fubo has yet to roll out their sports betting business but they, ""expect to launch a sportsbook before the end of the year."" Certainly this is an exciting direction that this company is headed in. Although, we have no sort of guidance as to how this sports betting business will perform. CEO David Gandler was quoted saying, “We not only expect sports wagering to become a new line of business and source of revenue, but we also expect that it will increase user engagement on fuboTV resulting in higher ad monetization, better subscriber retention and reduced subscriber acquisition costs.” I like the way that David is thinking, but simply liking the idea doesn't make it a success. I can imagine investors will be eagerly watching how this venture performs in the first year of its integration. As for now, we don't really know what to expect.

# Analyst expectations

1. Predicted revenue range for 2021: $465.03 – 480.44 million (growth of roughly 110%)
2. Predicted earnings per share range for 2021 (EPS): $(2.5) – (0.82)

# TLDR

Fubo's vision to be a digital entertainment giant primarily focused on sports is innovative and unheard of. Their recent acquisitions of Vigtory and Balto Sports shows their commitment to making their goal a reality. While the CEO is thinking big, his ideas aren't translating well onto Fubo's financial statements. Their expenses have gone up at the same rate as their revenue has and that worries me. Additionally, this company isn't in the best cash position with $134 million. It's important to note that this company is still early in the process of what they're trying to accomplish and **I'll be keeping a close eye on how they perform this next yea**r. Their recurring revenue business model will surely serve them well in the future as it is predictable and reliable. You'll notice that the discounted cash flow is missing from this post and that is because forecasting this company's future growth is extremely difficult without some sort of idea as to what we can expect. As of right now, to put a price on this company is quite difficult.   


**In conclusion, I'll be watching Fubo's earnings this next year to get an idea of where this company is headed and if it's worth starting a position.**

mx4ozj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mx4ozj/the_weekly_market_recap_for_gamblers_and/,The Weekly Market Recap for Gamblers and Degenerates - April 19th to April 23rd,136,35,2021-04-24 04:45:37,"What’s poppin bull-gang, Flux here with your weekly recap of the markets! Earnings season is in full swing this week, and the markets were volatile. Boatloads of news, combined with a healthy amount of FUD was dropped this week, and I wasn’t around to observe the markets until Thursday, so this recap will be a little bit more bare than most. Apologies in advance. If you want a copy of the newspaper early, feel free to see the links on my profile! With all that being said, let's get into it.

&nbsp;

- **On Monday, the media decided to spread some FUD regarding TSLA** after reports revealed that two people died after a driverless crash in Texas. TSLA shares initially slid 6%, until people pointed out that *literally nobody was driving the fucking car*, meaning that the owner purposely managed to bypass all safety measures in order to avoid outright driving the car. Fuk a weight sensor, fuk a seatbelt sensor, fuk a steering wheel sensor, and fuk the bears, buddy put a case of beer or something in the divers seat while he went to plow his Tinder date in the back seat. Despite this gut wrenching news, TSLA closed the week up 4%.

&nbsp;


- To add to the FUD on Monday, **The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a warning advising consumers to stop using Peloton (PTON) Interactive's treadmill** if there are small children or pets at home. The warning comes after a small child died in March, *nearly two months ago*, during a treadmill accident. America really decided to snitch on PTON over some old old beef just to put my calls OTM, kill me man. This headline is extra stupid cause a small child and animal can die on ANY treadmill, not exclusively a PTON one. PTON never actually recovered, and closed the week down 7%. Guh.

&nbsp;


- **On Tuesday, Netflix reported some disastrous earnings**. Netflix beat on earnings a bit, but then casually tried to slip in the fact that they lost nearly HALF of their yearly subscriber growth, reporting 3.98 million vs 6.2 million expected. Obviously, investors were PISSED and Netflix plunged 10% on the week. To be fair, that’s what you degenerates get for sharing your Netflix passwords with your friends, y’all deserve this one. During the earnings call, CEO Reed tried to “urge investors to look beyond subscriptions"", as if the writing wasn’t already on the wall. NFLX did announce a healthy share buyback during the call, which is pretty awesome considering they just created a dip to buy. Cathie Wood, and CEO Reed were promptly seen religiously doubling down on their shitty investments.

&nbsp;


- Throughout the week, **random shit was mooning left and right, most notably SKLZ and MVIS**. No news announcements, no earnings reports, no catalyst. Just good ol fashioned market manipulation baby. MVIS saw $10.20 before closing the week up 80% around $18.00, while SKLZ followed closeby seeing $12.50 before closing the week up 50% at $18.50. I was eyeing skillz for weeks at this point but didn’t want to catch the knife until it settled. Ah well, live to trade another day I suppose.

&nbsp;


- On Thursday, the media was back to spreading FUD. According to a report by Bloomberg, **President Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6%** to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new marginal 39.6% rate would be an increase from the current base rate of 20%, the people said on the condition of anonymity because the plan is not yet public. The proposal could reverse a long-standing provision of the tax code that taxes returns on investment lower than on labor/salary. **When coupled with the 3.8% tax on investment income that funds the Affordable Care Act, federal tax rates for investors could be as high as 43.4%**. For $1 million earners in high-tax states, rates on capital gains could be above 50%. For New Yorkers, the combined state and federal capital gains rate could be as high as 52.22%. For Californians, it could be 56.7%. Although this news has already been known for a long ass time, it still tanked the markets 1% on the day. Algos reacting to humans reacting to algos, crazy shit. I can’t help feel like this entire situation was comedic as hell. Rich people make too much money, therefore we wanna increase taxes on the ultra-wealthy. The ultra-wealthy then immediately withdraw all money from the stock market and we’re left with retail traders left holding bags. Wealth is transferred from the poor to the rich. Mission accomplished.

&nbsp;


- **To those familiar with the [Lil Yachty Indicator](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg0975/lil_yachty_theory_goes_on/), this week was terrifying**. On 4/20, Lil Yachty released a hit single, causing the market to absolutely shit itself. Although the market managed to recover, the stress it caused wasn’t all that welcome, because the song itself was pretty dogshit. On top of all that, on Friday he also announced that he’s dropping a ***WHOLE ASS ALBUM***. Friday was a ripping green day, which is really fucking awesome, cause it means I got to liquid all my positions at an all time high. I hope you all followed suit, cause next week we’re gonna be blood red. Don't believe me? Search up ""Lil Yachty Crashes Stock Market"" on youtube for some definitive proof.

&nbsp;


- **There was a whole bunch of news this week that I didn’t have time to write about, but I encourage you to look into it** later if it interests you! I’ll summarize them all below. The U.K. government said it would probe **Nvidia** Corp.'s $40 billion deal to buy British chip-designer Arm from SoftBank Group Corp. Chat startup **Discord** Inc. has halted talks to sell itself to potential suitors including **Microsoft**, according to people familiar with the matter. On Tuesday, **Apple** announced a new slate of products set to include the company's own chip. **U.S. weekly jobless claims fell to 547,000** in the latest week, below the 617 estimate and from 586,000 prior week. Continued claims fell to 3.674M vs. the estimated 3.667M.

&nbsp;


All in all, that wraps up this week's recap! Apologies for the shorter report this time round, I was extremely busy with work this week, and earnings season came with WAY too much additional news. I hope you all have a wonderful weekend, and come back on Monday rejuvenated for some more trading. Cheers 😎"

mv43dh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mv43dh/viac_bananas/,$VIAC Bananas 🍌🍌🍌,90,49,2021-04-21 08:11:47,"**TL;DR**. 

*Even in a declining environment VIAC is still fairly valued at* **$37.83.**  
*And in a bullish environment VIAC is fairly valued at* **$65.26.**.   
*And based on the EPV valuation it is a woapping* **$86.23**   

**VIAC offers a unique opportunity to take advantage of a current market in-efficiency.**   
As we all know by now a series of events lead to Archegos getting margin called. The Archegos fund was extremely aggressive and was operating under 5x leverage, heavily concentrating on Chinese and Media Stocks, such as BAIDU, BILI, TCEHY, IQ, VIAC, DISCA. There are many articles that explain how this margin call came to be. I won’t be discussing it here, because I want to discuss the opportunity this presents.

Whether you think Paramount + is good or not. I still think there is still an opportunity to cash in on VIAC’s assets. VIAC has a strong balance sheet and many assets that are valuable in the content business regardless if Paramount + takes off or not. Let’s address the elephants in the room. Can Paramount + compete with the top players like NFLX, DIS, or even HBO MAX?
I don’t think it matters if they can successfully compete or not because they have a huge library of content they can sell licences on and this makes them a valuable target to be acquired by the likes of AAPL or AMZN who are trying to pave their way into the streaming business. Their main revenue driver is cable television and everybody is cutting the cord these days so this is a shrinking segment, this does pose a risk to their recurring revenue. However they have another valuable asset that will help them offset this risk, and that is live sports. Although cable TV is shrinking, sports is definitely not and VIAC has many contracts and rights to stream live sports on their Paramount + service. None of the top 3 streaming services I mentioned does live sports streaming, and I’m sure they would love to add live sports on their library of contents. Their only competitor in the live sports segment FUBO. I do not perceive FUBO as a threat yet as they’re extremely overvalued and the business is losing money and has a lot of catching up to do. Even if FUBO is acquired before VIAC does, the acquisition of FUBO will force the other large streaming service to try and acquire their own to compete.

**The Valuation:**

I will present you with 3 different valuation all of them assume Paramount + is a flop and does not take off so I assume zero growth on their streaming service.   

Scenario one: Bullcase, I assume they will grow their total revenue by 3-5% for the next 5 year.  
[Revenue Estimates](https://imgur.com/78x276u).  
[DCF Valuation](https://imgur.com/s6TOmhj)

Scenario two: Bearcase, I assume their total revenue will be shrinking by  (-) 7-3%.  
[Revenue Calculations](https://imgur.com/JUWIXuz).  
[DCF Valuation](https://imgur.com/gra7R5E).  

Scenario three: I used an old school valuation method to value the business, Earning Power Value (EPV). In the EPV method it takes away the requirement for trying to predict the future and only takes into account the present business earning power. This method of valuation assumes no growth to the business. This method of valuation is a good valuation metric for valuing mature non growing businesses.

**Conclusion:**

Even in a declining environment VIAC is still fairly valued at **$37.83**.  
And in a bullish environment VIAC is fairly valued at **$65.26**.  
And based on the EPV valuation it is a woapping **$86.23**.

**Updated snapshot of consolidated option position** (stock in separate account). Open calls, heavily weighted towards safer strikes because I'm a pansy. Position is understated both in total and net return by about $20k because Ally is hot garbage.

[Open: May 21 $125, $130, $135. Aug 20 $120, $125, $130, $140, $145, $150, $160 ](https://preview.redd.it/xcprmy2ub7u61.png?width=1631&format=png&auto=webp&s=975fbcfbc92569cdc660d471ad5f391ce39a236d)

**TL;DR yet again** \- Quest performed over 10.4 million COVID tests during Q1 and base case testing has rebounded. They are still executing over $900 million in share repurchases over the next 3 months, which equates to a buyback of roughly 5% of their float. Then they have another $ BILLION of repurchases authorized for the back half of 2021 as well. Additionally, the technicals are some of the most bullish I've ever seen. And yet, the company still trades well behind their top competitor, Labcorp $LH. **I'll say it until I'm blue in the face from wearing these 6 masks, $DGX remains the safest trade in this market.**

**$DGX vs $LH** \- Look, I think I've beaten this comparison to death over the previous DDs, so I'll just add this quick table reflecting DGX share price as a % of LH. Note that prices are somewhat smoothed within each month.

https://preview.redd.it/rnve5wp4h7u61.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb8af65266c0df12e9022e4ba9b2c93cb04e4a6b

That's a pretty damn consistent trend isn't it? And don't worry, I know you aren't here to do math. If $DGX was trading at a conservative 60% of LH, it would be $156. Right now. Now, people can argue the LH Covance acquisition makes their growth prospects better than Quest. Maybe. But it certainly shouldn't drive this large of a variance.

**Charting / Technicals** \- Virtually all technicals are neutral or **VERY bullish** at this point. I also encourage those who like charting to checkout the 1-2 year trend. Then for more fun, take a look at the intraday trading over the last 60ish days. Look, I think charting is worthless 95% of the time as are technicals without a lot of context, but there are some obvious patterns in trading over the last couple months specifically. To me, it's clear institutions have been deliberately chasing out retail and consistently repurchasing at a lower price. On-balance Volume is soaring, which when combined with other metrics, is a great indicator of large ""smart money"" bets. This happens all the time. It's why stocks like Apple unexpectedly flatline for substantial periods of time, then make a huge move upward on ""info"" or ""results"" that you thought were easily foreseeable long ago.

**Institutions** and other big boys (or, conversely, dbag hedgefunds) - **13F filings** in Q1 and Q2 (so far) were absurdly bullish on $DGX, buying the stock at nearly a $4 to $1 rate. This is a much higher rate than usual for $DGX and VASTLY higher than the ratio of $$$ intuitions are putting into $LH.

**Shorts/shorting because this is WSB after all -** The amount of shares short is surprisingly interesting right now. Sure, an increase in shares short to nearly 4m doesn't seem like a lot on a float of 132m at face value. But $DGX has 90% institutional ownership, the majority of which isn't being moved (Vanguard is largest owner and Quest has a solid dividend). So the public/retail is really playing with 16m shares or so. Then factor in $DGX is repurchasing around 14 million shares this year, depending on buyback price. **Now that 4 million shares short becomes VERY material.**

**$DGX Q1 Performance -** I still expect a big beat, projecting over $4 EPS on a lower than expected drop off in COVID testing, substantial increases in base testing (core business), increasing acquisition revenue, and additional COVID research projects. Quest continues to flat out tell you they are still crushing COVID testing. Sure, it's down slightly from Q4, but remains much higher than 2020 Q2 and Q3. Adjusted run rate for April remains high as well. And now they will have base testing back again.

An exciting week ahead of us, here is my weekly newsletter which I share every Monday to help prepare you for the week! Feel free to DM me and happy trades!

**Week of 4/19/21**

The S&P500 opened Monday 4/19/21 at 4179.80, just below the previous close of 4185.67 on Friday  
4/16/21.

Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) prepare to square up over the social media platforms controversial  
tracking of consumer data. Facebook, which generates a large portion of its profits from targeted advertising, is known to collect consumer data to deliver the ads it believes will be the most successful. Apple has been in the process of developing what it calls “App Tracking Transparency,” for its devices and announced in January that the feature will be included and enabled by default on all new Apple operating systems. The technology, which was tested publicly in summer of 2020, will prevent applications like Facebook and Instagram from being able to collect user data. Facebook has begun preparations to sue Apple, who is currently in the midst of a lawsuit over App Store payments for the popular online game, Fortnite.

Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke on the issue following statements from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg citing Apple as their, “biggest competitor.” Tim appeared committed to continuing to roll out the technology, saying, “Technology does not need vast troves of personal data, stitched together across dozens of websites and apps, in order to succeed. Advertising existed and thrived for decades without it. And we’re here today because the path of least resistance is rarely the path of wisdom. If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform.”

Apple will hold its first product showcase of the year tomorrow, 4/20/21. The technology frontrunner is suspected to unveil our first glimpses of consumer-grade Augmented Reality technologies. The product showcase comes on the heels of a great month for the emerging AR industry, which was just the subject of a $20 Billion military contract with Microsoft. Apple is up 0.86% on the market open.

Emerging fitness company Peloton (PTON) traded down 5% on the open following federal regulators warnings against treadmills sold by the company. The Consumer Product Safety Commission released statements April 17th warning parents of children and pet owners to exercise caution after the death of a child who became wedged underneath the machine. At least 40 incidents of injury related to the machine have been recorded since its release.

Reports of Google (GOOG) using foreign tax loopholes to evade taxes have emerged. The company reportedly used the “double-Irish,” loophole to funnel over 100 Billion in profits through Ireland and into Bermuda in 2018 & 2019, allowing the company to collect the profits free of U.S. taxation. The loophole was addressed and abolished by the U.K. in 2015, however the nature of the change to legislation still allows companies established before it’s passing to exploit the loophole. A spokeswoman for Google indicated that the loophole is no longer being used by the company, and that the U.S. taxes avoided by using the loophole would have amounted to approximately 80% of all taxes levied against the profits.

The September 2020 agreement to merge NVIDIA (NVDA) and ARM Ltd. is currently in limbo as U.K. regulators have released statements intervening in the acquisition. The merger, which was negotiated by NVIDIA and SoftBank, is worth approximately $40 Billion. The intervention was released this morning, 4/19/21, and carries with it the stipulation that a full federal investigation be conducted and completed by the end of July 30th, 2021. The state of the deal is uncertain as markets await a press release from NVIDIA.

JP Morgan (JPM) has displayed considerable interest in funding a new professional soccer league in Europe. The European Super League, which was announced on Sunday by a dozen of the world’s largest football clubs, will be established to rival the current European Champions League, and will consist of 12 of Europe’s leading clubs, mostly from Spain and the U.K. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan confirmed in an email that it would be involved in funding the league, but the amount in which JP Morgan will be contributing is still unknown. JP Morgan posted earnings of 12.61 last week and was up 0.5% on the market open.

A relatively low amount of major economic numbers will be released this week. Reporting starts with Jobless Claims at 8:30AM on Thursday, April 22nd. Instead expect a busy week for earnings reports, with many major companies reporting earnings throughout the week.

If your curious why these trends appear common for any ticker, it is because options are priced based on quantitative models (Black-Scholes, Bi-nomial...). The market-makers will price options based on based on well-understood underlying assumptions. 

Curves of VXX with strike are inversed relative to SPY and QQQ, which I find interesting. This would probably mean the longer time goes on, the higher the expectation volatility comes back up. The higher relative cost of for OTM strikes would indicate that when VIX does eventually spike again, people are betting it will spike quite high, and you pay a premium this insurance. 

With skyrocketing IV, sometimes things get out-of-wack. Meme stocks like GME and AMC have way overpriced OTM calls for example

From TuSimple's [S1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1823593/000119312521091150/d909743ds1.htm):

> Hallmarks of our proprietary semi-truck specific technology include our 1,000 meter perception range, 35 second planning horizon, high definition (“HD”) maps with accuracy within five centimeters, and an integrated L4 autonomous semi-truck design comprising of a fully redundant sensor suite and components.

In the world of autonomous driving, L4 is the point of full automation and a human isn't needed in the vehicle at all. And technology with a 1,000 meter range doesn't exist (the 35 second ""planning horizon"" is a direct result of the range - it's the amount of time to react at highway speeds).

This article [discusses TuSimple's gear setup](https://www.laserfocusworld.com/test-measurement/article/14197547/autonomous-vehicle-technology-shifts-to-a-more-realistic-gear):

> TuSimple equips its trucks with 10 high-definition cameras that can identify vehicles up to 1000 m away (day or night, rain or shine), giving them plenty of room to steer around other vehicles or stop when needed (see Fig. 1). Five microwave radars can detect and identify objects up to 300 m away, important if fog or rain impairs vision. A pair of lidars with 200 m range give detailed views of objects inside that range.

Let's go over that again:

 * LiDAR range - 200 meters

 * Microwave radar range - 300 meters

 * **Magical HD cameras that claim to be able to identify vehicles 1,000 meters away - are you fucking kidding me?** I can't link to YouTube, but find the video ""TuSimple's Delivers Enhanced Night Vision Capabilities with New Camera System"" and you'll see that TuSimple's supposed ""improved"" camera is actually less clear, it's just better with headlight glare, and sure as fuck doesn't have a 1,000 meter range

They claim their technology can see [up to 1,000 meters away - triple the range of any competitor](https://www.tusimple.com/technology/), but they outsource all of their hardware and nothing on the market comes close to 1,000 meters. 

> Aeva Inc, a firm founded by former Apple Inc engineers to supply a key self-driving car sensor, said on Tuesday it had reached a deal to [supply the sensors for self-driving heavy duty trucks being developed by TuSimple](https://www.reuters.com/article/aeva-tusimple-idUKL1N2K102G)

Oh, and when TuSimple [tried to demonstrate how awesome its autonomous driving system is, it failed](https://www.wired.com/story/tusimple-self-driving-truck-cameras-computer-vision/):

> The demo drive also, however, makes clear there’s work to be done. After 40 minutes of, uneventful robo-driving, a computer voice interrupts our conversation: “Autonomous driving off.” Without my noticing it, the safety driver has retaken control. “I’ve got a freeze on my visual,” he tells Hou. “I shut it down for safety.” A network card in that server box next to me disconnected, likely due to the truck's vibration, freezing the system's human-machine interface and blocking the bit that does the motion planning from the bit that executes its commands.

> And so this flesh-and-bones human holds the wheel and works the pedals for the next 20 minutes, taking us off the highway and back to TuSimple’s garage. 

TuSimple hasn't sold any of their technology. [Their revenues are from traditional trucking](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tusimple-ipo-filing-shows-self-driving-trucks-still-a-money-loser-11616535572?mod=searchresults_pos4&page=1):

> TuSimple has so far earned money as a traditional freight-hauler, not from selling its self-driving technology ready in 2024. It has customer reservations for more than 5,700 trucks, although those aren’t equivalent to sales revenue.

**TL;DR - $TSP claims to have self-driving technology that has three times the range of anything on the market, but haven't demonstrated it, or sold it, and the equipment they currently use is from other manufacturers. They have 70 trucks (50 in the U.S., 20 in Europe and Asia) on the road making normal freight deliveries, with ""safety drivers"" in the vehicles, and that's where their revenues are generated.**"

They went public via spac titled ' **Foley Trasimene Acquisition II Corp** '. And just like every other SPAC in the last 6 months, the stock price has run up then gotten crushed. I personally hate spacs, however if the underlying company is valuable once the merger is complete they can be a good investment.

 The Spac is sponsored by Bill Foley, a notable entertainment investor. He made a fortune investing in wineries, golf courses, sports franchises, and hotels. Their CEO is Phil Mchugh, who has a track record working at citibank and barclays. Overall the management team seems pretty impressive. (Especially considering citi handles all wire transfers on earth. The CEO has a lot of experience with credit and merchant payments. I did notice that his linkdin profile is written in the third person, which could be a red flag. 

Paysafe is fundamentally a transaction handler. They serve mostly medium and smaller merchants, and transfer money between merchants, currencies, and forms of credit. They have some larger customers, notably including fortnite, twitch, and spotify. The firm handled 92 billion $ of transactions in 2020. They focus much of their business on gaming, and gambling. Which are both attractive and growing markets. 

Taking a look at the companies SEC filings, the notable risk factors they list include risk due to brexit, risk of accidentally processing fraudulent claims, and heavy reliance on third parties for much of their processes (payment processing, banking, routing/connectivity, customer support, IT). This leaves me with the question what do they really do? My understanding is that the company provides value to customers by the middleman and acting as a connection between merchants, local banks, and larger financial institutions. They process payments and take a processing fee. 

Other notable risks would be the major competitors that the company faces in the fintech world. They are partnered with visa and mastercard, but will have to compete with COIN, SQ, SOFI and many others. 

Advantages? The firm has a solid hold in the European and international markets. It's in a quickly growing industry, and has good leadership. 

&#x200B;

Finances.

PSFE has a market cap of $9.7 Billion. Their trailing 12 months revenue is $1.4 billion, and their gross profit was $891 million or 62.5%, very nice. 

The market cap/gross profit ratio is 9.7bil/891mil=10.8. At this ratio the company is pretty attractively priced. (If you bought the entire company, you'd make 100% profit in 10.8 years assuming no change in valuation). For reference, this ratio on a few other firms.

PLTR-68

COST-6.3

AAPL-19.1

MCD- 17.1

INTC-6.03

SPOT-27

SQ-42.6

PYPL-31.6

VISA-28.8

Relatively speaking, the price/earnings on this company is a bit low. Especially compared to their most similar competitors PYPL and SQ. 

Taking a look at the balance sheet it isn't so sexy, they have a lot of liabilities and long term debt. Not the worst I've seen, they still have more assets. Their quick ratio is 1.35. Perhaps this explains the low P/E. 

&#x200B;

Overall, the company has stiff competition, but good leadership and valuable customers. They are also specializing in a very attractive market. The company is very undervalued in my opinion, and could potentially have a significant run up to reach a more reasonable multiplier. If it's multiplier were to be similar to its peers (SQ,PYPL), the company would 3x in valuation. 

I started off this DD hating this company because it was a SPAC, however after looking into it I think I may invest.

Edit: another notable risk I just at thought of for these guys is currency valuations, they do a lot of transferring between currencies as they have a very large international presence. Also fixed market cap # because google is a liar

# TL;DR

`Heutagogy - self-determined learning, is a student-centered instructional strategy that emphasizes the development of autonomy, capacity, and capability`

`Pedagogy - the method and practice of teaching, especially as an academic subject or theoretical concept.`

Roblox is fundamentally an education company that encourages students to learn modern-day equivalents of typing on a computer. These skills involve things like learning how to code, develop art, or strong communication skills. =

# Purpose

To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here. WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts can crush Wall Street analysts at places like Morningstar or M-Fool. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation or cooperation.

* Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**
* How do we compare social media incentives? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**
* What really is customer service? **(GameStop DD Complete)**
* Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(Kansas City Southern Rail DD Complete)**
* What are elements behind US lagging industrial sector? **(Autodesk DD Complete)**
* Do we understand the consequences of STEAM education (Science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics)? **(YOU ARE HERE)**
* Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? **(Cloud Compute DD in Progress)**
* How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that’s why I’m sharing my writing. I’m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.

# Video Games & Heutagogic Learning

It appears clear these days that video games are the most dominant form of media. This is because the video game industry can better access and more aggressively capture our high-barrier entry need for adventure and journey. Other industries compete with this element but ultimately place their customers in the spectator's seat. For example:

1. The short stories on social media like Snapchat, Instagram, Youtube, or Twitter.
2. The hero tales created by Disney or Netflix.

&#x200B;

[Gaming as the leader in entertainment or media](https://preview.redd.it/xms6g6ksvpt61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=e84e0655c99280e464931f3da513e33404fbdee6)

One must remember that the attention-economy fundamentally depends on on key metric: **engagement**. It is no secret why organizations like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, or even Tesla have further intersected with gaming in aggressive maneuvers in recent years as a result of this economic condition. Gaming is a big winner of the attention-economy and often sits at the frontier of new economies.  When looking at age, gaming or other medias can be the shortest path to reaching new or lifelong customers. It is a lucrative and difficult position to acquire or maintain.

&#x200B;

Think of it historically; during the first iterations of the web, many customers were fearful of putting credit-card information online while online gaming companies have ventured into selling branded debit cards that sold to children and youth that otherwise did not have access to banking. Roblox takes this nature a step further by effectively defining and supporting Robux-to-fiat economy as the lifeblood of the company.

&#x200B;

[First generation fintech and banking services](https://preview.redd.it/72qme0crxpt61.png?width=353&format=png&auto=webp&s=cadb26b801c61afe73a8a96cb16a0024c66e316b)

I’ve discussed internet media, user incentives, and their distinctions in a previous DD involving Pinterest. To highlight one of main ideas:

>""An internet forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. In my view, it ranks like the following list, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:

1. Google is fueled by customer’s need for answered information.
2. Online video games are fueled by a customer’s need for adventure.
3. Reddit is fueled by a customer’s need for community.
4. Pinterest is fueled by a customer’s need for ideas.
5. Facebook is fueled by a customer’s need to connect.""

In this DD, I would argue that gaming is one of the most comprehensive applications of internet forums that can encapsulate all of the needs above and dig deeper into the ideas that drive it.

&#x200B;

[The investment incentive: low barrier to entry & decentralized game development](https://preview.redd.it/hmibns2pzpt61.png?width=1303&format=png&auto=webp&s=a08c1a1680665d6f9272f3cff8ab19bb68f3f3ed)

I typically do not like to assert authority on a subject when I write DD, but I feel that in this case it is necessary due to an enormous complexities behind education technology, what's wrong with it, and what needs to be corrected.  In short, my view is that video games are one of the most powerful ways to engage students in a meaningful and long-lasting education, ranging from social to reading skills.

&#x200B;

[Heutagogic learning](https://preview.redd.it/rq9dxj9yzpt61.png?width=591&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4fbe53adde74b85313ca4dca53077e14de64983)

Online games fulfill a similar shortcoming that traditional medias fail in regards to adventure or journey.  In the same fashion, education and the art of teaching generally stutters when the student remains a spectator for too long.  What gaming achieves as an education service are all the critical requirements of a healthy STEM education:

&#x200B;

1. The ability to inspire curiosity and confidence.
2. The ability to deeply engage.
3. The ability to produce imagination or creativity.

Some of us may scoff about this, but there is a lot of truth to this sentiment that I believe many would agree with. For many early online child gamers, skills like typing quickly, bartering, multiplying, reading comprehension, or the desire to pursue arts originates from our time spent engaged by video games.

This is the goal and nature of heutagogic learning. This nature extends to adulthood, as many of us experienced this phenomenon while learning about advanced financial instruments for the sake of ""learning the game""  of stock market investing. We spend time scowering through forums and generating a community no different than that of popular online games.  Many of us have even acquired generational knowledge as a result of this media condition. We have met the proper requirements and incentives for a STEM education at scale.

[Andragogic\/Heutagogic learning at scale](https://preview.redd.it/gplo1bx41qt61.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=715bae2a0ff447bd5d21569bcac401c636c69dae)

I could talk length about this subject alone, but simply put, the world is not quite ready to accept such an idea. Games are still seen as entertainment, but it typically evolves each generation. In my generation, three societal transformations occurred:

1. It stopped being weird to purchase in-game cosmetics.
2. The idea of watching others play video games was normalized.
3. E-Sports became popular and inspired a new economy.

&#x200B;

[Second generation online gaming](https://preview.redd.it/4bt555i62qt61.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c281084802f3ff72cb8143b40761bde4fa9e5ed)

Some of these resistances are interesting when you look at it from a simpler lens. Why was it weird to watch others play video games online, when it was seemingly normal to watch someone play Dance Dance Revolution in an arcade or an older sibling progress through a game? Why was it strange to purchase cosmetic goods where we spend a large percentage of our time in digital worlds? Why was it bizarre to see dedicated players compete at global levels when gaming and online access became a worldwide normalcy? Usually there is no good reason for the psychological resistance to change.

Yet here we are, playing and learning effectively one of the most popular mobile games in the US.

&#x200B;

# STEAM Pedagogy - Arts in STEM

&#x200B;

[STEAM pedagogy for architecture, engineering, or construction](https://preview.redd.it/b57peu7j2qt61.png?width=2782&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e6ce51e01691091ff6dbeee88ff1dad985a2ff7)

With that idea covered, I want to transition to examine one of the leading pedagogies in US education, which is the inclusion of arts in STEM, known as a STEAM pedagogy.  It may not be immediately clear why the inclusion is such a drastic change to STEM, but one should consider several factors:

1. STEM education standards are poor with low engagement (a societal problem)
2. Good science and engineering requires confident students (resisting imposter syndrome)
3. STEM requires creativity and imagination (critical thinking requisites)

&#x200B;

[Game development, code, or design](https://preview.redd.it/556dqhnp3qt61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6b4a2ac6c89a435890fcd01210026208aae9337)

What an arts education does is fundamentally produce new language and learning skills that are actively applied in a STEM education. Typically speaking, arts is also far more engaging to youth while traditional STEM learning models can carry less obvious inherent incentives.

However, slowly but surely, we are beginning to see students who seek to learn digital art, coding, investing and other STEAM-derived interests that can transition into other branches of STEM as a result of incentivizing the desire to learn these skills.

A young Roblox game developer is only a short path away from finding a passion in architecture or cloud computing. This strategy is not new and has had success for organizations like Adobe, Microsoft, Autodesk, and other technical skills. These are largely andragogic forms of learning, or adult-centered educations.

&#x200B;

One of the most significant accomplishments of the inclusion of Arts in a STEM-centered education is the inversion of a question that afflicted many classrooms for generations:

>“Why do I need to learn this?”

It turns out, the answer is not

>“so you can become a scientist!”

but to provide an environment that encourages and incentivizes a proper learner's mentality

>“I need to learn this, so that I can create that.”

&#x200B;

Engineers and scientists are simply disciplined creators no different than an artist or performer. However, there are significant and clear barriers to entry to STEM-based and Arts-based learning. It is far more pragmatic for a child to inspire creative behaviors with a canvas, skateboard, or instrument while the barrier to entry for engineering practices may be far less accessible.

Some of this is partially a consequence of time, where there has been less knowledge transfer on writing software vs. writing prose and some of these barriers have compounding consequences at the socioeconomic level.  For example, there is a large disparity in big tech hirings, and such consequences can carry over to other multi-trillion dollar industries driven by infrastructure and Green New Deal policies.

&#x200B;

[Socioeconomic consequences in education support](https://preview.redd.it/t2mh2ikz3qt61.png?width=987&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ed2aadf47bb21e36d44864efe58303c20119d74)

Another huge barrier to entry to STEM is simply the fact that many students do not believe in themselves or have not been encouraged to imagine that they are capable of achieving success in subjects like mathematics and science, so there is an enormous amount of undue self-filtering in the field. Learning how to dance is a far more engaging practice to a child, while learning how to code in some developer environment without the proper incentive may seem pointless. Organizations like Roblox can and are changing the equation for some students.

You may be at a loss at this point, but it's worth taking the time to simply ponder on this and what it means economically for Roblox. The language used here is directly aligned with the language used in the Roblox S-1 registration document:

1. Inspiration mentioned 9 times.
2. Create and inspiration mentioned 75 times.
3. Engagement mentioned 160 times.

This language is particular due to the game identifying with its original iteration, Interactive Physics, an education game that launched in 1989.

>""The story of Roblox began in 1989 when our founders, David Baszucki and Erik Cassel, programmed a 2D simulated physics lab called Interactive Physics, which would later go on to influence our approach to building the groundwork for Roblox. Students across the world used Interactive Physics to see how two cars would crash, or how they could build destructible houses. In starting Roblox in 2004, we wanted to replicate the inspiration of imagination and creativity we saw in Interactive Physics on a much grander scale by ushering in a new category of human interaction that did not exist at the time.""

Understanding the nature of modern-day cloud computing and its future direction will allow investors to understand the paths that Roblox will take. The fundamental theory of this economy is that a customer's data is an increasingly tangible asset. The way that I like to examine the economic output of this industry is by two core economic elements.

1. The value of work generated by machine-to-machine transactions (network output).
2. The value of data and services generated by human experiences (customer input).

[Serverless computing - network service architecture for real-time and powerful apps.](https://preview.redd.it/wl88yq547qt61.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&s=618f6be99e0b7cc157065b4505cb82d7f89d5e36)

There are many organizations that capture the essence of this industry. Organizations like Square and Zoom will provide services that we're all familiar with, but we often forget the under-hood-details that exist and govern the infrastructure of these companies. What cloud computing organizations have realized is that as our engagement with platforms increases, the value of our data and needs becomes increasingly tangible. Our needs for financial technology or property rentals have resulted in regulatory or social challenges, which we typically refer to as ""disruption"". The disruption is rooted in the fact that our data is an authentically tangible good.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vpzpov6deqt61.png?width=845&format=png&auto=webp&s=0128b3dd2ee4912161dbfc99c9d312b8f57f9b6c

&#x200B;

This idea that our data and time spent on digital platforms is the central hypothesis behind creation of the robux system that Roblox lives on. There are many things that Roblox needs to accomplish in the near to short term to achieve long-term profitability and the leadership seems to have a clear vision on how to achieve that:

1. The company will continue to redistribute its wealth back toward its developers.
2. The company will aggressively invest in education sectors to incentivize students to learn valuable skills.
3. The company will support wildly successful games as a way to create a long-term identity for Roblox (like popular Nintendo games)
4. The company will continue to invest in its cloud platform and eventually develop its own hardware platform to reduce its expenses.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jr21jf1b8qt61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8175cc302d2be55fe0e446f0b78dc71d6f1d4956

The reason that I'm certain of this is because the organization needs to accomplish the following incentives and financial feats:

1. Reached a large enough audience in order to maintain long-term relevancy.
2. Produced and support games that create enough incentive to join the platform.
3. Created enough incentives for developers to produce quality experiences.

&#x200B;

>""Roblox has a vibrant economy built on a currency called Robux, which can be purchased through the Roblox Client and website. Users can also acquire Robux through a monthly subscription to Roblox  
>  
>Premium. Developers and creators earn Robux by selling access to virtual content. Developers can also earn Robux by driving engagement of Premium subscribers through an engagement-based payout system. When Premium subscribers spend time in a developer’s experience, that developer earns a prorated share of the user’s monthly subscription fee. Engagement-based payouts incentivize developers to invest in the engagement of their experiences. Roblox allows developers and creators to convert earned Robux into the real-world currency of their choice through our Developer Exchange Program.""

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h95ts6pt8qt61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0406e17772f8f302bfdc4beb4eee288509e07440

In my view, Roblox's 2020 premium payout system will be one the biggest shifts in media as it has many potential outcomes that we aren't fully implemented yet. This is the nature of certain powerful architectures like computing more data at the edge or leaning on services like Fastly, Amazon Fargate, or other serverless/back-end platforms. Roblox is no such stranger to this and I would say that they certaintly have a vested interest in pushing these kinds of interactions.

Some uses cases of engagement-based payouts are repeatable to other platforms, where organizations like Reddit could easily implement similar financial logic if they discover that Reddit Subscribers spend the majority of their time to a small concentration of subreddits. This already exists to an extent, where users represent engagement through coin-sharing and reddit emoji placements.

Another example, if a high-quality education game were to be released on Roblox, where the developer agrees to redistribute their earned Robux to schools in need, then Roblox has achieved an economy where a student who is spending time learning has resulted in the improvement or construction of other learning facilities. This is also reflective of the idea that data is increasingly tangible.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bb9j3yj7aqt61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=8308e21dd05757fa74928a26560f665d0d61bf12

The possibilities with an engagement-based payout system are enormous for Roblox and produces added value to the ideas behind things like virtual concerts, streams, or other experiences that aren't fully realized in the gaming sector. For example, what is the economic consequence of children having a safe environment to attend concerts of their favorite artists? At the same time, the Robux payout system is a non-trivial distance away from creating applications of other alternative currencies like exchanging Robux with other digital assets like VBucks, tickets, or block-you-know-what-based applications.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1g33ivkwaqt61.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6ff4e2b37801f0ee02fa70d46b8fa636bc5455b

Another core element to Roblox's financial future is to ultimately secure its means of distribution. As it currently stands, the biggest expense to the Roblox platform is the fee processing it must agree to when it comes to doing business with organizations like Apple, Microsoft, Google, and other payment processors like Visa and Paypal. One way to reduce these costs and increase profitability is to develop products akin to the Nintendo Switch or Oculus platform. This idea is not too far away given the nature of Roblox's business, which has an enormous amount of various types of games that would be well-suited by Roblox partnerships. Overtime, the value of Apple or Google's distribution power weakens as the company cements itself into public consciousness.

&#x200B;

The company has alluded to this idea with an April fool's joke in 2019, with a console known as the imagination-powered Robox:

>"" At Roblox, we’re continuously exploring new and innovative ways to bring our platform to millions of people across the world. Just as we’ve expanded onto phones, tablets, the Xbox One, and virtual reality, we believe that there’s an even greater potential just waiting to be unlocked. A new way to experience all your favorite Roblox games. A new way to connect with your friends. A new way to make your dreams a reality in stunning, 8K ultra-high definition graphics and at greater than 120 frames per second.  
>  
>Welcome to a new era of interactive entertainment. This is **Robox**.""

# Conclusion

There was a lot of ground to cover here so let's briefly review. Gaming is arguably the best form of media in the attention-economy where Roblox identifies itself at the intersection of education and digital media development.

A significant portion of the education sector is focused on STEAM pedagogy which aligned with and supported by Roblox goals long-term. Roblox is able to leverage cloud computing to disrupt traditional models in gaming, education, financial technology, and imagination markets.

Since the announcement there's been radio silence. Despite this, Discord was recently in the news again for banning NSFW servers from IOS. This could mean two things; A, Discord is scared of Apple taking notice and being banned from the appstore as a result of the ongoing lawsuit (Apple v Epic Games); B, Microsoft's top dogs are combing through every negative aspect that needs fixing before acquisition. I believe the ladder as Discord is definitely looking to get money ASAP but hasn't announced anything. In my opinion it'd be worth while to buy MSFT. It'd also might be worth while to hold on to the stock a bit longer while Microsoft would move Discord's server hosting to MS Azure hence strengthening their own platform. Take this with a grain of salt though as I'm in high-school and haven't invested in stocks."

[LOSS PRON](https://u.teknik.io/fkVQx.jpg)

The music for todays post is a tryptic. Play in this order.

**Hat in the Wind** \- **Themselves**

**Light Work - Prof**

**All that Glitters - Dead Elvis**

I spent today at work in a sort of elevated and removed state.  The feeling of wanting to puke in every trashcan you walk by mixed with the just-above-ground-floating-weightlessness of an empty portfolio. It was something akin to a cactus whose skin people drink in a jungle I was once in.  Truly my spirit is no longer burdened by excessive wealth. Was it even mine though.. Zen masters believe you reincarnate through every door you walk through, Someone real sensitive said ""May we always just begin to see our selves as something else and smile""

**Some of you, well let me correct myself, many of you will know this feeling.**  The brief apparition of gold that appears in the middle of a trade which does not deter you from continuing some sort of mad ascension, pressing the gas pedal to the floor as you rocket into Valhalla as fast as you smash out. I want to be with you and join your YOLO'd ranks. I know these 5 digits are nothing compared to the magnanimous losses that sit on red thrones much larger than mine but its all relative right.  Life is too short to be a bitch and chicks dig scars.

**The specific details are a blur.**  GOEV is a fast bitch.  She's got a lot to offer just not now.  What tony has in his hat will take probably months to percolate... Shorts are in control and will be now that retail has been absolutely beaten up.  They will probably bail in some shape or form one of the first chances they get.  **There will always be a core group of supporters which I am one of. I really believe in the tech.  I believe that they have the power to disrupt transportation like the Model T did.**

News will be released soon and I would say that its going to be on a scale of -10 which is Lawsuits have traction to 10 which is Apple Car.  Factory and manufacturing partner with some pre-orders is probably a 5-7 depending... You're going to need an 8+ to kick off a naughty squeeze... Or someone will have to take on the unified shorts in the sector. The big move will be convincing institutions to buy in and catch the paper hands of the bailing retail.  Canoo must have a better ground game.  This will either be Cloughvis (God damnit I cant even use your ticker you absolute piece of shit stock because your market cap is too weak for WSB)or CLOV, Canoo gets to pick.  (Watch news drop tomorrow lulz).  Most good stock value plays are pain trains until they are not.

**Personally I need to learn to take gains**, be a bit less believing in my own confirmation bias bullshit.  I need to add a few months if not more to most options plays.  I also need to dark side a bit more and also run spreads. I also have to realize. Shorts are fucking violent and can bring pain.  They don't give up easy and fight on multiple fronts.

**Anyways I would like to thank all of you who joined me on this descent** into a sort of infatuated madness that could only be described as the autistic form of dementia that Lewis Carrol suffered from.  The following is a list of names and by no means is exhaustive but its the ones I can find right now.  I will continue to add as I re-read all the kind messages people have sent.  It has been a strange and crazy trip friends.

I do want to leave this, let me dismount my one trick pony and talk about the past and the future.

**I've spent a lot of time in the past getting into fist fights with death** (and only sometimes winning) and I realized that money doesn't mean a lot.  There's a certain level of financial stability which gets you to a point where you have everything on auto-pay and that works as long as you don't piss off your boss or still like your job. But its really just another stress in life. Enough money will buy you a seat next to the window at the SNF or all the experiences in life you can want.  But that yellow stretcher doesn't give a fuck where it finds you...  It will be there for you one day just the same. Please don't fucking waste your time its all you have. My **Hurt Circus** people will know what I'm talking about all lights, sirens boots on and beard on fire.

But fuck it, I want to be rich.

**The future,** at least as it pertains to this particular writing project of mine will be a rags to riches project.  We'll see if I have what it takes.  I'm open to suggestions of tickers or if you want me to write on something particular send it over and I'll give it a look. I encourage you to upload your own GOEV loss porn in the comments. But also if you won. Maybe show that off to...

But in the meantime I'll see you there.

Be well.

I know that some of you are very mad, cuz you bought into the wsb hype, but what happened tha last 2 days is absolutely normal and actually should be expected. Despite the fact that some retail investors think that those kind of events are some huge catalysts, they are just events that are intended to show investors and potential customers the capabilities of the company's products.

However, retail investors hype themselves up and buy the stock just before the event, cuz they either think that others will follow suite or that they will show some ridiculous, innovative technology or product. This of course does not happen, so they immediatly sell their shares, cuz they were in for the short-term anyway. At battery day Elon showed the huge progress that Tesla have made on potentially world-changing battery technology, but shares dumped by more than 15 percent the next day for the following reasons - 1- Tesla did not show an electric jet or a flying car 2. They did not understand anything about what was said and found the event boring 3.They were short-term traders that just played the catalyst. The same thing happened on the day that Apple showed the new Iphone- runup before the event and dump after. Both stocks are up big today.

Now before you ask why didn't you sell your shares if you expected the share price to decrease, I will tell you. Most successful investors will tell you that if you actually believe in the long-term growth of the company, you should not try to time the market. I bought PLTR's CFD's (certificates for difference) at DPO and almost convinced myslef to sell at 15, cuz I throught that the rally will be unsustainable in the short-term, but I am glad that I did not do that and instead I sold at 30. I bought shares this time at 24 average price. Of course I know that even if you are a long-term investor you will still want the share price to increase in the short-term ( there is something called opportunity cost) and I personally would like it better if the company was more transparent with the media and investors, but it is what it is. Just remember that the share price will definitely increase only if PLTR accelerates its revenue growth and customer acquisitions, everything else is speculation.

This is not a financial advice and I promise you that Peter Thiel is not funding my posts."

&#x200B;

GOOOOOOD  Friday, Retards!  Well, week   after Good Friday.  Whatever.   NrdRage  here with your weekly dose of   ""what weird ass company I've  never  before considered should I throw   money at this time?""  Today  we're  going to be looking at a company with a  150 billion dollar  market cap  (I know, I know, I usually shy people   away from companies  this  big)...that you've probably never even heard   of.  I give to you,  the  techgrowthboomer (?  I dunno, I guess it's a new  space) utility   company:  NextEra.  I dunno, sounds like a fucking   sporting goods   store to me.

&#x200B;

# A   fucking UTILITY  company?  Really? First you talk about a garbage  engine   maker you  trash the whole time before going long, and now you  bring   this Boomer  ass weaksauce here?

&#x200B;

Yes,   yes I  totally am.  You're  right, they are just a utility company,  which   means slow and steady  revenue streams, by and large.  But they've  got a   secret.  Well, 3:   Their CEO could steal your wife without even   trying,  and they also  happen to be the largest producer of clean energy   on the  entire  continent.  Which means they get all that sweet, sweet    unregulated  energy income.  Which also means they're afforded the    benefit of  trading like a growth stock to a certain extent.  Which also     means...oh shit, let's wait on that 3rd secret for a minute.  Added     bonus:  Even though almost every green energy stock from chargers to     producers to makers on the market has been getting gangraped the last     few weeks (they doin' my boys $BE and $CLNE dirty, man, but they're     fighters.  Stop asking, I'm still super bullish on them both...)

If     you live in the Southeast, you probably do business with these dudes    in  one way or another.  Who cares?  If you live in Duke Energy    territory,  you probably saw them roll up into Durham recently and try    and buy those  dudes out.  Big fucking deal.  They've got their fingers    in power  delivery just about everywhere, though.  With the exception   of  some  mid-Atlantic states and some areas in the Rocky Mountains,   they  stretch  from Texas to fucking those weird fucks in Prince Edward    Island.  Cue  the fucking cat memes, because none of this is    interesting.

&#x200B;

# Let's see how this turbine runs:

&#x200B;

These    guys are HUGE.   Like, that  ""massager"" your wife keeps in her    nightstand huge.  Depending on the  day, they're somewhere between 47-49    in the S&P 500, by far the  largest utility on Wall Street.  They    generate between 4 and 5  billion a quarter in revenue, and run at about  a   25% net margin.   They trade at an absolutely INSANE multiple  relative   to their peers  (about 30 compared to an average of maybe half  that for   everybody  else), so they seem really expensive at first  glance.   They're   looking at about 9% YOY growth for the next 3 years,  which is    staggeringly good for utilities, but not mind blowing as a  growth play.      As mentioned above, they get away with that valuation  because  their   positioning as a global leader in renewable energy  production  moves them   away from utility and towards growth.  There's  not an  executive in the   sector that will tell you anyone else is run  better  as a company,   though.   They've recently been on the prowl to  acquire  somebody -   anybody - in order to expand their reach and market   dominance.  Hasn't   happened yet, but with the way their stock is   valued relative to their   competitors, it's only a matter of time   before they make an M&A or   two in all-stock deals.  Their   financial house is in order, and their   overall debt load is   respectable for their market.

The     great thing about $NEE is that, not only are they ahead of the curve    in  every way in transitioning from coal to other forms of energy, but    the  costs for these technologies continue to drop, meaning that  their    margins are going to improve dramatically going forward - which  is why    they can sustain the premium valuation.  This little chart I  swiped  from   Irena

&#x200B;

So    no matter what happens re:  The  next paragraph you're about to read,    this (unlike the biotech stock I  talked about last week) is going to  be   just about the safest company  I've ever reviewed, even if my entire    thesis gets run over by a  monster truck.  It also doesn't hurt that  this   is the first stock  I've ever reviewed that ValueLine gives an A+   rating  to in terms of  safety.

# But let's get to the good stuff.  Shout-out to [/u/AllDatDalton](https://www.reddit.com/u/AllDatDalton/)     for bird dogging a lot of this information from his loft in a barn  he    rents from a kindly old man who's too tired to mince words.  Go  give   him  a like and a subscribe or whatever the fuck you kids beg for  all   day  these days.

&#x200B;

A  lot of you   idiots routinely  admit your shame in being bagholders hoping  that $ICLN   or $INRG will  do something other than fart when you poke  them with a   stick.  The  reason why these ETFs never do shit is because  the SPDJI   index only  has 30 stonks in it, and fucking $PLUG is the $AAPL  of the   clean  energy world according to it in terms of its weighting.   Which   means  if you bought in when $PLUG was rangebound from 65-70  earlier   this  year, you didn't make any tendies, and then you lost your  ass when    people got tired of $PLUG's bitch ass (Disclaimer:  I'm long  plug and    will be a bagholder until May when my calls expire worthless.     Fucking  $PLUG.  Don't buy that stock, and not just because they suck.  They're the anti-thesis of this entire ""Blackrock buying"" DD).

&#x200B;

Well,  that's   about to  change.  The number of stonks going into this is going  to   jump from 30  to....100.  At least.  Dalton (hmmm, I thought he'd be    bigger) has been  calling this the ""Blackrockageddon"", and you should    absolutely go read  his series of DD's on this topic.  I won't quote the    entire thing, but  the TL:DR is this:

&#x200B;

* On April 19th, this index gets rebalanced hardcore
* Whatever     gets added to the index, Blackrock (which, if you didn't know, is  the    Brad Wesley of the fucking investing world and the size of a mid   sized   country in terms of its assets) will be buying the ever-loving   shit out   of what's in there, because that's what they do.
* Therefore,     anything that gets added is going to get injected with a concoction   of   speed, cocaine, and some leftover Surge cola from 1998.
* This     index is going to be taking a sampling from best in breed and    influence  from a number of different sectors within the clean energy    metaverse.   Energy production, energy storage, smart grids, alternative    fuel for  vroom vrooms.  Think back now, children:  Who did I say was    the biggest  producer of renewable energy in North America?  Think   maybe  that company  might get added to a Dow tracked list?  Think   maybe, as  BY FAR the  biggest company in the entire fucking sector,   that company  might have a  disproportionately huge weighting in the   index?   If you  don't, you  might be the bad kind of retarded.  I'm   telling you this  because Dalton  has a philosophy to always ""be nice""   and he won't say  it.
* This is about as close to a sure thing as you can get.  95%, easy.

# 

# How much will Blackrock buy?

Dalton's     friend Wade says 400 million.  And he was wearing a manbun before it     was not cool, so you know you can trust him.  Actually, he had the   only   manbun in history that wasn't uncool.   My projections (this is   an   interesting thing, because he and I got interested in this shift at     about the same time) are slightly more aggressive, and I'm in the     480-520 range.  That's a lot of 1964 Buick Rivieras no matter who's     right.  These kinds of buys represent...oh jesus, almost 30 days of     volume for this company?  When you're talking this much money, you're     talking the back channels chosen retards like me use to buy our mass     quantities to consume (oddly, ThinkorSwim and JPM reserve just don't     have that much laying around), so you won't physically see it in the     order books, but you'll see an unexplainable melt-up.  Except that I     just explained it.  So there's that.

# Technical analysis, aka Man's search for faith, that sort of shit

I'm     going to do things a little differently this time because what I'm     DD'ing is really more of a momentum trade than a ""this company goin'  to    the moon, lads"" type of trade.   Instead I'm just going to show  one chart that explains   why the  hell these guys are so different from  every other utility out   there,  because I think that's all I need,  and then a quick 3 month daily.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That    shit is fucking crazy.  I  mean, not ""ripping the throat out of his    enemies"" crazy, but pretty  fucking crazy.  In short, this gal's got    entirely too many brains to  have an ass like that.

One price chart, but no lines.  Just to show that it's winding up.

&#x200B;

# So, to summarize:

* Big     ass utility about to get added to the world's biggest clean energy   ETF  -  and, in fact, is likely to be the most heavily weighted stock in    that  index
* Has consistently outperformed everybody else in their sector for basically forever
* Is one of the rarer types of stock that isn't presently trading at or near it's ATH, so it's got some room to run organically
* Maybe you fucking $ICLN cucks who have been bagholding that shit ETF forever can finally break even now
* Even     if the momentum trade goes sideways, there's very low risk of   existing   tendies.  Your upside is significant, and your downside if   everything   goes as wrong as it possibly can is fairly minimal
* You     can still convince yourself as you cry in the shower about how old     you're getting that you're not REALLY old because you aren't buying a     utility company, but a Techility company, and everybody knows fusion  is    the best kind of food.
* Look     at it this way:  WHen you finally realize you ARE old and move to     Florida, owning shares of this is like getting a rebate on your     electricity bill
* I     didn't talk about it, but they recently had a 4:1 stock split, and     those usually provide some runway as people interpret the stock as     ""cheaper"".
* I     don't remember Patrick Swayze ever talking with funny accents except    in  To Wong Foo Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar, so Dalton might    have  gone to drag.

# Price Targets:

&#x200B;

I'll     be straight:  Normally I would say it's priced pretty fairly right    now.   If not for the index shakeup, this would not have been my DD.    I've got  some short plays I'd like to talk about at some point because    the  market is going to turn to shit in May (and let me just apologize    for  not making a $DASH short DD a month ago, cause hoo-boy has that    been a  great play - hopefully some of y'all caught me talking about  it   in the  dailies).  I mean, more shit than it is right now.  As it    stands, I  think a short term target of 83 is really likely.  I've seen    long term  price targets of up to $113, but I just don't see it.  I    think $87 would  be where I'd start questioning you if you didn't take    profits.  And  remember, this entire thesis is based upon Blackrock    giving it a boost,  plus the added exposure that comes with being added    to a Dow index.  The  thesis all changes if that turns out to not    happen.

&#x200B;

# How to play it (There's always barber college if you fuck this up):

This     is a momentum play where you're just now starting to see the wind up    of  momentum (AKA ""How long you gonna be in town?  Not very long"").      Usually you'd see me advocate for some 90-120 day leaps 20% out of  the    money because usually what I talk about are mid caps with a lot  of    volatility that can flip your whole world upside down on not a lot  of    news because I like a bit of pod racing, but this trade should  resolve    itself much more quickly.  Buy some May 21 80c's ($1.50 at  the time of    this writing) and run like a thief if you want just a  little taste of    adrenaline.  If you want to play super safe, let the  underlying equity    come in a buck to the red and then buy $2 in the  money.  If you've  got   one of those working stiff retarrrrment  accounts, go into your  401k and   buy some shares.  If you want to be  ballsy about it all, grab  some   September 17 85c's for 2 bucks and  roll the dice.  The IV is  going to be   at a minimum because, even  though this thing trades at a  tech  multiple,  the IV is reminiscent of  the utility sector it lives  in.

**Commentary   that will age like milk:**    On the day of this writing, $NEE is slightly   green on yet another   no-volume largely red day where 10 stocks are   somehow making the SPY   green but most anything you'll track is red.    It'll probably fade into   red.  You might save a couple pennies.

# Position Disclaimers:

I'm     actually not going to tell you how many shares I have because it    sounds  like a ton (and, to be fair, it is) and I don't want to give off    the  impression that I'm YOLO'ing my life savings on this when the   fact  of  the matter is my managed portfolios basically is a mid sized   hedge  fund  and boring ass companies like this make up a pretty good   chunk of  that.  Fun money,  I've got 300 5/21 80c's, that I bought in   February on a hunch  about  re-balancing, and 500 6/18 75c's/ 500 6/18   77.5c (have been  building  that position since early March, so these   were OTM when I got  them).   These options, because they're so cheap,   really don't represent  a  significant holding even in my fun account   and my means of playing  this  trade is mostly via shares.

If     you're trying to shadow trade me, I don't know that the 6/18     75's/77.5's are the right choice because they're currently sitting at     about 4.60, but I only paid 1.47 for them so they made more sense for  me    than they will you.  That said, if you're risk averse, there's a    reason  why I chose June and I chose 75 when I started opening my    position.

All my love (And remember to not eat the big white mint in the urinal)

# PS:

Because     a lot of people have been asking me, as I've done DD's on a number  of    clean energy stonks:  While I think that $BE DESERVES a place in  an    index like this just because the type of clean energy they do is  so    damned unique and not represented by anybody else that is a likely  add    (nobody else getting added to this makes fucking microgrids), I   wouldn't   bet any money on it getting a spot in there.  I'll be   pleasantly   surprised if it does, but I'd put the odds of that at 20%.

HOWEVER,     since this index is tracking clean energy FUELS on top of clean   energy   generation, my boy $CLNE wants his shot at the title, and I   wouldn't  be  the least bit surprised if he gets a ticket to The Show.    Plus, I  mean  it's CALLED the Clean Energy ETF.  You can't spell Clean   Energy  ETF  without Clean Energy.

Buffet and Munger had avoided technology for most of their careers before they hit a home run with AAPL. Its unusual to see these old guys buying into tech stocks, so I dug in and did a quick sum-of-the-parts analysis. Here is what I came up with, would love to get any feedback in case I am missing something.

* Core China eCommerce biz has 60% of all eCommerce in China. This is a highly profitable cash cow - approx. $250/share using a 25x P/E.
* Other China retail including leading grocery co Hema and stake in HK-listed Alibaba Health – approx. $20/sh
* Net Cash - approx. $20/share
* Stake in Ant Financial at ½ the valuation prior to canceled IPO  - approx. $20/share
* AliCloud – leading cloud company akin to the AWS of China - approx. $20/share
* All others – Eleme (Meituan competitor), Lazada (leading SE Asia eComm co), Cainiao logistics, Alibaba.com wholesale biz, Yoku online video, etc. - $20+/share
* Add all this up and total value/share is approx. $350/sh.
* Stock closed at $225, so \~65% of sum-of-the-parts, or in other words, we have 55% upside.

At first the market didn't like it and on the next trading day the stock lost 10% (panic mode, loss porn and so on). However within the next 2 trading days BB has regained all its $ in a quick reversal. I'm here to tell you why.

This is a followup to [my OP.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/mhi3ev/blackberry_earningscall_were_actually_bullish/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) 

^(Quick note to the Mods: I believe my OP is about to bring new original content to the discussion and hopefully will be eligible to live its life as a post.)

**Portfolio Patent Sale (big $$$)**

Quick refresh: the stock fell because the revenue came below expectations but straightaway the company said it happened because they are currently negotiating the sale of a portion of their patents specifically related to ***mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking.*** Consequently they had to voluntarily limit the monetisation of these patents during Q4.

The points I would like to investigate are: for how much $$ this sale could go, how likely this sale is to happen, who could be the buyer and when could it be completed?

***First the money.*** CEO Chen during the call: *we will report a one-time gain of a reasonably big number, followed by a tail of up to seven years.* He also confirmed the yearly revenues for Licensing are around $250m. And that BB owns 38,000 patents. I will simply use these numbers with a DCF to estimate what that ""big number"" could be. Before I proceed I would like to emphasise that CEO also said: *we believe that the completion of the transaction will be beneficial to our shareholders* (if it happens).

Assuming a 10% discount rate and 7 years of revenue life, we have $250m current year, $227m next year, $207m (...) to $141m for the final year. For a total of **$1,339bn.** That's quite a pleasing big number but let's be careful nonetheless: we don't know the size of the portfolio being negotiated and the payment is expected to be initially a lump sum  + 7years of tail royalties. So they could tweak it a bit.

With a 15% discount rate we get **$1,196bn** and at 20% **$1,081bn.** Another way to look at it: if we consider that they would sell only 75% of that side business and we discount it at 10% we still get a number north of a billion $ (consistent with CEO comment: *it's a major portion of our portfolio*). So money wise should the sale indeed happen we are looking at an one time cash flow of $1bn to $1.3bn. Not too shabby for a $5bn market cap company with already $800m cash in its hands (yes they could have momentarily circa 40% cash to mkt cap ratio).

***Is this really happening?*** There is a high probability it would maybe 80% but it's not cleared yet. To get to this conclusion I listened twice to the conf call to try to decipher the clues. Whenever CEO was talking about the amount he sounded as if that part was near completion (*will be a big number* and *the majority of the deal will come in one-time early, but there is a tail that goes on*). Although he also stated that *the company has not yet reached a definitive binding agreement and negotiations are ongoing.*

The main hurdle might be the regulatory review of the transaction as the big boss mentioned that in the most conservative scenario: *we assume that negotiation and regulatory review continue for the first half* (of FY). A sentence that directly leads me to believe that the buyer could be a major company.

***Big money buyer:*** if there is a lengthy regulatory review it might be because the potential purchaser could be in a position to infringe antitrust laws (NB: antitrust laws were created by Congress to preserve competition among businesses and prevent any one business from dominating a single industry and building a monopoly). 

Speculations are ongoing that the buyer could be Facebook. It's honestly hard to say but that's the name with the higher odds at the moment. Just to recall BB sued FB in 2018, claiming the social media giant was using BlackBerry inventions in its messaging applications. Then they settled the dispute in January 2021 over patent royalties for terms that weren’t disclosed. You see the analogy here. By the way during the conf call this settlement was never mentioned and we still didn't see the financial repercussions in BB accountancy.

That said it could very well be someone else from North America, which leads us to the when.

***The timing of the sale*** is honestly hard to guess but again let's refer to the CEO comment that in their most conservative scenario the discussions could continue during H1. Subjectively I tend to believe that it would happen sooner rather than later because 1. they are losing money by restricting their Licensing every day that goes by and 2. it was *the* major statement in their whole conference call. You can arguably think that you would release this kind of communication when negotiations are very advanced. If I had to bet I would say it's a matter of a few weeks obviously subject to the regulatory approval.

**The Transformation**

By now unless if you've been living on Mars because that game rocket took you too far, you must know that BlackBerry is no longer an handset company. They excel at cybersecurity, they are deeply involved in the automotive industry including EV thanks to QNX and they are coming big hand in hand with Amazon to bring IVY to the world (October early release and Feb22 full product).

If and when they sell that side portfolio to a potentially big name you can expect all financial and traditional media to report the transaction and to emphasise the renewal, the rebirth of BlackBerry as an Internet of Things, Cybersecurity high-margins long-duration Tech company.

In terms of communication they have just started and they are about to splash the cash to continue on. John Chen is quite excited about it: *you will see us being more aggressive, in fact we ran an ad today Intelligent Security everywhere, an ad today. I just saw it on the New York Times and so we're just going to step-up in both people and spending and resources to go after the market and it is a huge, as you know very well, it is a huge market and no clear winner at this point.*

He later added that: *we have a reasonably large number of hires mostly in sales and marketing.*

***IVY is not priced in at all:*** there is no other way to say it. At the current BB valuation investors are totally ignoring the potential of IVY, probably because they don't understand it. Let me go straight to the point.

*BB and AWS said the new intelligent vehicle data platform, called IVY, will compress the time to build, deploy and monetize in-vehicle applications and connected services across multiple brands and models, making it easier for automakers to collaborate with a wider pool of developers to accelerate development of apps and services.*

The goal is to establish IVY as a standard platform across the auto industry, as Apple and Google have done in mobile phones through their iOS and Android platforms. This way IVY could be the equivalent of the App Store but for all mobility platforms whether EV, autonomous driving EV, air drones, rockets (SpaceX already using QNX) etc. The end uses are potentially limitless and most of the current discussed applications are under NDAs. Once they start to pop out, the picture will get clearer and clearer.

Similarly to what Apple did back in the days, BB has started an IVY Fund with $50m in it + $100K AWS credit for new startups willing to develop a product on IVY. Let's also not forget that the deal was approved by Andy Jassy in December who later got upgraded from AWS big boss to Amazon CEO. We can reasonably imagine that he values IVY as a potential disruptor and Chen sees it as a *significant growth opportunity.* Initially thought to hit the market in 2023, the early release will be available as soon as October 2021 (again the market is sleeping on this advancement).

One quick word on the cybersecurity part of the business: BB and CRWD have roughly the same yearly revenue (I will leave it to the experts to discuss how comparable they are). One company has $5bn market cap and the other $44bn.

**The Bear Case**

If the sale doesn't happen at all that's gonna look bad and hurt financially. Still according to the call, *full year licensing revenue will be in the region of $100 million* (if the sale fail) vs an usual $250m per year. As mentioned throughout that's because they are limiting the Licensing revenue while negotiating. Cybersecurity growth, QNX and IVY will still remain in play but more as mid and long term catalysts. They would still push for sales and marketing but the blue sky scenario obviously implies the receipt of a billion $ in cash in exchange of their accessory patents.

*Definitely not a recommendation to buy, hold, sell any security. Besides I have no knowledge in IoT, programming, software etc. I can only read.*

*Disclosure: long BB shares and June 20C and 15C (in that order).*

**TLDR:** BB is selling their old business patents probably for more than $1bn to a big player in order to focus on their new business model - cybersecurity, IoT, QNX, IVY - and come back like what's up."

DD:

----

- The 5.5% TSLA equity short interest of 44m shares [1] is only part of the ""true"", effective TSLA short interest: there's 2.6 million put option contracts open right now [2], a significant part of which are in the money, which, on a ~20% rally due to record Q1 results, combined with 2.6 million open calls, have the delta hedging effect equivalent to another ~100m shares short covered ...
- The pro-forma float of TSLA is 771m shares [2] - but at least ~130m of that is locked up by S&P 500 index funds, ~90m by options market makers for current delta hedging requirements: 220m shares or 28% of the float is already locked up today - effective float is 551m shares or lower.
- Due to TSLA's +1,000% rally in 2020 options market makers are net long TSLA by tens of millions of shares - so the delta hedging effect of put contracts doesn't show up in the regular short interest as it normally does for other names. Much of the effective short interest is ""hidden"" by this temporary artifact.
- So if we plug these numbers in: with TSLA starting at $661 if we have a major rally due to the Q1 results (TSLA already up +7% today) then we have 44m shares equity short and market makers lock up another ~100m shares during the rally just to delta-hedge the millions of puts and millions of calls.
- The delta hedging by market makers is anti-dilutive, just like short covering: it removes shares from the effective float. Anti-dilutive buy-to-cover is much stronger buying pressure than the typical trader-to-trader buying, because it contracts the float. 
- So should most Tesla shorts want to cover (not all: some are price insensitive hedges), they have to compete with the delta hedging of market makers (and regular bullish buyers): there's a combined buying of 144m shares on a 20% move, against an effective float of 551m shares. **That's an effective short interest of 26%.**
- A short interest of 26% for a low-float megacap like TSLA is excessively high compared to other megacaps: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and GOOG short interest is all below 1%, and their options open interests are an order of magnitude smaller than that of TSLA. [4]  [5]


I.e. the Tesla shorting that drive the price down from the $900 ATH to the current $661 is an ***excessively*** overcrowded short trade, with over $30b value at risk - which they'd want to cover much faster than any GME short position.

So a significant TSLA ""synthetic short squeeze"" is possible IMO, driven in part by excessive short options bets.

Should after the record quarter TSLA rally beyond $900 price levels to new ATHs, then all bets are off.

**Core Product**

TSMC was founded in 1987 by Morris Chang, who previously had worked in Texas Instruments. TSMC can be considered as possibly the most important company in the world that few people have heard of. This is because it is practically a chokepoint of the $470 Billion semiconductor industry and is instrumental in supplying chips to almost all the major players. Currently, the company supplies to Apple for their A14 chips and ARM-based chips for their Mac products, Qualcomm, MediaTek, AMD, Intel, and Nvidia.

The company is the world’s largest semiconductor foundry. They are in the pure-play foundry business. This means that they do not produce any processors for their own products but they manufacture and sell chips to companies such as AMD, Intel, and Apple. The main reason for which companies such as Apple and AMD source chips from TSMC is that they do not have to build their own expensive silicon fabrication plants (the CapEx of the plans run into 10s of billions of dollars and it takes an extremely long time to set up) to manufacture their chips. TSMC is currently the world’s 11th largest company by market capitalization ($554 B).

&#x200B;

[TSMC absolutely dominates the advanced chip market ](https://preview.redd.it/qx1btw29krq61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=61ce94bf883480c99f5e74a43bdea79bbf9d4d9f)

As you can see from the above chart, TSMC absolutely dominates the advanced chip market (<10nm, think phone processors) which also has the highest margins. The company effectively controls more than half (54% to be exact) of the world’s made-to-order chip market.

**Financials**

TSMC posted its best-ever quarter in Q4’20 with revenues jumping 22% to a record $12.68 Billion and profits increasing 23% to $5.1 Billion. They are also expected to invest heavily this year with capital expenditure for production and development of advanced chips to be between $25-$28 Billion. (60% higher than the amount TSMC spend in 2020)

They also have a very strong financial position with $23 Billion in cash vs a long-term liability of only $10 billion (YE 2020). The company has also predicted a record first-quarter revenue between $12.7 Billion and $13 Billion, which is almost a 30% growth from the same period last year. We do have to note that their share price has jumped more than 140% over the past 12 months giving it the current valuation of $554 Billion.

**Potential and Hype Factors**

**Technology moat:** Compared to peers, TSMC is easily the leader in chip production technology. The company has delivered over 1 Billion 7nm chips by 2020 whereas Intel is still trying to master its 7nm development process. For those who are unaware of chip manufacturing, in general, the smaller the node size (measured in nanometer (nm)), the better the performance and power management. This is why the companies making the top-end chips want the smallest node size available.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6mw9ehakrq61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=a70944796b31b7b971e743f497854c29d9b797d1

TSMC is currently in the process of producing 5nm chips (20% of their total wafer revenue) and is already ramping up for 3nm production by the end of 2022. It takes a long time to spin up a new silicon fabrication factory (3-4 years is the average time it takes for a factory to go from planning to production).

This leadership in technology would be one of the key drivers for growth in the coming years. The $28 Billion Capex spending also reflects on the management’s confidence about the long-term demand for the advanced chips.

**Strong long-term demand:** Even though the current shortage faced by automakers is mainly due to a supply chain issue, cars, in general, are getting more and more complicated and EV’s tend to need better hardware and chips. This will force the automakers to rush to lock in future supply. Even though the margins produced from the auto-chips are not as high as the phones/laptops, the producers of the chips are definitely going to benefit in the long run.

**Risk and Competition**

There are multiple risks associated with TSMC. First and foremost, at the current valuation, the stock is definitely not cheap. The current PE ratio is 33 which puts them in the same bucket as Apple and AMD. While this might be representative of their future growth potential, it is on the higher side for a manufacturing company.

The company might face a short-term crisis in production as Taiwan is currently facing its most severe water shortage in 56 years. Taiwan’s chipmakers have begun stocking up on truckloads of water to prepare for shortages. During a similar drought in 2015, Taiwan was forced to implement water restrictions for industrial companies. This can cause a significant impact on the top and bottom line as TSMC is currently producing at 100% capacity. A weakening USD can also have a significant impact on TSMC’s EPS as \~99% of their sales are in US dollars whereas only 15% of its COGS is in US dollars.

A long-term risk for TSMC is that their increasingly dominant position in chip manufacturing is starting to attract political attention. The current shock from the auto chip shortage is forcing governments to bring vital supply chains back into their countries in order to make them less vulnerable to disruption. In the US, lawmakers are citing the chip shortage as proof that the country needs to revive more semiconductor manufacturing at home. This has forced TSMC to build a $12 billion plant in Arizona. This political climate can be beneficial for Intel, given their current foray into fabrication. (I do not think Intel can effectively compete with TSMC in fabrication without significant help in trade restrictions. As we can see from the process roadmap, Intel is currently years behind TSMC in the manufacturing process and they could not make their products work even when they had the best process technology years back)

**Conclusion**

TSMC is currently one of the world’s largest companies and they are definitely not resting on their laurels. They have been continuously working on building more capacity and advancing their nodes. Even though there are some short-term and long-term risks in terms of their exposure to the US dollar, rising geopolitical tensions, etc., I believe TSMC’s current technological moat, a monopoly level market share in advanced chips, and the rising use of smartphones and IoT devices put TSMC in a very strong position over the long term!

Blink Charging is a small cap American EV charging provider with a value of 1.45 billion. It has been rallying from a around $1 dollar to a yearly high of $64.00 but in the last couple months has dropped in value by almost half to $34.00 due to a rising short interest amongst hedge funds to around 41% making it one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the Nasdaq right now. Not sure what hedge funds are short but I feel there are a few reasons for this.

The main reason for this is that there are a number of other competitors that are making inroads in the market and that Blink is relatively small amount of market share at 8% at current. Chargepoint is the largest in the market. Although I feel that that what the hedge funds have overlooked is that there should be room for loads of companys in the EV charging industry. The sheer rate of growth in the EV market has driven this company up 1200% and that has potential to keep going. Blink has implemented a total of 15,760 charging stations and Apple has added all these stations to its Apple Maps which is massive for the company. We also should not underestimate the radical change to the global economy where clean energy is going to overtake traditional fossil fuels. America has a target I believe of 2035 for the phase out of fossil fuel transport while most of Europe has pledged to transform its economy to be carbon neutral by 2030 with EVs playing a major part in that shift. This indicates that there is huge upside for the company in the coming years.💎🙌

Below I have highlighted a few of the fundamentals that are interesting and may look familar here including the current short interest (42%) and the current float 32 million. Thats around 20 million LESS than GME currently. 💎🙌

Also I checked on iborrowdesk where there is currently 45,000 shorts available very similar to GME at the moment although the borrow fee can be as high as 80%?? 

Here is where I got these numbers from if people want to expand on this.

However I do think that there is reason to claim the stock is undervalued regardless of what the squeeze potential may be if that sanario was to play out. What do you guys think I'm not a stock wizard by any means I'm just an Ape like you 🦧🦧 all so it would be interesting to get your opinions. 🙌💎"

**Unsmooth your brain - background on CRISPR:**

Now, what the fuck is a CRISPR and why am I bothering to explain it?  CRISPR is literally one of the most important inventions of all time. I'm not exaggerating. 

Your ape body is made of trillions of little fuckers called cells. You have all kinds of cells inside you -  skin cells, blood cells, bone cells, etc. Some of us here even have brain cells. But inside all those cells, there's something called DNA. You've heard that mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell. Well DNA is the CEO of the cell. It makes pretty much all the decisions, and is also the instruction manual/blueprint for how to make every part of the cell.

Now, imagine we can take the DNA instructions to make the chemical that makes a bug glow in the dark, and stick it in a banana. Think how much money we would make selling glow in the dark bananas to apes looking for a midnight snack.

That's what CRISPR is. **It lets you take DNA from pretty much anything and stick it pretty much anywhere inside another piece of DNA.** 

**Why NTLA?**

Making glow in the dark bananas is cool, but what if we used this to, idk, help people? Couldn't we just inject some magic DNA into people and cure their diseases?

Yup. And NTLA are the first ones to do it.

Late last year, the first human had the DNA in every cell in their body altered using CRISPR technology. 

This experimental ""drug"", NTLA2001, is for a rare genetic disorder that can be very painful and dangerous. **Until now, medications have only been able to treat the symptoms. NTLA2001 (theoretically) cures the disease, permanently.**

**Why now?**

On Tuesday, the **EU declared NTLA2001 an orphan drug**. Orphan drugs are medical treatments that are deemed important enough to have around even though the disease they treat is rare. **Important enough to have around that the government subsidize the research and production for that orphan drug.**

So not only do we have a world's first whole-body CRISPR therapy - which alone is enough to make the likes of Cathie Wood sploosh - but it just got bankrolled by the entire goddamn European Union.

**Strategy**

This is a long-term HODL move. But what a long-term HODL move it is. Imagine you're buying AAPL/MSFT in the 80s or AMZN/TSLA in the 00s. **This is not the only CRISPR company, but of the Big Three (NTLA, CRSP, and EDIT) it's got the most momentum**, making it suitable for shorter term plays as well.

**TL;DR - WRINKLY BRAIN GENIUS APES AT INTELLIA ($NTLA) GET BANKROLLED BY EUROPE TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING FIRST OF NEW CLASS OF WORLD-CHANGING MEDICINES.** 

**E: best immediate move would be to pick up long calls and/or LEAPS. I would want to see it dip to the 65-70 range to buy shares**

Fair warning, you'll develop a wrinkle of two if you proceed... but don’t worry my fellow ape brethren I’ve included charts, with colors, to make visualization easy. Let’s walk through these figures one by one and tell the story of Gamestop’s transition.

# Chapter 1: Gamestop’s Advantage in its Transition to Online.

Let’s start with the ugly before we get to the good stuff: **Operating Loss**. An operating loss occurs when a company's operating expenses exceed gross profits. Gamestop has had a fairly significant operating loss for many years now (peaking in 2018), as it faced the challenges all brick and mortar stores faced: theft of sales to the e-commerce giants -- the convenience of online downloads and pre-ordering on the internet. In the last two years, this loss has come down significantly. And what impresses me most about Gamestop is their cash on hand (currently $635M). Very few stores with operating losses have that level of cash. Most are in debt, and require the sale of shares to float by during rough times.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dyyd0zf7req61.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3e553bc397243f7b97702eb68d52d1a462c1431

And this is the key misstep the HF’s made in shorting Gamestop. There has been a stigma out there about brick and mortar stores going under (Toys R Us, and Sears as example)...  feeding frenzy, blood in the water you get the point. Sharks (HFs) have been getting more and more bold (reckless) in their targeting. Gamestop was the wrong target, for a very specific reason. It leases its stores. By comparison, consider Walmart needing to reduce stores, or Target. They’ve built massive buildings with parking lots to house their very specific store needs (huge upfront costs, sunk), and they rent (or own) these buildings under much different contracts. They can’t easily get up and leave one of their stores. Ask yourself, how would Walmart leave a store? Who would buy it? How could the investor renting to them turn it into something else? Maybe a city might want it to build an expo center. On the cheap. WalMarts costs are priced into this (it’s expensive). They can’t move as easily. Point being, Gamestop doesn’t owe anything to shut down a store, it simply stops paying its lease and moves all it’s stuff out. They rent strip mall locations and mall storefronts. This allows them to liquidate stores and downsize with little to no sunk costs. They can also reposition themselves much more efficiently. This is why we see this fast turn-around in Operating Loss last year (a major component of Operating Loss is storefront costs for Brick and Mortar). News of Gamestop closing stores isn’t bad news. Remember that. The media will try to sell it as such.

Because of the focus, Gamestop is eyeing Digital Sales, for its future.

# Chapter 2: Digital Sales Growth

It is clear to everyone, at this point, that Gamestop is looking to move a large portion of its business into the online space. In 2020 Gamestop did $580Million in sales online, and in Q4 alone their online sales represented over 34% of all Gamestop sales; Gamestop did more in online sales in the 4th quarter of 2020 than it did in all of 2019.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/80l9ei8breq61.png?width=1539&format=png&auto=webp&s=e16f718577f208643498038b3885b21f0e330092

So what caused this? Ryan fucking Cohen. And he’s just getting started. When we see the sales in 2021 first quarter compared to 2020 the trajectory of this massive shift will become even more apparent. We have only to look at Chewy’s online sales figures under Cohen to project what’s to come for Gamestop in the next few years.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rg3g528dreq61.png?width=1565&format=png&auto=webp&s=c83e58af632d1e9cc06f4e1da6c7df5f9c371f5e

That’s right, Chewy grew from $205M in online sales to $3,500M (17x) in 3 years under Cohen.

Gamestop Announced in it’s Q4 earnings report last week what it’s intentions are... *“Our emphasis in 2021 will be on improving our E-Commerce and customer experience, increasing our speed of delivery, providing superior customer service and expanding our catalogue.”*

Which brings us to our next chapter on the entire Electronics & Media space in ecommerce -- let's make sense of what potential exists for growth in this sector...

&#x200B;

# Chapter 3: Electronics & Media Sales

If you ever wondered where Amazon makes all it’s money. Look no further than the category of Electronics & Media (Gaming, computers, electronics, digital media). In 2020 the company did 120.9 Billion in sales, and 54.6% of that fell into this category. There are plenty of other players in this space, but only Apple is close to Amazon’s market share. Here is a chart to visualize the largest players (Gamestop is #10 currently with their 2020 sales, the tiny orange slice):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/im8t7lwfreq61.png?width=1529&format=png&auto=webp&s=52e086ce497c34d9e352cfed9fce99f50d2ce723

Amazon itself projects this space to grow 34.2% in the next two years. Meaning roughly $40B in new Electronics and Media sales will emerge in the online space for these companies to grow into over the next two years. Might be a good time to mention that Gamestop listed GPUs for sale on it’s website earlier this week, and they sold out instantly. With Gamestop doing $580M in online sales in 2020, and most of that coming in Q4 it is safe to say Gamestop is positioned to grab onto this space in a way that will shake Amazon’s growth models for the next two years. Have you noticed how Ryan Cohen is leaning on his Amazon (and Chewy) relationships to pull talent to go after this space. If chewy is any indication, I wouldn’t bet against him eventually grabbing a large percentage, even the majority, of it.

So let’s get to the fun part… valuation

&#x200B;

# Chapter 4: What is Gamestop Worth?

Valuations are a funny thing. Companies are only worth what people think someone else will pay for it in the future. Often we start with fundamentals, but in the end, hype and excitement over growth and continued growth leads to higher and higher valuations. I’ll start with a simple comparison just to prove a point.

Gamestop ($12B Market Cap) and Roblox ($36B Market Cap)… we’re all gamers here, right? We know what Roblox is, right? Two completely different companies, but let’s look at the figures anyway and then I’ll get back to comparing GME to the online retail giants. Roblox did $920Million in revenue in 2020 (up from $435Million in 2019), and it’s valuation rose from $4B to $36B. Hmmm… why? Well, it went public. IPO is a great way to hype a stock. Get people excited, maximize valuation, so those angel investors can finally get paid off. So how does this compare to Gamestop (minus the hype of an IPO). Well Gamestop did $6,466Million in revenue in 2020. Yep, seven times what Roblox did? So why the major difference in Market Cap? Well for one, Roblox has very few employees and no stores to spend money on (is this tickling that little feeling you have about Gamestop’s move to becoming primarily an online ecommerce giant, it should be). If Gamestop were valued the same as Roblox, right now… it would move it’s price to approximately $5,157 a share. That’s not a squeeze number. That’s simply an IPO hyped valuation number on growth. Gamestop is moving that direction, minus the IPO, but they are aiming to grow (like Chewy did).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ipbngvoireq61.png?width=1519&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a35214d7048744cd86debfee8cedda28b748b0f

So let’s get a better comparison to the other giants. Apple, Amazon Chewy, Target, Walmart and Best Buy. I’ve chosen these because they represent a wide range of Brick and Mortar vs ecommerce. Price to Sales Ratio is calculated by dividing the company's market capitalization by the revenue, this gives a general sense of how much the market is going to value a company relative to its revenue. Value players (like Buffet) are often looking for the lowest P/S ratio to enter for a fundamentally solid company, and companies with a lot of growth potential and hype can grow their P/S ratio (similar to P/E ratio) to levels that are very high. One thing you’ll notice in this chart. The more online a company is, the higher it’s P/S ratio can go. This directly impacts the Valuation of the company. While companies that may be online, but still rely most heavily on their stores, have a lower P/S because they have a lot of overhead costs. You’ll notice Gamestop in the middle, because it’s transitioning to ecommerce. Last year you would have seen Gamestop with a P/S similar to Best Buy and Walmart. The reason this is important is because as Gamestop grows it’s online business, it’s P/S is likely to rise, and moving to the Amazon level would represent a share price of roughly double what we currently see for Gamestop, while not changing anything about it fundamentals.

&#x200B;

# Final Chapter: Conclusions

Ok you’ve been patient, and I told you I’d eventually get to what Gamestop is worth currently, and next year (projection). What the market hasn’t caught onto yet, that we all see in Gamestop is it’s deep fucking value. So what is Gamestop worth, right now?

Well **$191**, that’s what it’s trading at. It’s only worth more, when people see these numbers and get excited about them. The numbers show that Gamestop is growing exponentially with its online sales and Ryan has brought on a team to accelerate that growth. I don’t know what Q1 numbers are, but I can guess a lot of Apes, are really excited about Gamestop, and becoming more and more loyal to its brand. I know I wouldn’t buy anything from Amazon, that I could get from Gamestop right now, even if it costs slightly more. It’s because of quality, and support for the brand.

Lots of things are increasing Gamestop’s valuation, but growth of it’s online sales will be the most significant one. What most analysts are ignoring (or simply missing, if I’m giving them some credit) is just how massive Gamestop’s online sales growth were last year, despite the pandemic. If we project Q4 numbers onto 2021, and ignored the dream team Cohen has brought on board, one can expect 3-4 times as much in online sales next year. That will tip P/S higher and people will stop seeing Gamestop as a failing brick and mortar and recognize it for what it is… an Amazon killer, going after an $88B market in Electronics & Media by 2023. On top of that, growing an esports brand (I suspect) that will engulf a $200B annual industry that is likely to only grow to $300B by 2023.

Project these figures onto Gamestop as you’d like. I’ll take a stab at it. Right now Gamestop should be valued at $662 a share, based on it’s Q4 figures and projection into 2021 from it’s finish in 2020 Q4. By this time in 2023, we will see Gamestop at a $50B valuation from $12.5B in sales, and a P/S in the 4.0 ballpark - that puts it’s per share price at $795 - conservatively without hyper on the growth (that you know will amplify that by another factor of 2-3). How do we justify a growth from 580M to $12.5B in two years… Ryan fucking Cohen is how. Multiple current sales by 17. Go back and look at that Chewy graph if you’re wondering how that’s possible. There is a gaping hole in the Electronics ecommerce side of the market, growing. Amazon and Gamestop can both grow incredibly without stealing from one another…

I have another DD in the works on The Squeeze (no dates, no times) and a look at how high we might go (spoiler, there is no accurate answer, but there is a lot to look at, and be excited about to try to make educated guesses).

Here is a teaser… When Volkswagen Squoze, it temporarily became the most valuable company in the world. Gamestop doing the same, would put it’s price north of $31,800 on it’s way to the moon (not that we heard a bell yet as we flew by that mark).

If you needed one more reason to HODL, it’s this… you will be at least 4 times richer a few years from now, even if you went into a Comma and your wife’s boyfriend lost your password couldn’t get to that sell button on the way down from the squeeze, because at $191 a share, GME is still a deep fucking value play squeeze aside.

And if you’ve ever wondered how Phineas and Ferb pay for their projects… I think I figured it out

If you need one more reason to HODL -- I have (had) a terminally ill child (no I do not want anything from any of you) that has a life expectancy of 25ish (she's 9). She survived what was estimated as a 1 in 1000 chance of making it (nine operations and three open heart surgeries as an infant-toddler), which is why she qualified and received a wish from Make-A-Wish (the best damn organization I could have ever hoped for). I have to also give the largest kuddos to this community. On the r/ PoGo board, when I posted about my daughters acceptance by Make-A-Wish to follow her dream of living our Pokemon Go in real life, this community was a critical part of making all that magic come to life. From volunteers who attended the event (400+ costumed members) to connections that got in touch with the animation team in Japan (they drew her a special sketch and all signed the back). Niantic also put UNOWNs of her name into her account after one beautiful soul reached out to someone high up in the org to tell them my daughters story. Why do I bring this up? I want to give my daughter the ability to live out her retirement when she's 18. Travel the world. Experience as much as she can. **If you need one more reason to HODL GME... I'm not selling until I can give her that.**

I'll start off with this number: **$8.9m**. This is how much Tony Aquila (Canoo's Chairman) personally lost between Monday's close and Tuesday's close. While we've all lost in the past day (I personally lost six-figures), Tony has lost more than any of us. While I'm not apologizing for him, I'm sure he too feels the fire of deep red in his investment. However, much of what Tony said, absolutely needed to be said. The moves he made has set up Canoo for long term success and I'll explain why.

I was looking forward to the Contract Engineering revenue and became disappointed when we did not see it. I truly believed this additional revenue stream would've been huge in the short term price movement. After all, OEMs are reaching out to Canoo for their expertise, while other companies are rolling trucks down hills or [trying to build vehicles that don't erupt in flames](https://www.thedrive.com/tech/39788/lordstown-motors-endurance-prototype-caught-fire-ten-minutes-into-first-test-drive). Having listened to Tony's reasoning and looking at [Canoo's financials](https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/52/canoo-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020-results), I completely understand why he nixed the Contract Engineering.

Let's go back to the end of 2019. Canoo was a young company. Developing electric vehicles is very capital intensive. Canoo's liabilities exceeded their assets, and at the end of 2019 they had a mere $31m in cash with $11m in current liabilities. While Canoo developed a great product, and held some cash, it may have not been enough to continue to gamma stages let alone enough capital to build vehicles for their subscription model. On the heels of Stefan Krause being ousted, Canoo was in turmoil. Senior members saw the writing on the wall, and started to leave in 2019 to early 2020. So, Uli Kranz (CTO, then interim CEO) and the remaining engineers did what they do best, find projects to work on. Enter Hyundai.

While the partnership with Hyundai may not have been ideal, it would've doubled Canoo's cash on hand. With a world-class engineering team on idle, it seemed like a really great idea to reallocate resources. As the saying goes, one in the hand, is better than two in the bush.

However, in hindsight, it turned out to be a terrible deal. Keep in mind Canoo's skateboard cost $250m to develop. We initially speculated the Contract Engineering revenue was $34m, but on the earnings call, it turned out to be even less at $25m. Furthermore, it's very difficult to differentiate your own IP versus the work you've been contracted for:

* If you developed a better skateboard for your client, you cannot use this superior skateboard as it belongs to the client.
* If you developed a worse skateboard for your client, you've now knowingly given your client an inferior product (see [Tesla vs Fisker](https://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-vs-fisker-the-epilogue-or-why-tesla-owes-fisker-11-million-3052/)).
* If you give your client your skateboard as-is, the client just received a skateboard that takes 3-5 years to design/engineer and possibly billions ([Faraday](https://www.businessinsider.com/jia-yueting-faraday-future-tesla-rival-bankrupt-2020-1)) if not $500+ million ([Dyson](https://electrek.co/2020/05/18/dyson-cancelled-electric-car/#:~:text=Dyson%20has%20unveiled%20its%20abandoned,on%20its%20own%20electric%20vehicle)), for a measly $25m. Congratulations, you just played yourself.

As you can see, none of these scenarios are ideal for Canoo. If I were Hyundai, I'd be all over this deal too. No wonder Hyundai was so quick to jump on this deal, especially after announcing their partnership with Arrival just a month prior.

**Upon closing the SPAC, Canoo is flush with cash. They no longer need the Contract Engineering revenue, and are actually better off without it.**

With this conflict of interest, I now see why many automakers are turning their backs to Apple. Why help a competitor to make a better product, for very minimal upside for yourself? As an engineer that signed up to join an exciting start-up like Canoo, would you be happy if you were pimped out to another company to engineer something that's not better, but not worse, but not the same, as something you've already created?

With that being said, Tuesday's price action was absolutely blown out of proportion, and I took advantage and bought GOEV warrants ($GOEVW) with both hands. Remember, we never knew details of the deal with Hyundai. Now knowing that the Contract Engineering would've produced minimal revenue, no royalties/on-going income, while delaying core projects, wouldn't you have cut this too? By killing the Contract Engineering, Canoo can now focus on projects that will set them up for long term success (e.g. designing tophats, factories and etc). For quick math, Canoo foregone $25m in contract revenue. Let's assume Magna would've charged $5000 for each vehicle. If Canoo instead reallocated resources towards building a facility, they would earn all that lost revenue within the first year ($5000 x 10,000 vehicles first year = $50m saved), while protecting their own IP.

Also, an important fact to consider was that Tony revealed that the contract value was based on labor of engineers (e.g. hourly rate), not value of IP. Meaning, Canoo charged a mark-up on top of their existing employee’s salary, rather than charging based on the hundreds of millions (if not billions) in IP they were receiving. While I do think Uli is a great leader, this was a great misstep under his watch.

With all the focus on the Hyundai agreement, we lost sight of gems uncovered in the earnings report/call:

* Internationalization. Lots of demand in Europe. International sales coming online soon.
* Better idea of cash on hand and operating expenses.
   * We are in a very healthy financial position. One-third of our market cap is cash. Canoo also has a mere $27m in current liabilities and <$7m in long-term debt. **If this isn’t a deep value play, I don’t know what is.**
* Timeline and order of models have not changed: LV, MPDV, PU. We are still on track for production next year.
* Working closely with State Governors to obtain the greatest benefits/incentives.
   * These discussions could save tens or even hundreds of millions down the road. While I would’ve liked to get confirmation on Monday, we cannot rush this crucial process.
* Acknowledged Investor Relation's lack of communication.

Tony also stated some milestones to look out for:

* Gamma vehicle progress.
* Reporting reservations vs pre-orders.
* Lock in geographics and contract manufacturing partners.
* State level partnerships.

As of Tuesday’s close, Canoo had a $2b market cap. Canoo has $700m in cash, and IP worth anywhere from $250m to $1b+. In comparison, Fisker has a $5b market cap and virtually no IP, no engineering and no proprietary technology. Lucid, which has a \~$40b market cap, is worth 20x Canoo, yet, they are only months apart from manufacturing. Canoo at a $2b market cap (<$10 share price) is an absolute steal in comparison to other players in the field.

**My bull case from last year still applies. The $18/$25/$30 price targets for management's earn out shares applies. I still have a $30 price target, which I'm confident we'll hit this year.**

**Positions: 130,001 warrants.** These warrants should be worth $18+ once $GOEV hits $30.

[$GOEV - 130,001 warrants](https://preview.redd.it/gb6dtnwwkeq61.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e87d38cc703d91c43b8d227e121187d7e3f0c12b)

**TLDR: Canoo's deal with Hyundai was terrible. Canoo can now focus on projects that will set them up for long term success (e.g. designing top hats, factories and etc). Production and model timeline is still on track.**

&#x200B;

EDIT: For those who are curious, I've added to my position since this post. I've added another 9000 warrants.

I bought puts and I’m considering going short for the first time ever. FREE WILLY.

QUICK SUMMARY ON WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY: If you're thinking you've seen this before, it's because my post got deleted yesterday because a couple things I said were not approved by the mods. Mods said I could repost it now, so I decided to go a little more in-depth into everything SEAS related. I even put some quick headers for those of you wanting to skim through. I’ll be answering lots of questions in the comments. Also, thanks to u/Neighbor_ for the inspiration on this play.

SEAWORLD HISTORY:
SeaWorld is a well known aquatic theme park company. Everyone knows these dirtbags as the guys who abuse whales, if you are somehow too young or you live under a rock go watch the movie Blackfish. It was a documentary exposing the life of one of the captive whales and it's pretty fucking disturbing. After a while their fins don't even stand straight up anymore from stress/mistreatment. PETA (ok fuck PETA though) has been on these guys asses for years and rightfully so. They’ve improved somewhat over the years but their reputation has been permanently damaged.

WHAT HAPPENED IN 2020:
The documentary and story caused a slight dip in the stock AND specifically in attendance, but both eventually recovered, and SEAS was hitting ATHs of $35 a share in the beginning of 2020. Suddenly COVID appears out of nowhere and many start to fear companies like SEAS would take major losses and have to add on even more debt. A now-retired and legendary WSB member known as u/fuzzyblankeet notices and creates an epic analysis of SeaWorld’s debt far too complicated for the average ape on this sub today. Check his profile if you want to read it or reread it.  He wound up getting rich off SEAS death puts that he bought before it tanked due to COVID. He’s probably somewhere far away on an island now loading up on more $SEAS puts tbh. 

WHAT HAPPENED IN 2021:
SEAS struggled to crack $30 for the rest of 2020, but in 2021, it went from a low of $30 on February 1st to current all-time highs of $50. In my last post, I kind of breezed over how the stock even got to 50 in the first place. It seems in February there was a rotation by (mostly) institutions from growth stocks (think AAPL, TSLA for now) into more value heavy stocks (think VIAC, BA, air/cruise lines). I believe these institutions were betting big on recovery plays such as SEAS, and in the process these stocks have become significantly overbought, smashing pre-covid levels easily. This is backed by an unusually high % of the stock owned by institutions. 

Keep in mind this company is still losing a shit ton from being mostly closed, about 25 million per quarter. SEAS also had to add another 225 million in debt to keep from going under, bringing debt to 2.2 billion. How SEAS is sitting at 40% above precovid levels while adding lots of debt and burning money out the ass is beyond me. I don’t really think they are going under but it’s certainly a possibility in the next few years. 

WHY I MIGHT GO SHORT:
This brings me to my next point of why shorting could be a better option than puts. My prediction is that institutions will inevitably rotate out of a shitty stock like SEAS and back into growth when they realize how overbought some of these recovery/value names are. Predicting when this will happen could be a challenge. We saw it a little bit in what happened with VIAC/DISCA but I don’t think it will be to such a major degree this time or happen as quickly. I think SEAS could climb up to 52 a share this week and that would be a good spot to go short for me. 

My final point is to take a look at a stock that is eerily similar, Six Flags. Both companies are theme parks that were doing about 1.4 billion in revenue in the years before the pandemic, and six flags was experiencing better growth than SEAS. Cash flow numbers and amount of money burned from pandemic were similar as well, but Six Flags is sitting at 47$ compared to ATHs of 70 a share. 

THE LONGER TLDR:
You probably just ignored that entire post but I’ll sum it up again for those who can’t read. SeaWorld is a notoriously immoral company that abuses whales and is sitting 40% above pre-covid levels despite being mostly closed the entire time. They’ve done nothing but add on debt and hurt growth prospects, and who knows if they can even return to precovid levels in terms of revenue and attendance. As for now, they are not projecting 1.4 billion in revenue until 2022. Regardless, I feel morally obligated to go short and FREE THE WHALE🐳🐳 I will be answering as many questions as possible in the comments.

Not financial advice just what I’m thinking."

mfuvgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfuvgh/canadian_lps_will_be_allowed_in_the_us_markets/,Canadian LPs WILL be allowed in the US markets *WHEN* MSOs are allowed to uplist. $APHA/TLRY 🚀🚀🚀,84,48,2021-03-30 01:36:34,"I **truly** don't understand how this concept is so difficult for most investors (""MSO gAnG"" in particular) to understand, but I'll make this nice and easy for you. 

Although the SAFE banking bill does **not** have specific language to allow MSOs to uplist, it *is* expected to happen. No one really expects to see ""pot stonks uplist allowed"" in the bill, it's more of an expectation with being allowed access to financial institutions. Cannabis investors on both sides would be appalled (investing in $ROPE) if uplisting wasn't allowed, so let's just assume it will be from here on out. 

 Currently the only thing stopping canadian LP's such as TilAphria or Canopy from purchasing MSOs is the threat of being delisted. That's *literally* it. If uplisting is allowed for MSOs, then LPs can own them and not be delisted. Simple concept, simple path into the US. 

There **is** a magical wall stopping LP's from sending their weed across the border, but **there is no magical wall stopping their money from purchasing portions or entire publicly listed companies.** 

Also, it would make next to no sense for LPs to purchase any of the ""big"" MSOs. Those companies have had to pay millions and millions to expand State by State and vertically integrate. It will make much more sense for LPs to purchase companies based on location and build them out to meet demand for the surrounding states, in the near future. Most likely southern States, since they can just wait on the northern border to open to their existing facilities. I say *mostly* because I expect some NY news from TilAphria shortly after uplisting for MSOs is a reality. Considering they set the TilAphria merger for 4/20, I'd imagine them announcing a merger that closes the day after the SAFE bill passes. They're cheeky like that, I like it.  

For example, Aphria owns Sweetwater. Sweetwater just so happens to own a 50m+ [distribution center in Indiana](https://www.wane.com/top-stories/sweetwater-unveils-new-52-5m-warehouse/) . I imagine one of their first purchases will be a MSO with large operations in Illinois to capture the current market there while waiting on Indiana to pull the red outta their ass. It wouldn't really benefit them much to pay a massive premium for someone like Trulieve who is a glorified SSO (Single State Operator) and doesn't really bring anything to the table for them. Trulieve just sells weed in a massive market. TilAphria can grow their own weed, they just want the market. Lol

Most MSOs are just being propped up by the **markets** they are in. Markets like Florida are massive, yet controlled by a handful of companies due to their laws. Same with PA, just a smaller market. Markets like California are bigger than entire countries. Regardless, the one thing that's definitely going to get bigger is the market size in US states as more people use and accept legal marijuana, and the one thing that's definitely going to get smaller is market share for companies who currently don't really have any competition yet. 

The hilarious part of this is: ""Trulievers"" still somehow see a path to continuing to be ""the most profitable"" company once they lose their monopoly on the 3rd most populous state in the US. Considering NY's clear signal **against** oligarchy type markets, I'd be very concerned as a Trulieve investor. Also, save the ""New York is just one State"" bullshit. Schumer is in the driver's seat for Marijuana reform and there's no reason to expect him to introduce a bill that doesn't resemble his States bill, and there's **no reason** to expect one that contradicts his State's bill. 

Also, while I'm shitting on Trulieve, I just want to mention that the **only** thing that could save them will be a national market. If they get State level legalization years before a national market, then they're **fucked.** They currently operate over 1 **million** square feet worth of grow space in Florida. That's easy to sell when you have 50% market share due to being 1 of 5 companies who control over 80% of the marijuana businesses in Florida. That's going to be a lot harder to do once there's **hundreds** of new growers and **hundreds/thousands** of new stores. Sure, booming demand from the switch from medical to legal should help, but it won't be long until they are a US version of an LP the last couple years. Just sitting on a big ol mountain of weed waiting on a bigger market to open. If they can keep up with quality in a highly competitive legal market, that is.  As I've said before, the numbers don't lie. Florida's medical marijuana market currently has a dispensary to 100k people ratio of 1.1, while legal marijuana states like Oregon have well over 10 to 100k ratio. 10x the current ratio, 10x the amount of competition on price, 10x the amount of competition on quality..etc. Trulieve will have a lot to prove in a legal market, and legalization isn't always amazing for everything weed related. 

Weedmaps for example: they're just a complicated google search. For online menus and traceability software, that's gonna be Dutchie. For strain info, that's Leafly. Weedmaps doesn't really bring anything to the table after Apple/Google stop blocking pot stores on their maps. 🤷

I see some parallels between the smartphone revolution and the current ongoing connected vehicles revolution. There are mainly two approaches where software platforms can succeed. Either you go full vertical integration like Apple iOS/Tesla with an end-to-end consumer hardware+software product, or you go full horizontal integration as an outsider by unifying multiple hardware OEMs under the same software platform and rely on an alternative business model like Google Android+Google Mobile Services (and hopefully Blackberry QNX + IVY). 

Those that decide to go alone in an attempt to build a vertically integrated consumer product but could not quite reach the level of ""polished premium-ness"" to compete with the likes of Apple/Tesla will eventually die-off or join the horizontal integration group (see Nokia and Blackberry phones). 

The first-mover to start horizontal integration is likely to succeed if all its plans are well executed. The follower will have a much harder time competing with the first-mover even though it might have an equally-capable or even better platform (see Windows Phone).

IVY is currently a first-of-its-kind platform, so it has a major headstart. As soon as IVY's adoption reaches a critical mass, the network effect will take off and IVY will become the industry-standard vehicle data platform."

Bull Case : Henrik Fisker is a great car designer that had a run of bad luck, and the partnership with Magna Steyr will give him the manufacturing experience needed to complete a car.

Bull Price Target: $14.64 Based on Toyota’s market cap per car produced and Fisker’s 200,000 car production target

Bull Odds: 15%

Neutral Case: Henrik Fisker is a great car designer, but doesn’t understand engineering, manufacturing, or production of a car. His ego will push him to micromanage the design/build of the car (again) and there will be production delays, manufacturing problems, and cost overruns.

Neutral Price Target: $3.66 Based on cash on hand ($1B) assuming they can maintain current cash balance by selling cars at break even.

Neutral Odds: 55%

Bear Case: Henrik Fisker is a great car designer, but is also a narcissist and unable to take direction from people with more experience. The deal with Magna Steyr will fall apart, and they will run out of operating capital without ever delivering a full production run.

Bear Price Target: $0

Bear Odds 30%

**Combined Updated Price Target: $4.21**

I know, I know, you’re sitting there chewing your evening crayons saying, “That’s pretty harsh there fib, seems like you just have it out for the guy. A car company is more than just one person. You can’t just bash the guy and call it DD.” Well, you may be right, but when there’s no car, no financials (Q4 2020 and FY 2020 results went out as a press release, but 10Q and 10K missing from SEC database), I need to rely on trust in the people running the show. Let me go through how I got to these conclusions and you can see if you agree. I’ll try to avoid too much pop psychology, but man this guy…it’ll be hard. 

&#x200B;

Buckle up, this is gonna be looooong.

&#x200B;

**Quick Background: The Early Years**

Fisker has a Degree in transportation design from the Art Center College of Design in Switzerland. Rock start vehicle designer with BMW and Aston Martin where he designed the Z8, X5, DB9, and V8 Vantage. \[1\]

Design experience, but doesn’t show any connection to vehicle dynamics, engineering, or manufacturing.

Does some work with/for Tesla back in 2007. Gets sued for allegedly only taking the job to steal confidential information to be able to start his own company – Fisker Automotive. Fisker wins in arbitration, with a finding that he did nothing wrong. \[1\] I mention this not to throw shade (he won the arbitration after all), just to introduce his connection to Elon Musk and Tesla. This connection seems an unavoidable thread through his work at Fisker Automotive which would have directly competed with Tesla.

**Chapter 1: Fisker Automotive (the first one)**

Henrik Fisker created his first car company. Named it after himself (not a glaring red flag since it’s his first company, but remember this for later). Created a car – the Fisker Karma – that was beautiful, but an engineering disaster. 

The most publicized issue was batteries that would catch on fire. But this wasn’t the only problem. “Pressure on engineers to stay faithful to Henrik Fisker’s original design, even when flaws emerged that undercut the Karma’s performance and potential fixes would add millions in cost.” \[2\]. These flaws included an exhaust system for the hybrid ICE that pointed forwards. The Exhaust. Pointed. Forward. And Fisker wouldn’t let anyone change it.

“On more than one occasion, Fisker asked suppliers to hand-build certain components for the Karma, which increased the cost as much as threefold” \[2\]

“The company churned through three battery suppliers in three years. As PrivCo notes in this amazing timeline, Fisker established a pattern of awarding supply contracts ‘not necessarily to the best supplier, or the supplier who offers the best price…but rather to companies that were owners and investors in Fisker.’” \[3\]

“As the years rolled by, Fisker observers became increasingly suspicious that the company didn’t even possess a working car. At the 2008 debut, Fisker announced that the Karma would go on sale in late 2009. Yet by early 2010, when Bill Gifford profiled the company for Popular Science, no one but the chauffeur for the Crown Prince of Denmark had driven even an early prototype.” \[3\]

“’Beneath the world-class skin was a rudimentary machine that needed several years of engineering refinement and testing before it could be ready to be released,’ said Maurice Gunderson, a managing partner at Runway Capital Partners who had an opportunity to invest in Fisker in early 2010 and passed.” \[2\]

“From 2008 to 2012, the carmaker lost an estimated $1 billion.” \[2\] (currently FSR claims $991m cash on hand and a planned production start at the end of 2023). 

This was heavily scrutinized after the fact since they had taken a $529M loan from the US Department of Energy and faced a congressional hearing in 2013. He left the company, and it soon after closed up shop and was liquidated and bought by a Chinese company. The same company that made the batteries for the Karma, that were catching fire. That’s got to hurt.

So, man that’s a rough start. Maybe he learned a bunch of lessons (best lessons are learned by making mistakes you know). Maybe he came back stronger, smarter, and better. Let’s see…

**Interlude: VLF Force 1 (2016)**

His next related venture after getting out of Fisker Automotive was a collaboration with some buddies to make a bespoke supercar called the VLF Force 1. His buddies had a company, VL Automotive, and they were like, wouldn’t it be cool if you \[Fisker\] could design a car for us. Fisker was like cool, since were friends and all. You might notice the difference between the name of the company and the name of the car. VL…VLF…VL…VLF. Yes, he made them change the name to add the “F” for Fisker before he agreed to help (two is a pattern). \[4\]

As promotion for this, he gave an interview where he answered a couple questions about the downfall of Fisker Automotive. \[4\]

Q: So what really happened at the end of Fisker Automotive?

A: I had major disagreements with the management on strategy, and I resigned in March 2013. Shortly after, the company eventually filed for voluntary bankruptcy in November 2013.

Q: You were the Chairman not the CEO then. How was the decision made to wind up the company?

A: After I left, Fisker Automotive went on for a few months. They filed for voluntary bankruptcy and restructuring in November 2013. In February 2014, a judge carried out a public and structured auction of the assets of Fisker Automotive, the winners being a large parts supplier in China called Wanxiang.

It’s a short back and forth, but there’s a lot in there to unpack. I just don’t have the time or the psychology degree to piece through it. Suffice to say, it really doesn’t sound to me like a man who learned any lessons or is taking any responsibility for the failure. 

Also relating to the VLF Force 1 is the first mention of him taking control of design and production of the battery systems. 

“We have formed a joint venture with Nanotech to create Fisker Nanotech that is developing a ground-breaking battery where we are testing the use of Graphene along with Lithium ion. It is showing some amazing possibilities. It will have, for sure, the world’s longest range. We have a good chance of passing 400 miles \[on a single charge\]. Plus we can charge it much faster and it has a longer life.” \[4\]. 

Wait, 400 mile range! In 2016! This should have been groundbreaking. But alas, it was vaporware. 

He also shows his deep lack of understanding of car manufacturing and design in the same interview. After owning a car company for four years.

“We also ended up changing the rear end, to accommodate the exhaust pipes. And, of course, we had to put the driveshaft down through the centre. In the beginning I think everybody thought that’s pretty easy. But it ended up taking several years and millions of dollars.” \[4\]

He also mentions a second car, the VLF Destino, that would be a high volume, low cost car. However this is the first of what I’ll refer to his “vaporcars”. 

**Chapter 3: Return of the Fisker (Inc.)** 

Fisker eventually got the rights to his name back and started a third company named after himself, Fisker Inc. We’re going to go through a lot here, but pay attention to dates. 

In 2017 Fisker unveils the Fisker Emotion (this will become vaporcar 2). Claimed modest specs like a 400 mile range \[5\], Level 4 autonomous drive \[6\], and a solid state battery \[6\]. Said that production would start in 2020 \[6\]. Again, any single one of these specs coming out in a car released TODAY would be game changing. But he claimed to have them ready to go in 2017. 

So lets talk about that battery. A solid state battery is the holy grail right now for car manufacturers. Read up on $QS if you want more details, but basically no one has made it work in an EV. Fisker claimed the following in an interview in 2017:

“It’s mainly been dismissed for automotive because it’s very expensive to make, it doesn’t have the power, and it doesn’t work below zero,” said Fisker. “We have cracked all three of these areas.” \[5\]

In a vehicle like the EMotion, it could easily permit a 700-mile range, he said. \[5\]

“This isn’t just a lab test; we’ve actually built the batteries,” \[5\]

They had hired a man named Fabio Albano from a company called Sakti3 who made a lot of bold claims about solid state batteries, but according to the following:

“To date \[1/18/2018\], none of the companies involved—Dyson, Fisker, or the former Sakti3, which is now a subsidiary of Dyson—have demonstrated a working, full-size automotive solid-state battery prototype and the most Fisker has shown the public is a block of material from a supposed solid-state battery.” \[7\]

From the same article: “But it's Fisker's insistence its solid-state battery technology works, the secrecy around it, and how much the company is reliant on it coming to fruition that calls into question the entire company, not just the car.” \[7\]

Back to the cars. The Fisker Orbit (vaporcar 3) was announced in 2018 as another very pretty drawing. “For now, the Orbit is being kept under wraps, but Fisker is hoping to bring the actual vehicles out into the world for a pilot at the end of 2019. “We are looking to start driving that around and testing it on a campus in the second half of next year.” He shared that the pilot would not be, as I expected, in China, but instead would be deployed at a campus in the United States.” \[8\]

By 2019, Fisker had apparently moved vaporcar 2 and vaporcar 3 to the back burner and was pushing his SUV for the masses (eventually to become the Ocean). He announced they would have a driveable prototype of the SUV by the end of the year (2019) \[10\], and were tooling up their own factory for production \[9\]. 

2020 was a big year where they went public, and secured a manufacturing deal with Magna. With Magna able to engineer and manufacture an entire vehicle, maybe things are looking up?

**Chapter 4: Foxconn**

File this under, OH GOD WHY?!?! You have a manufacturer. That does reputable work for reputable car companies. Why would you announce partnering with a second manufacturer, who specializes in cell phones, who has a reputation for valuing PR over production, and has never mass produced anything larger than a tablet!? Foxconn is the apparent manufacturer of the yet to be unveiled “Pear” concept. The Pear also exists only as a drawing on a napkin (vapor-ish car 4). Will Magnus allow you to take their design and components to a competitor for manufacturing, or do you plan to start all over from the ground up? Does Foxconn even know how to build a car? Do they have sourcing relationships for the car parts? Do they have anything to offer other than whispers of “Apple” in the press? This truly baffles me. 

**Chapter 5: I’m Exhausted**

I’m so tired of writing this, I’d be amazed if anyone reads it all the way through. I just want to briefly mention the current leadership of the company. Fisker Inc. has Henrik’s wife as CFO. This is a huge red flag for me when there’s an external relationship between the CEO and the CFO. Many shenanigans can ensue. The board also is full of lawyers and bankers (again), not people with auto industry experience. The one leadership position that has auto industry experience is the Chief Technology Officer (who is not a board member). 

**Chapter 6: Industry Saturation**

I think if he is able to strengthen ties with Magnus, and they can rope him into building a practical car, they may get the Ocean out to consumers. However, it will be too late. As I mentioned in my first write up, the EV market is already nearing saturation (see Tesla’s declining sales numbers), and the big boys (GM, Ford, BMW, Mercedes) are still yet to fully enter the game. And the Ocean is also (optimistically) 3 years away. People will not wait that long. They will cancel their $250 reservations and buy a car that’s at the lot down the road.

&#x200B;

Ok, so is Henrik going to be successful? I doubt it. He seems to have learned nothing from his past experiences and has a track record of inflated promises, poor decision making, unrealistic timelines, and not being able to deliver. The sum of all these parts to me shows a portrait of a company that will not be anything but another extension of his ego. They seem to not even be designing the car (Magnus is), and I can’t decide what value they add other than the name on the front. 

&#x200B;

As always, these are my personal thoughts for entertainment purposes only and are not intended as trading advice. Do your own DD you bunch of crazy monkeys.

The Gilford family spent 35 year building them into the largest mortgage orginator in the world.  They survived every downturn even the '07 Mortgagepocolypse, each time growing and taking share.

They didn't need no cash, they came public to establish themselves in the public market and begin planning for the some day when death taxes require the family to settle up with the irs.

The Gilfords built a $50 Billion company from scratch, its a story right up there with Buffet and Bezos but this family gets no respect.   They should.  

The biz:

Banks make loans, sometimes they make the mortgage thing to apes who have ""civilized"" and live in house things.  I sleep in the woods and swing from trees, but many of my so called 'evolved' cousins like this house living bullshit.  Well banks only have a handful of people in house who loan house mortages (i know weird).  They rely on these fly by night boiler rooms who send emails and call you unexpectedly, you think its about your car warranty or solar but this is that other sales call about Refi-Cash-Out into a Fixed Fully Ammortizing 30 year or buying a rental with a 5/1 ARM Fixed-Floating with rolled in closing costs.  

Its really a bunch of bullshit, mortgages, roofs, solar panels.  I like bananas, but I like this stonk called RKT.  

Morgages are hard, they want paperworks, bank statements, adp payroll slips.  The business comes in waves.  When rates are cheap and banks full of new dollar tokens given to them by  JPOW, there is a long line of house living apes trying to mortage their paychecks from 30 years on so they can install a pool or move to a neighborhood with a country club.  So the banks call on these boiler rooms to make all the paper mortgage calls happen.

These 'orginiators' are typically like circus pop up tent companies.  They hire a bunch of unemployed used car saleman and maniacs froms the sober house to call the leads and take the applications.  They hire Amanda and Britney who couldn't succeed as beauticians to do the document reviews and processing.  Simply put its the cast of heros you used to see on episodes of COPS where the call was a 'domestic.'  

But the Gilfords had a vision: build software that runs on devices that make it so easy to apply, qualify and process a mortgage that even Rodney with 5 days outa rehab and Britney 'I told your ass to send me that already' couldn't screw it up and the customer gets their house money fast and easy right from the app on their handheld glowing glass screen.

Hedge funds don't understand how good this software is.  No one else bothered to build it because bankers are not creative, they live by screwing others.  And the other circus freaks pushing mortgages are in it for next week commish check so they can coke and hookers.  

Stonk is at $26

The Hedges shorted 40 mil shares on a 115 mil float.  And index fund already bought 11 mil shares (invesco).   The original fund managers who bought the ipo sold it out during the last blast up to $43.  They sold, bc they saw morgage rates go up a 1/2 point and figured the circus is over and all these pop up freak show mortgage boiler rooms are going under.  They didn't bother to look at rkt.  They have a 90% repeat business rate: meaning 9/10 customers who do a mortgage with rocket, will use rocket if they do another.  typicall number in bankin is 1 or 2 out of 10.  RKT app is number 1 in the catagory, and as Mamma Cathy Wood teached me smooth ape brain: innovation is a winner take all game.  

RKT builds back better each downturn, and every mortgage boom brings in startup circus creeps that don't know how to code, analyst customer data (data science) and deliver good service.  Why should they? they believe its a churn and burn business.  They are running flee market stores, RKT is runnnin and Amazon of mortgages and now getting into car and personal loans

They don't take credit risk, they lend for banks and investor pools.  they ""service"" the loan which means they bill and collect.  so when rates fluctuate they have to adjust the holding value of the collection rights up or down any quarter.  Hedgefunds predict that higher rates mean they take a write down.  But thats just paper bullshit.  the collection rights always are profitable, they just have to 'discount' them when banks same interest is worth more.  Hedgefunds look for quick profits, not revolutionary businesses that make lives better.

They missed tsla, apple, amzn and countless others the same way.  RKT is no diff.

The company minted coin in 2020, about $4.50/share in profit.  Thats a PE of like 6.  Now no one thinks they will make that in '21.  2020 was the best mortgage year ever, people sat at home, watched netflix and bought and refinanced houses.  They also learned to use their phones and their computers for the first time ever.  They can now work and do businness on them, before they didn't, but covid make them overcome their fear and forced all the boomers to use their phone to get a mortgage.   the secular story of waiting for the apes who know how to use an app to move out of mom's basement to buy a house is over.  The boomers learned to use apps and now, all businesses will suceed or fail based on the quality of the app experience.  Did i mention RKTs apps are all number 1 or near in their catagories and great reveiws.  

Being number 1 and having great reviews in the app store makes it game over.  Its winner take all.  RKT will clean up in the down turn.  they will earn less with less business and higher rates but the long term earnings power of this company is $2-3/share and growing every downturn.

   * These are estimates, but [7k average account size](https://www.brokerage-review.com/investing-firm/assets-under-management/firstrade-aum.aspx) for a total of $70B AUM

97.9m\~ users WITHOUT including Robinhood. Just shy of $18 TRILLION rough numbers. Then remember, *there's international markets*. [This article](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/29/investing/china-gamestop-investors-intl-hnk/index.html) doesn't have sources, but it points out how global GME went. There's many more articles like it, for plenty of countries. Europe, India, Asia are several places I saw people trying to get in on the action. ""China’s approximately 200 million retail investors trade more often than any other investors on Earth—81 percent said they trade at least once a month"" [From this article](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/09/three-charts-explaining-chinas-strange-stock-market.html)

*Let me remind you that a stock like GME as of today has estimated between 27m-40m shares in the float, and a market cap of 18.4B at today's price.* **Retail has no control my ass**. Lets take a look at this:

A graph of apple users versus apple price from robinhood's API in 2020, going up to 8/6/2020. They stopped offering this information via API at this date.  We can ignore apple price here, we're looking just at ownership.

&#x200B;

[Source: Robintrack.net](https://preview.redd.it/1xji566rn1n61.png?width=1633&format=png&auto=webp&s=202fbbb95234ba5a1a6ae13453c992879805b25e)

The above shows on 8/6, 730k RH users owned Apple. That's 5.6% of users at the time using their 13m users number, which the total user number I would speculate is a bit lower at that time, as they grew from 10 to 13m users in 2020. RH stopped their API showing this info, so 8/6 is the most recent you can get on any company.

&#x200B;

GME was the most popular stock on RH, so I find it reasonable to believe at least 5% owned it, most likely WAY WAY more considering the global exposure this got. Once again, RH average account size is $5k. Please do the math here of how Jan may have looked. **This is ONLY on Robinhood**. Of course this is speculation here, but I feel that it's pretty reasonable. It's speculation based on prior data. & if users really are 23m, that's even crazier. Here's math below about what GME could have looked like. This is based on 13m users. Then, **add all of the other brokers**. This chart is only robinhood. You get the idea. Realistically, *other* brokers ownership percentage probably isn't *as* high, but it's still going to be way up there, especially during the GME phenomenon.

&#x200B;

|If average # of shares per person is|% of RH users that owned the most popular stock|Total shares owned on RH|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|5|730k shares|
|1|10|1.46m shares|
|5|5|3.65m shares|
|5|10|7.3m shares|
|10|5|7.3m shares|
|10|10|14.6m shares|

&#x200B;

Anyways, moving back to the more broad discussion and no longer focusing on GME.

""The **total market capitalization** of the **U.S. stock market** is $50,808,508.7 million(over complicated way of saying $50.8T (12/31/2020)""

&#x200B;

It appears our estimates line up pretty closely with other data. *Notice how mutual funds are SEPERATE here.*

So why does retail ""not control the market"" ?

Personally, I disagree with this statement. Retail does control the market. **Then why is there a narrative that retail doesn't control the market?** Two main reasons in my opinion. Yes, this is speculation based on data. Form your own conclusions. Here's insight into mine.

1. Retail isn't coordinated. Even though we collectively own over 1/3 of the market, we can't coordinate things like the elite can. We can't dump 1 million shares all at the exact same time to tank a stock price. We can't control the media narrative because we don't own/aren't in bed with the media, so we lose some influence here. Retail doesn't control the day to day action on a stock, but retail controls it from a broader sense. *One raindrop cannot cause a flood, but continuous raindrops over an extended period of time do*.
2. Information **IS** becoming a commodity, there's just so much shit and misinformation to sift through right now, it's difficult for most people. Retail gains more and more control every day through decentralization and increased freedom of information on the internet. *They ARE terrified of retail*. The potential for ""power"" to shift back to the people out of the elites hands is higher than ever with the advancements of tech. I could write a whole paper on this concept. I believe decentralization is the future for everything. Information, politics, money, stocks, etc. It is imperative for the elite to keep this knowledge away from the people. Knowledge is power. Poverty and education are linked significantly. Keeping people in the dark and unaware of their capabilities is an extremely powerful tool that has been used to suppress people since civilization began.

I know above points might sound a little bit over the top, but these are my opinions based on data. I'd be happy to engage in talks around any of these points. There may be data that is just plain wrong, or that I misinterpreted. Please poke holes in anything.

Edit: /u/alice_oe made this data point “I use the European broker eToro, they have 20 million users and their app currently shows that 9.49% of them holds GME. In January this number was around 15%.” 
Heavily supports my points made, felt like it’s important."

Looks like VXX was the right idea and I mis-timed the entry and therefore my strike. This was a good but hard lesson for me, but I’m excited because as you probably know by now my whole thing is learning and improvement. 

**Update 3/18 morning:**

*Whales to Watch: Revenge* edition coming tomorrow. If you think I’m taking this tier 1 whooping lying down you got another thing coming 😤 

**Update 3/18 Opening Bell**

Well, on the bright side, CS and DB are having pretty nice weeks 😬 😬 

**UPDATE 3/17 After Hoursish**

Before the close, there’s a lot of events tomorrow at spotrambo if you need a YOLO to wash the taste of VXX out your mouth like I do. 

**UPDATE 3/17 mid day **

🚨 JEROME’S COMMITMENT TO RATES AND CHILLNESS WITH INFLATION IS SENDING THE VIX TO GOD DAMN SINGLE DIGITS 🚨 

and guess what. I’m not selling. 

**UPDATES PreMarket 3/17:**

VIX? 🙏 🥺

Added a really interesting (to me) play for tomorrow at spotrambo.com. **SLDB** had two  unusual options orders on my non UW scanners yesterday for the 7.50 strike. [They also have a nice little conference pump coming tomorrow](https://i.imgur.com/qw8rxXu.jpg) 🤷🏿‍♂️ 

**UPDATE 3/16 close-ish (gotta run)**

Are ya winning son? Hoping for some fireworks tomorrow, but kudos to MA putting up a fight on a weird day. 

Yes I’m still holding VXX. Yes my heart still aches. 

PS Starbucks annual shareholder meeting up on spotrambo.com. Could be a play after today’s PT upgrades 

**Update 3/16 Open**

VXX absolutely ragdolling your boy, as is tradition. I’ll never sell because every time I do it goes 20% the next trading day.  

Thank God I found a tier 1 for next week I’m in love with. Also some tasty new events over at spotrambo.com to help you get out of today’s GUH like CRSR ALLO etc

**update AH 3/15**

Mixed movement overall with a couple tier 2 killing it BUT GOOD GOD VXX FADE ME FAM!

Bagholding with my held high for now. Somebody in the comments mentioned purchasing VXX Wednesday due to a nasty contango on the futures. I should’ve listened. 

**Another 3/15 morning Update**

Ahhh yea, VXX 😎 ☠️ 

****

**Update 3/15 morning**: There was some I really liked but forgot to mention here like AMD, they’re listed over at spotrambo.com 

Grabbed some VXX at 13.82 some NOK at about 4.30 and MA at 381.96. 4/1’s, 14 4.50 390. Grabbed more VXX than anything cuz I’m nervous. 

****

Guys, your boy AllDatDalton has a problem.  

Sure, it's a little fun when it pops, but after buying VXX and holding overnight, it always gives me the hangover of loss.  It always ends the same: my account is in disarray, I feel a sense of hopelessness, and everything in my life I'd worked toward to that point is eviscerated by terms like ""Stimulus Checks set to arrive...""

But *this* time...this time it really could be different.  **The FOMC is coming up this week starting March 16th**.  [For the unitiated, this is an event where not much is often decided but much is bet on; the FED gives their guidance in matters including—but not limited to--Quantitive Easing, Interest Rate speculation, and Bond Yield Curve control.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/think.ing.com/amp/article/us-what-to-watch-at-the-march-fed-meeting/)  Market volatility precedes it, as the oracles all scramble to determine what poppa Pow might or might not say or do—if the man farted into the microphone and walked away, VXX would probably climb 15%...the tension is *palpable*.

**This one couldn’t come at a more precarious time, as good news is now bad news**.  As reopening moves full steam ahead and we get a massive injection of economic stimulus, people are beginning to stop taking JPow at his word.  He promises a steady hand, he promises no interest rate increases, he says bond yield curve control is always on the table....and yet deep pockets flee en masse from stonks and into treasuries as the good times roll. 

**You see, the problem with the FED right now is no matter what they say, investors see the inevitable trend**.  They're betting there is only so long the FED can continue to artificially support the market--and only so long there will be reason to-- as indexes roar, the actual economy improves, and vaccine distribution is, for the most part, on track to return us to a world of pseudo-normalcy by summer.  It doesn't help that the FED stays verbally doveish while quietly doing things like declining to speak on Yield Curves definitively during speaking engagements, and [quietly ended the term repo m lending program](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/fed-ending-term-repos-reflects-liquidity-feast-for-dealers). 

**My choice here is between treasury-tickers and the VXX**-- last time I was making this choice I went with VXX on the DD, and that choice didn't pan out until the second week.  I said then, reflecting on that week’s losers, that I should have chosen treasuries...**so why didn’t I this time with the opportunity right here?**  *VXX is just absurdly low right now, trading under $14*.  I'm not saying the pop will happen Tuesday or Wednesday, but it may, and dollars to donuts if you hold a VXX 14 or 14.50c 4/1 you'll make some money at some point if you don't hold too long after it makes a run.  Also, if Jerome breathes a word about Yield Control they will plummett. 

**This intro is also my way of admitting my confidence level this week is low—there is too much potential for chop**.  Sure, I could be wrong and we go to the moon once stimmies start hitting people’s accounts, and that argument is fair as I see some of the new age commodities mooning to ATH over the wekend.  But, for the most part, I'd rather put on a jimmy hat this week and hope my safe picks don't come back burning me.

But anyway, **you didn’t come here for my half-baked philosophy on impending market volatility.  YOU CAME CUZ YOU HEARD WE GOT THEM BAGGERS**.  So, let's talk whales.

***

**Shoutout to unusual whales who makes this possible through letting me share their pick info! They’re great!**

**Last week’s lovers**: **DKNG** absolutely crushed it. **Tier 2**, on a sustained measurement over the week, actually defeated Tier 1.  **OCGN SQ EBAY** all had magnificent moments in the sun aided by that crazy **4% NASDAQ Day**.

**Mid-week Pivot**: The **F** call mid-week was clutch on the 13c, and now it's sitting above that price to end the week.  Also, I know y'all were feeling the heat on that **T** mid-week pivot call, but Friday brought us the glory. I was sweating though 😅 

**Last week’s lesson**: **GE** and **DIS** were hotter than shit wrapped in tin foil coming out the gate on Monday, then they hit us with that nasty curve.  **News broke that GE was closing a huge deal on Sunday, which gave me continued optimism, and then they just demolished the call holders with that fucking reverse split**--if you say you saw that coming, you's a damn lie.  DIS got great news, but it was crossing a key 200 resistance number (is that TA?  I don't know man, I think so), and couldn't hold.  I **think the key here is it’s okay to take a pause on the pick if it’s hot fresh out the gate the week of the RAMBO.  There will be more picks.  The other lesson here is that when the event is big enough, it plays like an earnings rather than a pump**.  DKNG, for example, had pump written all over it.  It was more about future potential than earnings in the description. Conversely, the GE annual event had an ER feel, particularly in articles I read Tuesday.  **Meme stock pump event=good.  Boomer stock boring investor event=be wary.  Stock crossing a big round resistance number leading into an event=watch how it behaves, and if it dips catch it post-event.**

**”Never lost, just ran out of time”**: Someone pointed out in a comment the M 3/26 20c i went with from two DD's ago is puh-rinting.  Should've held I guess.  Womp Womp.

**Tier 1**: Dice I'm Rolling with this Week (intriguing whale bets, with RAMBO (non-ER pumps), sectors or tickers I like) *disclaimer: this may be choppy as week enter positions on dips, long dates*

[MA](https://i.imgur.com/ufR3TrB.jpg) ([3/23 B of A electronic payments symposium](https://investor.mastercard.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx))

When I said playing it safe I guess I meant it lol.  MA is going from your grandfather's favorite holding to an interesting FinTech play that is showing malleability in a fast-paced industry.
[They're doing cool stuff like this merger with Payoneer](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/fintech-payoneer-partners-with-mastercard-ahead-of-3-billion-spac-.html) and, for better or worse, they've joined the growing list of companies linking their perceived fate to the commodity that shall not be mentioned.  

I just generally like the stock, but I think this conference presentation will be a great catalyst as they have a chance to expose some of their new school thinking and get some nice quotes for FinTwit pumps.  Getting in early in case stimulus excitement waves can give a little push in banking and financial processors, but weary of entry because of FOMC.

[NOK](https://i.imgur.com/EL3aSk8.jpg) ([Nokia Capital Markets Day 3/18](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news-and-events/events-calendar/investor-relations-events/capital-markets-day/))

**Me two paragraphs ago**: I'm playing it safe this week.  **Also me**: Let's pick a failed meme that is a favorite of foreign bots.  

Someone in the comments on my last DD was pumping this, and I kinda didn't pay it to much attention at first.  But, they had some interesting things say about NOK, and convinced me that the foreign de-listing wasn't as big a deal as people were intimating. 

Sometimes you gotta plug your nose--*hate the stonk, love the RAMBO*.  **The general consensus around this event is that this is moment NOK needs to do SOMETHING to please investors**.  NOK is also sticking to the messaging that this a strategy reset of sorts.  The key pump factor here is *whether or not they will set a definitive dividend policy*--that's what I'm watching for.  If we get the dividend announcement, the sky is the limit.  If we don't, well, bail out quickly, because this sinking ship may head for Davey Jones' Locker (I'm so corny bruh 😭 ).

[Somebody did a solid DD write-up on NOK](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m33vsq/full_diligence_post_on_nokia_nok_ahead_of_capital/) pre-event at r/investing.  I'm sure the sub will be appalled that I'm mining their shit for options speculation lol.

[VXX](https://i.imgur.com/CdGUT8U.jpg) (FOMC March 16-18th discussing potential yield curve control, etc)

The intro pretty much states where I'm at on this. **I like the 14c 4/1**--my plan is to wait for an assumed green open Monday, and see if I can pick up a nice premium price just before the classic fade.  **I’m going to hold until it pops, through the FOMC RAMBO**, and if the markets don't go red i'll probably trim some for a loss but keep holding for a level of general volatility.  If we open red Monday, I'll let action settle and push out to the 14.50c probably.  I dunno, I'm just a dog chasing cars.

[CRSR](https://i.imgur.com/W0soBkU.jpg): No whale betting, but some other UOA and I am very intrigued by their event coming up on the 16th, **The Macquarie Consumer Bright Ideas Conference**.  Sounds pumpish, and they're trotting the CEO out.

[GPRO](https://i.imgur.com/tdX3a7c.jpg): Tons of consistent whale betting matching performance of an uptrend.  Been on a tear, so may need a little dip to get a good entry point, but I want to follow the money on this one.

[CS](https://i.imgur.com/5D7VBrd.jpg)/[DB](https://i.imgur.com/QnUyMK4.jpg): boring financials plays without UW bets, but still pumping nicely in other UOA registers.  CS has a conference presentation the morning of 3/16 and is releasing their annual report on 3/18. DB has a presentation on 3/18.

****

Remember, this week could be super flukey, so long dates, timing your entry, and the ability to HODL are key.  I'm genuinely not excited about this week, not gonna lie.

**TLDR**

This week could be choppy with FOMC, so I'm grabbing some **VXX**, playing a longer **MA** call for a spicy safe haven, and buying **NOK** leading into their capital markets day as a purely speculative play.

**AAPL** has a rumored product launch coming on the 23rd, **CRSR** has an interesting conference, and **GPRO** continues to recieve bullish whale bets.

Inbox always open.  Happy hunting everybody."
m4el34,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4el34/hey_i_got_a_real_juicy_for_you_sklz/,Hey 🌈🐻 I got a real juicy 🍌for you - SKLZ,25,38,2021-03-14 04:25:30,"I have reason to ***believe*** this company could lose like 90% of their revenue **OVERNIGHT.**

**Don't** look at my post history unless you need proof **I'm retarded**

I've dumbed down my ***beliefs*** to **2** core reasons

**Their Monetization Model is insane, you have a better chance winning at the casino than you do betting on SKLZ games.**

* On average, players have nearly a 7% statistical edge going to the casino and playing black or red on roulette like a smooth brained dummy fuck (This is literally my favorite way to play roulette so I know what I'm talking about)
* Let me break it down further, going off of the fact that they take 14% of all bets on average(You'll have a hard time finding this on their site - [https://www.skillz.com](https://www.skillz.com/) \- but this Bloomberg article mentions the 14% fee [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/skillz-soars-in-trading-debut-as-investors-bet-on-mobile-esports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/skillz-soars-in-trading-debut-as-investors-bet-on-mobile-esports).
* So let's say you want to make 10 bets on a SKLZ game. You bet $50 on each game, and so does your opponent. The matchmaking system knows to put you with players of similar skill so unsurprisingly, the 10 game streak ends in a 5-5 draw. Both players will have lost $70 in this situation. If the streak went 6-4 in your favor, you would have earn a measly $16 dollars. SKLZ appears to only want to increase this percentage. I refuse to believe this pricing model will have an appeal to mainstream audiences when they see how hard players are getting boned.

**Where does Apple's 30% take of In-App purchases fit in?**

* Of this 14% taken from each betting transaction, what is Apple getting from the cut? I am having trouble finding any evidence that apple is making money from these bets that are taking place on their platform. I have reason to believe that SKLZ may be bypassing Apple's 30% fee, as 14% is clearly less than 30%. SKLZ apps allow you to put money into an account without going through the app store. 
* **Fortnite got banned from the app store for doing exactly this.**
* If games using the SKLZ plugin get banned from the app store, this company will lose all revenue it earns from the App Store. What would this scenario mean for the stock being that it's currently valued around $10 billion dollars as a hyper growth company that doesn't seem to have apps on any other platform?
* In the event Apple is getting a cut, how much are they getting? What kind of special treatment is SKLZ getting from Apple? We need to hear from Apple about this companies monetization model. 
* How much longer is Apple going to allow $200 Million Dollars of revenue to go through at a fraction of what they are typically owed?"

I have been the guy who hits the refresh button all day, who GUH's the dips, of course I have in the past had to use credit because I had spent more of my paycheck  than I should have.  I have seen a lot of people who are getting  obsessive to the point its could be unhealthy. We are one of the most chilled out group of autists  I have ever met. Which is why I made this guide to remind you all of a few things. I based this guide off of posts I have seen and replies to posts I have made. Please note I am not speaking about 1 stock in general, this applies to everything market related. I just use GME because its an easy example. 

1. It's a good thing the market closes on the Weekend. This cannot be the only thing you focus on. As your parents or wife's boyfriend would tell you "" Go outside"". You need to get out and do other things not related to the stock market. Keep your hobbies, play with your kids, go see your parents. You have to get out and do things other than WSB,and watching tickers all day.
2. Eat you Autistic pieces of shit. 3 Meals a day I dont care if its all Wendys, you have to eat 3 meals a day. On a serious note either eat some fruit or take a good multi vitamin. For the sake of not spending all of Melvins money on doctors visits please drink some water too.  

3. DON'T SPEND MONEY YOU DON'T HAVE. If I see one more question about how margin works ,how to get approved for margin or if they should yolo all their money on Margin im going to have a stroke.  If you thought losing more than half your initial investment sucks, Imagine losing all you invested because you now owe your broker their portion. Then of course you might owe some interest on that pending on the broker.

&#x200B;

4. Dont let this get in the way of your day job. I cleared near half my yearly salary on GME round one. I did this all the while working and not neglecting my responsibilities. I dont care if you're a  bagger at the grocery store or the stim man Crazy Joe. Do your shit so you can pay your bills. If you really cannot help it take some PTO on a day that you think you will need to watch it constantly. Just dont get fired.

&#x200B;

5. Your family probably thinks its cool you're in on something big ( GME for example),but they probably get sick of hearing about it. This should not be the only dialog you have with others around you. Keep that shit here, lets circle jerk. Told the wife today Im back in GME for 3k more ( I have been trying to swing trade it for RD 2 just to do something different all the while catching the squeeze). All she said was "" again?"". Now in RD 1 she was asking about it probably as much as I was looking at it . This is not nearly as cool as many of us think it is. Most people dont get whats happening or do not care. This is ok.

6. Know when to get out. I know this is hard for people from my generation but in this game there are winners and losers. Dont be a fuckin loser you fucking loser. When this shit can change your life take some profit. Stay in diamond hand the shit out of it but take care of you. Someone during this squeeze will still buy at the top Guaranteed . He/she will HODL and be stuck at sub 10% loss for sure.  Get in before its too late or just say this is not for me this time. 

7. Now this is kinda misinformation because the market makes no sense right now but.... Once something reaches the news,social media ,or is being talked about. Its usually too late. BUY the rumor sell the news.Someone out there already knew this before the media did, they got in when it was low. Once its common knowledge these people or firms are already selling leaving you bag holding. 

8. Do your DD. No!! not the DD your wife's boyfriend is giving her while you cuck looking at AH tickers on your phone. Research the stock , and decide for yourself. Go to investopedia and educate yourself on the vocabulary. You should know some basics behind stock fundamentals. If Im pushing a stock on here , you do not know me. I could just be trying to give you my bags to hold. 

&#x200B;

9. Exercise please , you need to move about during your day. It will help you mentally and physically .

10.Dont hate on others who dont invest in your stock. We are a support group, a fundamental group and above all else we eat crayons together. I bought GME in January at 40$ per share, got told I was a retard for doing so by my friends. Never said shit to them when it mooned,even though they told me WMT is where the money is. Not everyone is in GME, and those who are genuinely believe the hype. As my wife's boyfriend says to be when I get to be a grumpy gills "" If you dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all.""

11. To make it simple if you dont know how to buy a Call option don't be buying call options. You need to do a lot more research into the fundamentals. You will lose your ass.

Ok what's up you fucks? It's u/afitdinosaur coming back at you with some old-school WSB style DD.

&#x200B;

Sit down, shut the fuck up, and close that r/gangbang tab of your wife and her boyfriends, because you're about to get slapped with some **real** deep dick value.

&#x200B;

A few months ago, I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jy3up1/dr_michael_burry_is_gonna_ilumnate_your_portfolio/) DD to WSB outlining how I thought LUMN was the bee's knees. I still think that. There has been some development in the stock since I posted that DD, and I think that y'all deserve an update. Because frankly, the pitiful DD I've seen on LUMN since, one of which references why ""Cables are like the future, man"", and another that had more emojis in it than a tweenage girl's apple chat, is well, unsettling. So you're fucking welcome.

**Act 1: Dr. Christian Bale, PHD, MD.**

For those of you who are too retarded to read my first DD, what initially got me interested in LUMN was a [13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761920019679/0001567619-20-019679-index.htm) filed by the one and only Michael Burry, who will henceforth be referred to Dr. Christan Bale, PHD, MD. As seen in the excellent movie The Big Short, Christian Bale is basically an autist who reads approximately 10 million pages of housing loans, and figures out that the trading of [Collateral Debt Obligations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo.asp) on subprime mortgages was going to crash the housing market.  Dr. Bale then buys approximately $1.3 Billion of [Credit Default Swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp), which is a kind of like a bet on a loan defaulting and proceeds to ride the housing market crash to tendie town. Is he the gayest of bears? No he's fucking not. They weren't puts, were they?

Confused about my lazy explanation of both an Academy Award-winning film and complex financial products? I don't fucking care. Google it, or watch the movie. Margot Robbie will explain it all to you, plus she'll get your dick hard. (Or your pussy wet. Idk I've seen some thots around here lately too).

Christian Bale has now increased his position in LUMN, per his last [13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761921003819/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml), and it is now his fourth largest holding. Remember that other stock that Bale invested in that helped put u/deepfuckingvalue on the map? What was it called again....? Idr. Oh well. Moving on.

**Act 2: A New Breed**

Ok, with that out of the way, onto the stock TL;DR at the bottom.

LUMN is formerly CenturyLink. Most of you are young enough now to not know that this company used to be shit, and was a part of a dying telecom industry that provided mostly phone lines, and no one except grandma has got phone lines in their house anymore. And grandmas die every day. So, much like the cigarette industry, CenturyLink's customer base was rapidly dwindling. Unlike the cigarette industry, CenturyLink could not replace them faster than they died.

&#x200B;

Until recently.

LUMN has rapidly transitoned to a cutting edge fouth industrial revolution company that is investing heavily in all the cool jazz that the kids love today, like hybrid cloud systems, adaptive network systems, AI driven adaptive threat recognition programs and advanced collaboration systems, which they have recently expanded with a partnership with [ZM](https://www.fiercetelecom.com/telecom/lumen-expands-partnership-zoom).

&#x200B;

Recently, they presented at the Morgan Stanley Technology Summit. I didn't watch that shit, but I guess it went well because the stock rallied almost 8% the day after, despite the market collapsing around it. I meant to post this shit before that summit, but was too busy getting my ass raped by PLTR weeklies to care.

LUMN is now trading at a cool $13.60, up from $9.76 when I first tried to bring you degenerates on board. Not bad for a boomer stock.

On top of this, insiders have been absolutely loading shares, you'd think this stock was [GME](http://openinsider.com/screener?s=lumn&o=&pl=&ph=&ll=&lh=&fd=730&fdr=&td=0&tdr=&fdlyl=&fdlyh=&daysago=&xp=1&vl=25&vh=&ocl=&och=&sic1=-1&sicl=100&sich=9999&grp=0&nfl=&nfh=&nil=&nih=&nol=&noh=&v2l=&v2h=&oc2l=&oc2h=&sortcol=0&cnt=100&page=1), or something.

&#x200B;

**Act 3: Money and All That Shit**

LUMN recently had their Earnings Report. After which, they got fucking obliterated. Personally, I think the finanicals are greatly improving. Let's discuss why, ok?

* Their non GAAP EPS was $0.48 per share, against the estimate of $0.30 per share, beating the average consensus estimate by 37%.
* EBITDA was $8.6B vs $8.9B in 2019.
* Their net income improved from -$5.2B to -$1.2B.
* Operating Expenses were reduced by by almost $570 Million.
* Their net profit margin was improved from a solid -24.33% in 2019 to -5.6% in 2020.

Ratios:

* Price to Sales .51 in 2020 from .66 in 2019.
* Price to Book .96 in 2020 up from 1.07 in 2019.
* Price to Cash Flow 1.61 in 2020 from 2.12 in 2019.

&#x200B;

Don't understand what any of this means? Me either, basically. But know this: LUMN's evaluation ratios are knock any one of their competitors in the 5G industry far, far out of the park. They are a company with a $10B market cap that does sales north of $20B. For comparison, TSLA's Price to Sales ratio is 24.23. If you don't understand why a lower number is better here, fucking google it. Because I lied. I do understand the financials but I'm too lazy to explain it all.

**Act 4: Forward Looking Statements**

Here are some additional reasons why I think this company will make your portfolio super duper green:

* LUMN owns one of the largest fiber networks in the world, with over 450,000 miles of fiber owned in North America alone. They also own the largest fiber network in Asia, where the expected CAGR of 5G Utilization is [46.4%](https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/asia-pacific-5g-enterprise-market-to-witness-massive-growth-by-2024-as-mega-trends-fuel-industry-transformation-870296850.html).
* Asians aren't the only folks LUMN loves they recently hired [Quincy L. Allen](http://blackmillionaires.blogspot.com/2011/08/quincy-l-allen.html) to their board of directors, not only because he's a successful dude, but because, you know, #BLM, as the kids say.
* Companies like AT&T and Verizon will rely heavily on fiber providers to expand the next wave of 5G, which, as you cool kids know, is the next bee's knees. There have been some unsubstanitated chatter of a potential buyout by AT&T. But take that shit with a grain of rice. Still, with how cheap options still are on LUMN, it's worth the gamble IMO.
* There has been a steady increase in [Darkpool Prints](https://twitter.com/darkpoolcharts/status/1364034343480545280) on LUMN since February of this year. For those of you who don't know what darkpool trades are, basically, folks with huge amounts of money will trade stocks on a private exchange because the size would otherwise throw the equity price out of whack on the public markets. Like, a lot of money. Like, more than you fucks who bought into GME at $400 have made so far.
* LUMN is prime to drop a bomb in the the near future. There was a lot, a lot of attention at the MS Tech Summit and LUMN got some attention, as previously mentioned above. Options volume has spiked, and the Put to Call ratio is a respectable .14. Bottom line, not alot of gaybears in the LUMN camp.
* There's a chance of a big upcoming catalyst at any turn with LUMN. However, I think the safe move here, and the best way to generate TENDIES, is leaps. For those of you who don't know what leaps are, they're pretty much the opposite of FD's. **It is possible to buy an option that expires farther than this friday, not sure if you fucks knew that.**

And yes, Sir, I know this is a casino. **I'm giving you a sure why to beat the house.** Currently, an ATM option for JANUARY 2022 is $1.75. This is cheap, folks. Real fucking cheap. I've got options that have been fucking printing since December. If you're a real tendie tickler, try leap call spreads. Set and fucking forget. [For the price of 4 GME shares, LUMN could net you $25k](http://opcalc.com/rlE). That's definitely enough to tell your wife's bf you're sleeping at the foot of the bed instead of a couch. In a year.

**Act 5: Don't Eat the Crayons**

Ok time for some chart astrology you fucks. As you can see [here,](https://imgur.com/YvMsoZy) we've got LUMN on the 10, hourly, and daily charts. For you robinhooders out there, there are things called candle sticks and technical indica-...fuck, nevermind. It's too complicated. Just keep yoloing your stimmies into GME FD's. It'll work out I promise. TBH it probably will you degenerates are a wild bunch. I hope you all make millions.

Anyhoo:

* The 10 is showing relative consolidation, with an arguable inverted head and shoulders, and had a strong move upward when RSI traded into the oversold range. there were multiple tests of the 200 EMA (purplish), 50 EMA, (yellowish), and 20 EMAS today in this time frame. LUMN held VWAP until about 10AM central when it dumped below it and traded under VWAP until it spiked up to retest VWAP after hours. A push over VWAP ($13.68) in PM tomorrow could set LUMN up for a strong pump at open for all you daytraders out there. MACD ended in the bullish/nuetral territory.
* Hourly is showing signs of a reversal if we can get strong out of the gate and get through the several levels of resistance: $13.19 at 200 EMA, $13.68 at VWAP, $13.73 at 20 EMA and $13.76 at the 50 EMA. RSI is still in the low to nuetral oversold territory at 45.50. MACD is getting ready to curl bullish and I think LUMN will be strong tomorrow. Volume Profile (not pictured) has strong resistance at $13.83, but over that we could get real fiesty.
* Despite the daily MACD curling bearish, and RSI being in the higher range of overbought, I'd argue we're seeing a small bull flag on the daily. Volume movement also makes me think bull flag, but be aware of the general market sentiment and get ready to play both sides of the coin.

&#x200B;

Ok Autists, you may be missing a chromosome, or might have an extra, or maybe I'm thinking of something totally different, but this one's a no brainer for me. Watch the price action and go long when the opportunity arises. Since my last post, LUMN experienced a sympathy squeeze from GME which drove the price up to $16.60. Since I'm no u/deepfuckingvalue, I cashed the fuck out of most of my earlier posted calls because I paid pennies for them and sold them for dollars. However, I still hold July, November and January 2022/2023 calls and spreads.

This is a smart play folks. Which might be sacrilege on WSB these days, but nothing will be unVALEd or turn PRPL in your portfolio and you will be able to afford to eat more than CORN. The only thing that will happen if you join the LUMN gain is green tendies and fucking caviar. #ganggang.

&#x200B;

TL:DR- Buy LUMN calls, leaps and shares. Did I mention there's a 7% div?

&#x200B;

Postions:

* 4,225 shares
* July 15c, 17.5c, and 20c
* November 15c, 17c, 20c, 22c and 25c
* January 2022 12c, 15c, 17c, 20c, 22c and 25/30c Debit Spreads
* January 2023 25/30c Debit Spreads

&#x200B;

Bonus Positons:

* JACKED TO THE TITS in PLTR shares
* PLTR April 16 35c at 3.21 Cost Average (FUCK)
* TAK January 2022 30/32c Debit Spreads
* WMT January 2022 165/170c Debit Spreads
* TSLA March 19 1050/1060c Debit Spreads at 1.25 Cost Average (ALSO FUCK)

&#x200B;

I'll see you fucks in tendie town.

This post is an attempt to bring some context to some of these price targets. 

Consider the fact that, even if GameStop's market capitalization briefly reaches $2T, it still will not be the most valuable company in the world (that title will remain with Apple). **At a market cap of $2T, shares of GME will be worth $28,680.** At a share price of $10k, GameStop's market capitalization will be  \~$700B, less than those of companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple.

Now, from the perspective of fundamentals, it doesn't make sense to compare GameStop's market cap to those of the companies just mentioned. However, in the context of a short squeeze, it seems like a reasonable comparison, especially in light of any evidence supporting the possibility that GameStop will briefly become the most valuable company in the world. And that possibility is quite plausible. 

Remember that Volkswagen became the most valuable company in the world when the price of its shares spiked in the midst of a short squeeze in 2008. You might say, ""Well, maybe market caps were more uniformly distributed in 2008, so the bar for VW was lower."" Ok, fair point. But at the peak of the VW short squeeze, VW attained a market cap of \~$420B. According to The World Bank (see [https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD)), the total market cap of all listed domestic companies worldwide was $32.27T in 2008, and $68.65T in 2018. So at the peak of the VW short squeeze, VW accounted for roughly 0.42/32.27 = 1.3% of total market cap. In 2018, 1.3% of total market cap was $0.013\*68.65T = $893B. **At a market cap of $893B, GME shares will be worth $12,806.** And this is a conservative estimate, since the current total market cap is considerably larger than it was in 2018.

TL;DR: The price of GME shares could reach anywhere from $12k to $28k. Obligatory  🚀🚀🚀."

1) BB has nothing to do with smartphones. Throw those 2007 notions out of your mind and bring yourself to the future

2) Whilst the whole stock market has been pissing themselves for years over EV/AV industry speculation, the reality is that these are hardware companies with low margin, and limited scale potential.

Even Tesla, owned and run by the richest man in the world, has yet to build more than 500,000 cars in one year. Meanwhile Tesla competitors springing up everywhere with both new challengers such as NIO and old money fucks getting into EV such as VW and GM (GM in December 2020 announced 100% by 2030 all cars would be 100% EV).

THE REAL FUCKING MONEY is not in EV production which has low margin and low scale, but in data monetization which is high margin (and being software) has unlimited scale. In the same way that Google makes only $18Bn revenue from hardware sales (phone, nest sales etc) but makes $120Bn from data monetization, $BB is going to to the fucking moon with $200BN revenue + by 2030 with 10% net whilst Tesla and other big auto are fighting over 4% margins (Tesla net profit in 2020 = 4% whilst **BB sat at a juicy 10.15%**).

This industry is going to the fucking moon, and BB is the only one with a front row ticket 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. This shit is like investing in Google or Amazon in the year 2000, by the time the mainstream saw the potential 5 years later, shit was already at pluto

u/just an everyday life couldn't have put it better: ""Zombie cars and QNX

QNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. What the fuck does that even mean nerd? For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.

Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.

Fast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot program but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?

SONY? Blackberry QNX. Baidu? QNX baby. XPENG? Blackberry as well. If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? Li Auto But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using Nvidia DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both Canoo and Hyundai makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.

You might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀""

3) BB is a cash flow positive, growing company with near nil competitors in an industry that is skyrocketing. Despite this, the boomer fucks who still believe BB is a smartphone company, have in their own glorious act of autism, have massively shorted BB bringing the share price down. 

BB is a growth company in a growth industry, these hedge funds are going to need to borrow more money if they want to buy tendies after the wider market realizes the market inefficiency that is an undervalued BB. u/Tradergurue went into a lot of detail in his $BB short interest post here [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short\_interest\_in\_bb\_its\_increasing/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short_interest_in_bb_its_increasing/) 

TLDR: hedge funds caught with their dicks in their hands are about to get Royally Fucked as the market corrects itself with a BB rise over the next month

Don't let TSLA and AAPL fool you,12,55,2021-03-05 08:47:16,"I am not going to do the homework for you guys. Just go to any financial statistics website and look at the PE ratio of the majority of the stocks inside ETFS like QQQ. Their PE ratio and net revenue / cash flow to stock prices are not actually up but either stable or slightly lower. The only exception to this rule are meme stocks like TSLA, GME etc. AAPL is an exception too but AAPL's net revenue is quickly catching up. But ETFs and tech stock market in general are not in a bubble, you are looking at less than a handful of stocks to make this determination.

You guys are also forgetting that we are currently undergoing a technology revolution like never before. Covid-19 put technology in the forefront and it's like the invention of the steam engine right now. Everything in tech and the cyberspace in particular is literally going to skyrocket in the upcoming years. People who are going full time in right now will be the winners and history will know it. Jury is out for if these meme stocks are overvalued too because we don't know their future potential (TSLA, NIO etc - minority of the tech stocks). What is happening right now is that safe money is moving out of stocks and either into bonds or cash. Because of inflation cash is going to take a huge hit in a year or so when we finally have the figures for how much Covid-19 cost us in American dollars. So not only will people miss out on the huge gains post-tech revolution but they will also take a big hit for holding cash.

I am not going to say if I am a financial expert or not. It is common sense. But I was never a part of these PLTR, GME and TLRY ponzi schemes. These people are worse than the hedge funds because they are just as greedy but far less educated / invested. It was a pyramid scheme where the first guy in took the most gains. I don't believe in something like a store that sells physical copies of video games to ever succeed rofl. Let's not forget Gamestop offering $3 for a game they would later sell for $40. All you bozos did was bail out the assholes that were invested in an asshole company and had poor retail investors take the hit for it. You people took advantage of depressed anxious jobless individuals and now many of them are left without much. I took a big hit from TSLA too (silly me). But I do believe in the cyberspace taking off big time in the upcoming years and it'd be the most valuable resource imaginable. You are seeing news right now about tech stocks being in a bubble over and over. You are also seeing news about some bond bullshit going up. It's the news that wants you to get out so the big whales can go in cheap - right before Biden administration goes all in on the clean energy and tech sector. Tech in the 1990s was nothing like it is now. India and China did not know what computers were back then, now every person has an iphone and tiktok in their hands. Cars are running on cyberspace/cloud that did not exist back then. Revenue of tech companies dwarfes the oil giants. Currency itself is produced using technology (Cryptos).

If it survives I'll edit it with all the DD you can stand, but otherwise just click on my profile an look for my WFC (Wells Fargo) DD. Here's the TL;DR  


1.) WFC is a bank that was in the doghouse. Fed says it can come out and play now.  
2.) WFC is a bank and banks do well in high interest rate environments. Rates are skyrocketing right now.

3.) WFC is one of the only big banks that hasn't reached it's pre-pandemic highs, meaning it still has room to run.

4.) When Ryan Cohen sold his stake in Chewy he invested it into just two stocks, AAPL and WFC. You could buy AAPL, but that's a tech stock that isn't going to do as well in a high interest rate & high inflation environment as a bank.

5.) Michael Burry initiated a large position (3.3% of his fund) in WFC last quarter. You all know what happened last time Burry and Cohen agreed on stock.

6.) WFC has really freakin' cheap options. June 45c (that's about 22% out of the money) were going for 80 cents today. IF WFC gets to $50 by June (about 34% gain) those calls would be worth $5 intrinsically. That's over 500% gains on the calls, I'm sure you can do the math if it goes higher.  


Positions - 60 June 50c, 15 June 45c, 20 March 40c, 10 March 42.5c, 150 Shares."

While everyone was crying about the market taking a shit and RKT crashing ([I was crying too](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx7mlz/rkt_12k_114k_17k/)) it was announced ZNGA acquired a game studio, [Echtra Games](https://venturebeat.com/2021/03/03/zynga-acquires-diablo-co-creators-echtra-games-in-expansion-to-pc-and-consoles/), whose creator and his team played a pivital role in Diablo/Diablo II. They were acquired with the goal to help Zynga move into PC/cross-platform game play. I think this is a promising acquisition with lots of future potential and is just [one of many planned for this year](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/zynga-q4-earnings/).

The CEO of Zynga also spoke at a conference with Morgan Stanley today. Below are some excerpts he said during the call that I found interesting .

&#x200B;

**Well known established global IP + data driven iteration + proven game mechanics =** 🚀

>We like to learn from what we've done before. And in the case of Harry Potter that was a big element of it. One of the things that we learned was we needed an intellectual property in a world that was appealing to a much larger audience and a much more global audience, so that a lot of the cool game play features that we had could reach a bigger audience. So we combined a new IP with some proven mechanics that we'd been messing around with. And then we tested it for a very long period of time and test markets. That's really the structural difference between mobile and console.  
>  
>In mobile, you can really test market something to remove a lot of the introduction risk. And so with Harry Potter that was something that we did as we went into whether it was Australia or Canada, we were testing very specific elements of what makes for a successful game. Does it retain? Does it engage? What's the conversion rates? Does the UA scale against what the cost of acquisition is? And so, we thoroughly put Harry Potter through its test marketing phases. And what we're really excited about was first and foremost the reception from fans was phenomenal.  
>  
>We saw - the ratings were very strong. The Harry Potter fans were raving about it. It went really viral. We did some fun stuff with Zayn Malik. And it really had really a lot of nice momentum out of the launch. But then when it started to hit weeks 14, 30 and beyond, all the testing that we had done about what were the retention rates engagements, we were exceeding them. So it was actually really positive to see that the test marketing worked and that was a critical part of the success here.

The Harry Potter IP is a money machine. If you can integrate the game mechanics that get people to continually make micro transactions, or spend hours playing, combined with a raving fan base of an established global IP, imo this is going to print money for them.

The Harry Potter game was [launched on Sep/23](https://investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-launches-harry-potter-puzzles-spells-worldwide). I think we could see a lift in revenue in the coming quarters from this game.

&#x200B;

**2 Upcoming Game Releases in the First Half**

They're targeting 2 new game releases in the first half ""Puzzle Combat"" and ""FarmVille 3"".

**On Puzzle Combat**

>So as we think about releasing Puzzle Combat in the first half, I wouldn't necessarily set the expectations that this is a theatrical movie model where it's - a Marvel movie that comes out at summer and it's got this huge spike. That's not at all the model here, right. We're in this for the long-term. This is a marathon, not a sprint. And so, we're going to be releasing the game, see how it settles in and then very methodically start acquiring based on what we're seeing in the dynamics and the metrics.

**On FarmVille**

>And, there are a lot of fans that have tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of people had played FarmVille over the years. And when we think about all of those fans and what their expectations are and how to bring them into a new experience, we’ve doing a lot of testing. We’re also running a bunch of FarmVille games right now, whether it’s Country Escape or Tropic Escape, which has a very big fan base and they love the game.  
>  
>And so it’s a little bit more complicated to navigate some of the pre-set expectations, but what we’ve done is really build out a terrific new experience and experience that is unlike LA. It has things that are familiar to people that have played FarmVille in the past, but it’s got a lot of unique new elements to it, and a new look and feel that feels very modern and very cutting edge for what we believe mobile games really are these days.

Puzzle Combat is more of a long play, and I like these types of strategies mixed in with shorter term plays. Zynga seems to have a healthy balance of this, which I really like.

What I think Zynga does well is tailoring their games to the fan base. I think FV3 is going to be a fresh reboot of the beloved game by its fans with new elements to keep users engaged.

&#x200B;

**Expansion into cross-platform gaming**

As mentioned, they acquired Echtra to boost their expansion into cross-platform gaming. Unrelated to the acquisition, one of the first cross-platform titles later this year will be Star Wars Hunters.

&#x200B;

>Yeah. I think if you take a step back and look at the industry overall, some of the largest franchises in the world right now are cross-platform, and they’re free to play in many cases with seasons passes and things like Fortnite, Pub G, Engine Impact, a lot of people have been talking about how the console developers getting into mobiles the thing. Well, I think that door swings both ways. I think mobile developers can actually step into the cross-platform mega franchise part of the market, because of a few reasons.

&#x200B;

Regarding the team they acquired:

&#x200B;

>I think the last point I’d make on cross-platform is that. We’re just getting started in this. So the acquisition of Echtra is really a key one for us, because ultimately game quality is a function of game team talent and leadership. And when you look at these guys, they’ve worked on RPGs for up their whole careers. They’ve worked on Diablo, they helped to create Torchlight, which is a fantastic IP and the action RPG category. They’ve actually published games cross-platform. It’s a team less than 50 in San Francisco right near our shop.

I think if the launch of Star Wars Hunters goes well in the second half of the year then I think it's possible we see a nice upward movement on the price.

&#x200B;

**Becoming a first party ads platform cutting out third party platforms like Google/Apple**

&#x200B;

>...mid-point the last year, we started looking at the fact that we were one of the premier advertisers in gaming. All of our games are enabled for IAP and IAA. But between the time that they saw an ad and they ended up in our game, we had it was kind of opaque, right. We worked with other parties – other third particles or use other third-parties like, Iron Source or Unity app and Google, Facebook, and the third-parties were handling a lot of the information and a lot of the acquisition. And then we looked at our first party data asset, which is the data that we were generating around what a player was doing inside of our games.  
>  
>And that was tremendously valuable, but we were missing that piece of it. And so when we looked at it, we said, wait a second. If we do a couple of things here, we can capture the 15% to 30% we’re paying partners right now, just to manage the exchanges. We would get more information about what’s hot, and what’s not at the top of the funnel in terms of what’s appealing? What’s not appealing? What companies or products are doing better and why? We would be able to creatively optimize our products better. We ended in a post IDFA world that would all become first party data. The big issue with privacy is what is one party exchanging to another party about an individual, right? But if you enter one network and you have a good exchange of what your permissions are, you carry through that whole process in a high fidelity way from a data standpoint.  
>  
>And so when we looked at it from multiple directions, we're like, wow, we can margin expand, we can pick up more efficiency in our UA dollars and in our advertising business. We could grow our advertising business faster and we could generate potentially a competitive advantage and information superiority, just knowing more about the players coming into our walled garden or into our platform than the next guy.  
>  
>We felt like this was something that we could go after. We went through a very diligent process of breaking down what these look like. And we found that some of these components we could build, some of these components we need to partner on and in addition to that in ad tech, there's a lot of - there's really a lot of vibrant companies and opportunities out there to potentially partner as you've seen from recent development.  
>  
>So when we think about where we were as a company, we were a mobile pure play developer and publisher and we felt that that is a really valuable company, but we thought that we could become an even more valuable company by building out our platform by starting to grow our total addressable market by getting into consoles and PCs, and then leveraging this unique asset and hyper casual to really supercharge the platform as well as get us into a place where we're seeing more information coming into the top of the funnel and then converting them into players and ultimately payers.""

This really sticks out to me. Zynga was 1 step ahead from the new pivot by Apple/Google on stronger ad tracking privacy. They're becoming the ads exchange where companies pay for displaying ads in games. This also gives them an advantage on learning what's working for others and apply that to their business model.

[Here's a bite sized](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljywic/znga/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) DD u/jojofroyo did.

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. Do your own research.

Positions: $27k with various calls throughout the year. I think they could have a great ER to justify a new target price from analysts, so went with a higher strike price after their next ER.

This stock market crash prompted millions of investors to **""buy the dip""**.

YTD from March 2020 to March 2021 we've seen some impressive gains to say the least - (Apple saw a **117% gain** from March 2020 to Feb 2021).

My theory is, in order to avoid the short-term capital gains tax you must leave your investment in a security for over 1 year...

That being said, I believe we will see a massive movement of selling off and taking profits around mid March from investors who bought the 2020 dip and want to avoid the capital gains tax. 

P.S. I know nothing and most of what I say I've heard form someone smarter than me and just regurgitated. So, if I'm absolutely wrong ill take it like a man but this is just my thought on what to expect from next month.

**TLDR; Mid-Late March will see a HUGE sell off due to investors avoiding short-term capital gains tax followed by a huge bull-run.**"

Currently buying aggressively on the cheap:

LuLu - Mar. 24th ER and extremely oversold. Girls with great asses with always buy this and store re-openings should provide additional income.

AMD - Just released the new Threadripper. Also underpriced and same short interest at TSLA. Could make a 10% run at any given moment.

AAPL - Well because they rule the world and it stupid underpriced.

I know, I know, I didn't think my first contribution would be about a Jim Cramer Boomer Stock... but yea, it really is. But just follow along with me here.

I first began the day planning out my next moves for when I start jumping off the tech train (like right about now), and begin embracing the market for post pandemic retail/life (and once the CPI begins to bump, the moves for making money in the market during inflation). This led me to look at commodities and companies which deals with commodities.

**ENTER COSTCO**

I then pull up COST and wonder what the heck am I looking at. Why is there such a dip!?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fs582ukeerk61.png?width=501&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd299c206740f45dbfec2923e2483ee9e4fd46cd

There must have been some terrible news right? Being an avid costco shopper to feed my family of 5, I begin researching what terrible thing happened to Costco to cause such a rapid selloff. But the more I looked the more I realized that this selloff is really just weird...and it could be an opportunity to get some tendies...(or rotisserie chickens...see what I did there?)

**Researching Possible Causes**

Could it be massive shorting like we all see with other stocks? No, its only running 0.98% of shares shorted.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b6jtyoyferk61.png?width=505&format=png&auto=webp&s=52d06efbe13966d7ee2d559e5a7c4fd0d7f6a106

Was there any news of accidents or management issues? None that I could find on google.

Then I come across an article about warren buffet which may explain some things

**Warren Buffet Sells his shares of Costco**

https://www dot yahoo dot com/lifestyle/warren-buffett-dumps-all-his-costco-stock-3-reasons-why-that-is-a-big-surprise-235600486.html

Well, considering that he sold it off prior to November 16th 2020 (could it have been him doing that huge red candle on nov 9-10th?) shouldn't the stock have begun to drop from there? It should have, but it didn't. So I looked some more and found that Costco announced a special $10 dividend (which is pretty high...I mean RKT announced a $1.11 div and thought that was amazing). My first thought was that damn, Costco made a lot of money to do a $10 dividend, and second, that this drop isn't justified if Costco is making a ton of money.

https://finance dot yahoo dot com/news/supermarket-chain-costco-declares-special-222312149.html

Here's a chart with the dividend marked (you can also see that big red candle right before it which could have been buffet?).

As you can see, right after the dividend has passed, the stock begins a slow bleed until you see the final crazy selloff at the end, and with that $10 dividend in the back of my head, im already thinking that this sell off is all sentiment without any real reason.

So I do some due diligence and look at the financials, earning calls, etc. I then mark them on the chart to see what kind of effect those things had on the price. They seemed to help or negate the stock even during this time of speculative hype.

Each blue vertical line marks an earnings call, where if you zoom in close enough you can easily see the market respond negatively or positively to the results in a pretty normal fashion within a week or so afterwards. Each call is followed by a swing of about 10 points up or 10 points down. Typical moves for a stock trading in the hundreds. This confirms to me that without a trigger to drop the price of Costco, there really isn't any reason why the stock is dropping and that any positive earnings should push it back up and any negative earnings should drop it further (or remain the same).

As you can see, the stock is just completely oversold, trading outside the bollinger bands which tells me that it might be a good time to catch a falling knife (you know, buy the dip)...but what could slow the downfall and even reverse it?

**Enter the earnings call March 4th and why I am Bullish**

Looking through the financials, Costco has continuously beat its earnings.

>This warehouse club operator has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 11.04%.  
>  
>For the most recent quarter, Costco was expected to post earnings of $2.04 per share, but it reported $2.29 per share instead, representing a surprise of 12.25%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.85 per share, while it actually produced $3.13 per share, a surprise of 9.82%.

https://news dot yahoo dot com/costco-cost-beat-estimates-again-171005710.html

And looking at its previous 2 years of March earnings, it has always beat its December earnings (for all you call options people). I didn't do a screen capture as its a long scroll. But the data is on the link below. Just look at all the March earnings vs the one reported before it.

The most recent price target estimate I could easily google (ALL above where its trading now)

**Fundamentals (if they matter anymore) have not changed, AND WHY I LIKE THIS STOCK.**

**They make a ton of money (selling tendies):**

>In FY 2020, ended August 30, 2020, Costco posted year-over-year (YOY) gains in revenue, net income, and other metrics. Total revenue increased by 9.2% YOY while net income attributable to Costco climbed by 9.4% YOY.3﻿ The company said that its e-commerce business saw a 50% YOY increase in sales for FY 2020 as a result of gains in grocery deliveries, prescription medications, electronics, and office supplies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.4﻿  
>  
>Costco posted revenue of $43.2 billion and net income attributable to Costco of $1.2 billion in its Q1 FY 2021, ended November 22, 2020. Revenue rose 16.7% while net income attributable to Costco grew 38.2% compared to Q1 FY 2020.

**They are growing their online business (growing and selling rotisserie chickens):**

Continuing its sales strength during the COVID-19 pandemic, the company reported net sales across all segments of $19.1 billion for the five-week period ending January 3, 2021, a 12.3% YOY improvement overall as e-commerce sales jumped 62.5%.

**They are international (also making tendies):**

>Besides the U.S. and Canada, Costco operates membership warehouses in Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Spain, Australia, France, China, and Iceland, and these latter countries are represented in the Other International Operations segment. Together, the non-U.S. and non-Canadian countries represent roughly the same amount of revenue and operating income as the company's Canadian business. For Q1 FY 2021, Other International Operations generated total revenue of about $5.9 billion, a 21.8% YOY increase. Other International Operations also posted Q1 FY 2021 operating income of $289 million, a 46.0% YOY increase. This makes this segment the fastest-growing in terms of both total revenue and operating income. It comprises 13.7% of revenue and 20.2% of operating income.

https://www dot investopedia dot com/how-costco-makes-money-5094774

**Why Costco post pandemic will still retain its customers (Article from 2020):**

>Nearly all the members who had the opportunity to cancel their subscriptions last quarter declined to do so. A full 91% of its U.S. shopper base chose to renew, in fact, which marks a slight increase from the 90.9% that Costco reported in each of the last three quarters. Costco counted 55.8 million member households at the end of Q3, up 500,000 compared to the prior quarter. Its global renewal rate was unchanged at 88.4%.

https://www dot fool dot com/investing/2020/06/01/why-almost-no-one-canceling-costco-membership.aspx

Costco is a solid business with much upside. Despite buffet selling (he also dumped AAPL), the fundamentals of the business have not changed. Seeing as that the majority of its profits come from the membership itself, and that most people do not cancel their memberships, I dont see why Costco would suffer post covid. At the recent price its currently at, it signals an overly sold stock which will very likely bump up in the next earnings call to stabilize the price and bring it back into traction.

**My Plan:**

I like this stock for both a long hold, and will supplement with $340 March 19th (sound familiar?) Calls. Ill have 60 shares come market open tomorrow.

edit: fat fingered march 5th instead of march 4th earnings call.

edit 2: i wrote horizontal line instead of vertical line when referencing the plotted earnings calls (too much writing!)."

Why Clover Health is retarded.,422,92,2021-03-03 14:28:57,"I've bought the falling knife. I enjoy high risk. Let me run you down some fundamentals on why this is an advanced long. Pun intended. (My screen name.)

Let's get to the meaty part first.

Lesson #1 Fraud is the most bullish word on Wall street, but even better is Monopoly, and Antitrust. Which is why retail weak fingers are getting walked down. (Regulation is the most feared btw.) If it wasnt for Clover health pulling some strings behind the scenes I dont think they would exist. Clov was caught running a red light, so take the fine, and get back in your Tesla. If not for fraud they wouldn't last a year. United health, and Blue cross would've destroyed them right outta the gate.  Look at the most fraudulent companies in the world. They're sporting the highest market caps. Ask Tesla bear scrubs Einhorn, and Gordon Johnson about how Tesla is a fraud. Apple, Msft, Amzn,  seen fraud litigations. Bring in Vivek, and Chamath. Accused of fraud. Get the point? Fraud is bank as long as your the fraud.

Who cares about Last year? You've heard this right?

""**Past performance** is **no guarantee** of future **results**""

A. Grew membership by 36.3%

B. Increased revenue by 45.6%

C. Gross profit increased to 12.2% of revenue

This means absolutely nothing. Again. **""Past performance is never an indicator of Future results.""**

**4 F's  - Future Fun Facts & fundamentals. Speculative Statistics.**

A.  The number of Americans ages 65 and older will more than double over the  next 40 years, reaching 80 million in 2040. The number of adults ages  85 and older, the group most often needing help with basic personal  care, will nearly quadruple between 2000 and 2040.  👈  (Try search engine)

***Those statistics come true. Minimum +200% customers***

B. Government Medicare spending is set to increase from 15% to 19% 👈  (Try search engine)

***More revenues from the budget.***

C. Medicare for all. 👈  (Try search engine)

***""Medicare for all"" would push our potential customer base to the moon. (Full Population)***

D.. Clover health's competitors have over a trillion dollars in market cap to swipe.

***Always good to have healthy competition. UNH, ANTM, HUM, CI, plus private ones like Aetna***

E,F,G Highly Speculative. It's a healthcare insurer that's only medicare, and not yet in the workplace.

***If Clover health enters the entire health insurance market whole different valuation is coming.***

&#x200B;

TLDR; For those that are patient. This could be a really great long term growth investment. Clover health currently has less than 1% of available participants in healthcare marketplace.

Aside from the celebrity status of certain board members I'm going to tuck this one under the mattress, set a recurring investment, and probably have fun losing everything if tit's go up.

Edit; Almost started crying today. So I bought some stocks at that emotional moment. My average on clov is now break even. I caught 6.55 and I didnt lose fingers this time. got august 12.5 calls for .90c too. "

$GM has some real potential to bring me some generational wealth. $500 PT. Yes, you heard that right. 

1.	GM is insanely undervalued, trading at only 12.5 P/E currently and $75bn market cap. GM is the largest automaker in the USA selling over 8,000,000 cars per year. In comparison, Tesla is trading at over 1,500 P/E and $750bn+ MC. Tesla only sells 500,000 cars a year. They make tons of money on their existing ICE lineup through popular brands like Chevy, GMC, Cadillac, Corvette and reinvesting it into Autonomous Vehicles, Electric Vehicles and Flying Vehicles. 

2.	GM currently has many government contracts and will continue to win more contracts. Government agencies use Chevy's SUVs and President Biden's limo is a modified Cadillac Limo. Biden has committed to turning the entire government fleet of 650,000+ vehicles (light trucks, SUVs, semi-trucks, etc...) into fully electric. and built in America, I expect an announcement soon and GM to be awarded some, if not a majority of the contract. Other startup EV companies simply do not have the scale to produce the government contract. Ford has EV production in Germany which is not made in America. Tesla recently purchased $1.5bn in cryptocurrency which the Treasury Secretary Yellen is against. I think $GM is the best bet to win a majority of the government's work.

3.	GM has committed to selling 30 new EV by 2025, selling ONLY EV by 2035, and being fully carbon neutral by 2040.

4.	GM owns Cruise Automation. Initially, bought the startup for only $1bn and most recent funding round of $2bn by Microsoft/ Honda has valued the startup at $30bn. Currently in the lead of Autonomous vehicle technology and continuing to grow massively in the technology hub of the world, SF Bay Area. This technology is being massively discounted.

5.	GM has Utium Battery technology and a $2.3bn factory in Lordstown, Ohio churning out their proprietary battery technology. 50-200kWh battery packs that will push the cost per Kwh under $100 (current cost for Tesla is over $230) in the next few years. These batteries will power the new Cadillac Lyriq and Hummer EV coming out later this year. The  cars are not weak, truly cutting edge! 

6.	Apple has rejected Hyundai, Kia, Tesla, Nissan in their bid to find a manufacturer for building an EV. $GM is still in the running and could be a nice surprise. They are cutting edge, mature with manufacturing capability, and made in America.

7.	Famous investors like Warren Buffett, Leon Cooperman, Joel Greenblatt all piling into $GM in the billions.

8.	President Joe Biden will likely renew the EV tax credit in his upcoming stimulus bills which will cut the price of $GMs EVs by $7,500 and spur sales significantly.

9.	Chip Shortage Fear will be over soon and is only temporary. $TSMC has is in the process of building a huge factory in Arizona which will keep chip manufacturing in the US. Biden will sign executive orders to ease this issue through defense production act.

10.	Newly released Chevy Bolt and Bolt EUV is the hands down most affordable and best value EV on the market today. Bolt starts at $31,995 - Bolt EUV starts at $33,995. Both more range than Tesla Model Y and EUV has $GM's version of Tesla Autopilot, SuperCruise already installed (versus Musk's $10,000 for this upgrade).

Megabullish on this to double or triple once the media/ mainstream investors discover what $GM can really do! Position below. Cheers guys.

Zynga (yes, the FarmVille one) has had a solid year. They’ve shown good profit and have a strong outlook for 2021. When they’re compared to competitors they’re undervalued by about $5 per share depending on the day. They hold solid market share, and have agreements in place for strong properties (Harry Potter and Star Wars to start). 

I’ve been reading some speculative rumors that Zynga has been having some discussions about being acquired by a larger company. I’ve seen arguments Snap has a standing agreement with Zynga for gaming, and Facebook will, at some point, need to work more on diversifying. Both want need to expand into new realms of revenue and buying a profitable company with a growing user base would be a solid move.  However, I want to throw an idea out there that Apple could have a good case to buy Zynga to bolster their own somewhat feeble (for Apple) gaming division both on mobile and on devices like the Apple TV.

There is apparently a new TV coming out, but at what point is that device pointless when a lot of TVs are coming with Apple software native to the TVs OS?  To me, the logical expansion is to make it a more gaming friendly console and a good way to do that is to add a suite of games by buying the dev. 

On mobile the draw is more so to cut out the middle man and add Zynga profits to their own. Zynga also owns rights to some great properties and has a close competitor to Fortnite coming out. This would help Apple fight Fortnite its self and the messy battle that that is turning into.



I put some money on $ZNGA for these reasons. If not Apple, someone might snatch this one up before WSB decides to YOLO it like $GME"

This is one of my first posts and am going to try to make this a weekly thing to help you apes and autists out. 

Hedgefunds and asset management firms have these analysts preparing all these market forecasts all the time. I feel like us apes could come together to defeat the hedgies by putting all our thoughts together and getting a sense of how the market might look like in the near future. So we can get tendies! Who wants tendies? I want tendies!

Please note this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. I am just an ape. This is purely for education purpose. Please consult a financial advisor not me.

You all must be wondering, what the hell is going on in the market lately? Why are stonks down? Where are my tendies?

Well Apes, apparently there are these things called bonds. JPOW sells these things at auctions and people buy them! Can you believe it? People actually buy things other than stonks.

Lately these bond traders have been very worried that things are getting back to normal! There's $1.9 trillion on its way and that means tendies! Tendies for everyone! And that means prices of things might go up. And if that happens then Fed might have to raise interest rates to keep the prices from getting out of control!

These genuis bond traders have ultra paper hands and they were expecting rates to rise in 2023. But they are afriad they might go up in 2022! Oh lawd! Have mercy.

If interest rates go up. It means stonks go down! Witchcraft! These bond traders are scared and pooping their pants. No one is buying, which is driving the prices of some of these bonds down. means yields are rising! Rising yields oh no!  Everyone is panicking and cashing out.

So bond traders are all looking at JPOW like what you gonna do. You gonna keep running that printer or stop? JPOW is like. Whatever YOLO. But bond traders are not convinced. They feel like JPOW like a cheating boyfriend is lying and will probably backstab them and raise rates.

So bond traders don't wknow what to do. They are panicking. Scared and running around like chickens without heads. All this fear is spreading into the stock market and people are selling their stocks.

Stocks are down! Stocks are down! Stocks are down!

So what's ahead? Well Feb's job report is out on FRIDAY. If the numbers look good Thats Bad! Good means bad because it means things are getting back to normal. No! Bond traders don't want things to get back to normal. If numbers are bad Thats good! Because that means less risk of higher rates.

Good is bad and bad is Good!  What in the world is going on?!?

Well - All you need to know is JPOW is speaking on Thursday. Everyone will be watching. If he says something stupid... Stonks will go down. So lets hope he doesn't say anything stupid. Job reports out on Friday. If report is good then more red! 

Also - Expect some more red if bond traders panic a bit more and drag the stocks down. If there is fear in the market then fewer insitutions will buy stuff. Apes are still buying. So keep buying and keep holding those diamond hands. Don't paper hand! Hold Strong! Let the insitution paper hand. If we keep holding. The market will stabilize in the next week or so. If we buy that means more tendies.

All the best Apes. Just remember, expect turbulence ahead. But it will pass in a week or so. As soon as those stimulus cheques hit the streets, there will be tendies! Glorious tendies.

**3/4 update:** Most profits taken on EPD when it went above 23. All those calls went ITM this week. Chillin now while awaiting Powell

**Another 3/3 update**

Taking oil profits and sitting the rest of the day out, going to read up a bit on current index price action and see whatsup tomorrow.  I’ll post anything interesting I find. 

**Clarification**: not selling EPD

**3/3 mid day update:**

Looks like the EPD call and 3/2 oil Update were on the right track. Holding off on buying any of the tech for Rambo rn while letting those run. Closed out any ded tech. 

**Night shift RAMBO update 3/2**

All the news coming out about OPEC+ is bearish, but I keep on seeing repeat OTM 3/19 call buying on all oil tickers.  *My spidey sense tingles*. 

**The State of our DD: Update 3/2**

Shitty market movement but nothing unexpected on our underlyings. Tech zoomed Monday— DOCU was a one day hold, but **remember to check the events scheduled on ones like CRM and NVDA for when you want to enter**. These are volatile times for tech and we’re playing pops. 

**We got concerning news on Energy with Saudi’s saying they’ll loosen oil supply**. Tomorrow is the ESG portion of EPD and XOM is having an investor day— I’m going to let XOM movement determine if I am scared or not since it will be a litmus for Thursday EPD event. 

BIDU doing its thing let’s hope it keeps up. CRM sucks ass as always but it’s the schedule I’m gonna play, not the stonk. 

So far I am okay with things have played out after a big Monday, and luckily we have far dates on deez bitches

[Welcome back to the casino](https://i.imgur.com/rWUea2Z.jpg). 

**Last week’s 1x-to-multi-baggers:** SPOT SNAP BA 
**Last week’s losers: BIDU XPEV**

**On a milk carton but our family still has hope**: JD

*I use Barchart and TOS for general flow, but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks. Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.* 

**UPDATE: DOCU CEO** speaking at Morgan Stanly TMT conference Monday AM. [This 300c 3/5 came through last week](https://i.imgur.com/dD2cqVp.jpg). Suicidal strike, but I like the sentiment. 

****

When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.

**Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day. 

Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.

****

**1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**

On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.

I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.

Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**

It was time to get to work.

****

**2.	The investigation**

I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.

1) [SNAP](https://investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https://investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https://investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.

2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.

*All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump. 

*NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*

These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".

****

**3.	Defining RAMBO**

As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**

I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https://esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.

**Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**

****

**4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO** 

**What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**

**My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference. 

**5. So what am I saying?**

I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.

**Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**

[EPD](https://i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀 

Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.

The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https://www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.

You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.

As always pick a good entry point.

[BIDU](https://i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) 🚀 🚀 

**EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright 

Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:

>BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China.
A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.

Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.

[CRM](https://i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) 🚀 😬 

CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.  Outside of that nearing bottom, though, they've got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4/9 275c.  [They're trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week, alone](https://investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx).  I'll play it a little safer, a little longer, but I'm in for fishing the bottom here.

[ZNGA](https://i.imgur.com/cTLGZLk.jpg) 🚀 😬 

Whale came through with a conservative bet, but I'll be curious to see what they have to say at upcoming conferences after their CEO essentially begged for somebody to buy them out after ER lol (not really, but yeah kinda).  [They're speaking at the Morgan Stanley Tech Conference on March 5th, 8:25 AM PST](https://investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-present-morgan-stanley-technology-media-telecom-conference)

[NVDA](https://i.imgur.com/TFrRmTn.jpg) 🚀 🚀 

I'm as sick of hearing about the damn chip shortage as you are, but NVDA has their annual investor day coming up on 4/12 and calls are starting to trickle in.  Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.

**Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I’m a bandwagon hopper 🤷🏿‍♂️  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble

****

**TLDR**:
Check the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.  Investor day is the new earnings report.

I like tickers: **EPD BIDU CRM ZNGA JNJ NVDA**. All long, on dips, and buying in tandem with the above mentioned special datesj"

Unfortunately none of them were available, so I’m stuck with my fellow smooth-brained apes.  Hopefully our individual brain cells can work together to answer my question:

Is there a possibility that the dips of every major stock on the market could be caused by shorts selling to cover GME?

I ask because prior to GME rising, the prices of FB, AMZN, AAPL, NFLX, GOOGL, TSLA, and almost ever other big boy on the market dropped despite the DOW closing at record highs.  I’ve never seen that before.  I’ve owned AAPL for the last six years and I have never (and I mean NEVER) seen the stock drop $2-$3 consecutively for this long.  AAPL has been one of my safest and most consistent investments, so I’m a little surprised.  Especially since they just posted over $100 billion in revenue last quarter.  It doesn’t make sense.  Almost every ticker on my watch list is down by a lot.  Of the 40 tickers currently on my watchlist, GME is the only one in the green.  

Thoughts?

**So Let's start!**

Right now, we are in a bloated market with some insane valuations, inflation fears, and recession nightmares... So intuitively, the plays which would make most sense(withstand all of these) are undervalued stocks(rare gems) in an overvalued market!

I introduce to you **(Ticker: $F) FORD 🇺🇸 🦅.** The all American car manufacturer which withstood every recession since 1920's... The company which our government treats as a favorite child! The car manufacturer which produced most American cars ever, and finally the innovator which employs one of the greatest PR firms and R&D teams. **I know, I know, you may say WTF??!! FORD?? GTFOH boomer!! Hear me out till the end and you'd be surprised.**

# FORD IS STORMING THE ELECTRICAL VEHICLE MARKET AND THEY AREN'T FUCKING AROUND!! (Veni, vidi, vici)

Yes, you read the tittle right!! Not only that, but also they are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EV cars to compete with TESLA). After years of development, this year they came out with **Mach-E.** An EV car which has a starting price of $35,395(After Federal Tax Credit which still applies to Ford EV's (indicates great government connections)) and easily rivals a model Y when it comes to value. It's way cheaper and has relatively comparable features.

As The Verge's Sean O’Kane perfectly said: ""I don't think people should underestimate just how important the Mustang Mach-E could be. The Mustang branding makes it instantly familiar and the design is striking enough that it gets noticed right away without being so out there that it's uncomfortable or weird or alien. **It's the kind of car that in a couple of years, if enough of them are on the road, it can really make people take notice and think about buying an electric car in a way that the I-Pace or the Audi e-tron or the Chevy bolt never have or will. I think Ford is tapping into something only Tesla** really does well right now with the Mach-E, which is trying to mix that modern design with increasing ubiquity in a way that could make people feel like they're missing out on something, much like the **effect a new iPhone can have.""**

For more on Mach E comparison to Tesla cars: [Link 1](https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/23322283-rd-barris/5534036-reviews-of-ford-mustang-mach-e-show-tesla-no-secret-sauce) Link 2

# What about production, constant need for innovative technology in EV's, and the need for other models?

**Production(keep all of the following in mind because a Tesla comparison is ahead):**

Ford produces around 5.5-6 million cars per year, it's the second biggest US car manufacturer. They know the in's and out's of the car production market and have top tier international connections^(1). Additionally and more importantly, they have the government in their pocket.

Ford has **active** production facilities in Turkey, China, Romania, Spain, India, Canada, Germany, South Africa, Thailand, Russia, Taiwan, Argentina, England, Venezuela, Mexico, Brazil, and Slovakia^(1)(arranged by size). But, I'm not here here today to talk about that. I'll be focusing on the EV car production.

Ford has already produced 10,000 Mach-E's and they delivered 5,000 of them to dealers. In addition, They are planning to produce 50,000 Mach-E's this year. While this number may seem minuscule in comparison to the six figure production number of their gas vehicles, it's an impressive start in the EV market. By comparison, this year so far Tesla has rolled out and sold just 14,100 of its electric SUVs, the Model X. And back in 2017, the EV manufacturer was able to produce only 1,764 of its popular Model 3s in the first six months of production. The following year, however, Tesla delivered more than 140,000 Model 3s.  While Tesla had a slow start, it certainly has caught up in filling  customer orders. In 2019, it’s averaged sales of 12,500 Model 3s a month or about 150,000 cars a year. While Ford won’t be able to match this years Tesla Sale numbers **initially**, it looks as if it’s off to a strong start. (Source: Motor Biscuits).

Another point to keep in mind, Other carmakers haven’t had as an impressive showing as Tesla in EV production, either. Jaguar sells a mere 200 I-Paces a month. The Audi E-Tron, a plug-in SUV, is averaging about 600 sales a month. As for the Chevrolet Bolt, its sales numbered about 13,100 to date this year. The Chevy EV’s first year saw only 23,000 produced(Motor Biscuits). and please don't get me started on Chinese EV BS... Bottom line is, aside from Tesla production numbers in the EV space, Ford is the next runner-up after Tesla.

**What about international production and sales?**

Ford to go all electric in Europe by 2030! It intends to spend $1 billion to revamp a factory in Cologne, Germany, where it will produce EVs using a Volkswagen platform(Biggest car manufacturer in Europe).  This new strategy involves phasing out gasoline-powered vehicles in favor of electric power. The automaker expects to have **all commercial vehicles made by Ford in Europe be electric by 2024.** Two years later, it expects **to have converted its entire lineup into electric or plug-in hybrids.** Gasoline-powered commercial vehicles will still be offered for sale in Europe after 2030, Ford says. However, the automaker currently sees electric models accounting for two-thirds of its European sales.(source: Tech Crunch)

**What about Asia?**

Ford announced Jan. 27 that its Mustang Mach-E SUV **will be manufactured by Changan Ford for customers in China.** The Mustang Mach-E will start being produced there later this year as it looks to tap into China's electric vehicle (EV) market. Remember that China is the world's biggest car market with more than 20m vehicles sold each year. (BBC)

**What about government support in production?**

Ford CEO calls on U.S. government to support EV batteries, charging(Headline on Feb. 24 Reuters). He outlined the automaker’s plan to develop electric platforms for its top-selling trucks, vans and SUVs. What happened after that? Biden ordered for a review of US supply chains for vital goods such as large capacity batteries and semiconductors! In addition, he signed an executive order to amend the Semiconductor shortage. It seeks 37$ billion in funding legislation as a shortfall of semiconductors has forced U.S. automakers and other manufacturers to cut production.(Reuters)

**Innovation and Technology:**

Ford and Google to Accelerate Auto Innovation, Reinvent Connected Vehicle Experience (Feb. 1) [(Ford link)](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html). Ford and Google came together in **first-of-its-kind partnership** to create unique services and capabilities for Ford and Lincoln customers, and to **accelerate Ford’s transformation plan.** They are working on data, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) innovations. As part of this new, **six-year partnership,** millions of future Ford and Lincoln vehicles **at all price points will be  powered by Android, with Google apps and services built-in.** In addition, Ford and Google have established a collaborative group called, Team Upshift, that will push the boundaries of Ford’s transformation, unlock personalized consumer experiences, and drive disruptive, data-driven opportunities.

**What other EV models are they working on?**

in 2019, the Ford F-Series was second only to the Apple iPhone, which raked in $55 billion, in terms of total revenue generated. The F-Series  generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined, which added up to $40 billion, Just something to think about. The F-series is their most successful car and they are planning to release the new EV version of it soon this year. After that, They will move to electrify almost every model one by one.

# Valuation and Price target (~110$ = 429,000,00$M market cap)

Yes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.

$Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple

(Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- some are outdated)

TSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X

NIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)

GM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X

F - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X

**(Important part starts here)**

As you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.

If you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.

If WSB adopts $F, it can raise it be the next (110$+)  EV play in the industry. At that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **🇺🇸 🦅**.

Ford has always put the American people over money and has provided so many American jobs for the last century. Ford is a well known American brand and it's deeply ingrained in the American history and culture. I'm proud that my grandfather used to work in Ford(ME) and had great memories in there. In my opinion, the strength of this brand will continue on and it will rise from the ashes like an American bald Eagle**🦅** after a forest fire.

**TLDR:**

1- All American, highly undervalued stock.  **✅** **🇺🇸**

2- They are ready to dominate the EV market. Targeting mid class with high quality cheap EV's. **✅**

3- Have the government support. **✅**

4- Have a strong international factory presence for production. **✅**

5- Strong PR, Research and development teams with a 6-year google partnership. **✅**

**MY Price Target: 110$ TICKER:$F**

Apple has been falling for a month with barely any green days to speak of. It is well below its trend line now, and the chances of such a company continuing to bleed out and break with its growth trend entirely are slim to none.

Point being, one of these nights soon, AAPL is going to start jumping back up, probably to 130 or so if you ask me. If you are holding weeklies when that happens you will hit the jackpot, and if you ask me that could happen any day now.

* **GameStop** Volatility is picking up
* **“Meme Stock”** phenomenon is not going away
* **Success in GME** could unleash coordinated runs that will swamp the system
* **Instant clearing** will not occur quickly
* **Regulators** will need to step in or the markets may destabilize under the speculative assault

After a few weeks of “normal” 20%-30% intraday moves GameStop stock is once again becoming parabolic nearly quintupling in yesterday’s regular market trade and after hours session as it rocketed from $46 to $200 before finally settling at $168.

#### Volatility is picking up

The volume in after hours alone  surpassed regular hours trading with more than 41M shares changing hands. It is very possible that GME volume today could exceed 100M shares matching the average daily volume of such trillion dollar capitalization giants such as AAPL.

The fact that GME’s volume could approach the volume of AAPL – a company whose sales are more than 30 times larger is of course absurd. But GME is not an investment idea on any normal cash flow analysis basis. It is the preeminent “meme stock” which moves strictly on the highly reactive buy and sell flows created on the Reddit r/wallstreetbets bulletin board.

#### Copycat trading could overwhelm current clearing processes

The GME phenomenon represents a completely new dynamic in the markets that combines social media dissemination, mobile access and commission free trading to create a giant, highly directed pool of capital that could verticalize any stock at any time for no other reason than flow. 

While this is certainly fun and perhaps profitable for traders involved it creates massive externality problems that could have very negative effects elsewhere in the market. We’ve already seen how such massive volatility swings forced RobinHood to suspend trading in the stock in order to meet margin calls from its clearing house. RobinHood has since shored up its balance sheet, but it is unclear if it will have enough capital to withstand a fresh wave of activity, especially if the GameStop gambit proves successful for the speculators involved and will then attract 5X or 10X new flows that could propagate through many thinly traded, financially dubious securities creating massive 200%-500% daily moves.

#### Regulators Will Need to Step In

We have arrived at the moment where the market execution technology is completely overrunning the clearance and settlement protocols that haven’t changed much in centuries. It is absolutely clear that if “meme trading” is to continue markets will need to go to instant settlement of transactions – a task easier said than done. The clearing of trades is a multi-trillion business with thousands of actors and a million moving parts that cannot just instantly switch to a 99.99% uptime regime in order to accommodate swarms of speculative flow. Yesterday’s FEDWIRE wire issues that deal with clearing banking transactions – a much larger and more important business – is testament to the fact that financial systems are vulnerable to a “brownout” event – much like the one that occurred in the energy markets in Texas as abnormal demand completely overran supply.

The events in Texas were tragic and in many ways preventable but the laissez faire attitude of regulators exacerbated the problems a thousand fold. The very same dynamic may occur in the financial markets if regulators do not take control of the situation.

#### Long term Bans may be the Only Policy Play

At this point it is unclear what regulators could do given the absence of quick legal, cultural and technological directives to instantly move to real-time settlement. The only choice of the regulators is to simply suspend trading in any security that moves more than 25% in a day absent any material financial information from the company. The suspensions would have to be far more draconian than the current  versions that are in place. Regulators would in effect have to create system wide bans on any trading in the “meme stock” security for days and perhaps weeks rather than minutes. The bans would have to be backed by strict civil penalties for any OTC trading of such securities so that the threat of punitive damages would cool off speculative flows. 

If a hobbyist Robin Hood trader who held $2000 of a suspended meme stock suddenly faced the prospect of a $50,000 fine for illegally trading it, the speculative fervor would cool.

#### Anathema to Free Markets

This is of course a complete anathema to the notion of friction free securities markets where any participant is at liberty to do use his capital as he pleases. It is undoubtedly a drastic solution to the problem at hand, but for now it may be the only policy choice to make given the unintended consequences of letting this phenomena play itself out without any supervision.

The current financial system is simply unprepared and incapable of absorbing highly coordinated speculative flows that could overrun the underlying business of the global capital markets. The ultimate irony of the GameStop saga is that the very technology that has created unimaginable freedom to transact instantly at minimal cost may invite the most restrictive response imaginable in order to avoid a massive destabilization of the markets.

lrznso,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrznso/bbs_time_has_come/,$BB’s Time Has Come,469,113,2021-02-25 14:01:11,"This BaBy is taking off. BB these past 3 weeks has gone through a shit storm and none of us BB holders know why. It is the most undervalued stock I’ve ever seen in my investing life. BB is your wife’s boyfriend when he comes over for dinner dressed all nice and shit to impress you so that he can fuck your wife after dinner.

Listen to me when I tell you this. Blackberry is a company that used to sell phones back in like 12 BC, it flourished for a bit until Apple came in and beat BB into the multiverse.

Last few years blackberry floating around in time and space realized that it missed some sweet juicy titties and decided that it wants to go back to the physical world so that it can get a taste of some good ol’ titty juice. And decided to move into cybersecurity, or just a security company in general. And I mean the absolute best security the world has to offer, just a few hours ago BB won as the best autonomous cybersecurity company in 2021. And that’s just scratching the surface. World governments still use Blackberry phones and services because of how much they trust it. Including the US government.

BB has a product called QNX that ensures the safety of the next big thing - Autonomous vehicles. And it’s working with every fucking one. just to name a few giants using QNX - Ford, Motional, Baidu(China’s google), Audi, GM, Toyota, VW, BMW and more. All of these auto giants are currently working on AV’s and use BB’s QNX, except for Apple and Tesla, but they’ll join in soon enough, Why? Because Blackberry’s QNX was approved by the government, whereas Tesla has yet to do that. QNX is currently installed on about 200M cars and that’s just the beginning. No we won’t see profit this March because it is yet to boom. 

another product BB offers is only the best cybersecurity software available for you an I, called - Cyclance. It is basically like CRWD but better. And it’s only one of their products. It’s a subscription based software that protects you as if you were walking down the street with 3 Tyrones backing you up.

IVY - A partnership with AWS(Amazon Web Service) That BB has been working on. It’s basically an App store installed in AV’s, and Blackberry will be the backbone in it. Well knowing Amazon, they don’t fail. And knowing BB, they know how to ensure that nothing around them fails.

This is probably one of those once in a life time chances to get in before the floor goes up. Watch when the revenue starts to kick in, the floor will be 60$, and mark my words.

DISCLAIMER: This is a long term investment, not a get rich in a day kind of stock, but if you are willing to make a solid and rewarding investment, go for it. It may take weeks, to months. But I truly believe that Blackberry is making a revival. And that’s why I yolo’d 80% of my portfolio into this, sold all my BA shares to put more in BB.

Also, I am not a financial advisor, nor am I above average intelligence. This is just me sharing what’s on my mind. And you should take this with a grain of salt.

Positions: 500 @ 12

Edit: Thanks a lot for the rewards retards, but shouldn’t you just buy more BB?"

Fundamental explanation of what blocking tracking actually means: 
https://www.techrepublic.com/article/safari-for-ios-14-and-macos-11-how-to-prevent-websites-from-tracking-your-moves-online/

Signs that desire for early adoption is high: 
https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/prevent-apps-from-tracking-you-across-sites-ios/

Apples self-claimed results:
https://searchads.apple.com/

ios14 is proclaimed to fuck small businesses, marketers and e-commerce. That is the single biggest Zoomer and Millennial workforce collective in America. With this change, businesses can no longer target any iPhone user after they’ve visited their website while using the trigger of the ad that they visited the website.

Ie, you visit a red shoe page. You forget about it. Tomorrow you see an ad for a red shoe.

Or, you look at concerts online in Austin. Then you get distracted and don’t do anything. And then you get an ad for a discount to a concert the next time you’re browsing.

No more ads like that with ios14. That is dangerous because 80% of the digital marketing budget is devoted to remarketing and retargeting efforts (across the entire industry)

So, that’s concerning to me because while we can convert customers that have visited the website of Our company and that knows who we are, we make 9.7x what we spend on ads. But, with raw new first time interaction we see a return of .43x. This update will essentially fuck all the small businesses that have put in the time to build their marketing structure around Facebook, and even more so removes the ability for e-commerce to use this as their primary driving factor as e-commerce has an even worse initial introduction return but retargeting they make bank.

Simply put, all ads have to be written like you have no idea who exactly you’re talking to beyond a few details of their interests. You lose all ability to check if they are interested or even know about your company based off non-Facebook interactions. With this, Facebook interactions aren’t even valid anymore due to their far right audience consuming a 76% majority of their usage, you result in clients that are legit fucked. So you have to limit your buyer persona a ton and in turn your average ad cost will be raised significantly as it has for the last year as costs have eclipsed an all time high of being ~400% higher than last year.

All in all, you’d now spend $15000 for the same thing you would’ve paid $900 for previously (unless you’re part of the .00001% of FB advertisers). Due to the increased costs of Facebooks bottom line but also because of all these other factors combining to make it harder to even find the person you want, much less be given the time needed to convince them.

While tracking isn’t the nail in the coffin, the further downsides of Facebook remove further value. This isn’t about Facebook though. This is to show that Apple is making an incredibly, multi-industry impacting move with an attempt to bring Facebook to a 0% market share of iPhone users.

Why the fuck would Apple do this? They would never hurt their brand. They would never make a dumb money decision. They are the biggest company on the NYSE and that didn’t happen by making off the cuff decisions nor did that happen because of a “privacy play” Apple has realistically taken as much of the market as they can while touting privacy as their primary benefit to buy an iPhone.

With this Facebook filed an antitrust lawsuit that is literally going to create a War Between Giants. This very well may be the single largest business brawl ever seen. The number one most valuable company in America that’s geared to fight the number four most valuable.

What does that mean? Well typically, Apple will stay hush-hush since they aren’t making the move for publicity or branding. That’s not what happened this time. Instead, as soon as Apple was asked for a comment they stated they’d be fighting it.

Following this, Facebook sends out an email at 3:00am talking about the impacts this will have on all Facebook advertisers. They were burning the midnight oil and they decided fear was the best way to motivate the Facebook advertisers. Fuck Facebook for that tbh.

Well, Facebook has a secret solution. They can basically bundle an internet browser into Facebook and just serve the ads through there. Suddenly, they can track you again because suddenly you are never technically leaving Facebook. This is sketchy as fuck and is a simple one-line fix for Apple to again remove this ability. Like a game of cat and mouse as Apple plugs Facebooks bullshit side skirt attempts.

Additionally, Apple doesn’t historically allow skirts as you can see in the most recent time Apple denied a product that competed with a market they are in: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation and this move was super controversial. 

Want another example? Maybe a high profile one? Well Apple said fuck Epic Games and went for the jugular when they straight up removed Fortnite and all Epic Games products from the App Store. They straight up murdered another billion dollar company and Apple didn’t even get scratched. Literally said “fuck off, you can come back when you will pay your bill”

Apple didn’t care. They were going to get their money whether the company or retail investors cared. Apple is going to get paid when you’re on their platform.

But currently Facebook pays Apple $100 a year to list their app. That’s it. They don’t get a cut of ad share. Nothing. So Apple can monetize these small companies making millions but can’t take a cent from the fourth largest company in America. That’s not something they’re gonna be chill about especially as Facebook continues to damage their own reputation. You’ve seen Apple swing once with ios14 and you’ll soon see Apple swing with punch two.

But before punch two could even happen, Facebook files an anti-trust lawsuit and tries convincing their advertises with that 3am email to support the lawsuit. Uh oh. Must be hot in the walls of Facebook.

So why would Apple finally pull the trigger?

Because for years they’ve been building a secret digital marketing ad delivery platform. Where’s it been tested? In the App Store and they are currently sitting at a 50% conversion rate on average. That means one of two people that see an ad, download the app from that ad.

That is fucking crazy numbers as Homeer is currently sitting at 3%. That’s a  16x difference. That means we could theoretically pay 16x less due to the difference in their ad delivery model or potentially see 16x the amount of impressions.

What’s the difference that makes Apple so different? They don’t want to spend your whole budget unless they’ve found the perfect person. With Apple, you can set a maximum budget of $10,000 a month currently. Facebook currently has small e-commerce shops spending multi-millions a month. In the App Store, there is a ton of money left on the table currently but that’s not the juicy bit here. The juicy bit is that for the last years they’ve been testing and building this platform while also updating all user experience with Apple products. Finally, Apple has reached 100% control of the apps found and used on their phone, but what they don’t control is the ads inside those apps.

The five obvious big plays here.

👉 Mobile game ads

Game ads have become a meme about how bad they are. Additionally, they are essentially the very last item that can give Apple a bad look while also largely deceiving the users of iPhones. You know how bad they are. An additional upside to this is that not only does Apple look better as a whole, but this is before you consider that suddenly small businesses would have access to an even deeper level of targeting.

Imagine now, I know my perfect client is 34, has two kids and plays candy crush before she goes to bed. Well finally I can run ads under that scenario without having to go through some shady venue while also maintaining the trust aspect.

👉 Ads for kids

Finally parents can prevent their kids from seeing unregulated ads. Honestly, I can’t give example of revenue benefits here but this does help early adoption and public support a fuck ton.

👉 Safe for work toggle

Finally, we can have not safe for work ads for those that opt-in. Alternatively, this would function as SFW only but this is again, just another public perception possibility.

👉 Apple News 

Now, Apple has been going hard after news apps for the last year. Why would they do this? Because they have Apple News but it’s not monetized by Apple currently. Again, they have third party providers displaying ads that Apple gets zero share of.

But oh don’t worry, soon Apple will finally monetize all of their software because they have ads running in every platform imaginable.

👉 Privacy

Another major benefit is that we can deliver high quality ads as business, will get better ads as consumers all while maintaining the fine line of quality and privacy.

Now, ignoring all of that, Apple has seen a moving average growth of 50% YoY for the last four years. They have a solid growth path with products and for the last two years they’ve built their cloud platform to not only consume massive amounts of data, but also process that data. Just look at how they can now search through all of your photos instantly and show you them instantly without a single bit of that photo data being physically on your phone. They are geared to the fucking tits on software innovation and no one even cares.

To put it in perspective, Apple introducing an ad delivery platform with 50% avg. conversion rate would be like the day Steve Jobs announced the first iPhone.

Secretly for years they’ve worked towards this moment and they finally swung first in a fight.

Even without ads I fully expect them to hit the target of $165 by the end of the year while reaching $220 safely at the end of 2023.

Realistically, business adoption will take at least 8 months before Apple sees enough profit to even recoup the cost of the lawsuit, but this would be the single largest business pivot ever seen in the world.

So if Apple goes from a product business to a software business what does that mean for their value? Let’s look at Stripe since we have recent data and we know what they’re doing has the same kind of user life-changing benefits.

Stripe does $450 million in revenue. They were just valued at $115 billion. That’s a P/E ratio of 255%

Currently, the P/E ratio of Apple is 34% so not only do I expect them to land in the high middle range of the two, I also additionally expect never before seen returns for an ad company. Not because they have the largest audience but because they can genuinely show your ad to the exact person you want.

From a business perspective, digital marketing is entirely about quality over quantity when it comes to potential consumer eyes and this would be the very first ad platform to operate with this ideal.

Finally, Apple is currently underperforming and is trading on rumor of a bullshit electric car and is sliding, all while literally no one on the internet has considered the idea that they’re doing all this because they’re introducing an ad platform that will soon print billions of profit within months of releasing.

Now finally we can cover the aspect that we don’t have to try and time them developing and releasing this. They already tested it, got crazy fucking results and no one bats an eye. Everyone is so consumed by Facebook they totally missed the play Apple just made.

There’s a major war brewing and it’s only begun. But we’ve all watched the idea that all media is good media be proven true as Robinhood received 3.5 billion in funding during the biggest retail investor controversy in modern day. Regardless initial interaction, Apple investors don’t get scared by that. Apple investors are Apple investors because they know they will bring hell to earth before they accept not getting a cut of the money.

This company is down on the month incredibly and there has never been a better time to buy Apple IMO while being prepared to hold for about 8 months for potentially a massive, massive payout. This is not an option we will sell quickly. This is a weather the storm and wait for the announcement to set into reality.

Disclaimer that this is pure personal intuition and this idea came from nowhere but my ass and Facebook sent the email literally Monday so this is as hot off the press it can be.

All this to say, people like targeted marketing both businesses and consumers but not when it’s in Facebook hands. 

What company in the entire market is most trusted to do right by the consumer while delivering an incredible cost at likely a higher cost to those paying while also maintaining 100% of their self-made market? Apple.

I am jacked on 3/17/23 @ 190 for 10.60

Edit: due to an awesome fucking user we now know they are hiring a massive amount of jobs for their ad platforms: https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/search?search=Client%20Partner%20Manager-%20Search%20Ads&amp;sort=relevance&amp;location=united-states-USA

Here’s the snippet: 
&gt; “The Ad Platforms EPM team is looking for a highly-functioning, self-driven, and versatile leader who can manage a team of EPMs to drive our site reliability projects. These projects are key to our overall operations and business growth. You will own delivery responsibilities on projects that seek to build out scalable platforms and reliable infrastructure for core systems and applications across heterogeneous environments. This will happen while also adhering to the highest levels of privacy and security that Apple holds. You will be responsible for leading and mentoring your team to work through project dependencies, risks, and deliver measurable outcomes against timelines - in a fast-paced environment!”

While these may not all be for their *new* platform there is definitely jobs created on Feb. 19 that bring a different tone."

Hyundai has since come out with their own shit sandwich, [https://www.ft.com/content/b742f5ec-44e2-4f3d-9a63-05662eab0f0b](https://www.ft.com/content/b742f5ec-44e2-4f3d-9a63-05662eab0f0b) . They are involved in the largest EV recall, just announced.

Do you think Apple really wants to be associated with that nonsense?

Fisker is still early stage enough where Tim Apple could come in and apply the Apple style to the Fisker design, which TBH are already sexy : [https://www.fiskerinc.com/](https://www.fiskerinc.com/)

And, Apple has NOT signed the deal yet with Hyundai so it's likely Tim Apple could pull the plug and instead plug his EV strategy right into Fisker's daughter. (google that one)

After seeing all of the comprehensive DD posted by fellow scholars, I have decided to do my part for the community. I will be posting an extensive, Ivy-League level article detailing a comparative analysis of Apple & BlackBerry, clearly indicating its prospects and eventual growth into an even greater product.

**Price**

* **Apple:** The Apple product and all of its iterations in the market typically range from 1.32 U.S. Dollars to $21.00  U.S. Dollars per Apple. In perspective, the retail price of ""red delicious apples"" was around 1.32 U.S. dollars per pound in the United States in 2017, up from about 0.82 U.S. dollars per pound in 2000 (Statista, 2020). This clearly shows a growth of over 60.98% in 7 years, an astounding figure for a mere Apple.
* **BlackBerry:** The average price of pre-picked Blackberries ranged from $1.50-3.50/pint to $6.00-12.00/pint depending on the region (North American Raspberry & Blackberry Association, 2018). However, NARBA's indicated only a slight increment to the average price due to the pace of growth driven by the stability of the prices justified by individual growers of the product. In fact, 76.0% of blackberry producers were planning to keep the same prices, and 82.8% of raspberry producers reported plans to keep the same prices in 2018 (North American Raspberry & Blackberry Association, 2018).

**Barriers to Success**

* **Apple**: None, an Apple a day keeps the Doctor away.
* **BlackBerry**: Weather was mentioned as the primary barrier to BlackBerrys' success (23 responses), followed by Labor (21 responses) and SWDs (13 responses).

This crucial information clearly indicates the obstacles that we have to overcome in order for BlackBerry to achieve greatness. With the overall growth of the EV market, the weather will undeniably become better due to less omission of toxic gases into our atmosphere/Ozone Layer, which means better weather. Additionally,  the article that was created a few days ago suggested that Lucid Motors was in fact hiring engineers to help tackle the complications associated with BlackBerry, showing growth in that area. Moreover, SWD, which refers to the Polish Dragunov Sniper Rifle, is clearly not equipped to decimate tens of thousands of BlackBerries at a go, so we're good there as well.

With that said, BlackBerry is indeed a really good fruit to purchase not only due to its inherent health benefits but it’s ability to withstand inflation, judging by its stable price over the years!

Full Disclosure: I own products of BlackBerry (two packets) and am not a professional Fruit Analyst/Advisor, please purchase BlackBerry at your own risk and remember to check the expiration date.

Time to buy EV stocks.,703,281,2021-02-24 14:40:31,"In 2009, I watched my 401k get cut in half due to the Great Recession. I didn't want to put a single dollar into the market, but I refused to take a dime out. I was scared. My wife, who is much smarter than me, convinced me to put $10,000 into stocks I thought might survive a decade. I did that, but I also chose one specific sector to favor more heavily than others. I chose infotech. It worked out.

This isn't the Great Recession. Indicators are pointing to a very healthy market ahead and a pretty big swing up--if the virus gets under control.

Today I woke up to find EV stocks on sale. It looks ugly, and there's plenty of reasons why this is happening right now. But the EV market isn't going anywhere; it's simply the future. And because of that, I'm sticking $60,000 into the market again tomorrow, but this time, I'm spreading it across a lot of stocks. Some more speculative than others. Everything will be pure calls or stocks purchases; no puts, no spreads.

Some of these stocks are going to collapse to pennies. Others will more than quadruple in value. I'm making this post so I can come back in ten years and kick myself for not choosing THAT ONE STOCK to invest the whole amount in, just like I did with Netflix. (Though I put most in it.)
I also thought it would be good to get a bunch of EV tickers in the same place, so you can do your own DD and choose which of these might interest you. Or do like me, put larger amounts in the more stable picks, and throw some money on the craps table with some others.

You'll notice some popular stocks missing, because I just don't have any faith in them. Do your own research, and feel free to add more EV stocks below. Also, yes, some of these companies have (and will) merge, but I'm playing them here for different reasons.

TLDR: Buy when there's blood in the streets.
EDIT: I'm up 36% on the day, lol, but these prices will fluctuate heavily, and some will fail and die.

***TLDR:*** *GameStop can be a build-a-pc workshop with trade-in for a new PC every year (like how people trade in phones)*

I heard this idea being tossed around before and I wanted to make a post to discuss it's potential. First go watch this 40 second video on YouTube since WSB doesn't allow links: 

# NZXT Workshop DLC trailer – PC Building Simulator

[screenshot from the video](https://preview.redd.it/vgryv5esddj61.jpg?width=888&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e87e17d619445b3562992e05cf406e065b5ed75)

This is a PC Building Simulator but imagine, for a second, if this was real and became GameStop's market place. PC building is hard and not many people either know how or want to do it. That's why people buy PC's pre-built, but it's almost a guarantee that you would get better specs for the same price had you built the PC yourself.

# Building a PC is hard

When I built my PC it took several days for all the parts to ship to my house and the power supply was even delayed for up to 3 weeks, so I could not use my PC when I already had every other component. When it came in, it took 2 hours to build cause I had to open all the boxes, figure out what goes where by searching it up on YouTube, and then stumbling to connect the different wires to the motherboard. Look at this mess. Not my room, but it looked something like this

[PC building catastrophe](https://preview.redd.it/mfgp51gwddj61.jpg?width=454&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a8d7e0b4d943021f13da13b60970e317c31b5c2)

# But it doesn't have to be

Imagine how easy it would be if all the parts are already opened (new/used) and placed on the shelf and you could just swap parts and pick parts as you go with an employee helping you all along the way in case you get stuck. Not only that, the employee could even tell you what parts are the best for what games you want to play. If you only wanted to play Minecraft on low end graphics and don't need a PC for AAA games, they could tell you the parts to get for the cheapest PC that could handle that.

Not only would this open up the gaming world to people who don't have gaming PCs, this is just incredibly convenient. This would also let people stay in a GameStop like it's an Apple store and just hang out and chat with people building their PC.

[PC parts quickly selected for your gaming needs](https://preview.redd.it/bf2kkrxbedj61.jpg?width=502&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3380fabf8c12007a8e04432afaab0d8312f49175)

# Trade Ins

You could trade in your old PC and get a discount in building your new one. This would give value to brick and mortar stores and people could be trading in PCs like they trade in/buy a new phone every year

# Questions

Would you go to this? I know for a fact that I would. If enough people can just build a PC quickly and more conveniently at a GameStop near them, would this just bring Newegg and other online PC sellers out of business?"
lr1l80,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr1l80/pltr_extensive_dd_part_2_what_makes_it/,$PLTR Extensive DD Part 2: What Makes it Disruptive/Valuation,415,118,2021-02-24 10:42:56,"Yesterday I posted a lengthy DD on Palantir Technologies ($PLTR), where I went in-depth on my evaluation of the firm's history, its financials, and why I believe the naysayers are wrong (Link included here:[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq8rw4/i\_think\_pltr\_is\_invincible\_rn\_and\_in\_the\_long\_run/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq8rw4/i_think_pltr_is_invincible_rn_and_in_the_long_run/) )-i do recommend reading this first, this post is meant to be a follow-up/supplement to my liking of this stock.

But I wanted to go more in-depth into just why I find this company so special and unique. As I mentioned in my DD last night, I am just a 19-year-old college student, not an investment banker or hotshot market maker, but I believe the information I have ascertained about Palantir by just scouring the web distinguishes it from any company on the planet (but we'll keep it strictly to the software industry in this DD).

What is truly unique about Palantir's software (Gotham, Foundry, Apollo) is how collaborative, scalable, and advanced it is. Let me break this down: Palantir's software is COLLABORATIVE b/c it meshes the company's clients' data into a mega cloud. For example, the LAPD, BP, JP Morgan, and top law firms all upload their data onto Palantir's cloud, where they can get insights into efficiency, efficacy, and receive suggestions from the advanced software on how to improve their venture (these guys are all PLTR clients btw), and particularly useful for say, defending an embassy or managing a supply chain.

Now, just to get it straight, there is no data/cloud that can come ANYWHERE close to the insights and knowledge on what Palantir has.  You might often hear from Wall Street research analysts/CNBC shills who complain that PLTR has too many rich clients (big companies/gov't). But I think what boomers don't understand is that building your foundation amongst the biggest fish in the sea is quite the ADVANTAGE, not a weakness.

Let me use an example from our beloved Cathie Wood and her firm Ark Invest's large position in Tesla extremely quickly (I promise). When asked about how she felt about Tesla's performance in the autonomous driving space compared to competitors like Waymo (owned by Google), she commented last year that **having a vast collection of data** would separate those who succeed from those who attempt. As a reference, Tesla cars all transmit self-driving data back to the firm, which comes about through the many Tesla owners who drive all over the world. On the other hand, Waymo is committed to private testing stages only, which is shallow-minded b/c it doesn't have access to trial data on say, congested roads.

Back to PLTR. The reason I bring up the Waymo-Tesla-Ark example is to highlight just how many clients PLTR's revenue base represents, and how impactful that is on a company's growth, scalability, and ultimately, the *success of their product*. But I mean when you think about it, Palantir's clientele is the **ENTIRE GLOBAL ECONOMY/SOCIETY**. Go to the *Financial Times*, and try to find me an article that doesn't talk up Palantir's greatness in the U.K and their work helping NIH. EU members like Greece/France also use it for COVID vaccine tracking. Palantir has contracts with the Japanese/South Korean governments. Palantir has notably helped the U.S. catch infamous cucks like Osama Bin Laden to Bernie Madoff. Quite the diversity!

The reason for that entire BJ to Palantir right there is to illustrate just how extensive this scale is. Not only is all this data accessible RIGHT NOW to all these clients to collaborate on Palantir's platform, but is comprised of the single most dominant and sustainable institutions/enterprises in the world. No matter how the political winds blow or how the global/domestic economy winds up, you can count on 3M, the DoD, Ferrari- to name a few- to continue seeking ways to scale, grow, expand, and Palantir certainly is the way.

This gets back to another central, bulletproof thesis surrounding Palantir. Who are its competitors? Who can do what Palantir does? 

Let's start with Snowflake. All credit to their talented team, Warren Buffett, and their gang of bulge bracket banks who underwrote their IPO and cheerlead the stock on media outlets on the daily. But for lack of a better word, their software just isn't *dope* enough. I mean the UI contrast speaks for itself, but the intelligence is what matters here. Yes, data warehousing is no joke and is certainly a scalable business, but what kind of innovative insights can you draw from just essentially a digital warehouse that doesn't add any value? All Snowflake really is is Salesforce dressed up in pretty bells and whistles. Really makes me question Buffett's whole commitment to ""value.""

[C3.AI](https://C3.AI) at least has me interested. It seems like a real knock-off version of Palantir based on what I can ascertain from their public materials, but so what? A bunch of washed-up junkies from Oracle think they can lead the transition to AI? Compared to a company that was seeded in 2003 specifically to work with the CIA and other intelligence agencies after 9/11 (PLTR also called the ""gold standard"" by these agencies according to *TechCrunch*), why waste your time in [C3.AI](https://C3.AI) or Snowflake? Don't even get make me started on Splunk, IBM (who conceded they suck by signing on w/ PLTR last week), or MSFT.

And while we're at it, let's talk about valuations to drive the point home. According to the *Financial Times,* PLTR is valued at a $48B market cap and is trading at 34X 2021 estimated sales. To start, yes that is very lofty, even after accounting for the recent sell-off due to earnings/lock-up fears. But I'll pick on my prime targets, SNOW and AI, if we can even call them competitors (we'll be nice). SNOW has just under an $80B market cap, but is trading at 80x 2021 estimated sales! AI is trading at a $15B market cap, and is trading at 70.5x 2020 estimated sales!! That's fucking crazy, and Buffett should sell SNOW immediately if he cares about value (or he just doesn't understand technology).

Since the whole speculation is going to be about earnings in the next few years, let's talk about that. As I mentioned in my DD yesterday, PLTR reported EPS of $0.06/share on a non-GAAP basis, which is TRIPLE what the street predicted!! But thanks to a $100M stockholder compensation expense, the GAAP basis was a loss of $0.02/share, and Wall ST took the opportunity to AMBUSH PLTR. 

If you understand how business development works, these incentives are necessary in the early stages of a company. How else do you expect to attract top talent to the company and incentivize existing brains to stay? But as you grow into your valuations, like PLTR will, why do you need to do it? (PLTR has essentially promised 30% + growth for 5+ years, and earnings are on the way this year thanks to their earnings report). Who does Apple need to incentivize to stay? Wall St is simply trying to make something out of nothing.

I also mentioned PLTR was a direct-listing yesterday, unlike any of these other names here. If you don't know what that means, basically PLTR didn't have its IPO underwritten by banks or pay them massive fees in the process. So equity research, investment banking, asset management, and other areas of lucrative finance have no incentive to talk up PLTR (just Jeffries it seems for now).

And this is what I mean. Again as I mentioned yesterday, it happens with all megacap tech companies. Think about it as evolution. Facebook. Apple. Tesla. Google. Microsoft. These guys weren't oversubscribed by the money makers either, nor were they cheaply valued either. But by the time the robust top line translated into earnings, these firms were worth hundreds of billions of $ with the snap of your fingers, which is exactly what will happen with Palantir (we are already seeing this- their institutional ownership nearly doubled from 12% in January to 21% right now).

This is what I want you all to think about. As a disclosure, I am very long PLTR (you can view my positions on yesterday's DD), but irregardless of whether you will invest in it or not, read about Palantir Technologies. This is the company of the future: able to tailor its cutting-edge technology to all the intricate challenges the 21st century projects: climate change, further space exploration, geopolitical/nuclear tensions, renewable energy adoption, inequality, police reform, and so much more, while providing a platform for all these parties to collaborate and improve. Given the world is an ever expanding place, and the dominant players are already seated at the table, I could not feel more relieved or excited than to have all my chips in the one waiter who will serve them all.

\*\***This is not financial advice.

If you think BB is a distraction from any other stock, then scroll on past these tendies new blood.

https://presentations.akamaized.net/FileLibrary/1218/4/AWS_BlackBerry_Final_Slides.pdf

Blackberry and Amazon Web Services just finished their webinar explaining their multi-year, global agreement to develop BB IVY. They are addressing the undeniable need for software development in the growing and evolving automotive space in terms of apps, shared mobility, and software development and updates and how they can help solve and transform them.

**TLDR:** Blackberry will help automakers address the security issues, while delivering constant updates to a vehicles software in their infotainment system, apps, voice assistant capabilities, and also active safety features (including self driving). 

They will also help monetize on the ecosystem of in-vehicle apps and services, and BB will also be a bigger giant in this space because compared to Apple or Google who want to own this information, BB offers it to their OEM partner.

They are transforming the UI and product design of 
their products in cars and also working on a way of allowing customers to communicate to other endpoint destinations and operating systems (not just QNX).

Key Points:

1. **Ivy benefits the whole value-chain** because modern cars and trucks are built with thousands of parts from many different suppliers, with each vehicle model comprising a unique set of proprietary hardware and software components. These components, which include an increasing variety of vehicle sensors, produce data in unique and specialized formats. This requires highly specific skills required to interact with this data and with BB IVY there is no need to worry about special automotive programming languages, hardware variations, or proprietary sensor data formats.

This means the developers won’t need specialized or automotive software skills and the consumer (driver) gets more frequent feature updates allowing for better performance/experience along with safety of their data. 

2. **Data is the new Gold/Oil**. Blackberry pivoted from phones many years ago and has had a vision to build a data analytics platform for years which they showcased at CES 2 years ago.

In a Bloomberg interview, John Chen says that this new business model creates a recurring data business for BB. This revenue stream should not be overlooked as a Mckinsey&Co report outlined that connected cars will allow for the OEMs to monetize data from connected cars. We all know that 7/10 most valuable companies in the world generate billions in profits from data-based services.

Chen explains that Amazon is interested in BB:

1. QNX provides Amazon with a secure, safety certified OS (aka the “plumbing” or ecosystem Ivy will be built on)
2. BB secures all endpoints in the Internet of Things
3. Potential move to provide endpoint-based security platforms to **Amazon Alexa, Amazon delivery drones, Smart stores**, etc.

**What does Amazon provide BB:**

1. AWS experience with user interfaces
2. AWS Cloud
3. Machine learning models from AWS Management Console

So what about competition?

Chen points out that he is not worried about Apple and Google entering the space as they also only have experience with user interfaces and, but they lack experience in the OEM space with the ecosystems. The leverage BB also has over them is that Google and Apple want to own the data themselves, where BB would offer it to their OEM partners, which is very valuable data to automakers.

End note: 

The automotive space is changing rapidly as every single company is rushing to make more technologically advanced cars. If you own a Tesla you are already aware how crucial the Apps, Self driving, Car software updates, etc. are all crucial to the experience of next generation cars. 61% of the EV market already use QNX and soon every car will be needing more security and BB is already in 175 million cars that haven’t even scratched the surface of being next gen. Among Amazon, Baidu, and Motional, Lucid motors is also on the plate and hiring a QNX specific engineer at the moment. 

**Bear’s Case**
The opposition says that BB’s revenue has yet to prove that it has grown as a software company in the automotive space. One of the first disadvantages, according to analysts, is that it’s still a small-scale company compared to several of its software security competitors. This will make it very difficult to compete with competitors much larger.

The company also hasn’t proven it can consistently grow its business solely as a software company. Furthermore, BlackBerry stock has slowly been losing market share for years, especially in endpoint management.

So although operations may be stabilizing as of recently, analysts still see a tough path to consistent growth for BlackBerry.

But in my bias opinion, BB has tackled many of these obstacles just this year. Partnering with big names in different spaces has provided recognition, new sources of revenue, AND public awareness.

Nobody is forcing you to read BB updates and I ain’t trying distract you from shit. BB isn’t a boomer phone company anymore, educate yourselves in any stock before investing.

My non-professional price target: $20.00 is feasible and modest EOY. 2x? 3x from there?Nobody knows what the limit is, but it’s a steal at the current price. This isn’t a squeeze or a heavily shorted company, it’s an **iNvEsTmEnt**.

Positions: Increased position of 4000 shares (2000 @ 9.67 BEFORE GME sent it on a rocket, and 2000 more averaging UP since shit hit the fan with GME) and 9/17 17c, 19c, 21c."

Its a lot of speculation.  But we have an idea what tesla is targeting.  And we have teslas track record for the past 10 years or so.

20M deliveries by 2030.  Power revenues equal to auto revenues.  Plus robo taxis.  Not to mention anything else like service, superchargers, insurance, possible air craft down the road, etc.

So you can use that, 30% margins on autos, avg selling prices of say $25k. To get auto revenues estimates.  Double that revenue for power.  Then multiple by a probability of success.

Robo taxis are a real outlier that could possibly double both of those or be equal to zero.

So its really difficult to assign value. Which is why the stock is so volatile.

The high price is due to tesla historically high success at hitting 50% CARG since 2012.  Just try carrying forward 30% CARG for 10 years and see what estimates that gives you.

As such market is expecting tesla to do well.  Production is lined up for 1M autos this year to not be an unreasonable number, double of 2020.

Do all the above and assign a price multiple to the revenue.

So teslas track is strong, its history is strong, and its potential is even stronger.


So do the math.  20M autos at 25k sale price yields 500B in revenue.  Double that to include power potential, so $1T in revenue.  30% margins leaves us with 300B in profits (assuming they can get earnings to near equal auto margins, they currently do NOT).  A 20 P/E gives us $6T market cap.  This ignores robo taxis.

So $6000 a share by 2030, assuming no robo taxi revenue, production hit targets, and 20 P/E.  Obviously a lot of risk to these targets though.

Alternatively, 40% CARG (tesla has had 50% since they IPO'd) would put 2030 revenue at $896B.  Not far off from the above.


Big questions are

1) can it hit/maintain 30% margins as EVs race to the bottom on prices/commodize.  Apple has done well with phones but autos may be more difficult, idk

2) can it turn revenue into profits equal to 30% profit margins.  Current earnings are no where near the declared auto profit margins. 

3) can it scale manufacturing fast enough to hit target with batteries being a big limitation, driven by limits in battery supply chains, which they have to take in house and reinvent to achieve 

4) is a 20 P/E reasonable.  If not what is?  Most autos are much less then this.  But most autos have terrible debt positions and near no growth.  

5) biggest what if, can they make robo taxis a global thing?  How will that affect revenue and margins?

May be a good time to BUY THE DIP

Welcome to Tuesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Tuesday, February 23, 2021-

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-23-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Nasdaq set to sink again as Big Tech slide continues

> * U.S. stock futures were mostly lower Tuesday, pointing to a 1.4% decline in the Nasdaq, one day after the index sank nearly 2.5% in its worst single-day drop in almost a month. Tech stocks continued to slide in Tuesday’s premarket, with Apple down another 2% after closing lower by nearly 3% Monday.

> * Dow stock Home Depot dropped 2% in premarket trading on worries that Covid pandemic sales gains won’t last. A stock drop of that magnitude would put a major dent in modest year-to-date gains.

> * The S&P 500 on Monday fell almost 0.8%, in a fifth straight decline, its worst losing streak in nearly a year. The Dow Jones Industrial Averaged bucked Monday’s downdraft, closing slightly higher. It’s doing so again Tuesday morning. All three stock benchmarks remained stronger for the month.

*****

> # 2. Bond yields have been rising ahead of Powell’s testimony this week

> * As part of mandated semiannual economic testimony, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell goes to Capitol Hill twice this week, appearing Tuesday before the Senate Finance Committee and Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee. Rising bond yields and accompanying inflation fears are adding a higher level of interest around Powell’s remarks. The 10-year Treasury yield, which moves inversely to price, was slightly lower Tuesday morning,. But it’s been rising lately and trading around 1.36%. It was as high as 1.39% on Monday, the highest level in about a year.

*****

> # 3. B/itcoin sinks below $50,000; Tesla shares drop again

> * B/itcoin plunged 12% Tuesday morning, sinking below $50,000. The world’s largest digital currency, still up 60% this year, hit an all-time high over $58,000 on Sunday. Price swings of more than 10% are not a rarity in c/rypto markets. B/itcoin once climbed to almost $20,000 in 2017 before shedding 80% the following year. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday warned about those wild swings.

> * Shares of Tesla, which earlier this month revealed an investment in b/itcoin, fell another 6% in Tuesday’s premarket. The stock sank more than 8.5% on Monday, in its biggest drop since late September 2020. To be sure, other tech stocks also suffered heavy losses Monday. Ahead of trading Tuesday, shares of Elon Musk’s electric auto maker was up just 1.25% this year. However, over the past 12 months, Tesla was up nearly 300%.

*****

> # 4. Home Depot, Macy’s report better than expected quarterly results

> * Home Depot’s fourth-quarter earnings and revenue surged past expectations Tuesday, as consumers continued to invest in their homes due to the pandemic and strength of the real estate market. However, shares dropped on comments from Home Depot’s CFO, questioning how long the pandemic would last and how that may influence consumer spending.

> * Shares of Macy’s rose more than 3.5% in the premarket after the retailer Tuesday morning reported its first quarterly profit in a year. Revenue in the fourth quarter also beat estimates as the company’s efforts to cut inventories during the holiday quarter and rely less on deep discounting paid off. Ahead of Tuesday’s trading, Macy’s shares were up 35% this year, though they struggled over the past 12 months.

*****

> # 5. Electric automaker led by ex-Tesla engineer to go public

> * Electric vehicle maker Lucid Motors plans to go public at an $11.75 billion combined equity valuation through a reverse merger with a blank-check company. The deal between California-based Lucid and C/hurchill C/apital Corp IV is the largest in a series of such tie-ups involving EV companies and special purpose acquisition companies, better known as S/PACs. Shares of C/CIV fell more than 30% in the premarket. But speculation about the deal pushed the S/PAC stock up 470% this year alone. Lucid is led by ex-Tesla engineering executive and automotive veteran Peter Rawlinson.

# Quick Things I'm looking for today

- Powell's speech

# Quick Thoughts

**Companies that sell luxury goods that hold their value are hot right now**

People are scared of inflation and of the stock market. This is old news at this point. So they're looking for other investments, even if it doesn't go up in value, it just needs to beat inflation. Anything that can make them get rid of their dollars.

They're not too happy with gold for some reason (I explain this in the next section). They're trying their hands with beatc01n but that can be a bit risky and too new for some people (old people mostly). So how about alternative investments?

Watches, wine, pens, whiskeys, sneakers, even pokémon cards. Anything, for the love of god take my god damn money!

Oh and when I say people, I'm mostly talking about rich people or anybody with enough disposable income to worry about this stuff.

It happens a lot in the US and in Europe but a place where it might happen much more than usual is China.

You see China has this terrible habit of devaluying their own currency. This helps with exports and with reducing unemployment. But lately, they couldn't keep up with the US (USA Number One!!!) with the trillions poured into the economy. So, right now, China's Yuan is pretty valuable in comparison with the dollar. 

But this will not stay that way, or at least the Chinese government will do everyting in their power to not let that happen. It needs a good economy, low unemployment and overall satisfaction of their population or else their power are in danger. And the devaluation of their currency is one of the sure (very easy) ways of doing so.

So if I was Chinese (I'm not, I'm a martian hiding behind a rock because I've seen an alien coming out of its spaceship, but if I was Chinese), I would buy a lot of watches or anything americans do.

I say ""If I was Chinese"", but again, it's really ""if I had a lot of disposable income and want to diversify my assets to hedge against inflation and currency risks"" and Chinese people are just a more extreme case of this.

So yeah anyway, nice story to say that companies that sell luxury goods *that hold their value* are hot right now because :

- People want to put their money somewhere (really anywhere!)
- Chinese people want to buy US luxury goods to hedge against the devaluation of their currency
- Rich people want to buy stuff that hold their value without the risk of the stock market
- A lot of rich people *made* money during the pandemic and don't know where to put it
- A lot of people are bored and shopping for anything cool (luxury goods being one of those things)


**Might want to short gold**

Gold has been for decades the best hedge against inflation and stock market risks. That's because it's decorrelated from any currency (dollar, euro, yen or the swedish krona if that's what you're into), because there's a fixed supply of it (by gold mining companies) and because a lot of it is stored safely (in Central Banks reserves).

The price of gold is not too volatile either so it's the perfect hedge to diversify a bit. 

Any metal are viewed as an hedge but gold became the standard for it. That's because a lot of currencies were using the gold standard. Not only that drove Central Banks to store a lot of gold and keep it even after they switched to the monetary system we know now (Money printer brrr and all that) but that ""safety"" feeling that gold had back then stayed in the minds of a lot of people. What kept that feeling alive even further was that it's a tangible asset that had a real world use, not just a piece of paper that holds value just because some big entity said so.

So all that to say : Gold is a good hedge against the market and inflation. Except, right now... investors don't want to touch it that much even when the risks are as high as ever! So why? Well... Let's explore those reasons a bit...

*Before that, I want to give a few disclaimers. First, not financial advice ;) but also, this is mostly speculations. While we can have a good idea as to why the market behaves the way it does, gold is mostly driven by the sentiment of a lot of very different investors with very different perspective, strategies and personal risk tolerance. The stock market and other commodities are like that too but fundamentals play a much bigger role for them. Gold on the other hand is mostly a speculative asset. So that's for the warnings. Now let's see what those reasons are.*

First, gold went up a lot at the beginning of 2020. From $1,500 in March to $2,000 in August. That's a nice 33% increase in an insane bull market. People were eager to put their money in any asset (mostly the stock market but gold was nice too). But in August, gold became overvalued and signs started to appear that this bullish sentiment was not sustainable.

Add to that the fact that the Armageddon that investors feared in March didn't actually happen. Investors wisely switched from gold to stonks and other assets.

But stonks are not the only asset that was down a lot during March. Oil too! There was a mix of geopolitics and people staying at home so didn't need gas. Anyway, when all that fear calmed down, investors bought a lot of oil at those very cheap prices. And oil became the commodity of choice for hedging purposes.

Another asset was chosen : beatc01n (you know what I mean). While it didn't have as much impact on gold as oil and stonks, it still probably hurt it a little.

So you might say ""*that's a nice writup buddy, you're explaining the past here, but you said we should short gold now, so what gives?!*"" Well, first, thanks, I put a lot of effort into those posts and it's nice that it's appreciated! But also, all of those reasons still apply today and there's more.

The rising bond yields make T-Bund much more attractive than gold. Much lower risk with a pretty nice ROI. And if institutions want bigger yields, they are probably ok with buying high yield bonds since the FED and governement seem to do everything they can to keep businesses afloat.

Also, a lot of institutions invest in beatc01n making it a more attractive and legitimate investment. That drives the price higher, therefore making it more attractive and so on...

So, if there's no catalyst that shifts this bearish sentiment, this slow downtrend is set to continue.

The biggest catalyst that I can see for gold is that America (and the rest of the world, there's not just america) reopens but if it does, then that means the economy will be much better and investors will buy stonks even more instead of gold.

Another (small) catalyst is that beatc01n becomes very risky again. Institutions will sell and write off those losses (Elon Musk already said he would do that with his Tesla investment). They will probably buy gold again as a result.

So, in my opinion, the bear thesis boils down to : stocks, oil, beatc01n and bonds and other assets being attractive while gold is being forgotten a bit and that might not change for a while while the bull thesis is that a catalyst might change that sentiment.

Ok Bye!"

lqbt54,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lqbt54/the_real_big_short_passive_investing_positive/,"The Real Big Short: Passive Investing, Positive Feedback Loops, and The Massive Ark Bubble",164,138,2021-02-23 14:53:20,"tl;dr: Long Dated ARKK puts and/or debit spreads.

""Shut up gay bear!"" ""Don't short meme stocks!"" ""Cathy will bury you!"" Over the last year, you'd probably be right. However, every single bubble ends the same, it's just the underlying assets and catalysts that vary. You feeling a little bearish? Are you fingers itching to YOLO some puts like last March? Don't short SPY, short ARKK.

This is not a case to short ARKK just because the stocks it holds are too high. Shorting a bubble just bc it's up is a bad time. This is a case to short ARKK because of how it functions as an ETF. For starters, an ETF is essentially a bundle of stocks. You buy ARKK and you indirectly invest in Tesla, Square, Paypal, Zillow, etc. However, the inner mechanisms at work are quite interesting. Every x amount of dollar inflows leads to ARKK buying more shares of its underlying stocks. Why sometimes so are buying ARKK shares from a willing seller, the money usually goes straight to Ark Invest, where it is routed to the underlying shares. People buy ARKK, ARKK has to buy shares of Tesla, Square, etc. to create new ETF units, the stock buys help the ETF price go up, more people want to buy ARKK because it's performing well, so more money flowing into underlying stocks, etc. You see what's happening? More inflows = more buys = better performance = more inflows, and so it repeats. However, stocks only have so many shares, and Ark has more than quintupled its holding sizes in the last year. Ark now owns more than 10% of the shares of several of its portfolio companies. It is difficult for Ark to offload this many shares in a short time if the company wants to rebalance, as it will move the stock price significantly. Ark has since ""diversified"" by buying speculative ""growth stocks"" such as 0 revenue reverse merger plays.

&#x200B;

So what? Well a number of Ark's holdings have increased by 400% or more from last years HIGHS in February, yet the underlying companies are largely unchanged. Tesla's meteoric rise is a prime example. Many of these holdings are now struggling to break out to new highs, and appear to be either consolidating or breaking down. ARKK itself is up 400% from the march lows and 180% from last February, by far outpacing the indices. 

&#x200B;

Ironically, more and more people are talking about Ark now, though it is mathematically much harder for the company to outperform simply due to its bloated size. Combine this with Ark's tendency to largely ignore valuations and hold a number of incredibly pricy ""growth"" stocks, and the stage is set for an unwinding. The FAANG stocks are not massively overvalued, IMO. Apple and Amazon are fine and unlikely to crash. Tesla and other Ark holdings are a different story. Sector rotation is real, and Tesla appears to be falling victim. Other high flyers may soon follow. If and when investors start taking profits on their ARKK positions, the company will be forced to sell  off a portion of the underlying assets. This will cause increased selling pressure on the already sputtering growth names, thus pushing a stock decline. This decline will impact ARKK's price, leading more investors to sell off, thus accelerating a massive reduction in holdings which will continue to tank ARKK's price. Momentum works both up and down, and Ark's illiquid 10% holdings in a number of companies may be its grave as it will be forced to sell off its own positions if outflows begin.

&#x200B;

Maybe it's because we are approaching the one year anniversary of March 2020, but my bear senses are tingling. The high flyers of last year are most vulnerable, and the mechanisms behind ETFs make ARKK a prime target. This is a David and Goliath moment for our gay bears out there, good luck."
lq9ldw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq9ldw/key_upcoming_market_considerations_gme_bonds/,"Key upcoming market considerations, GME, bonds, Powell, stimulus",78,29,2021-02-23 12:50:34,"1. We have been going through a minor correction the last few days due to rapid rising of bond yields and so there will be a lot of focus on Powell's hearing tomorrow and Thursday. My feeling is that Powell will continue to be consistent in his message that his priority is to boost the economy/market and that inflation is not a concern at this moment and that there is no consideration of rising interest rates. If this does happen, I think we will go right back into heavy green the rest of the month. There are a lot of ppl smarter than me on WSB so I'd love to hear contrary opinions or agreements or whatever you all think.
2. Do not expect hedge funds in any shape or form to get punished or held accountable by any government agency. It is all a show. We cannot count on any government incompetent and corrupt officials to do anything to make things fair.  If you need proof, just go back and look at the Bernie Maddoff story. The one Greek financial analyst reported fraud TEN times to the SEC for like 8 years in a row. In some ways, he was kind of like the DFV before DFV, another legend but a different situation. Regardless, the SEC did NOTHING each time. Maddoff was a hedge fund guy operating a HUGE 20B+ ponzi scheme and still the SEC did NOTHING. The only reason he was even actually caught was when the credit crunch caused the ponzi scheme to fall apart and Maddoff turned himself in. The SEC Is a bunch of pansies when it comes to going after the rich. They are owned by the rich. They only come after the smaller poorer people. The other hedge funds new it was fraud too but the only reason they didn't complain was out of fear that their own fraud would be exposed by brining in regulators. The vast majority of hedge funds are all BS and a house of cards. There is no government agencies that will do shit against them ever. We apes/autists/retards are all we have and we must continue to do the work and fight. We must beat them at their own game with better data and better research. This is just a discussion board but its up to each of us individually to make the best decisions that make sense for each of your respective situations. But pay attention to what those hedge funds do, what public info they release, what they are shorting, etc. Beat them at their own game and bang their wives as you are doing it. THAT is the goal. 
3. Despite point #2, there is plenty of hope and I am optimistic about GME. Remember, these hedge funds also shorted Tesla all year long as admitted by hedge fund douche Gabe last week. Surely, they tried manipulation there too in order to artificially keep the price down. But, Tesla was and is too strong. They could not keep it down forever and then they eventually had to pay the price which initiated a whole bunch of short squeezes as Tesla mooned to crazy highs. I'm not saying GME is guaranteed to follow that path but, with some good news from RC and with some solid strategic steps, GME can break out. It just needs some catalysts and then some momentum. Patience is key here for those who truly believe in GME as I do. Earnings is coming up in March and some good news could go a long way in sparking another gamma squeeze. I will point out that, even though Melvin shorted Tesla last year, they still had a very solid year and made a lot of money, I believe I read it was around $500M for 2020 so they will still find other ways to manipulate other things to cover themselves. Whether its using their media puppets, their short reporting buddies like Shitron, short ladders, ETF underhanded shorting or whatever else, they have a lot of shady dirty tools in their bag.  Regardless, when it comes to GME, we can still win this battle if we believe in GME. This is not financial advice and people should only be all in if they believe in GME and can afford to be in it.
4. The stimulus looms large. Congress has estimated a stimulus delivered around March.  Some say it is already priced in but I don't agree.  I think the combination of the stimulus combined with market reopening has the potential to really take this market to record new highs. This however will  not last for the whole year IMHO because inflation concerns will certainly creep up again once we get to the highs.  If my predictions come true and we do get record highs, it will be time to consider the ""Sell in May and Go Away"" philosophy.  I will admit this is prediction is just an estimated guess and I again invite those who are much smarter than me to weigh in on whether they agree with this prediction or things its completely off base. 
5. Mining stocks like MARA and Riot are interesting and I am watching them. Ever since Telsa announced its investment, there has been wild speculation that Apple could follow. Perhaps it is better to just buy the coin instead of the mining companies. That I do not know. I will say that I think it is absolutely a strong possibility that one day these coins will replace the US dollar as the global reserve currency.  Maybe I am just retarded in thinking that but I think its possible.  

That is all I got. I again invite all those who are far  smarter than me to rip apart any of these points or to agree with me or to just comment their expertise. And, most importantly of all, by far, I will end with one thing......I LIKE THIS STOCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
lq8rw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq8rw4/i_think_pltr_is_invincible_rn_and_in_the_long_run/,I think PLTR is invincible rn and in the long run.,660,185,2021-02-23 12:08:25,"So... this could be a bit long, but let me double down  on my thoughts on PLTR. Recently, we’ve seen a little turmoil in the broader market that has scared some growth investors, and I do think there is some justifiable fear.

A lot of folks are going to tell you this is a great discount on names like TSLA or PLUG, and I certainly don’t disagree with them- I just want to have all my bases covered.

Now we have seen some structural shifts in the broader market. The 10-Year shift up to 1.35% is a noticable tick up, and this is something all of us 🦍 have to be wary of.

As much as I like discounts, when the market prices in tighter money, the Fed will have to listen. I believe Uncle Jay will continue to have the market’s back, and I think the 10-Year should be capped at roughly 1.5-2%. We’ll see how this develops, but the bottomline is these forward-looking growth giants are going to get CRUSHED if they miss expectations.

And well, if technology continues to be a deflationary pressure through innovation as we all expect, then 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 regardless and we can cap the discussion here.

So here’s where sweet good PLTR comes into play. I really, really like how they delivered earnings last week. Didn’t REALLY disappoint: beat earnings on a non-GAAP basis and had 45% annual top line growth.

But that’s not even the kicker for me. The fact that PLTR leadership is essentially guaranteeing at least 30% growth over the next 5 years (read the earnings call transcript), which will look like an absolute bonanza if rates actually start to go up.

Now, the thesis is that growth firms’ future profits are less valuable today if rates start to go up, which would not be great for big growth names like PLTR. But then here’s the thing: it would absolutely WRECK mega tech growth like FAANG or the EV/battery state field.

Let’s go back to earnings. Karp and the PLTR team are essentially setting the bar very low, telling investors to sit back and expect ONLY 30% growth for 5+ years. (For boomers, they realize this is fucking crazy btw).

Essentially, if there is any surprise to the upside, which is totally reasonable with a disruptor like Palantir, and this thing will be worth hundreds of billions in the blink of an eye.

But think of how all these great stories came about. Tesla in 2017-2019. Facebook in 2012-2013. Apple in 2008-2009. These tech stars never had a straight shot up, and the same goes for PLTR.

They faced the same problems. I’m only a college student, but I remember for as long as I have been alive from skeptical financial analysts that Tesla was gargantually overvalued and didn’t have the cash to survive in the EV market.

I watched as a kid as some whiz built up a social media platform from his dorm room, but Wall St attacked him for wearing a hoodie to his IPO. Not only did they not think he could expand his platform from PC to mobile, but they questioned how its cutting edge technology differed from Myspace and Tumblr, and wondered if he could ever scale ad revenue. 
He shore could.

Yes, PLTR is overvalued. What isn’t? Snowflake trades for 80X estimated sales. C3.AI trades at 73.5X its 2020 revenues. Salesforce, Splunk, and MSFT ain’t cheap. 

(For reference, PLTR is trading just under 37X 2021 sales, which is lofty, but looks reasonable compared to these other names that have way higher multiples and much less sophisticated/scalable software).

And if we look at it... PLTR was profitable by roughly $0.06/share if you take out a stockholder compensation expense that otherwise would have left them with $100M+ in operating profit. 

Is it profitable? PLTR has 70% fucking margins. How are Finance pricks not creaming over this??? You want high margin/earnings- this is it right here, man.

But no, no, big bad overvalued Palantir want to pay executives/advisors/shareholders extra money. Bad. Bad- I say they worth $20 in equity research reports and on CNBC instead, but still load up behind the scenes 🤮🤡.

Fuck the shills who say Palantir can’t continue robust growth or be profitable. (I am looking at your trend-seeking bots Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley).

On top of that, yes their revenue base is dominated by gov’t clients at roughly 52%, but let’s pause and realize this is a good thing. I mean... i don’t want to get too political here, but broadly, you’re a fool if you think the Dod, DoJ, or CDC/NIAID are cutting back anytime soon, if not looking to HEAVILY EXPAND given the monumental threats we face- geopolitical foes like China, Russia Iran; climate change; police reform; EV adoption/renewables more broadly; 5G and cloud/quantum computing, i really could keep going (amongst all of them, these agencies have dozens of contracts with PLTR worth hundreds of millions of $).

Not too mention PLTR also has massive contracts with numerous EU members and Asian allies like Japan/S. korea, but there’s honestly so many positive examples about how scalable this beauty is both domestically and internationally.

And let’s take what Cathie Wood said the other day on CNBC: roughly along the lines that some of the greatest innovations come from the military. I think we can point to the WWW as a pretty decent example of that.

Given PLTR traces its roots to the CIA’s venture capital arm and loading up on national security contracts with all the intelligence agencies after 9/11, I feel pretty confident that this lengthy history will continue providing much value in revenue AND earnings to PLTR, especially if rates starts to rise.

Furthermore, the cross that bogged Tesla, Apple, FB, and pretty much every mega cap tech company is restraining Palantir right now. The Street wonders if they will be able to continue locking down corporate clients, which it has been rapidly expanding in recent years.

The answer is yes. But Wall St doesn’t want you to think so at the moment. B/c PLTR was a direct listing, they weren’t underwritten by investment banks, and thus don’t receive the same financial shilling that names like Snowflake or C3.AI LITERALLY PAY FEES TO analysts/associates at bulge bracket banks to shill like a damn used ‘98 Honda Accord (and that’s exactly what these other SAaS names are compared to PLTR)

But we always double down on our convictions. If you have seen Palantir’s demos, read its financials, or listened to their CEO, then you know the potential of this company.

I believe in people. I believe in Peter Thiel and his track record. I believe a guy who founded PayPal with Elon Musk, seeded Facebook when no one else would, and decided to seed PLTR w/ the CIA (when no one else would)- yes, I believe he knows what he is doing.

And I believe he is capable of finding talent like Alex Karp and collaborating with him to build an absolute behemoth.

As a conclusion, can someone give me a firm answer on a company that can actually compete with PLTR in terms of solving a complex issue like tracking down Osama Bin Laden or expanding a niche industry into international markets??? And if your only comment is on valuations, see Snowflake (quite the value investment Mr. Buffett ;).

For disclosure, I am very long PLTR and am simply sharing my thoughts. This is not financial advice. And as always, do your own reading/research, but these are the frank sentiments of a PLTR believer.

Now with the lock-up fucking history, PLTR TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Tomorrow, 23 February 2021 is the annual shareholders meeting. This is a good time to take a look at the ""Apple of my eye"", AAPL. Note, this is not an earnings report, but a shareholder meeting. More on that below.


**Upside:**

iPhone Sales - For the first time since 2016, Apple is #1 global smart phone sales. That means Apple has retaken their crown as the smartphone king. And this is all before 5G really takes over. I anticipate Apple iPhone sales to continue to perform well as 5G is rolled out globally. Strong smart phone sales continue to cement Apple as a very stable company, and situates them very well to continue expanding into other areas (hint hint Electric Vehicles).

Low volatility - considering the annual shareholder meeting is tomorrow, I am surprised to see that historic volatility is currently only 10%. This means options are relatively cheap. In my opinion this opens the door for a speculative play here, where we can see call options increase in price due to delta (AAPL stonk price increasing, which has historically performed very strongly) as well as IV (volatility) increase due to speculation. Apple thus far has been relatively quiet on their future plans, and I believe if they hint at any information tomorrow during their shareholder meeting or in the near term, we will be eating tendies 🚀 🚀 🚀

https://amp.ft.com/content/ee13ada3-a66a-4b3a-9def-bb308a800941


**Downside:**

Lawsuit with Epic Games - This is still pending, and currently Epic Games filed a lawsuit against Apple in the EU for ""anti-trust"" reasons related to mobile games and the iOS app store. I am not a lawyer and don't claim to understand what's going on, so I can't speculate on what this would do to the stonk price. It's something to keep in mind when considering your risk tolerance. Historically though it doesn't seem like anti-trust lawsuits have seemed to stop anyone, but I am open to other's thoughts here.


**Electric Vehicle (EV) Speculative Play:** 🚀 🚀 🚀

In my opinion, this is where the largest tendies will come from. There may be a huge speculative play here and I believe the combination of Apple being quiet on the topic while they work on the details (as per their normal playbook) as well as a general market sell off in response to recent market volatility (i.e. funds are selling off their AAPL to shift their gains to other areas to fight the market volatility), means we have a lower price AAPL stonk than I believe it should be. Basically, hedge funds are busy fighting in other areas of the market and can't allocate capital to speculate on Apple and are instead busy fighting the day to day fight in other stonks (GME?).

The Electric Vehicle (EV) play - there have been reports of Apple looking for an EV partner in 2021, and my opinion is I expect news on Apple's EV play over the next 3-6 months, if not during annual shareholder meeting tomorrow. 🚀 🚀 🚀

Of note, Foxconn which is Apples main chip producer, is releasing their own EV (independent of Apple) by EOY. In my view point, this means a major Apple partner who they have an extensive business relationship with already has the infrastructure and equipment in place to support an Apple EV play.

Most recently, Apple has been in early talks with car producers Kia as well as Hyundai. While nothing is official, this is evidence that Apple is exploring the EV market.

But keep in mind, Apple is a technology company so they can provide a car manufacturer partner with EV technology using their top computer science talent. Using existing skill sets and projects already in development, Apple can provide operating systems, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, self driving technology, LiDAR sensors, etc. to the EV space. In my opinion this makes Apple a speculative EV play.


**Financials:**

Sales grew a whopping 72% ($111.5B) in the previous quarter. They spent $5B last quarter on R&D alone. They reported a free cash flow of $73B in 2020 so they’re more than financially capable to pivot in the EV field. I point these numbers out as a reminder of how financially sound Apple is, which in my mind reduces the downside risk of any AAPL plays.

In 2020 the board of directors had a target goal of $265B in net sales and they hit $274B. The operating income target was $61B and they hit $66B. Clearly this board of directors knows how to get results and meet targets.

Furthermore, Free cash flow growth last quarter was 87% or $35B. That’s wild. Apple has the cash on hand to make any EV move they would like to


**What’s happening at the shareholder meeting:**

- Electing directors: reelecting to the Board of Directors: James Bell, Tim Cook, **Al Gore**, Andrea Jung, Art Levinson, Monica Lozano, Ron Sugar, and Sue Wagner;

- Independent accounting firm for auditing

- Advisory vote on executive compensation

- Adding a new shareholder nominated director position (increase from 1 to 2)

- Improve executive compensation program (director’s pay ratio is over 400 to 1 of the average employee)

- Questions and answers by Tim Cook. Will they speculate on the EV play? I believe that any hint of EV will send AAPL price skyrocketing 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀


**Price point:**

$175 base, $225 bull over the next months to EOY


**Positions:**

16 April $125/$130/$133.75 calls, 22 Jan $125 calls


**TLDR: AAPL is a low volatility play with a huge speculative upside, meaning tickets are cheap for the next rocket to Planet Tendies** 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀


**Bonus:**

Al Gore aka man bear pig is a director on the board for Apple.

https://images.app.goo.gl/En2pYet7C5fTUUpS7

The creators of the internet argue that Gore was “the first political leader to recognize the importance of the internet and to promote and support its development.” Clearly Al Gore saw the importance of the internet, and with EV being an environmentally green initiative, I believe he would see the importance of EV. If not developing their own electric vehicle, at the very least providing software/products for other EV players.

This is part 1 of a series aimed at helping you guys have a fighting chance against wallstreet. Remember you are going against the sharpest minds in the world and you will lose. But you have me in your corner and im rooting for you guys, I believe in you

Volume

-A trend that moves on steady volume means that its likely to continue aka price is rising or price is lowering

-Falling volume means that a trend is likely to reverse, whether price is going up or down, it applies to both

-A burst of extremely high volume means that its trend is likely to reverse. Usually when the stock reaches its peak or when all of a sudden it crashes, keep your eye on the volume

-If there is Low volume and the price stays the same, it usually means thats this is the new normal price. People are unfazed by slight price changes here, this is the new normal

-A second price breakout after one just occured is usually marked by yet another high volume spike. It usually means losers are heading for the exit because theyve been bag holding and cant take the pain anymore or bulls are jumping back in

-a price breakout in low volume means that its fake, the price will recoil

-rising volume during a rally(after a stock crashed)means that even though the bagholders are leaving, new losers are coming in

-When volume shrinks during a rally, it means that bulls arent as eager to keep buying at these high prices. Fuel is being removed from this ship. A reversal is imminent 

-When volume dries up during a decline, it usually means a reversal. That is the bears are no longer shorting and the intelligent bulls who got out a long time ago are ready to pounce yet again

-As a rule of thumb, if todays volume is higher than yesterday’s, it means that a trend is likely to continue 

-Volume is relative, what is high for ibm may be low for apple. What is low for apple may be high for ibm

-As a rule of thumb, high volume is 25% higher than the avg volume of the past 2 weeks and low volume is 25% lower than the avg volume of the past 2 week

-High volume confirms new trends. If prices rise to a new peak, and volume reaches a new high, then prices are likely to retest, that is go below the peak and come back to the peak to see if it can exceed it or go back down.

-If a stock falls to a new low, and volume reaches a new high then that bottom will also retest- that is go up and come back down to that bottom to see if it goes even lower or stays there

-the true bottom of a stock occurs on low volume and is always retested at low volume. If it stays the same then this is a great buying opportunity 

-if volume shrinks during an upwards or downwards trend then that trend is ripe for a reversal 

-When a stock reaches a new peak than it was yesterday, but the volume is lower today than yesterday- this is a great shorting opportunity, that is: Now is the time to sell or time to buy puts

- This does not work on a downwards trend as a stock can keep going down even with low volume. It takes buying to move a stock up, but a stock can go down on its own weight

-Watch volume during a reaction against the upward trend(aka panic selling). If the dip continues but volume shrinks, it means bulls are no longer running or selling pressure is spent. When the explosion of selling volume dries up, then it means that the upwards trend will resume. This presents a good buying opportunity or to buy calls

-Many downtrends are punctuated(occurs at intervals) by rallies(price goes up momentarily)which begin on heavy volume. These shake out weak bears which causes volume to shrink and gives a signal to sell short~ this means that short sellers are now sure that the stock will crater because no more rallies

This fucking stock only goes up. The last ten trading days its finished in the green. With earnings coming this week, do you think someone knows something???🚀🚀🚀🚀

Here’s the simple, shitty DD you need to know. 

1. P/E and P/S sell at very low multiples compared to industry peers. (14x  compared to 20-30x). Once earnings crush on 2/24, expect a big move to even out these multiples. 

2. Institutions buying. This is a large safe haven for institutions to park money during all this crazy shit in the market. They also get a sweet dividend as they wait (and so do you). 

3. Acquisition target- I’m not sure if they will ever sell, but the fact that they own content and production on all the biggest streaming networks (apple, Netflix, Amazon) means they will always be in question for acquisition. The multiple should be higher for this reason. 

I could go on and on about how it’s investor day, how it’s shorted heavily by Melvin capital, but I’m writing on my iPhone in my work bathroom. This stock has all the signs. If I were writing a perfect scenario for a stock, this would be it. Hop on the train and enjoy the daily gains

This is common and means nothing but it makes me think they could have better use for those money. Of course there could be a million reasons, maybe just diversification

What I consider special is when insiders buy shares. Ryan Cohen bought GME. And he sold motherfucking Apple to buy GME. He already won his bet in terms of value but fuck me if he planned to make money like this. He had another plan for those money he invested in GME and we didn't see anything yet. That's what could make GME skyrocket in the next years and I don't want to watch this from outside, I want to be part of this

I literally started trading 2 months ago and I know nothing about trading. That's why I mostly base my decisions on what insiders do. And this is why last week I sold my 250 PLTR shares and double down on GME

Yeah well, I just got exactly 4 GME shares so far. I'm planning to buy 50/100 more on Monday depending on the price

Not financial advice, do your research blablabla

Edit: apparently I was wrong about PLTR as Thiel bought back the shares with his company Mithril Capital so I'll be buying it back soon. Current position: 100 x GME

They're lobbying to get more stim $$$ to distressed movie theaters. Lemme summarize what I learned, and also **explain why all this is bullish for AMC.**

**1) What did NATO do?**

\-They successfully lobbied for a $15-billion relief package for indie movie theaters that have suffered a greater than 25% revenue loss. This bill, unfortunately doesn't cover AMC, Regal, and Cinemark.

\-However, NATO lobbied to give tax credits for the aforementioned bigger theaters. This might not sound like a lot, but the tax credit was the only thing that allowed TSLA to have profitable quarters prior to last year. 

\-Also, all theater workers (including at AMC), will have unemployment benefits extended nationwide.

\-As if that's not enough, NATO is continuing to lobby for bigger companies like AMC to receive stimulus money.   


**2) Will Streaming Kill theaters after the re-open?**  
\-This seams to be the #1 concern amongst WSBers and reddit people across different subs. Well, I have a great answer for you: NO.

\-NATO, AMC, Regal, Cinemark  worked out deals with most of the major studios to NOT simultaneously release films online with their theatrical releases post-covid. Theatrical box office windows (and their revenues) will therefore be protected once we officially re-open America.  


**3) Consolidation:**

\-Several thousand least-performing theaters have already shut down. This, for better and worse, will help AMC. NATO actually finds this to be a good by-product of covid, as underperforming theaters have been wasteful for movies that screened in them. It's very likely that AMC and or Regal will buy them out and renovate those theaters.   


4**) Pent-up Demand:**

\-Japan and China have reopened their theaters. Both have had RECORD box office numbers with domestic movies that typically don't beat tentpoles like The Avengers or Batman, etc.   


**5) Unprecedented Pipeline:**

It's ultimately all about the movies. Will the be good, and will you see them?  
I'm pleased to say, 2021 and 2022 will be INSANE. 

Normally, you might have one or two big event movies a year. After March, we have like 1 or 2 tentpole releases every month this year, including but not limited to:  
Godzilla Vs. Kong, Mortal Kombat, Cruella, F9, Uncharted (the movie), Venom sequel, Spider-man sequel, Conjuring sequel, Top Gun sequel, Space Jam (with LBJ), James Bond, Resident Evil and many auteur driven lower budget films by PT Anderson, David Fincher, and Wes Anderson.   


**6) Theaters found more ways to make money:**

\-Also, the closure of the theaters was an opportunity for the bigger theater chains to improve and re-model their outdated systems. 

\-Many rear-projection screens (that require projectionists and expensive projectors) are being replaced by LED screens. 

\-Sound systems are being dramatically improved. 

\-The seats will have tables, suitable for the service of Wine, Beer, and Meals.  


**7) The Craziest (and likely) Scenario:**

\-The Paramount Consent Decrees are being repealed. This decree basically prevented one company from producing and exhibiting films. 

\-NATO is now in talks with Apple, Amazon, and Netflix to screen content in movie theaters.   
Netflix has already bought a number of independent theaters. 

\-There are rumors about AAPL or AMZN acquiring AMC!  John didn't deny those rumors.  


**TL;DR** \- Stimulus has lagged in helping the movie theaters because they were deemed ""non-essential,"" but not anymore. Money's on the way. Also, after we re-open, we'll have one of the most ridiculously popular films released all at once for the next two years, in protected viewing windows in which theaters will not compete with streamers like Netflix and Amazon. On the contrary, Amazon or Apple might acquire theater companies, like AMC and Regal due to the repeal of the Paramount Consent Decrees.

**What do semiconductors do?**

[https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/diode.htm](https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/diode.htm)  
L2Read -   
In short, they are used in chips to make electronics work.

Demand for electronics is at an all time high.  EVs, phones, laptops, gaming consoles, fridges, thermostats, doorbells, toasters - i dont know - everything.  

""The Semiconductor Industry Association [said in December](https://www.semiconductors.org/global-semiconductor-sales-increase-6-percent-year-to-year-in-october-annual-sales-projected-to-increase-5-1-percent-in-2020/) that global chip sales would grow 8.4% in 2021 from 2020′s total of $433 billion. That’s up from 5.1% growth between 2019 and 2020""

That was before Biden's announcement that he will be [signing an executive order to address the chip shortage.](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order) Looking primarily at US companies.

Biden recently announced that he is fearful of China's control of the semiconductor market [And that he will look at US companies for military functions](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/biden-to-order-supply-chain-review-to-assess-us-reliance-on-overseas-semiconductors.html).

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2020/07/30/why-semiconductor-chip-making-based-u-s-critical/5536083002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2020/07/30/why-semiconductor-chip-making-based-u-s-critical/5536083002/)

**Why $ON?**

They make a large array of different components that fit throughout the electronic market.  Unlike AMD or INTC or CRSR - $ON produces components for automotive, personal, medical, cloud, and aerospace and defense.

All of these are important - but the last bit is an important focus.  Because again - Biden is scared of China, and wants to move to become more independent of their chip makers.  ""The White House plans to review gaps in domestic manufacturing and supply chains that are dominated by or run through “nations that are or are likely to become unfriendly or unstable.""

China's biggest semi conductor company TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd.) currently sits with a market cap of $588.98B. $ON is at $16.70B.  TSMC's hegemony over the semiconductor market is hardly surprising, considering that it makes silicon for industry bigwigs such as Apple, Nvidia, and AMD and soon to be INTEL as well.

Well - that was the case - until biden steps in and starts giving incentives to use US semi's and gives companies like $ON $$$$ to expand production capabilities.   Thats a lot of potential clients and revenue.

LONG - this company will do very well.

SHORT TERM - it will see steady growth.  Although - I believe this company will explode as soon as any real steps are taken under biden's initiative.

This has been the biggest weekly inflow since March 2008.

In 2008, after big inflows into the stock market happened, the stock market crashed. Most well-structured conservative portfolios lost one-half of their value. Momentum stocks lost 80 - 95% of their value.



Stock Funds See Biggest Inflows Ever as BofA Warns Top Is Near


BofA’s gauge of market sentiment-- the so-called Bull & Bear indicator-- is approaching levels of extreme bullishness, which can trigger a sell signal that hasn’t been set off since January 2018, according to the note.

Fed knows of the inflation spike and they will have to react



S&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio

In Yale economist and Nobel laureate Robert Shiller’s book Irrational Exuberance, he introduced a price/earnings ratio for the S&P 500 that averages inflation-adjusted earnings over the prior ten year. Today’s Shiller P/E multiples are the highest they have been in two decades. 

Dot com bubble: 44
Today: 35 


Warren Buffett’s favorite valuation metric, a simple ratio of the total U.S. stock market capitalization to annual gross domestic product, effectively gives market watchers a reference point for current prices.

The current stock market value of $42 trillion, compares to annual GDP of $21 trillion. One year after the dot-com bubble popped, Buffett said the unprecedented highs should have served as a strong warning signal. ""If the ratio approaches 200%—as it did in 1999 and a part of 2000—you are playing with fire,"" said Buffett.

Current Buffet Indicator: 195%
Dot com bubble Indicator: 159%


Margin debt balances have exploded on Wall Street, recently hitting an all-time high of $778 billion—nearly 37 times the $21 billion investors held in March 2000. However, the more important metric to focus on is margin debt to cash in customer accounts. It’s currently at 72% more debt than cash, versus 79% at the peak of the dot-com bubble. Speculation is contagious


Among stock market indicators the put/call ratio measures the weekly volume of put options, which are purchased when investors think stocks will fall, divided by the call option volume, contracts purchased by bullish investors


Currently the put/call ratio is 0.4, nearly identical to the 0.39 it registered in March 2000, at the peak of internet stock buying mania.


S&P market-cap concentration is at an all-time high, making index-tracking funds, which represent trillions of dollars in market value, extremely vulnerable to swings in just a few companies. 

Today, the top five—Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla and Facebook—make up 21% of the index’s total market capitalization, even more than the 18% of market value commanded by the five biggest in 2000, when Microsoft, Cisco, General Electric, Intel and Exxon Mobil were on top. 

Is this it? The end is near?

This isn't a squeeze - it's a bank run.",1852,1087,2021-02-15 01:28:49,"The U.S. Mint just admitted [they can't print enough](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-precious-coins-demand/us-mint-unable-to-meet-demand-for-gold-silver-bullion-coins-idUSL1N2K82XU) silver and gold coins to meet demand. CNBC has it wrong - this didn't start with WSB. People are losing faith in the dollar and wanna hold fucking metal.

You don't think there's a shortage? Go try to buy a 1,000 ounce bar of silver. Google it. If you happen to find a dealer who isn't out of stock, you'll be paying an insane premium over the spot price.

I'm not gonna get into all the silver manipulation conspiracies. Let's stick to Retard Economics 101: if there's a shortage of the good it means the price is too damn low.

Because of the differential between the physical spot price of silver, and the futures price in the COMEX there's an arbitrage: Anybody with any serious cash today could take silver delivery from the COMEX at $27, and quickly flip it for well over $30. Futures deliveries last year were already at a record:

But the amount of folks standing for March delivery might just break the bank... because there's just not enough Silver to deliver to everyone who wants it. That's why (as another WSB post already detailed) The SLV ETF amended their prospectus to basically say [we can't actually get the silver that we need.](https://twitter.com/BullionStar/status/1360703958029905921)

If silver futures start creeping up, this thing could completely snowball. Because those industrial consumers of silver - Tesla, Apple, Medical stuff - absolutely cannot afford to have their production lines shut down for a month because of one input, and will pay anything to make sure they get those 1k bars in hand.

How to make tendies? Look what happened to AG and SILJ a few weeks ago when Silver went up 9%. Those two tickers FLEW. Buy calls on them for July if you're responsible, April if you're a degenerate gambler.

How to do your part and make sure the squeeze happens? Buy PSLV. That fund is going to actually take delivery of 1,000 ounce bars on your behalf.

Positions: $PSLV shares, $AG July calls, strike 20,  $SILJ August calls strike 25.

DON'T BUY $SLV

EDIT: I received a message from a smart dude suggesting that this news actually means that $SLV is vulnerable, and buying it is also a direct way to create tightness in the silver market. Could be. Don't know. Good luck out there. "

Before Covid supply chain was running smooth as a glove, think of it as a highway full of cars flowing at exact same speed and spaced equally. This supply chain was being perfected for over a decade. And then this shitstorm happened. The highway is clogged, ships are standing loaded with crap they cannot effectively unload quick enough, there aren\`t enough ships to move products that are needed. Including basic materials for industries and intermediate components to make a final product.

For those who don\`t know, there is an absolute chip shortage in the market right now. Spanning from AMD/NVDA CPUs and GPUs, to auto chips, to new consoles, and any kind of electronics. Even AAPL will have sales issues this quarter caused by the chip shortage.

The main chip producer TSMC is ramping up CAPEX to $28 billion, including $12 bn for their US plant.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead) 

The perfect storm is brewing for NVDA and AMD to gain enormously from this market, but in my opinion AMD will end up with upper hand, let me explain.

&#x200B;

1. Back in 2017/2018 year old GPUs were selling over on Amazon and elsewhere for double their MSRP. These were old graphic cards! their price should have depreciated over time, but didn\`t. Why? Cause of B T C. Miners were buying that shit by bulks. Guess what? We\`re at the exact same situation right now, except that price of that thingy is now $50k! and with new cards being more cost effective you wouldn\`t be able to buy ANY right now even if you wanted it to simply upgrade your PC and play something. As a matter of fact try to buy GTX 10xx or RTX 20xx gen on Amazon, there are NONE! So its not only the latest gen that\`s unavailable, its ALL of them. And CPUs have the exact same problem, which wasn\`t so bad in 2018. And soon you might find it impossible to buy even any laptop having latest chip: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156)
2. Not long ago NVDA announced $40 bn acquisition of ARM which would ensure they have access to state of the art IP which would make them future chip behemoth, and not surprisingly the largest companies in the world are now lobbying against that [https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns) . With this in mind, its becoming increasingly likely the acquisition wont go through. On the other hand, AMD replied with the acquisition of XLNX which seems wouldn\`t be such an issue considering AMD is way smaller than NVDA or INTC.
3. AMD and QCOM are actively lobbying US gov to address the issue, which they will. What to expect? Quite likely to remove previous trade policies regarding chips - resulting in easier access and higher/cheaper volume of chips being produced overseas. Which would mean AMD can ramp up production and meet the huge current demand of data centers and whoever needs their GPU. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage) . 
4. Price action - stocks follow certain pattern. They kinda wobble within some range for long period of time, 6-18 months, this is where a lot of accumulation by big players happen, and fundamentals kind of crystalize. Once the conditions are right, the stock can shoot 50% in a span of a month and then hover on new level for considerable time. Look at the chart of TSLA 2015-2019, NVDA numerous times, AMZN, GOOG, etc. Right now, NVDA is up already 20% in the last month. I believe the market will look from NVDA to AMD very soon, given points 2-3 and major holders wont be willing to sell for current price.

To recap what is the perfect storm. In 2017/18 chip shortage was caused mainly by A. the thing we dont mention here, right now its also B. new consoles cant be produced fast enough, C. supply chain issues which might be resolved soon, C. simply way bigger improvement in new CPUs/GPUs hence new upgrade cycle coupled with corporate upgrade cycle due to COVID

This campaign has been largely led by large hedge funds. Without S&P inclusion, the story might have ended there with hedge funds trying to escape with their profits and leaving retail the bag. However, S&P inclusion presented these hedge funds with a much better option to close out their positions while also riding the stock down. The shares that hedge funds no longer wanted began to be picked up by passive funds leading to selloffs by the active funds which pushed prices to this level.

With passive funds holding the bag, the hedge funds which lead the rally seem to be attempting to push the price back down through a reverse gamma squeeze^(2).

No retail trader is buying 1m+ in deep OTM puts, this is an attempt by hedgies to push the price down.

We can also see this from the massive shift in options volume. $190B of calls open interest and over $250B of puts open interest, a massive put skew. This is especially significant because ""To put it in context it is equal to the combined $AAPL and $AMZN bullish skew or if you’d rather to the combined  $BABA, $FB, $MSFT, $GOOG and $WMT combined."" reflecting extremely bearish sentiment in an very very bullish market.

Once the reversal begins there will be nothing stopping it as OTM puts get less and less OTM. There are no shorts left to be squeezed and the bag holding passive funds which are largely barred from holding derivatives will have no way of rebalancing the options skew.

I know these are difficult times for this sub and it’s almost impossible to post something solid which is not about the current meme stocks.

Instead of jerking to some porn i did some research on PLTR and want to share my DD with you. This might be a longer text for your love dopamine level so maybe you should grab some your Adderall before.

The following text might you give your eyes aids since English isn’t my native language. I will try my best.

**Palantir as a Company – the beginnings**

PLTR was founded by some people and one of them is Peter Thiel who worked alongside with our holy papa Elon at PayPal. As a payment-service they had concerns about money laundering and founded PLTR to tackle this issue early. The CIA also funded PLTR (they are always funding stuff like this – Siri as example). This actually might be the reason why people think that PLTR is a company which aggregates data and do data analysis for the government….but this is not accurate and not correct at all if you see the big picture. I will explain this point later.

You retard still reading? Nice here some rocket emoji’s to pump your dopamine and keep you happy. 🚀🚀🚀

Let’s start with the DD

First of all my POV is looking for a midterm to long term investment in PLTR. My valuation considers PLTRs current state and predicting from now on for the next few years.

&#x200B;

* **1. The Management**

Before I start with the product I rather start with the management. You can sell the nicest thing in the world. I can guarantee you that the product definitely won’t be considered as the nicest thing after a while if you have a shitty management (Intel). With Peter Thiel on the leaderboard we got a competent asshole and CEO is Alex carp (co-founder) Peter Thiel is well known and Alex Karp is one of us. He yolod his heritage into some business and become a chad. Seriously tho, I trust Peter and if Peter holds on Alex since Decades so do I. Peter proved so many times how cunning he is and showed how to pick adapt problems early and create solutions.

&#x200B;

* **2. PLTR Business model/ products**

Before we understand how important PLTRs products are we have to understand that we are simpeltons who don’t have any business with PLTRs. We create data. We don’t fuck with it. We creating with using our phones or working in the office. Only a few of us may working with accumulated big data. PLTRs customers’ base isn’t neighbor Joe or Aunt Nancy. The products they offer are not even for midcap companies they are more designed for whole industries and governments. That’s the reason why their products aren’t so tangible for many people.

PLTR basically offers systems to big companies/governments which import their data into these systems. PLTR doesn’t sends workers to the client to collect data and analyse it. They sell platforms. They got 2 Products called “Gotham” and “Foundry” You may think wtf is this guy talking about? Let me explain it in 2 examples:

First example is Syria with Gotham. It was impossible in the country to know who the good guys are and who the bad ones are. I know u muricans only know yourself and the rest of the world is the “rest of the world” for you. But this wasn’t so simple in Syria you had many factions with different intentions and some of them were allies and some of them were enemies. The lack of information or the ability of recognizing and sorting these information’s are crucial in a war. PLTR solved the struggle with creating a map which provided resilient information for the marines so they can operate safely. Civil problems over there could also be fixed.

[https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/)

Actually what the John Hopkins University does with the covid numbers and the map, is some sort of what PLTR offering with their solutions. There are rumors that the tracking of Covid and the vaccination will be done by PLTR.

In their S1 Form PLTR describes it this way

“Gotham, our first software platform, was constructed for analysts at defense and intelligence agencies. They were hunting for needles not in one, but in thousands of haystacks. And they did not have the software they needed to do their jobs. In Afghanistan and Iraq, soldiers were mapping networks of insurgents and makers of roadside bombs by hand. Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps U.S. and allied military personnel find what they are looking for.”

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406\_11](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406_11)

The second example is about “Foundry” and it’s directly from the S1 File of PLTR (page 121)

“An Airbus A350, for example, has five million parts and is built by hundreds of teams that are spread across four countries and more than eight factories. Companies routinely struggle to manage let alone make sense of the data involved in large projects. Foundry was built for them. The platform transforms the ways in which organizations interact with information by creating a central operating system for their data.”

Both of these systems solving big issues with less effort. The arms industry as example would took billions for drones and stuff in Syria for the same job. The important fact is that PLTR does not spend so much resources for new clients they only have to provide access and support for their services and the client feeding the “machine” with data.

The key point is to understand that PLTR benefits very huge from economy of scales. This is very important since their costs for additional revenue is basically flat while the profits growing exorbitant with new customers. They offer a software and platforms and not kind of services where they need man power. All they do is working on their platforms and improving it.

* **3. PLTRs big issue during the last decade**

Peter Thiel was a great supporter of Trump and funded his elections campaign. The market thought that when trump wins then PLTR will get all the government (especially military) contracts.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html)

But this didn’t happened. Peter got cucked by the huge authority apparatus in pentagon. These dudes loves bureaucracy and they do it for a good reason. If you retire from your job in pentagon you usually get a high paid luxurious position at Lockheed, Raytheon or Bae Systems to make additional free money for your retirement. Many thousand people working in pentagon just to select and buy stuff for the government. They spending billions of dollars for purchases and then PLTR came around and said like „look guys we can do this job for a few millions instead billions“. Of course the arms industry was pissed and the pentagon boomers helped them out. PLTR got constantly scammed from boomers and didn’t get the contracts. This was also the „swamp „trump was talking about.

A fun fact to this matter: Before James Mattis got summoned as the Defense Secretary of the USA he was a general in Afghanistan. He ordered services from PLTR despite the fact the pentagon was against it. But the marines praised PLTRs software and valued it over the trash they used to know from the defense/arms industry.

Even with a James Mattis as the defense secretary, trump as president and regardless that PLTR does it better and cheaper than the arms industry, it wasn’t possible for PLTR to get the government contracts.

[https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373)

[https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/](https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/)

How it’s ended? Well Peter’s wife doesn’t have a boyfriend because Peter is the fucking boyfriend of their wifes. All ended at the court and PLTR won. All this injustice ended at the court. The judgements on these cases are true circuit breakers for PLTR. Not only because PLTR spent shit tons of money for law suits. The lawsuits were perfect uppercut hits on the arms industry and they ended some fraudulent behaviors and „best practices „in the government

[https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/)

PLTR will profit from a Biden who wants to decrease the military expenditures. They will get the job done and at the same time the costs will go down. With the recent judgements the door looks open.

&#x200B;

* **4. Valuation problems**

I could spam some multiplication on revenue or even a DCF but I think it’s not necessary. Expect the costs of research and development (maybe marketing) the costs of PLTR stood mostly flat in the last quarters. It’s a growth stock and the pricing is mostly in the perspective of PLTR. This is actually all we need to know that the revenue increases while the costs staying mostly flat. Check out the balance sheets at page 12 on the S Form 1.

Let’s talk about the market. The whole market seems overpriced but it isn’t tbh. Due to the low cost of capital there is no alternative than to throwing your money on stocks or on real estate. There is nothing with a solid interest rate around (not even in emerging markets). At the stock exchange like in 70s, the companies had to offer a return, a perspective which should be more attractive as putting your money on a saving account with 8% interests without risks. These times are gone since the 2000s. So before people discuss insane valuation they should check out the fiscal and economical policies.

Now back to PLTR and why the price is difficult to set (cheap imo). First of all PLTR did a direct listing without an investment bank for their share offerings. Its lacking of the valuation which they usually would get through such a process.

PLTR wanted to do IPO with Morgan Stanley but it was mess.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears)

Morgan Stanley proved themselves many times as stubborn communists when it comes to valuations. I mean you guys remember their disgusting price targets for tesla like 100$ post split or stuff like that.

These guys are very focused on numbers and I know it’s difficult to price in the potential and perspectives. But you can’t ignore these things for a fundamental valuation. If you want to consider these things in the price you have to understand the business of the company.

This ended that one team at Morgan Stanley valuated PLTR with 5 billion while another team thought they worth 40 billion.

[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html)

How is this difference possible and why is this happening? Because people don’t understand what they are valuating. This happened a lot in the last decade because the decision makers in these banks and many analyst don’t have any idea which metrics they should use on companies like that. They are using the metrics from classical industries on new business. They freaked out when Facebook was valued with 100 billion as IPO. Same with Twitter and in the last years it was Tesla. They said apple going to tank every damn year in the last decade. I honor Warren Buffet so much since he has the dignity to realize that he don’t understands something but at the same time he sees the potential and the trend. That’s why he hired 2 Chads who bought Snowflake for him. The transformation and the generation change didn’t happened yet. That’s why they try to use the metrics from Caterpillar on Tesla.

Guys the whole market is mooning with the cheap liquidity. Pennystocks and zombie companies transforming into billion dollar market cap companies. Facebook as IPO had a market cap of 104 billion back in 2012. At that time it wasn’t possible for Facebook to monetize their users with selling ads. They just paid 100 billion for the potential in more difficult market conditions.

Look at the IPOs like doordash, Bumble. I’m not going to call this a bubble. Just check out their business cases and use the metrics. Maybe its easier for people to understand Bumble and Doordash…

On page 12 of the S1 (balance sheet) Form you can already see the huge positive trends in PLTRs revenue and their costs. All this without all the positive events and contracts PLTR recently got.

PLTRs valuation is difficult and I think it’s miscalculated by pessimistic communist who don’t understand that their products are game changers for industries, governments and defense forces. Because of these points I think there is huge price potential for PLTR

&#x200B;

* **5. Risks for PLTR**

Despite the general market risks PLTR mentions at page 29 of the S1 Form the competitors as the main risk: “We face intense competition in our markets, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.” The S1 Form didn’t aged well. Actually I don’t think that PLTR would have any trouble with offering new shares. Also with Peter Thiel as one of the founders the financial side should be stable.

As PLTR competitor people use to mention IBM. The boomers from IBM already surrendered with their Windows95 computers and decided to cooperate. The biggest threat would be big tech with big money like AMZN or APPL. You all now the stories about APPL and Spotify or AMZN and all the merchants. Even if the big players would step into PLTR markets it would be difficult for them since PLTRs products doesn’t rely on an Amazon store or on apple devices. PLTR is years ahead with their products.

I think the greatest risk (still) are the boomerish arms industry and all the boomers in pentagon and other authorities.

There are very corrupt infrastructures when it comes to decision making and assigning contracts. People fear changes but they can’t avoid the changes. With the recent judgements we can see a turn on the tables but the transformation will still take time. It’s a circuit breaker with an avalanche effect.

The risk factors on page 16 on the S1 form mostly aren’t relevant anymore. People complained that PLTR wasn’t profitable for 18 years. Well PLTR was never designed to be profitable and Alex Karp once said “love us or leave us alone”.

[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html)

But even this changed recently. PLTR became profitable in 2020 with 130,000,000§. Now the same people complaining about how high the stock price compared to the profits. Well just you wait.

&#x200B;

* **6. Conclusion and Outlook**

If you still reading I have to admit that this was a lot text and i am sorry again about the lingo. Let’s connect the dots and bring this information to a point

1. The boomer coalition in the pentagon and in the arms industry is taken down by PLTR. They will able to get the governments contracts and the classic arms/defense industry is no match for PLTR products. The judgements of lawsuits were catalyst and the effects should be already shown in the next earnings. These were such underrated events but I think there still will be some odds but PLTRs situation is much better as it was a time ago. The chains are off!
2. Military expenditures rising worldwide

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qqcv8vzee4h61.jpg?width=744&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98d264f091b7ff80926038660f43c57b87fc8ef2

[https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion)

With Bidens presidency we will see more disruptive technologies chosen by the government. Biden want to reduce the military expenditures. PLTR is able to provide better service for lower cost. Not only the recent judgements also the political change will help PLTR. Ironic if you remember that Peter supported Trump and getting his tendies from Biden.

3. PLTR superior products profits hugely from economy of scales. They don’t have any significant costs when they acquire new customers. Making the big data usable for decisions making is already very important and step by step people realize that this issue growing fast. We creating everyday more data than we did yesterday and leaving the majority of it as trace and unstructured data. We don’t work with it but big Institutions does.

Here is the passage from the S1 and I fully agree with it:

“The systemic failures of government institutions to provide for the public — fractured healthcare systems, erosions of data privacy, strained criminal justice systems, and outmoded ways of fighting wars — will continue to require both the public and private sectors to transform themselves. We believe that the underperformance and loss of legitimacy of many of these institutions will only increase the speed with which they are required to change.”

4. PLTRs value. The current situation of the market with tons of liquidity seems like a bubble. People don’t know what to do with the cheap capital and people throwing it even on meme pennystocks.

Facebook had his ipo back in 2012 during much harder market conditions as now. The valuation of Facebook was over 100 billion and people called it insanely overvalued. They did it because Facebook didn’t had a way to monetize their users (especially on mobile platforms). Facebook has a market cap of over 750 billion now and nobody calling it over valued.

A remember the recent examples? Bumble?! Bruuuh. Don’t get me wrong if you invested in Bumble but they have nothing special to offer and their business case can easily copied or improved by others. Its shows the current state of our market with the crazy liquidity that even zombie companies got astronomic valuations. Use these metrics on PLTR with great products, great management, low cost base and less odds as ever before….

PLTR price is wrong imo especially in this market and with PLTRs current state and perspective.

5. Do you use PLTR? Me Neither! It’s not designed for us and we have to inform us about the success. PLTRs new contracts and their future are shining bright. With the settled lawsuits the sky is clear for PLTR. But their customer base is not only America. I’m not a murican and 3 weeks before I just find out that the police departments in our state using PLTR products. I don’t need to link endless evidences here since you can google it by yourself and see how many contracts PLTR recently got. Especially after the circuit breakers we talked about.

I have genuinely trust into Peter Thiel and Alex Karp that their will make the best of PLTRs potential. The odds getting removed and the demand for PLTR is increasing.

If all these information would priced in correctly we would have a share price of at least 60-70$.  With upcoming and ongoing positive events PLTR share price should soar more..

**What’s next?**

Now we have earnings ahead and the lock up period ending.

For the earnings I think the number will be fine and keep up the positive trend on revenue with a disproportionately trend of the costs. The most important part will be guidance for 2021. We should listen closely and see if the magic is already happening.

The second event is the ending of the lock up period. You all remember the end of the lock up period of Nikola? Just 1-2 days after they announced they don’t got the GM deal? The stock tanked – for a good reason. You know the guy Trevor Milton.

But in PLTRs case everything is different. Despite the successful deals they got, does a guy who says “love us or leave us alone” sounds like someone who going to drop his shares at the first possibility? I don’t expect such a behavior from Alex Karp and neither from Peter Thiel. If some employees drop their shares it should be fine.

I would appreciate if the stock prices would go below 3ß. It would create a healthy bullish chart pattern and would be actually a nice discount to get in or stock up. I don’t think that the shares going to dump a lot because of this event. The earnings and the guidance are more important and the key events if you want to invest mid – long term.

What does all this means for you? Nothing! Please don’t do any market activity based on my DD. I’m just sharing my knowledge and looking for critics so I can reevaluate my theses. This is not a financial advice.

My hearts bleeding for all the GME holders. My last Reddit account got banned because I criticized “the pumpers”. In one of the comments I called the mods gay and got banned permanently (bye bye 20 k karma). If you are new to this please don’t do any decision based on this so I can sleep gladly.

I’m not well positioned and not trying to pump this stock. I have 70 shares and a CSP. Fair play and fuck all the bots and pump and dumper we recently got in the sub!

Leave an upvote if this post helped you. I need some more karma to be able to shitpost everywhere again!"

I present to you The Curious Case of Benjamin Butto....err Black Berry. ($BB),396,112,2021-02-13 00:48:09,"Listen up reta.....err, I mean memelords.   I know we’ve all moved on from the meme era into the weed era (and  hopefully people stick around that one due to the fundamentals for a  while, but if not....) and soon to be a redux of the vehicle era, but  there’s one meme stonk we need to have a real, honest heart-to-heart  about (and hey, it even ties into cars):  Let’s talk about Blackberry  ($BB)

# First,  let’s get some misconceptions out of the way: 

&#x200B;

Blackberry was never a  short squeeze stonk, even though it ended up getting roped in with the  other squeezers we were denied squozing  because of Wall Street cheating.  A lot of people thought it was and  that’s simply not the case.  Blackberry was, is, and always will be, a  phoenix rising from the ashes story, nostalgia peppered with  functionality.  You know, kind of like how you sometimes go watch some  classic porn to beat off to and don’t stop to think about the fact that  the actress is now in her 60’s and probably has super saggy tiddies.

Next  misconception:  It’s not a Boomer mobile phone company.  They don’t  make phones anymore – phones that are branded with their logos are made  by another company that pays licensing for the logo and some of the  patents.  Blackberry sold all their mobile patents months ago.

Third misconception:  No matter how much we ask,  they’re never changing their name back to Research in Motion so that we  can talk about Rim-jobs.  Sorry, just isn’t going to be a thing.

So  what are they?  It’s simple really:  They’re now an enterprise level  software security company.  When you think about it, it’s not such a big  pivot, given that their security encryption in their heyday was so  powerful that they ended up having to set up offices in certain nations  because it was impossible to crack and ran afoul of certain  international laws.

# Let’s take a dive into the financials before we get into the story:

At the time of this writing, BB is a 7 billion dollar  company with shares trading in the $12.50 range.  Even after the meme  war collapse, they’re still worth double what they were when the ball  dropped in New York City with absolutely nobody watching in person and  everybody at home wondering why even Anderson Cooper was using an autotuner.   They generate a hair over a quarter billion dollars in revenue each  quarter over the last year and in 2020 had a negative EPS of about 32  cents a share as they retooled, though they trimmed that to .23 cents a  share for their last quarterly earnings report.  They have about a  billion dollars in cash on hand and receivables, and they have about  half a billion dollars in debt.  It’s not a great fiscal outlook there,  but it’s certainly manageable for a growth company (which is what they  presently are).

# Where do they make their money?

Almost  half of their revenue is legacy income from selling endpoint management  and secure communications licensing.  A third of their revenue comes  from licensing their patents.  Oh, they also own Cylance, for you IT  help desk monkeys.

**That shit’s pretty boring, not gonna  lie.**  Your wife’s boyfriend might find it interesting, but only because  he can use it to laugh at you that you know this shit.  But the rest?   The rest is where things get interesting.  Blackberry Radar is a fleet  management solution, and the most interesting thing is....well, for  that, we have to go back in time for a moment:

# (Wayne’s World flashback/dream noises)….

July 29th,  2017.  Las Vegas Nevada.  50,000 of the world’s most feared hackers  descend upon Sin City for a weekend of debauchery, drinking, and talking  about all the new and interesting ways they found to break shit or in  general cause chaos - aka DefCon 25, which was NOT cancelled, contrary to what you might have been told.  A young hacker from Wisconsin positively stuns  everybody at a panel by revealing how it is that he found he could  effectively hack almost every late model vehicle on the road that  possessed connected features – from range and while the vehicles are in  motion – using.....music  theory.  It’s an absolutely stunning revelation, something matched only  by how terrifying the implications of it are.  And all anybody needed  was a $300 RF modulation tool.  Using this, he found he could take  control of every mass produced  car on the market except those made by Volkswagen Group and Tesla, and  those only because they had randomized frequencies they used.  This guy  fucked.  This process was so dangerous that, for one of the only times  in DefCon’s history, they didn’t publish the how-to publicly.  Oh, and a  team from a then relatively unknown EV company in China called $NIO won  the car hacking capture the flag tournament in less dramatic fashion.   If you didn't hear about any of this, it's because you were too much of a square to be there.  Sucks to be you, chump.  Something had to be done.

# Enter Blackberry

I’ll  spare you all the things that have happened since then, but what you  need to know is this:  Blackberry came up with a solution to defend  against this and a myriad of other problems (not to mention Europoor  compliance in the form of ISO 26262) not to mention autonomous security  - and their security software suite (QNX) is now on almost every new  car rolling off a factory line today.  This software is also critical  for EV’s, because it controls battery management ECU’s (that’s the shit  that makes it so you don’t have to drop 10 grand on a new power plant every 2 years).  Or, for those of you with IQ’s of 60:  Computer make car gooder.

# OK, so that’s cool.  But how does this get me TENDIES, man?  How much can these guys make?

They’re  coy about this and won’t give hard numbers, but there are ways we can  estimate what they’re pulling.  But to do that, we need to go back in  history again, and take a look at a stock nobody cares about

# (More Wayne’s World noises)

Enter:   Nuance Communications ($NUAN).  You’ve probably never heard of these  guys, but you and almost everybody you know has used their products at  some point.  They used to be best known for their Dragon Naturally  Speaking software suite, which your grandparents who decided they were  too old to figure out how to use a fucking keyboard bought so that they  could talk to their computer and send you messages that you hated  getting unless it came with a 20 dollar  bill, but which they thought you cherished forever.   However, at some  point around 2010, IBM – whom the Nuance CEO at the time was close  friends with the management of, literally just \*gave\* about 125 patents  around voice recognition to Nuance thinking that they were worthless.   Nuance took these patents and – for a brief moment – became one of the  coolest techs on the planet, because their tech is what made Apple’s  Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, Samsung’s whatever it was  called and a billion other voice recognition platforms work.  That is,  until Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Steve Ballmer, and everybody else Nuance  was dumb enough to trust to let look under the hood of their secret  sauce came along and all stole the IP to made their own platforms, leaving  Nuance rotting in a hole in the desert.  But one of the really cool  things Nuance expanded into before they went full retard was  they bought a couple of companies around 2013 or so– Tweddle and some  other company I can’t be bothered to look up – and got into the  connected car space.  At one point, Nuance’s Dragon Drive virtual  assistant was in every new car made by 9 of the world’s top 10 auto  makers.  

# OK, dude, my wife’s boyfriend is asking me to bring him a beer.  Can you speed this along?  What does this matter?

It  matters because we can look at what $NUAN was getting in licensing for  putting their virtual assistant in these vehicles, and use that data to  extrapolate an estimate of what $BB is getting for their software.  With  just their 9 car makers at their back, they were generating over 300  million dollars a year – and that was almost a decade ago, and just for  something that would tell you where to pick up your Down’s Syndrome  medication. Add a premium for security, include all the auto makers,  carry the one, smoke a bowl to help you concentrate, adjust for  inflation.....

This  is a market worth about...oh, roughly 750 million dollars a year for  Blackberry on the conservative side once they actually start charging a  market rate for this product.   Right now, they’re adopting the same  go-to strategy Microsoft has been employing with Azure, which is to  basically GIVE it away in order to gain market share and penetration,  and then send Fat Tony to collect once the car maker is reliant on it.  Plus  all the other stuff we already glossed over because it’s boring as  shit.   Applying the average multiple of earnings for cybersecurity  firms out there, their lack of competition in the space, etc. And you  come up with a market cap valuation target of....oh,  roughly between 45 and 50 billion dollars once they’re firing on all  cylinders.  And they don’t have to worry about Google or Apple throwing  10,000 engineers at this to make a competing product, because it’s just  not worth it to them, so they’re largely gonna get left alone.  

Or, by using maths....a  share price of somewhere in the neighborhood of $87.50.  Give or take  10 bucks.  Make it 15 to the downside, just to be safe.

# Yeah man!  Cool.  So I’m in.  It’s gonna go to that by like, Friday or something?

An enterprise level cybersecurity company with a sub 10 billion dollar valuation is basically unheard of in this century.   But this is not a burn play where you’re gonna  get 50% gains every day with no work.  It’s a company that’s going to  have to melt up to that.  It still won’t be to that point this time next  year. 

BUT....that  doesn’t mean it doesn’t have a great story.  It just means that this  isn’t something you do a 0DTE YOLO on and expect to get something out  of.  And making an Avengers meme about it isn’t going to send it to the  moon.  This is something you buy and stash in a musty corner of your  portfolio so you can tell your Boomer parents that you’re being  responsible with your investing and you were just joking about betting  your inheritance on weekly FD’s for shitty online dating sites where the women have to talk to your sorry ass first.   Oh, and it’ll make the lambo you buy with the money from this safer.

Because I know it matters, here are 69 rockets so you apes understand what all this meant.

.....no, there aren't going to be any rockets.  I lied.

Disclosures/Positions:  I am long $BB, holding 100,000 shares @ $7.67 average and another 5000 January 2022 5c’s.

# TL:DR:  $87.50

Every huge company in the world is missing semiconductors: ""companies like Apple, Qualcomm, Sony, and AMD have all cited shortages in recent weeks, with effects ranging from part shortages for iPhones to the incredibly hard-to-find nature of the PlayStation 5 or AMD’s newest CPUs and GPUs. But in today’s increasingly connected world, a shortage of semiconductor chips impacts not only traditional technology industries, but also a wide-ranging list of other industries. Numerous automotive companies — including Volkswagen, Fiat Chrysler, and Toyota — have been forced to temporarily suspend vehicle production over the past several months. And Ford just announced that it would be pausing manufacturing on its most lucrative F-150 trucks earlier this month in the wake of chip shortages.""

All these companies are just begging for more semi-conductors, and $ON and others are almost completely out. When production starts ramping up again the huge demand will increase their earnings even more: THIS IS A LONG AND SHORT PLAY.

I'm getting ready to buy shares and a few LEAPS.

$ON destroyed its earnings call and is ready to fly once this news gets bigger.

These last few weeks have been bizarre in terms of the stock market and it has left me at a complete lost as to what ""up & coming"" companies to put my money on at the moment. I am feeling that I would like to outline my running thesis as to what has been going on.

The GME gamma squeeze has changed a whole lot. Probably this is just a short term distrubance, though it could be a continual change, I really don't know.

\*\*So what has happened?\*\*

\*\*Part 1 - Gamestop\*\*

Gamestop and its prophesied gamma squeeze awoke the hoard. Tens, if not hundreds of thousands of newby traders exploded out onto the freshly burgeoning retail trading platforms to take advantage of the promise of riches beyond belief.

You see a rumour began to spread that the ruling financial elites had gotten greedy, they had over extended, and trapped themselves in an unwinnable situation. How lucky we all now were. We simply needed to buy up these shares and we would soar to the moon carried by a rocket, powered by the elites lost money. It was irresistible. It was a promise not only of immense wealth, but also of destroying those that had destroyed others so many times.

This, of course, didn't end as most people expected. The elites escaped their fate. The early traders made millions, most won minor amounts and some lost more then they could.

\*\*Part 2 - The Fallout\*\*

So, suddenly the market had become open to a hoard of fresh traders that had gotten a taste, a teaser of what they could make from a hobby in stock trading. They had only two questions on their mind ""What stocks are the next GME?"" & ""Which of these winning stocks can I afford and win the most?"".

These two questions inevitably led them to one place... THE PENNY STOCKS! (also stocks under about $30) Though, most of them couldn't access all penny stocks, just those penny stocks that are avaliable on most standard trading platforms.

\*\*Part 3 - Thesis\*\*

I am doing away with the story like tone of this now, though I hope you enjoyed that.

Essentially, A ton middle class people that don't have ridiclous amounts of money surged into the market and have all been trying to guess the next GME/Big thing and many have just been following trends on mass. The issue with this is there is currently ""seemingly"" high quality DD posts being made of virtually every widely avaliable stock under $10, and of many stocks that are a bit higher than $10.

I imagine, because of this, many people might be experiencing the same problems as me now.

1. It is much harder to tell which low cost stocks are actually potentially good long term investments and which are riding the hype wave and new trader wave.
2. Many of the potentially good long term stocks have shot way past what there forecast long term gains had been. So, I am left wondering how far they will recede back, if at all, and when should i buy back in.

I am curious what the take of other traders on here are about handling this situation?

Personally these are the steps I have taken.

I have benefited with a small amount of winnings both from GME & from weed stocks as well as some of the other penny stock gains. I have taken all of my money out of these sort of plays temporarily and moved most of it into safer long term investments. Most into a few different ETF's, some into SQ, Microsoft, Apple.

Though I have kept a small amount ( an amount I have no problem loosing) and I chucked it into a Tanzanian gold company stock, ""why"", you may ask, ""have you moved stocks into a strange unimpressive tanzanian gold mining company?"" simply because it was one of the last widely accesbile(that is to say avaliable on most amatuer trading platforms) penny stocks under $1, I suspect it may move up simply because of how cheap it is. Stocks under $1 seem, at least temporarily, to be soaring for the simple fact of being under $1."

My bull case for Shin-Etsu.,35,30,2021-02-12 02:04:01,"Intro: Over the past few months, there have been an increasing number of posts discussing the semiconductor shortage in the automotive industry. The TLDR for these posts is that the big winner here is going to be TSMC. TSMC is the leading chip foundry in the world. It produces chips for Intel, AMD, Apple, and many others. 

My thesis: The chip shortage is already priced into the current value of TSMC. I still have 9 shares of TSM, but I am going long on those. This is a shorter term play based off of the ongoing automotive semiconductor shortage. TSMC sources it's wafers from 5 suppliers, 4 of which are publicly traded. These companies are F.K.S., MEMC, S.E.H., Siltronic, SUMCO. These 5 companies produce 85% of the worlds raw wafers. Shin-Etsu produces 33% of the worlds wafers. Shin-Etsu is also positioning itself to be one of the primary producers of the chips that are invloved in the automotive industry shortage. In addition, Shin-Etsu is one of TSMC's primary suppliers of Photoresist. Finally, Shin-Etsu is based in Taiwan, TSMC is fully aware of this and is taking full advantage of the logistics advantages associated with Shin-Etsu's geographical position. 
TLDR: I think that SHECY is going to see a rapids spike in the next 6 months.
Position: 7 Shares SHECY @42.91

Understanding The Market Requires You To Understand Market Psychology

Check out my profile for stock Analysis by request.

Stock market intraday patterns – all times are in Eastern Standard Time!

When day trading the US stock market you may notice certain patterns, based on the time of day, that occur more often than not. These patterns, or tendencies, happen often enough for professional day traders to base their trading around them.

9:30am: The stock market opens, and there is an initial push in one direction. Highly volatile!

9:45am: The initial push often sees a significant reversal or pullback. This is often just a short-term shift, and then the original trending direction re-asserts itself.

10:00am: If the trend that began at 9:30am is still happening, it will often be challenged around this time. This tends to be another time where there is a significant reversal or pullback.

11:15am-11:30am: The market is heading into lunch hour, and London is getting ready to close. This is when volatility will typically die out for a few hours, but often the daily high or low will be tested around this time. European traders will usually close out positions or accumulate a position before they finish for the day. Whether the highs or lows are tested or not, the markets tend to ‘drift’ for the next hour or more.

11:45am-1:30pm: This is lunch time in New York, plus a bit of a time buffer. Usually, this is the quietest time of the day, and often, day traders like to avoid it.

1:30pm-2:00pm: If the lunch hour was calm, then expect a breakout of the range established during lunch hour. Often, the market will try to move in the direction it was trading in before the lunch hour doldrums set in.

2:00pm-2:45pm: The close is getting closer, and many traders are trading with the trend thinking it will continue into close. That may happen, but expect some sharp reversals around this time, because on the flip side, man traders are quicker to take profits or move their trailing stop losses closer to the current price.

\---

3:00pm-3:30pm: These are big “Shake-out” points, in that they will force many traders out of their positions. If a reversal of the prior trend occurs around this time, then the price is likely to move very strongly in the opposite direction. Even if the prior trend does sustain itself through these periods, expect some quick and sizable counter-trend moves.

As a day trader, its best to be nimble and not get tied into one position or direction. Many traders only trade the first hour and the last hour of every day, as these times are the most volatile.

3:30pm-4:00pm: The market closes at 4pm. After that, the liquidity dries up in nearly all stocks and ETFs, except for the very active ones. It’s common to close all positions a minute or more before the closing bell, unless you have orders placed to close your position on a closing auction or “cross”.

Trade Entry Checklist - Things to Consider before entering a trade

1. Portfolio fit – Make sure you diversify your portfolio. If you have 9 open bullish positions, consider a bearish stance elsewhere to balance your portfolio and reduce risk.
2. Liquidity Check – If the stock you are considering has enough stocks traded per day. This can easily be found on Yahoo! Finance – look for “Average Volume.” Look for contract strikes that have at least 1,000 contracts of open interest – this minimizes bid/ask spread and ensures market liquidity so that you can actually enter/exit trades easily.
3. IV Percentile – Example: AAPL has IV of 45%, but IV percentile of 85%. This means that 85% of the time over the last year, volatility will be lower than it is right now as it’s current actual IV (45%). Likewise, if GOOG has an IV of 45% but an IV rank of 25%, then only 25% of the time over the last year IV was lower than it’s current value (45%). This means we have a 75% chance that IV will increase on average, meaning it’s current volatility is low – and we want to buy into that. If IV is between 70%-100% you will need to actively monitor that trade, higher risk.
4. Options strategy - Pretty straight forward- If IV is high and the price of the underlying is also high, we can eliminate bullish strategies and focus on bearish, and vice versa.
5. Strike Price – First you need to determine if you want an in the money (ITM) or out of the money (OTM). An ITM option has a greater sensitivity – delta – to the price of the underlying stock. So if the stock price increases by a given amount, the ITM call would gain more than an ATM or OTM call. This also means it would decline more than others if the price falls. ITM calls are more expensive as well – higher intrinsic value.

Next consideration is risk/reward. An ITM option carrier less risk, but costs more. If you only want to stake a small amount of capital in a trade, an OTM position may be your best choice. OTM positions are riskier, cheaper, and potentially much more profitable if the stock surges past your strike price.

6. Expiration – Date similarly to strike price, the further out a contracts expiration is, the higher the premium because time is on your side. There is a higher chance of the stock meeting your OTM target price given a year to do so, compared to a week. This is called Theta – a quantification of how much value is lost due to the passing of time. Theta also grows exponentially as you near the expiration date – your $190 strike call will be worth very little if the call expires tomorrow and the stock is at $180 because the probability of the stock reaching $190 is low.

7. Position size – This is important – BIG TRADING POSITIONS WILL EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF BLOWING UP YOUR ACCOUNT. We suggest you place trades utilizing only 1-5% of your total account value, with an emphasis on the lower end. Play it safe, round down. It’s much easier to recover from a -5% loss than -80%.

8. Future moves – Think beyond what’s going on with a stock than just in the current day – unless youre scalping. Is there an earnings report coming up? Can I roll this into the next month if I need to? Is there an upcoming dividend payout? Take the time to plan your positions and don’t rush your entry – You want to ensure the best possibility of success. I’d take $500 profit with a 90% success rate over $750 profit with a 50% success rate any day. You want to build consistency, and plan your positions before you take them."

It's another thing to **not understand how certain metrics are calculated, when/how data is reported, and blatantly make up numbers** because it fits a delusional reality where GME is going to be $10000/share. I'm not saying GME isn't ripe for another squeeze, but be reasonable. Think about what certain share prices mean and the odds it could ever reach such a height.

# Let me put it into context:

&#x200B;

|GME Price|Market Cap|Comparable |
|:-|:-|:-|
|$1000|69.7B|BP, Twilio, Anthem|
|$10000|697B|Alibaba, Visa + MC, JP Morgan + Wells Fargo |
|$69420|4,789,980,000,000|25% US Annual GDP, Apple + Microsoft + Amazon|

When you dispute data from Bloomberg Terminal, the holy grail of Wall Street trading, you've lost the investing game. It's not even a casino-level bet, it's throwing cash into a fire pit and pouring piss martinis over it. Don't downvote someone because they disagree with your reality, challenge them. We all have opinions, and we can think the other degenerate's opinion is flat out dumb. But if your DD doesn't hold water, then it truly is dumb.

# tl;dr It's great you love GME as a stock, I hope they do great and think they'll make a great turnaround. Just don't be untethered from reality, follow posting guidelines, and don't make up data"

1) BB has nothing to do with smartphones. Throw those 2007 notions out of your mind and bring yourself to the future

2) Whilst the whole stock market has been pissing themselves for years over EV/AV industry speculation, the reality is that these are hardware companies with low margin, and limited scale potential.

Even Tesla, owned and run by the richest man in the world, has yet to build more than 500,000 cars in one year. Meanwhile Tesla competitors springing up everywhere with both new challengers such as NIO and old money fucks getting into EV such as VW and GM (GM in December 2020 announced 100% by 2030 all cars would be 100% EV).

THE REAL FUCKING MONEY is not in EV production which has low margin and low scale, but in data monetization which is high margin (and being software) has unlimited scale. In the same way that Google makes only $18Bn revenue from hardware sales (phone, nest sales etc) but makes $120Bn from data monetization, $BB is going to to the fucking moon with $200BN revenue + by 2030 with 10% net whilst Tesla and other big auto are fighting over 4% margins (Tesla net profit in 2020 = 4% whilst **BB sat at a juicy 10.15%**).

This industry is going to the fucking moon, and BB is the only one with a front row ticket 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. This shit is like investing in Google or Amazon in the year 2000, by the time the mainstream saw the potential 5 years later, shit was already at pluto

u/just an everyday life couldn't have put it better: ""Zombie cars and QNX

QNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. What the fuck does that even mean nerd? For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.

Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.

Fast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot program but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?

SONY? Blackberry QNX. Baidu? QNX baby. XPENG? Blackberry as well. If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? Li Auto But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using Nvidia DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both Canoo and Hyundai makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.

You might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀""

3) BB is a cash flow positive, growing company with near nil competitors in an industry that is skyrocketing. Despite this, the boomer fucks who still believe BB is a smartphone company, have in their own glorious act of autism, have massively shorted BB bringing the share price down. 

BB is a growth company in a growth industry, these hedge funds are going to need to borrow more money if they want to buy tendies after the wider market realizes the market inefficiency that is an undervalued BB. u/Tradergurue went into a lot of detail in his $BB short interest post here [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short\_interest\_in\_bb\_its\_increasing/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short_interest_in_bb_its_increasing/)

Entire automative factories have been shut-down due to constraints on on getting chips in their vehicles. This phenomenon was predicted to be less unrelenting, but recently, many manufacturers (particularly Microsoft regarding the Xbox Series X) have basically admitted that they simply can’t sell their products due to the limits on chips designer’s limits of wafers of a given process node.

As a rundown, Intel, TSMC are the “big fabs” that you hear about in advanced computing technology. AMD uses TSMC, but AMD is on a 4-front battle with its console, desktop CPU, server CPU, and GPU market, as well as mobile chips. Essentially, any company in the position of AMD (even Intel and Nvidia are facing this problem) that can sell its products like hotcakes, but can’t get the nodes they need for their top-of-the-line products is bound by what they ordered months or years in advance. It is very likely that this will resonate as a prime reason to use lesser-utilized nodes by other companies for various other components (Internet-of-things, 5G etc...)

Essentially, chip *designers* are being constrained by their ability to gain access to various chips. But the fabs behind these “big-name” computing technology companies that you’re used to hearing about are essentially bidding with eachother for these same advanced process nodes, kicking smaller (and by *smaller* I don’t mean *small*, I mean literally anyone that isn’t trying to +1 extremely advanced computing products).

TSMC is producing process nodes that perform very well. Except, their supply is very limited. Keep in mind, Chip *designers* will often times outsource their designs to be made on different nodes. Intel uses TSMC, even though it has its own fabs, for instance. And Intel also rents out their own fabs.

This is where $UMC and various other lesser-known semi-conductor manufacturers come in. They will likely fill the massive demand for *any* process node that chip designers can get their hands on to fill the unprecedented shortages which seem to be pushed back farther and farther.

Eventually, your average, run-of-the-mill devices will need chips in them, and they are likely to have difficulties working with more well-renowned chip-makers to actually put their architectures on a given node. In general, chip-manufacturers have had the lion’s share of consistent performance over the past year due to increasingly innovative products from high-profile designers. It’s quite possible many device-manufacturers will opt not to use larger semi-conductor fabs as big-names like AMD, NVidia, and even Apple are competing for the same nodes.

At the very least, a lot of the previous success of semi-conductor manufacturers and chip designers may potentially trickle down to lesser-utilized and less glamorous fabs.

There’s already a precedent that very specialized chip designs will often go to these manufacturers, and now that the big names literally are fighting for these advanced nodes, many chipmakers have used Global Foundries and other “less sexy” fabs to meet demand for chips that they *need* now.

In general, companies with semiconductor fabs are likely to do well, simply due to the fact that the world in general needs more wafers, substrates etc... as infrastructure becomes more complex, digitally.

I recommend researching semi-conductor manufacturers who have long been underdogs.

**This is not financial advice, I am 🦍 and I am currently sauteeing crayons in a pan**

EDIT: [semi-wiki](https://semiwiki.com/) has very in-depth descriptions of various companies, many of which you’re familiar with.

I believe Qualcomm has been brutally oversold. I expect a large rebound in the following months. 

Following their [most recent earnings report Q1 2021](https://investor.qualcomm.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001728949-21-000022/0001728949-21-000022.pdf) on the 4th of February their stock dropped 10% in 2 days. However, their earning report was strong and they maintain confidence that they will have a strong Q2 earnings too with an EPS of $1.65 (analysts were expecting an EPS of $1.57). The Q1 ER had an EPS of $2.17 per diluted share which is more than double their Q1 2020 $0.99 EPS. Although their ER beating high estimates of $8 billion in sales by an extra $200 million, [their licensing division brought in $1.35 billion of an estimated $1.43 billion.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/qualcomm-stock-earnings-chips-apple-51612390489) Their equipment and services division brought in $6.440 billion. They had an operating income of 2.5 billion.


Qcom has a healthy balance sheet with $7 billion in cash and very little short term debt. They do have $15 billion of long term doubt, which would be entirely covered by their cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. They can chip away at this debt slowly in this low interest period whilst focusing on R&D.


All sounds good, so why did the stock tumble so bad? I’ve looked at different sources and have read that business analysts are worried about the limited manufacturing capacity across the semiconductor industry. However, I believe this is bullish. With demand higher than supply, it allows for the flexibility in price and larger profits whilst reinvesting back into manufacturing. Furthermore, I do not believe the dip is for this reason as other US chip producers such as Broadcom, Nvidia and the likes also are experiencing the same chip shortage and their stocks have not dipped in the same way. AMD has dipped in a similar way after beating earnings in true fashion and is showing signs of recovery which makes me bullish of a rebound. 

 It is possible the sell off may be due to [citi downgrading their PT to $165 from $194.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/qualcomm-stock-gets-a-downgrade-at-citi-after-earnings-2021-02-04) This is still higher than the current price by a bit but is slightly more bearish. Qualcomm has 77% of shares held by institutions, so you’d expect less volatility considering recently they have been loading up on shares, however, this data is prior to earnings. Updated figures on institutional holding reports are filed within 45 days after calendar quarter end - the 21st of March. [The most credible reason for the dip may be due to analysts having higher forecasts for the licensing division, however, I do believe the reaction has been very disproportionate especially when following EPS for the next quarter remains strong.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/04/why-qualcomm-stock-is-falling-today/)

Edit: new to WSB, I noticed DFV never at any time told anyone to do anything. I don't pretend, I know the typical emoji lingo. I'm holding as the money is in Roth IRA and I cannot touch it until I retire. There are other stocks that have done well for me. AAPL since 2004, BRK.B since 2011, SYY since 2015. Will let this ride and see where it goes. There could be some M&A activity down there line for either of these."

Positions: 230 $15c Jan 2022

https://preview.redd.it/quhsl8g03hf61.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b1b2bda4d0ecf816f47d8986b8dd241603ea2e7

First of all, fuck the suits and GME 💎🙌🍌🦍💎🙌🍌🦍💎🙌🍌🦍💎🙌🍌🦍 I have 3 shares at $300 and I just want to see all the short sellers get burned. But for a core position, Ford isn't bad.

**It's a value stock**. Ford is extremely cheap. From 2008 onwards, and again in 2020, Ford has a company that has been left to die. It is also an industrial, which puts it in the realm of boring companies that will benefit from the rotation of it does come.

If you want to talk fundamentals, PE is something around 8x right now, which makes it in the same realm of freaking Tyson Foods, which last I checked, was responsible for taking things off a carcass, putting it into small bags and selling it for 79c/lb for autismos to REEEEEEEEE over.

If you want to talk options, dude the underlying is basically $10. That makes options cheaper. And the IV is basically 30-50% on reasonable strikes and exps (say 10% OTM 1mo, 20% OTM 2mo etc). This means for a single GME option (I don't care which one), you can have anywhere from 100-500 of F ones. People dumping their entire life savings on 20c options is what the sub was built on.

**Gubmit money**. This is nothing new ([meaning we saw it during the Obama era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_incentives_for_plug-in_electric_vehicles#United_States)). You bet there will be incentives for both companies and consumers in the September budget. This also has the tailwinds of Biden's ""plan"" of buying all American and electric for the Federal fleet. Ford will absolutely lowball the shit out of everyone else because that's what Ford does when faced with these [morally-questionable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Pinto), [profit-enhancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestone_and_Ford_tire_controversy) situations. Ford these past few weeks have been trading like a green company like Sunrun and a few others. Yes GM will probably do the same thing, but GM doesn't have this next point which changes the situation.

**So what if it can become a tech company?** Yeah, it's never going to happen. I would never buy a phone from Ford for example because you know Ford can find a way to make the plastic rust. But the [Ford-Google dea](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/ford-and-google-sign-six-year-deal-for-android-in-car-apps-cloud.html)l goes beyond just installing android on cars. Ford will absolutely sell user information to Google (kinda like how RH sells it to Citadel). Google wants this information because it wants to get into the self-driving car business, and the deal allows it to leapfrog TSLA by not having to build their own cars, network and ecosystem. The data is probably more valuable since you have a wider view of the entire US driving demographic.

GM does not have this. GM does not have anyone to prostitute their driver data to. Sure, GM can do that, but GM is expensive and their small cars business will be absolutely killed by the deluge of new small EV manufacturers over the years.

So... don't do anything crazy like $15c March 2021 because there will be no GME-esque short squeeze (even though yeah VW was a car company and earnings are this afternoon). A 40% gain over 11 months is very reasonable. And again, the options are very cheap ($1.50).

**Risks, disclaimers etc etc:** Hi Mr. SEC, this is not financial advice. I do not drive a Ford because I don't want to be stranded on the side of the road. Apple car might lead to a drop in Ford but thankfully in the US, Ford has stopped producing small cars. If I lose it all, please feel free to find this post again and drop an F in the chat."

I feel like I need to say something so people don't $ROPE thinking they have no other choice but to pray for a squeeze.

I need people to understand that not selling (depending on the stock) is also losing because of OPPURTUNITY COST. I am not telling you to sell if this was fun money for you, but I see people taking out fucking loans to play a momentum run that prior to this only ranged between $3-$25 per share for the last 4 years. 

Yes I understand Cohen can make changes to make GME a successful businesses, but understand it can take years. If you bought at 300-500 you will basically NEED a short squeeze to get out of those positions.  If your paper loss is already -75%, than ya, probably just hold, but do what is best for YOU.

The heavy realized loss that I took from my last GME trade hurt a lot, but I took my remaining capital and made a good chunk of my loss back up already (BA and MSFT). Sometimes you need to be proactive and not wait/pray for a short squeeze to happen. 

For example: If I have a position in AAPL and for whatever reason it drops 30%, I wont sell it since I know it will eventually come back and just collect dividends during the wait because of AAPL's FUNDAMENTALS. 

People need to understand that GME was a high risk high reward play. If you believe that this stock was manipulated, then what makes you think they will stop now? If you are confident in your position then hold.

I pray that a short squeeze does happen since I sympathize with people that lost their fucking life savings on this play, but at the end of the day you need to do what is best for YOU."

[https://www.canoo.com/](https://www.canoo.com/)

Canoo is a new EV start-up that plans to have a vehicle subscription service. From their investor presentation, it looks like they estimate $90,000 revenue on a car over 12 years. That means the cost per month for their subscription model is $625 per month, all in, no down payment, no insurance cost, they take care of maintenance, etc.

Link: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ea125677ex99-2\_hennessy.htm?fbclid=IwAR2as\_F2t-ZrmXWjKGvDLROdeSmL5ByctPw3W0VuqEcOHYjZggG3d5FX4T4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ea125677ex99-2_hennessy.htm?fbclid=IwAR2as_F2t-ZrmXWjKGvDLROdeSmL5ByctPw3W0VuqEcOHYjZggG3d5FX4T4)

Now, I know that seems a bit expensive but it seems that $625/mon is cheaper than the low end of the average of owning a gas-powered car at $750-916/mon. It has a barrier-of-entry because there is no down payment. I don't know how that will play out with most people. I personally like owning my own vehicle, but it could be popular with younger people because again, they wouldn't need to worry about any maintenance or insurance. Now, I do think their subscription model would be very popular among large companies that need a cheap, low-maintenance fleet of vehicles. I hope they're trying to land a contract with a company like UPS or FedEx.

What I like most about this company is their ""skateboard"" platform which is the bottom half of the car. From my understanding, they would just need to crash test one of each skateboard. Any vehicle, regardless of the configuration, would also have that crash rating, which is an amazing cost saving when they can sell a bunch of units to a larger car manufacture, like Hyundai, with whom they already have a partnership.

Link: [https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia)  


It is reported that Apple tried to buy Canoo in 2020 but Canoo turned them down. Apple has apparently partnered with Hyundai to enter the EV-space, I think because Apple really liked Canoo's customizable platform. Apple couldn't buy them so they joined them in a roundabout way.

[https://www.slashgear.com/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-report-electric-vehicle-skateboard-platform-autonomous-ev-roadmap-13654915/](https://www.slashgear.com/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-report-electric-vehicle-skateboard-platform-autonomous-ev-roadmap-13654915/)  


Having said all that, they won't have any vehicles out until 2022 so be wary of that, but this is a long-term hold for me.

Canoo (GOEV) currently trades at $16.40, hitting its all-time high at $22.30 in December. So, it hasn't had a crazy break-out yet but I'm confident there will be one closer to launch."

One thing I found interesting is that not only does short volume for GME increase to greater than 50% of total volume on Jan 27, but on Jan 28, the Exempt Short Sale Volume increases significantly as a percent of total volume (\~6x increase from 27th to 29th).  As we all know the 28th is the day that brokerages were forced to shut off memestocks and when we saw what many have claimed to be a major coordinated attack to drive down the price over the course of a few minutes to trigger long margin calls and stop loss orders.

Here is what this same data looks like for some other securities over the same time frame. I took particular note that BB had a sudden increase in this exempt short volume which seems to match up with a sudden downward movement in its price yesterday morning. Although the overall short volume decreases, so not sure what total impact that had on the price.

What is Exempt short volume? Here is how investopedia describes it:

""Though the SEC oversees brokers who issue short-sale orders, they do not execute regularly scheduled audits or required regularly filed reports by brokers. Instead, the SEC expects broker-dealers to be self regulating, by maintaining their own records which are subject to audit at any time. With this in mind, broker-dealers are required to document their polices for how they mark orders as exempt, and, if audited, provide evidence that they have followed their documented policies and procedures.

Broker-dealers therefore mark an order short exempt if they believe it qualifies for an exception. The primary exception is the use of non-standard pricing quotes for trade execution. That means that if prices come in outside the [National Best Bid or Offer (NBBO)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nbbo.asp), they can initiate a short-sale order that they judge would have qualified as an uptick in more orderly markets. Marking for these orders is signified by SSE. All orders marked SSE will be closely checked by self-regulatory organizations and the SEC for compliance with Regulation SHO exceptions.""

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortexempt.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortexempt.asp)

I don't know jack shit about what this means, and I'm not a financial advisor, which is why I'm asking for someone who knows more about this to explain the significance of this. Does this help support the argument that Hedgies/brokers are circumventing the NBBO for ladder attacks when LULD rule is triggered? Were there frequent enough trading halts since Jan 28th for this to have a significant impact? AAPL and Ford have very small but non-existent data for Exempt short volume, and I'm not aware of any limit rules applied to them over the last few days, so where did their exempt short volume come from?

My position is \~50 shares of GME at \~$120. Small long positions in some of the other securities mentioned, but GME is by far the biggest."

I have been posting on this sub for over 3 years back when we were at only a couple hundred thousand. This is my first DD write up and I’m a little retarded so please go easy on me. 

For everyone who doesn’t want to read a wall of text there’s a **TL:DR** at the bottom.

**Technical Setup:**

Canoo has completed its SPAC merger and ticker change a little over a month ago going from HCAC to GOEV. Ever since the combination it has been piled into by shorts. The short position has grown exponentially from 99k shares to over 10 million as of the last update by NASDAQ. I subscribe to S3 Capital’s retail short algorithm which gives a more accurate current estimate of ~11 million shares short. New available shorts are nearly nonexistent and borrow rates are sky rocketing. If you haven’t been living under a rock the past couple of weeks you already know how well short squeezes can play out. 

[S3 short Info](https://imgur.com/RPVpzbu)

[NASDAQ Short Info](https://imgur.com/LrjJJCD)

[Share Borrow & Fees](https://imgur.com/esZFBfL)

**Fundamental Setup:**

GOEV has a ton of positive catalyst the shorts are overlooking and I believe this will lead to large losses on their side. For one, the EV revolution is here to stay as you can tell from the new administration. Biden plans to electrify the whole federal fleet (estimated 650k vehicles). GOEV  has the perfect mid sized commercial B2B purpose built vehicle which fits the build of many government vehicles. The Canoo purpose built vehicle can replace for example USPS mail trucks.

[MPDV Purpose Built Vehicle](https://www.canoo.com/mpdv/) 

Canoo’s leadership are veterans in the automotive industry which is hard to say for some of the other SPAC *cough * NKLA. Canoo's co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was CTO at EV carmaker Faraday Future and more importantly has over 30 years of management experience at BMW. He worked to reimagine the MINI brand, develop the company's first SUV, and the iProject (BMW i8 & i3). They also poached talent from Tesla; Sohel Merchant (vehicle architecture) Christoph Kuttner (vehicle trim), and Alexi Charbonneau (proprietary EV skateboard tech) just to name a few. 

The real value here is their proprietary B2B skateboard platform for EVs. Allowing for any automaker to design and build their perfect sedan and just clip on to an already existing powertrain. Now AAPL is most likely going to sign an EV production contract with Hyundai/KIA (expected as soon as Feb 17th) confirmed last night by the  3.6 Billion investment. GOEV is already providing their platform to Hyundai/KIA. GOEV has already been validated by AAPL as in AAPL wanted to buy them out in 2020 so clearly they like their tech. And if you think that’s not enough to sell you on this theory then listen to this: In 2015, Apple almost used the BMW i3 as the basis for its Apple Car… the two founders of Canoo were the top guys on the iProject. It doesn’t take a genius to connect these dots.

While I’m not claiming they are or aren’t happening, I think it is important to understand how institutional trading works. For reference, I work on the sell side so im a semi-suit (im not an execution trader, but I have enough friends who are).

You may notice that these stocks trade in 100 share increments, this is by design and has a name, they’re called “round lots” and are used to break up large orders. These round lots are used by every single institution in order to not smash through the bid/ask walls and ensure orderly markets. They are not evidence of a short ladder attack.

Think about it, if a fund wanted to buy $1,000,000,000 worth of AAPL, they could never place a market order as they would move the market against them, and a limit order would never fill. They could use a dark pool to buy without advertising their order, or find a willing partner for a block trade. They also, very frequently have to use low touch VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) algos (much different than prop algos) to buy in the open markets on an exchange. These algorithms ingest the order, and then execute the trade based on a predefined % of volume, ie. the sell side execution trader never wants his/her orders to take up more than xx% of volume. As the algo operates throughout the day, it executes thousands of round lot trades. These round lot trades are the 100 share increments you see each day. All the 100 share increments mean is that you are seeing institutional volume mixed in with odd lot trades (blocks not in increments of 100 shares).

**TLDR:** 100 share blocks are round lots and are not in any way an indication of a short ladder attack, they simply show institutional order flow.

**Positions:** 30 shares of GME at $14.07

Most importantly... **HOLD THE LINE**

Edits with interesting questions:

**Q: If you're going to execute a short ladder attack it makes sense to choose a round number like 100**

A: They're not choosing 100 shares, their order is much larger, probably thousands or tens of thousands of shares. The algo breaks up that order into 100 share round lots and executes the trade. The reason for this is simple, its easy to match  100 share lots than it is to try to piece together orders. If the seller is asking $xx.xx for 100 shares, the buyer can bid $xx.xx for 100 shares and the match is made. If you have 13 shares at one price, 29 shares at another price, and 91 shares at another price on both the bid and ask side, complexity increases materially.

**Q: Why do I see a lot of odd lots in AH trading?**

A: Because order flow from retail brokerages too thin to combine market orders into a single round lot once it makes its way over to a MM, so they just execute an odd lot order. It is what they have to do and is the last part of my answer above."

Last week on January 24th, Nancy Pelosi's husband disclosed buying 4 different tickers. The tickers were TSLA, AAPL, DIS, and AB. Most of the mainstream media were very focused on talking about the TSLA, AAPL, and DIS yet only very briefly mention the fact he bought 20,000 shares of AB. I found this particular stock pick very odd in comparison to TSLA, AAPL, and DIS. It's an odd pick because

A. I hadn't ever heard of ticker AB before reading this story. And

B. Paul Pelosi bought deep ITM calls on TSLA, AAPL, and DIS. AKA calls any smooth brain could make. These calls are super safe long term plays, and require no brain power or risk for how deep in the money they are. In comparison to those three companies, he bought SHARES of AB. I found this extremely odd. For those reasons, I began to look into the company to attempt to see why he made this purchase in particular.

After non-extensive research I came to two different possible conclusions why he would buy shares of AB with as high conviction as TSLA, AAPL, and DIS:

1. He liked the high dividend yield of 7.72% and the slow yet steady upward projectory of the stock. OR
2. He knows something I don't.

So, because I am retarded I went with number 2 and YOLO'd 30 Apr 19 45$ calls @ .50 cent strike price. I will hold these calls with diamond hands and we'll see what happens.

EDIT: This is entirely speculative and could be high risk. I'm retarded so I don't know if it's high risk or not. Invest at your own risk. (for the new members of this sub)"

To all of you who are out there who’ve ever thought “oh man, if I’d only bought X stock X years ago I’d be rich!” - if you aren’t holding right now, you’re wrong. 

I’m an actual investor, not a swing/day trader (I know, gay) and I went all in on TSLA back in 2019, so I had days where my account would lose 20% of its value. Weeks where it would lose half. I didn’t sell a share as it went from $960 to $330 pre-split. Nor the $460-$300 drop post-split. These are just a few examples. 

I bought GME because in a worst case scenario some crazy illegal shit happens and I now have a long term position in a solid company. I covered my cost basis in tranches on the way up and now I’m holding the remaining 300 shares with house money. If it’s too late for you to do that, take it as a lesson for next time.  What was Melvin’s mistake? No actual hedging. Don’t be a Melvin. . 

A good investment requires holding 9/10 times. The overnight million dollar plays are very rare, because they take a higher ratio of luck than confidence. This shit is a lot like dating - your confidence won’t help if you’re making shitty picks, but your good picks will never pan out without confidence. $GME has my confidence- the numbers are in our favor. And so, I hold. And I sleep like a baby at night. I have 300 shares, and I’ve lost a nauseating amount of money the past two days. 

But I don’t give a fuck. 

Hold, relax, forget about it. We own the stock, we aren’t the ones bleeding interest. As much as the hedges have their cheating, we have nuclear bombs too- one whale, one great piece of news, one exercising of stock options by a certain Ryan Cohen... I could go on. 

It’s not a sure thing, but anyone acting like we’re in dire straits probably didn’t comprehend what was going on in the first place. Just shut the fuck up and hold. Do you want to be the “Golly I could’ve had Apple 20 years ago!” guy for the rest of your life, or do you wanna be the strong motherfucker who actually took the leap?"

Theoretically each share could be worth an infinite amount of dollars. If no one sells, that's the price they'll have to pay. I think it's time these hedge funds billionaires lost their yachts and mansions and have to live in a normal house like the rest us. This is a moment where we're taking back what they took.

Realistically we can probably get $35,000 a share on average. This would put GameStop roughly around the same market cap as Apple. It could go up to $50,000 a share. Anything is possible.

Please do 5 mins of research before you jump onto something someone says. Please go through more stocks if you need more evidence than what I provided. I would love to be proven wrong so I feel better about GME, but going off of completely wrong information is just going to get us all burned even more."

I just wanted to post some encouragement.  This is actually my first post on Reddit.  I got an account long ago to join r/freefolk after the disappointing end of Thrones.  Good or bad.  Agree or disagree.  That forum taught me the power of the internet.  I decided in August of this year that I needed to take control of my own financial future.  That, win or lose, I should own it.  I bought some regular stocks.  Got my Apple, Tesla, and Amazon.  Stuff I believed in.  Then I started learning things.  My risk tolerance grew.  I learned I liked some digital currencies I can’t mention and got in with what funds I could back in September as they started to climb.  They treated me well.  I started following other subreddits like this one in the background.  I was thirsty to learn and willing to lose some money (and make it if the gods smiled).  I’ve followed the logic with these stocks.  This is all a gamble.  I know that.  What has been exposed to the mainstream is that it’s all a gamble.  I think the “experts” hate that the most.  But this is a damn good gamble.  I missed the boat to get on GME last week but I jumped into as much AMC as Robinhood would let me.  I’ve eaten my shirt on it but I continue to hold with diamond fucking hands.  I’m recently divorced and on my own.  There’s a lot I could do with that money.  It’s nothing I can’t afford to lose but I could use it elsewhere.  I won’t.  It’s to the moon or to the ground.  I thought I missed the GME bandwagon for good but then it started dropping.  I almost let the naysayers get to me and didn’t go in.  I’m already eating it on AMC but you know what?  I’M IN AND I’M NOT FUCKING LEAVING!  Bought this morning at 114. Only a couple of shares but it’s what I can do.  I want on this rocket with you.  We go to the moon or crash together.  I can’t help but think there are others out there like me and there’s been such negativity.  No negative here.  Let’s do this!  My diamond fists are closed.

Once again the world has sought to divide us. Yesterday it was with silver and short ladder attacks. Last week, with brokerages. Before that, politics, race, Android and Apple, football and football, smooth brain and smoother brain. This narrative has dragged on for as long as I can remember. 

The hedge fund managers and corporate backers and media pundits who've pushed us towards failure for decades are the same who seek our failure today. To them, we're no different than the commodities and securities they so freely and fragrantly manipulate. At our expense they use our diamond hands, gorilla strength, and full tilt retardation against us, and the truth is that until now we've drooled idly by and let it happen. We let them overshort us to the brink of moral bankruptcy, economic collapse, and cultural disaster, while they sat back and stuffed their pockets with our tendies. 

Until $GME.

We, in all of our smooth brained glory, came together in the name of a hopeless cause because we believed we had the power to change it for the better. We set aside our differences and agreed that despite them, we found something worth fighting for. Today we stood shoulder to shoulder with the great apes of old. We fervently beat our chests with diamond hands and shouted ""HOLD"" as we stared down our oppressors. Some paper hands fled in the face of this tyranny, but we HELD! In glorious revolution we lit our forges and fired that paper into endless diamonds.

Now, on the frontline of yet another bloody battlefield, we find ourselves strapped onto the backs of rockets. Ready to launch ourselves into the heavens if only to add more stars to the night sky for those below us. We do not fear death, for what's $323 worth when priced against the soul of our people? Take in the enemies terror. Look them in the eyes as we take to the stars my friends, for they'll speak of us generations from now.

Apes bring hope. Diamond hands no drive good, rockets only go up. We go too?

Make no mistake, we are here fighting for so much more than $GME, but it is absolutely $GME that we're fighting for. Believe in us. Believe in yourself. Believe in a better world for all smooth brains where the bulls**t the elites pull on us and call ""protection"" is brought to the dirt and burned off in the glow of our afterburners.

With hands like diamonds we sail into the tides of eternity,
Monkeys amongst the stars. 

WE LIKE THE STOCK."

The fact the HF are doing this to cause a companies stock to plumment which is highly illegal and is blantly obvious they are behind it is even worse. Where's SEC or Goverment regulators at to step in and put a stop to this. I mean they wre perfectly fine shutting us out from trading, but there is no action taking against them.

Honestly if they are allowed to get away with this, then what is keeping them from going after stocks like Tesla, Amazon, or Apple. Every company at this point should be worried and filling complaints seeing how HF are manipulating the market to there whim and are to ruin any company to put a quick buck in there pocket."

It's Only Just Begun.,112,8,2021-02-02 22:22:42,"Been watching the whole Gamestop thing unfold since November on WallstreetBets (WSB) and holding some shares since $40. WSB has grown from 2 million members last Monday to 8 million just a week later, and they have revealed an amount of corruption in the open market more than I could have previously believed. I'm proud of the major newspapers reporting most of the event accurately so far, while all the major TV stations (CNBC, CNN, Fox, etc.) are blatantly lying and saying WallStreetBets has moved on to invest in Silver. They've given up on trying to say Gamestop is a lost cause because that just put fuel on the fire. Now they are trying the tried and true method of ""divide and conquer"".   

The financial system doesn't seem to realize how many young investors they have pissed off. They haven't reported on are all the people who used their Gamestop winnings to buy video games and consoles to donate to children's hospitals, or the billboards across the country this week in Hartford, NY, Boston, Denver, and even in front of the NY Stock exchange itself showing something similar to ""WE'RE NOT LEAVING, GAMESTOP TO THE MOON"".   

Today, STAKE, a broker in Australia akin to Robinhood (RH) is now preventing people from buying the stock after it has dropped about 60% in one day. They let you buy it when it was worth $300 and $400, but not at $150. Seems fair right? The google store removed an inflow of thousands if not millions of negative reviews from the RH app when RH prevented buying. Facebook has deleted groups talking about the stock and actually protected groups talking about the fake silver investment. Not that Apple is a saint but they actually allowed all the negative reviews and now \~1/3 of the RH reviews are 1/5 stars. 

I'm happy that when many brokers in the US shutdown buying the stock last week that people from Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia, etc. posted their portfolios--posted that they were here to support Americans and buy when we were prevented from buying. The media sells the ideas of republican vs democrat, gay vs. straight, Christian vs. Jew, native vs. foreigner, male vs. female, black vs. white. These are all to distract you from what the real battle has always been and always will be: the poor vs. the rich. Not the rich that may deserve to be rich--the rich that have made their money off scamming, stealing, and rigging a system that influences the entire planet.

We caught them with their pants down shorting a stock 140%. How do you sell 140% of something you don't even own? The media says the short squeeze is over. They said it was over a month ago on CNBC when Gamestop was worth $20 (a 100% increase in a week). Then they said it was over when it spiked up to $40. Again when it hit $150. Its not over. Its only just begun because there is no way for them to buy back 140% of a stock when we are proudly holding a decent percentage of it and refuse to sell. These Wallstreet firms will either change the rules of the game or go bankrupt. Either way stay tuned for more news when it spikes up again later this month."

To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or ""counterfeit"" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.

Much of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.

One thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**Methodology**

I'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.

**The Code**

    from collections import defaultdict
    import time
    import requests
    POLYGON_API_KEY = '<ADD YOUR API KEY HERE>'
    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY
    
    data
    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))
    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm
    for line in f:
        parts = line.split('|');
        date = parts[0]
        ticker = parts[2]
        try:
            fails = int(parts[3])
            price = float(parts[5])
            value_of_fails = price * fails
            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)
        except ValueError:
            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')
            pass
    
    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():
        day = int(date[-2:])
        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))
        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])
        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] > 10000000, sorted_stocks)
        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:
            val_of_fails = data[0]
            num_fails = data[1]
            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))
            res = req.json()
            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':
                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))
                continue
            else:
                try:
                    volume = res['volume']
                except KeyError:
                    print(res)
            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)
            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100
            print('{: <6} ${: <5} {: <9} / {: < 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))

Here's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.

If everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value > 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.

EDIT - Someone pointed out a mistake in my script. Fixed, and added a bit more data

EDIT 2 - For those without enough brain wrinkles / attention span to interpret this - There may have been shady shit in the first few days of Jan, but doesn't look like anything went on in the second week. Will need to wait till Feb 15 to see data in the last few weeks of Jan. I'll probably do some more analysis when that time comes"
lapgwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lapgwo/for_those_wondering_why_bb_qnx_is_so_good/,For those wondering why BB QNX is so good,208,32,2021-02-02 14:33:53,"Information from Pixelcarve:

QNX is generally regarded among engineers as the most advanced, stable and secure operating system in the world. As such it is trusted by the likes of NASA for mission critical operations, large nuclear power stations, factories, high-speed train control systems, and an endless array of embedded systems that require 0% downtime. QNX has earned its reputation and many in the computer industry believe that if QNX had chosen to compete with Microsoft and Apple and pursue a consumer sales route rather than an enterprise route, the world of computing would be generations ahead of where it is now. 

So what makes it so great? QNX is built on a micro-kernel, which means that the core component of the OS (the kernel) only contains the bare minimum amount of code that can provide the mechanisms required to run an operating system. The remaining functions in a typical kernel (Monolithic OS) such as the filesystem, device drivers, application IPC, etc. are instead run outside of the kernel in the user space. Essentially what this means is that the kernel is the only software executing at the most privileged hardware level and is therefore infinitely more secure and stable. Bad drivers, software or executions can’t bring it down.

Micro-kernels also allow for RTOS, which simply means an operating system with guaranteed consistency for how long it takes to accept and complete a task. For a real-life scenario, think about the ABS brakes on a car – they require mission critical specifications to occur in real-time or someone can die, so the system running them has to be able to guarantee the delivery, receipt and execution of messages in X amount of time or it does not qualify at RT.

The benefits of this architecture are too numerous to get into here, but one of the main benefit to RIM is its ability to execute multiple platform runtimes at the same time with high efficiency – this is why you can write an application in C/C++, Adobe AIR, Webworks HTML5, and Java and have them all run natively on BlackBerry 10. The benefit to developers and consumers here cannot be understated. Basically ANYONE with any amount of programming experience can make an app, from high-level web based UI’s to low-level 3D games.

QNX takes their design one step further by also offering POSIX support, which is a family of IEEE standards that helps maintain OS and software compatibility. Being a full POSIX system, and not partly POSIX, ensures it’s a lot easier to develop software for the QNX platform."

Here’s some DD for anybody who doesn’t eat breath and sleep only GME.


eBay, like most other online retailers, are going to have ludicrous numbers in this last quarter due to the holiday season. That’s just a given. 


I am an experienced eBay seller who on a weekly basis for the last few years, sells around 15-20 items. The last few months was ridiculous. Items which were posted that would have around 10 bids and 5-15 watchers, would have 25-30 with 20+ bids. The views on each item was double to tripe from early November until pretty much the last two weeks. 


Lots of volume, lots of selling, lots of 10% commissions for eBay. Now we all saw what happened with Apple, posting 100+ Billion in revenue this last earnings report and being down 3% the next day. That shit happens, I’m not a psychic with a magic ball. If the market is tanking, the market is tanking. Look at it this week. But I will say this, the volume on eBay isn’t why I’m going fucking hard in the calls. Here’s the real cherry on top:

eBay has now finally implemented a payment policy they have been working on for a long time. Every single one of my sales went through PayPal, along with everybody else. Every single god damn transaction PayPal got their dirty little claws into. Since I think like the beginning of eBay, it’s just been a given that they give PayPal millions of dollars every month to run their transactions.


Well guess what you mother fucker. Shit had changed. Since they have now implemented their STRAIGHT TO BANK ACCOUNT POLICY, PayPal doesn’t even exist. The money goes, you guessed it, straight to your account. They even have their own return feature which they deal with themselves now, instead of putting funds into hold on PayPal. eBay allows you to chose when you get paid and in what frequency. For example, I have mine setup for each Tuesday of every week. 

This is going to and has already saved them MILLIONS in fees. Papa Musk has already moved on from PayPal, it’s time we do the same.


Oh, did I mention all the new payment platforms introduced as well? I bought a Pokémon card the other day without gay as shit PayPal but through god damn Apple Pay. It was way too easy. You can also link credit cards, bank accounts, whatever. It’s 2021.


eBay posts earnings in a few days, Wednesday after close. Do what you want. If the stock goes down, call me a retard and make fun of me. If the stock goes up, fuck off and thank me later. Look at what it did today. I’ll probably sell a third of my calls on Wednesday for an IV hedge as well. Play at your own risk. 


TLDR; My positions are eBay CALL 05/FEB/21 60CALL , 62CALL and 65CALL"

lamill,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamill/bb_dd_no_meems_part_2/,$BB DD - NO MEEMS - PART 2,534,81,2021-02-02 11:39:58,"TOday I did research to calm myself down after pounding a redbull and getting triggered by all the misinformation and greedy nitwits that have flooded this site looking for a quick flip.

Imagine you’re John Chen. Sauntering down the hallway, with your 50 pound dick grazing the velveteen carpet with each step. You hear the guttural screams coming out of sales. You walk by the engineers, and gaze upon the latest widget as they kowtow before your bespecled grandeur. You hear about the customers who sing your praises, and the (much fewer) ones who tell you your product sucks donkey balls... But we (the retards @ WSB or frankly the dubmasses @ seeking alpha and even JP Morgan equity coverage) don’t know the details any of this, only dry ass reports that come out every quarter.

So, other than hacking into John’s brain (not recommended), what can we do? We can suckle at the teat of Twitter announcements, and sometimes that’s fun but usually it’s PR driven (unless it comes from Papa Chen’s account in which case suckle away).

But boy oh boy wouldn’t it be great if we could know the things P. Chiddy does. What new things are in development. Big new sales in the pipeline. Whether the company is hiring (or shrinking), and in what areas….Wait. For the last thing we actually can!

thanks to the grotesquely fat (and very rich, no offense Gabe) founder of a soul-crushing professional network called LinkedIn. Linkedin, very kindly, takes employment related info from companies and displays it for all the world including competitors of those companies and bored autists like me. So let’s see - What Can headcount trends @ $BB tell us about the company?

To start, I took a look at Job Postings / Total Headcount. If you’re a shrinking company, this should be a low number. If you’re growing, it stands to reason this % would be higher. No company deliberately hires people they don’t think they need, and last time I checked $BB’s CFO wasn’t completely retarded. Now, it’s important not to read too much into this, but as a general matter companies that are growing have high stock prices (b/c they’re growing, duh) and vice versa.

FANG isn’t a perfect comp (I’ll get to the others in a sec), but **serves as a good proxy of a “baseline growthy” tech.** No super saiyan rocketships at this point, but nobody is accusing $AAPL of shrinking. See below.

&#x200B;

# IMPLICATION NUMBER #1 - $$BB COMPARES FAVORABLY TO FANG IN TERMS OF HEADCOUNT-IMPLIED GROWTH. IF YOU SAID “$BB IS HIRING MORE RELATIVE TO ITS SIZE THAN THE AVERAGE FANG”, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AND THROW BANANAS AT YOU, BUT YOU’D BE RIGHT!!

“But wait,” you say. “growthinvestor123 you fucking idiot, [didn’t you just compare $BB to CRWD, ZS, SAIL, and PANW](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/) to justify a **$60 / share** price target for $BB? I want to see the ratios for those.” Ok you, got me. See below, headcount-implied growth is higher for endpoint security comparables.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eaz3begzize61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d01221903b3c50a6838710f32daa173035eb9e92

“Hah,” you say smugly. “Those other endpoint security businesses blow $BB out of the water, $BB sucks”.

No, you fucking idiot. If a simple headcount ratio without context was all it took I’d be rich instead of handsome like mommy tells me.

$BB went through [**round**](https://channeldailynews.com/news/layoffs-hit-blackberry-in-waterloo/28015) after [**round**](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=blackberry+layoffs&atb=v224-1&ia=web&iai=r1-3&page=1&sexp=%7B%22cdrexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22artexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prodexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prdsdexp%22%3A%22c%22%2C%22biaexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22msvrtexp%22%3A%22b%22%7D) of painful layoffs as it shifted from being a handset business to what it is today. Despite what the trust fund communists on this site would want you to think, firing people is never easy, and a lot harder than even hiring them. No manager wants to see his team shrunk,and no CEO wants to be painted as a chainsaw wielding asshole. $$ BB has a **history**, and that is a blessing and a curse.

**Remember**, Daddy chen’s primary focus for the past almost-decade has been driving a turnaround. The handset team? Gone. Money-losing International operations? Gone. But the smart monkes and useful apes who might be able to do more than throw feces at each other??? And these smart monkes who were retained – Well, no need to make a job posting for that role anymore, right?

# IMPLICATION #2 – BLACKBERRY HAD > 20K EMPLOYEES. UNTIL RECENTLY THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CUTTING, NOT GROWING, AND ONE OF THE FEW BENEFITS OF ITS PAST SHITTY HISTORY IS THAT THE COMPANY CAN NOW GROW VS. HAVING TO FIND NEW EMPLOYEES QUICKLY LIKE CERTAIN COMPETITORS

This brings me to the final part of our headcount analysis. Let’s look at those endpoint security comparables again. Headcount is one thing, but of the quality of that headcount? Let’s look at two two non-retard quotes –

***""I have my own theory about why the decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The product starts valuing the great salesmen, because they're the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company."" Steve Jobs***

***“If your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it’s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.” Peter Thiel***

I was curious and did comparison of the ratio of $BB’s Engineering / IT monkeys to its sales. See below

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6nog6m62jze61.png?width=524&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb26266cbef428abb3152f1b9077c1a0daee07b0

Even as a $BB bull, I didn’t expect the discrepancy to be so large.

# IMPLICATION #3 – BLACKBERRY ACTUALLY IS MORE OF AN ENGINEERING / IT FOCUSED COMPANY RELATIVE TO ITS PEERS. IN MANY WAYS IT IS MORE OF A “START-UP”. EVEN WITH FINANCIAL PRESSURE, JOHNNY CHEN RETAINED TECHNICAL TALENT. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE COMPANY’S FUTURE, AND VALUATION ???

**TLDR: BB IS NOT A ROCKET SHIP. IT IS A LONG RANGE SHUTTLE, CAPABLE OF BURSTS OF SPEED, PACKED TO THE GILLS WITH RETARDS AND TERRAFORMING EQUIPMENT AND HEADING TO MARS.**

The problem is, if they truly ran out of money, why wasn’t buying halted altogether? Stocks like Tesla, apple, Amazon, etc, those all still continued to trade, meaning that they still had funds to clear.

Nasdaq posted an article on January 29th saying that the GameStop short interest was at 121.07% [link here](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-these-the-best-heavily-shorted-stocks-to-buy-right-now-5-names-to-watch-2021-01-31?amp), and S3 Partners lost credibility in my eyes by contradicting themselves on the same day on a Sunday.

This is NOT financial advice, but what I believe is that the price is being manipulated as low as possible before they REALLY start to cover.

I only have 1 share, so I don’t really give a shit, I bought in at $376 on Friday and I’m okay with watching it burn to the ground.

If you have a lot of money invested, reconsider if you wanna keep all that money in there. If you wanna go full ape💎👐🏼, go right ahead and support the cause🚀

https://www.evernote.com/shard/s406/sh/c770a0f8-21e9-75b5-9fa1-8afe83712c8a/b5c179b3717cccf990bd14b187d71dce

**Thesis:**  
With the advent of online gaming and e-sport, Gamestop is prime to make a turnaround and grow again assuming it will change direction and adapt post Covid. The support of Ryan Cohen, a e-commerce marketing guru, has brought hope to a once-beloved brand and ignited the flame of this reality.  The stock is also enticing because of its 138% short interest which is the highest percentage in the market. Thus, a remote chance of a short squeeze could occur. *Majority of investors do actually believe in the company and is not in it for  just the short squeeze opportunity. *    
&nbsp;

--  
**Background:**  
Gamestop was once the most prolific gaming retailer in the brick and mortar time period. They made their profits by rebuying used games/gaming paraphernalia at low prices and marking them up greatly. They relied mainly on foot traffic due to a subpar online presence and they were slow to change. The low price and convenience of online shopping had won over shoppers causing the demise of brick and mortar. Large brands started disappearing left and right and now it was Gamestop's turn with a boost from Covid. Investors wrote GameStop off as a dinosaur company with its shares eventually dropping to $2.5 dollar.

--  
**Results:**   
Hedge funds saw this and decided to go short on them, betting on their demise like all the others. The funds abused the mechanism of the market to cause a large selling pressure onto the stock, forcing the stock price down and accelerating the demise. Could this be manipulation? If a hedge fund were to short a company out of spite, they could very possibly bankrupt a company.  

--  
**How did Gamestop survive for so long?**  
Even though they weren't raking in e-commerce profit, they were still profitable. It was just that that profit stream was shrinking. The profits were also concentrated at a fraction of their stores. As they closed unprofitable stores, they were able to offset cost slightly. Investors were also holding on to the imminent release of the new console super cycle. Investors noted that the golden days were right after the new consoles were released and Dec 2020 couldn't come quicker. Gamestop was patience and managed their financials well with a strong balance sheet. Investors had underpriced the real estate of theirs. They were not valued for growth anymore so they weren't in a situation to raise capital risk free. They have several billions in short-term and long-term debt but  they had 600 million cash in hand to cushion with. Lastly, the Nintendo switch had just came out and was the best selling gaming console ever. Gamestop rode the tailend of Nintendo success all through 2020 with Switch sales offsetting losses in the other gaming segments.  
https://www.evernote.com/shard/s406/res/8832d8fd-2fda-68ce-77ac-5ab3f362f936  

--  
**The turnaround:**  
A new management team had join in August 2019 that set to slim down the company. They were much more aggressive and sought to aggressively close stores. A comprehensive turnaround plan called GameStop ReBoot  was announced with 4 elements:   
  
1. Optimized the Core Business  
	Reducing unprofitable stores and focusing on what works  
2. Become the Social / Cultural Hub for Gaming  
	Turning Gamestop into a experience center and not just a store  
3. Build a Frictionless Digital Ecosystem  
	Revamp the supply chain to be e-commerce focused  
4. Transform Vendor Partnership  
	Rekindle and make new partnerships   
  
Like all new managements, this one needed time but unfortunately Covid complicated the plans. Investors became increasingly doubtful and even bearish. However, they had underestimated the future of gaming. 

--  
The first significant move was bringing Reginald Fils-Aimé onto the board of directors. Reginald was known for his market prowess bring Nintendo to what it is today. Investors loved that. 

--  
As Covid happened, working from home and home entertainment exploded. Logitech, Corsair, Bestbuy exploded. Online gaming was projected to be very ludicrous in the next decade and Covid had shorten this timeline. Online gaming took off. Activision, Electronic Arts, Zynga, Tencent all exploded. Apple app revenue from their gaming segment exploded. Investors had repriced these stocks higher taking advantage of the first player advantage. One notable company that changed in valuation was Logitech, they were a value company but relabeled to growth. What was missing from this list was Gamestop. The bullishness in gaming was there and everyone else profited. If there was hope of a GME turnaround, their valuation model would certainly flip to a growth model at higher PE multiples. It was only fair.    

--  
The next big event that occurred  was in October 2020. Gamestop announced a partnership with Microsoft which was the first real tangible milestone on the turnaround plan. Investors started to give the company a second look.  Microsoft Partnership caused shares to rally 30% in a day. A bullish sign that the big players haven't given up. However this was short lived as shorts continue to drive the price down as there was no concrete details on the revenue sharing partnership, only that ""for every Microsoft Xbox console that GameStop sells going forward, GameStop will get some percentage of the revenue from every digital full game download, DLC, microtransaction, and any subscriptions as well."" To me this sounds very bullish that Microsoft still believes in Gamestop.  
 
--  
Next came news that the well-respected businessmen Ryan Cohen released that he had bought up 13% of Gamestop shares, becoming a minority owner. Ryan Cohen was the founder of Chewy, a Petsmart online branch that outcompeted Amazon. Investors labeled him an e-commerce guru/genius. He had bought shares at $4.81 and slowly gobbled up more as the price increased. Rumors started speculating that Cohen would takeover and transform Gamestop and it was materialized when Cohen sent the management a very aggressive letter.  

--  
""GameStop’s leadership should immediately conduct a strategic review of the business and share a credible plan for seizing the tremendous opportunities in the rapidly-growing gaming sector. GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences – not remain a video game retailer that overprioritizes its brick-and-mortar footprint and stumbles around the online ecosystem.""  

--  
It was a do this or else there will be a hostile takeover. The letter was sent three weeks before Q3 Earnings and investors were now watching intensively for details of a roadmap or of a Cohen reference during the earning call. ER came around and management was mute beside the announcement of a shelf offering of 100mil. Company performance wise, they were negative on profit but had still beaten expectations. The expedited closure of unprofitable of the stores helped. The stock would have soared had not an offering been announce (offering dilutes shares) so instead GME dropped 17%. From the conference calls, many bull investors felt reluctantly weary of this turnaround while some even dismissed management consideration of Ryan and piled on to the shorts. A week later, a filing by Ryan Cohen showed that he had continued to believe that the stock was undervalued and bought even at $14.83. This news rekindled the speculation that Ryan Cohen was going to do a takeover. Stock bounced and soared to $22.35 dollars for the next few weeks before dropping to $17.35.    

--  
**Jan 2021 - The first squeeze:**  
Shorts were still convinced that Gamestop would not be turn around and so they held steady with a short interest above 130%. Some short sellers had left while new ones piled on.    

--  
Monday, Jan 11th, Gamestop decided to drop bombs to the short:  
- First with an announcement that there was 309% increase in e-commerce sales from 2019 holiday season, 4.8% increase in comparable store sales, 3.1% decrease in total sales.  
	- The biggest takeaway was that their new e-commerce strategy was working. 309% increase is massive. Also this followed their original plan to concentrate on their core. Rise in sales of profitable store was also shown. The closure unprofitable stores hit their total sales but it was not much and implied that these stores were dead weight. They slimmed their bleeding cost segment and increased their profit. This was super bullish.  
- Secondly, a board of advisor switch up was announced. Ryan Cohen and two main Chewy guys were hopping on, replacing 3 other people. 
	- Ryan essentially brought Chewy Management to Gamestop. They know have 1/3 of the company's vote.  
	- GME Management knew that a takeover was happening, hostile or not and so they opened the doors. They also expanded Ryan Cohen's ability to buy up to 20% of the total shares  
	- Permit And Hestia Capital also align more with his vision so that would put them at a 5/9 majority  
Result: Even with the news, the stock price stayed range bound at 20.5 and volume was extremely low for that Monday and Tuesday.  Shorts were once again depressing the price. However, Wednesday came and the first of the shorts closed their position while bulls bought calls. The stock soared. This catalyzed into a gamma squeeze to kick off the huge rally.  

--  
The analysis stopped dead of the gamma squeeze as these recent events have been a gray area of interpretation. Enjoy.

Seems like a lot of people want to chase the big money fast (OFC who wouldn’t want to do that) 

While this short-squeeze has been going on, and the sell off that just happened, a lot of good stocks has gone down, including Apple and Facebook after great earnings numbers. Even tho Tesla missed earnings expectations, Tesla is still a great investment. 

What’s interesting is that if anyone has watched Keith Gill (u/DeepFuckingValue ) YouTube videos (Roaring Kitty) he invested into GameStop because he states that he’s a value investor. (7/27/20 and 8/04/20)  
Keith Gill took the time and educated himself on GameStop’s position. 
Keith saw that GameStop was highly undervalued. He saw that they have more cash on the balance sheet and that the market cap was less than the amount of cash on the balance sheet. 
Keith researched about consumers spending habits on physical vs digital consoles and games. Also on physical games vs physical movies and physical music copies. 
Keith saw that GameStop has potential to make a lot of money on the new Xbox and PlayStation consoles.

You take out your BlackBerry G1000 and tell SiriQ to drive your wife and her boyfriend home as you head across the street to reminisce about the old life you left behind. You think to yourself *wow* *Siri has gotten 10 times better after BB bought over AAPL and merged Siri with QNX.*

You go out back to your usual spot but notice there’s a homeless man there sleeping in the dumpster. Andrew then says *It’s $42,069 for a handie*. Exactly the price of one GME share. Oh god… has he really not covered his short position yet? After some haggling you managed to get the price down to one silver bar. You take out your other phone, the Nokia G420 SLV Edition as payment but Andrew snatches it away from you. He throws your phone to the man in the dumpster and they both make a run for it. In the darkness you vaguely make up the back of the man’s shirt which read “Melvin Capital”.

I wrote an article 2 months ago about why WSB was running the equity markets. I explained how the rise of passive investing (ala Mike Green's thesis) was making it so that the marginal mover of capital was entirely passive, and this is leading to a war between retail (WSB) and hedge funds for the valuation of markets and basically the winner gets to lead the sheep (the passive money). It explains the massive run-up of Tesla/Nio and the endless bids from the likes of vanguard funds once they reach certain market cap hurdles. I won't go into this in depth. Those who wish to find out more should read my previous post and go look up Mike Green from Logica. 

I won't go into details on the gamma convexity squeeze dynamics, and how it is enhancing a lot of momentum and creating feedback loops, for those who want to read more, I would recommend Chris Cole of Artemis capital to talked about this dynamic in the podcast **End Game** with Grant William.

This time around, I will talk about two misconceptions of the market surrounding GME. I will talk about why attacking hedge funds like they are part of the establishment is also pretty misguided. And I will will go over my thoughts on what will happen next.  

**GME Misconceptions**

The two misconceptions on GME have to do with manipulation of GME shares by the brokers and that they are having to do this because the short sellers are trapped in an infinite money black hole. The problem with this narrative is that it ignores some fundamental understanding about how buying shares work. The prevention of GME buying really has nothing to do with market manipulation in collusion with Citadel or Melvin or any market makers. The fact is that the market makers are running trillion dollar flow books and couldn't care less, and Robinhood is not a broker for any hedge funds. The real reason is that some of these smaller brokers don't have enough working capital to fund the required collateral by clearing houses (which was raised on them over the past few days), this is why the largest guys like Fidelity didn't have that issues. Which is why many brokers are drawing down their banking lines (such as Robinhood drawing down $1 billion from banks). Once they bring on enough liquidity, they will enable them again, but until then, we still live in a T+2 settlement world in which brokers have working capital needs. The implementation was retarded, but the brokers basically panicked when they saw their working capital deplete rapidly.

The other misconception has to do with WSB finding in infinite money wormhole. Trust me, I was there when a relative value Fund I interned at in 2009 basically went bust when a short selling ban was implemented. I was there when the Italian banks were on the verge of collapse, sitting on my 10x delta puts with a seven figure paper profit as a 26 year old when Draghi announced LTRO and blew my portfolio up. There are a lot of things that would stop the infinitely money machine, especially if you have been around long enough and have seen all the games being played. One such way is that management can simply issues new shares (likely through a privately placement deal with the short seller consortium), and the likelihood goes up the more the price goes up. Another way is that the SEC could step in and put a short term trading halt while forcing the short sellers into a deal with mgt. 

**Misplaced Hatred of Hedge Funds**

If one looks around the financial landscape today, Hedge funds are actually a dying breed. The young put about 80% of their capital to work in passive while the boomers that are exiting have historically placed about 80% of their capital to work in active funds. As a result, since about  2008, active managers such as mutual funds and hedge funds had actually been dying, even though they played almost no role during the 2008 GFC. If anything, many hedge funds identified problems in the system way earlier and most of the people in the big short were successful hedge fund managers. The problem was that the rise in passive and the fed had manipulated price signals so much so that one cannot actually make money arbitraging value (long undervalued, short overvalued) in a world less and less flow cares about value. 

The narrative being promoted by those who do not understand markets is that these evil hedge funds were shorting stocks, bankrupting companies and forcing layoffs. This could not be further from the truth. The value of a share in a secondary market has no impact on the day to day business of a company. A company could trade at 0 value, but if it generates healthy profits and has a strong balance sheet, it will keep going, hiring people and expanding. The truth is that these ""evil"" hedge funds were managing long short books. They were owning things like Facebook, Apple or it could be distressed debt they thought were undervalued, they were hedging their long book with things they think could go bust in the event of an economic downturn/crisis. 

**What Happens Next**

The effects of the GME short squeeze should not be underestimated, not because of the money lost by shorts on its position of somewhere around $20 billion (that's peanuts in financial markets terms). The full ramification is actually on the long side, from hedge funds who no longer feel like they can hedge out their downside by shorting fundamental unsound companies. I would not be surprised if the action in the markets in the past several days is just the beginning of large unwind because hedge funds will have to now reduce their risk position in their longs, the ramification of which will be in the hundreds of billions to trillions. It could very well be that this de-risking by active managers will lead to the start of a larger correction in the broader market. And as we have seen during the March selloff, without active managers who have cash on their books, who are the buyer of last resort, but instead passive flow, who actually tend to go bid-less in a market crash, we could see increasing volatility the likes we have never seen before. 

If the market does crash, congress may blame this on ""reckless speculators"" and ban option trading for those under certain income/networth thresholds. just as hedge funds are being scapegoated for 2008 despite being innocent, retail may be scapegoated for the next crash despite the real driver of volatility being the rise of passive money. The lack of retail participation in options may mean that he gamma squeeze dynamics will end. 

I have taken off most of my long positions and am sitting on cash and reloading VIX calls and some weekly ATM SPX puts.  Congraduations, you autists have beaten hedge funds (who are more like whales being hunted to extinction than fierce sharks) in the first major battle, but have set yourself to lose one of your most important tools (gamma squeeze). I would suggest taking out your gains and buying downside protection, maybe you'll gamma squeeze the market into a 50% correction and turn yourself into a high-net-worth (HNW) so you can bypass any future retail restrictions."

l9p1xu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9p1xu/shkreli_on_gme_131/,Shkreli on GME - 1/31,839,520,2021-02-01 07:29:44,"Gamestonk. Gamestop. GME. My thoughts are on Reddit, under my u/martinshkreli & subreddit r/martinshkreli. Those are authentic and discuss why GME is one of the most unprecedented events in market history. Here, I'm going to discuss the populist attitude that is creeping into this odd situation and add some thoughts on short-selling in general.
  
Let's cover my own unique angle on the concept of a 'short squeeze'. Most would define it as an erratic upward change in price driven by short-covering. I believe short-squeezes defined this way are usually a fictitious idee fixe that aggregates a number of discrete market behaviors and dynamics into a convenient and pithy moniker. The image of python-like buyer constricting some hapless speculator into a higher stock price is evocative but misleading. Many knew me as a short-selling specialist on Wall Street, focused on 'binary events' of biotech stocks. I think I've seen it all: I was once short more than 75% of a company's shares outstanding (I do not recommend this). I bought 75% of a company on the open market, etc.
  
Short-sellers are governed by the same market dynamics as longs. They get nervous when positions go against them and consider exiting. Like longs, they can double down if they wish. The only difference is that, of course, short positions grow when stocks rise. And they can rise infinitely, while long positions fall asymptotically to zero. But both get, theoretically and assuming no fundamental changes have occurred, more attractive as they move against the trader.
  
Short sellers have to pay borrow fees to longs (typically tiny, but sometimes massive). They have to locate stock to short, again usually easy, but sometimes difficult. Both are perilous when those rare adverse times arise. Why? Despite the possibility of a growing cost of renting stock, the ultimate fear of a short-seller is a ""buy-in"". It is nightmarish and has only happened to me once or twice, excluding options-related activity. A buy-in occurs when a broker decides to forcibly exit the short position on behalf of the trader because the broker and trader cannot secure the 'locate' which is supposed to underlie the short sale. The buy-in order is typically violently disruptive: a market order for the whole position near the closing hours of the market! The SEC published a list of stocks at risk of buy-in: the fail to deliver list.
  
My point is that a 'short squeeze' can only practically affect the trader for two reasons. The first is that the trader digs in, doubles down and doesn't exit as his position grows. That's bad trading, and will eventually blow the trader up. But, if the stock is a 'good short', that short will be replaced by more traders with stronger hands/a better entry price/smaller position. What's more is the average investor can't tell if this is happening! The second is the buy-in. I haven't heard GME shorts being bought in, but again, how would you know, other than the grapevine? My point is most of the disruptive, exciting trading here is simply long speculators banging away at the stock.
  
New longs are sometimes attracted to rising prices, speculating they'll increase further: that's called momentum. Those buyers are typically offset by the existing longs who are excited to exit at higher prices. But, if there is a large short position in the stock, a speculator may feel that those covering (buying to get out) short-sellers will provide additional fuel to the momentum. That's sometimes the case, but higher prices should lead to more supply from both long and short sellers. My feeling is the actions of large long holders probably have more influence on the stock price than shorts who dart in and out, and typically in smaller size. Remember that shorts who capitulate are often just replaced by new shorts who are attracted at the new lunar prices.
  
In essence, 'short squeezes' become a self-fulfilling prophecy as new long investors pile in trying to 'squeeze' this sometimes phantom of a short seller, and existing long investors may hold off selling for the same reason. With some Popperian skepticism you will easily see that the same dynamic can exist without the short boogeyman, or with a short boogeyman of any size. Speaking of which, where is Chanos and his slavish groupie, Carson Block? 
  
Speculative momentum can occur for any reason. Let's not forget that the 'trapping shorty' strategy is an awkward idea for a few reasons. Short sellers are often sophisticated market participants who are betting on the decline of a stock. You usually don't want these type of traders sniffing around your favorite longs: I recall writing a 'short report' on a stock to watch it fall 50% that day. If you do a study of stock returns of highly shorted stocks, they are pretty awful. The reason there is 'no arbitrage' is the borrow rate. 
  
But even if you got this poor short to capitulate and squeeze, the amount of buyers who are now holding stock at absurdly high prices put way more energy (and money) into the stock than the short seller's white towel ever could. A sledgehammer killed the fly: now what? Alternatively, are you the host or the parasite?
  
On populism. I don't really think most investors or speculators should go into any investment thinking that there is 'an enemy'. Concentrated (big) investments (bets) give rise to emotional behavior, typically the enemy in trading and investing as it clouds rational thinking. It's a lot better to be Socratic with your 'opponent' and understand what they're thinking. If your position were to be half the size it currently is, would you be as emotionally interested? Try it! You'll lower your risk and feel better.
  
Some of the behavior going on at WSB sounds more jihadist than speculative. The idea that there are some investors who are 'good' and others who are 'bad', or that there is an 'establishment' is BS. Everyone has the same goal: I have a pile of money, I'm trying to make it bigger, fuck your pile--I don't care about it. Anything other goal is contrived, foolish and won't help you win. You can't 'fight the rich' by trying to become one of them. Don't you see the irony? A related thought experiment: what if this trade continued to work really well? And another, and another? Then some WSBers are billionaires. Aren't they the new 'enemy/establishment?'
  
Who do you think hedge fund managers are? They're typically the anti-establishment. Things have changed a bit, but the most successful HFMs are actually the WSBers of the past. These are guys who didn't fit in well at i-banks, often got kicked out for having big mouths or not wearing the right ties, or just wanting to wear jeans at work and not fill out TPS reports. When they started their firms, people like Soros, Icahn, Steinhardt, Robertson, Cohen, Griffin, Loeb (who has posted anonymously on boards), Samberg, even Cramer were fish out of water and had very tiny amounts of capital, often begging for investors.
  
The need for an enemy. To sustain increasingly insane behavior, it isn't uncommon to use a straw man or a scapegoat. Oppressive regimes used this technique in the past, and the media uses it today. Retail investors don't have much power individually. With your $5k RH account, you can't day trade or even qualify for margin. It's pitiful. So, it's understandably quite exciting to finally feel like a 'player' that you read about. To be a part of 'something'. The problem is the media is goading you to be somewhere between a lemming and a life-agnostic but impotent jihadist. Blowing yourself up won't impress anyone, and there is no afterlife here, other than a minimum wage career and mom's sofa. GME and shorting in general is small potatos in the scheme of the Wall St. machine. Don't worry about getting 'even' with the rich. That's jousting at a windmill that will waste your energy.
  
No one here, hopefully, wants to be a lemming. Those willing to 'die on this hill' have to realize something: Wall Street doesn't care about its speculators. The new traders who vanquish the old simply replace them. Nothing changes. When LTCM blew up, or Amaranth, Visium, Galleon, or anyone else, it is 'out with the old and in with the new'. So, perhaps WSB can blow up 1 hedge fund or maybe 5, but so what? Eventually, the tables will turn and it will blow up. The leveraged, fast-money trading markets are a violent place and the only people who care one whit are the brokers charging fees (directly or indirectly). They only care to make sure the sorry carcasses can pay their bills. They know there will always be another speculator lined up, ready to shove his money into the lotto machine. There is no pride here. There is no credit for being a good solider. You either survive or you don't. Your job is to survive and thrive. Becoming a lemming will guarantee failure as per the statistical truism of gambler's ruin (enjoy the proof in measure theory). With enough time, anyone playing a game with <50% success rate (equal payouts), will lose all their money. Get that number above 50%. Add the Kelly Criterion to your trading strategy.
  
You might ask, ""(that's all well and good OR we'll agree to disagree) but, Mr. Shrek, isn't this a good trading strategy? (ganging up on shorted stocks)?"" As long as you're not a lemming/jihadist (willing to walk over the cliff, whether or not you have a ""cause""), and you ignore a somewhat slimy ethical/market manipulation question, I don't see anything wrong with it. There are better ways to make money, since you're asking. Stoking (or worse, participating in) a buying frenzy that is akin to a forced musical chairs game is a little crazy. Once a stock is absurdly valued, you're just hoping the sell-off doesn't happen while you're holding it. If you have enough lemmings or jihadists 'helping you', that's a good thing. They will hold your bag--someone needs to. 
  
Of course, if you've found the ""next"" Microsoft or Apple, no one needs to hold any bags. But, no company can increase its objective (aka fair) value quickly enough for this... phenomenon? situation? absurdity?... to make it reasonable. Those things take years, go slow and steady, and this frenzied buying/""short squeeze"" phenomenon won't let value play a factor. That's why WSB GME longs have shifted theses from ""well, Gamestop was/is cheap"" to ""the gaming cycle"" to ""Ryan Cohen will save us"" to ""...jihad?!""
  
Each member of the herd has its own financial parameters, too. Some may have $500, some $50,000,000 or more. Some may be willing to lose their entire stake (and even more) on an out-of-the-money or levered trade. Some are not. Some were in the latter and somehow end up in the former. Some are in one column at one price and another column at another--some are switched from column to column by force. Today's lemmings/jihadists are tomorrow's sellers. When you're hanging off the mountain, pay attention to the guy holding the rope.
  
Loosely 'coordinated' buying can certainly affect stocks. Heavily shorted stocks and small cap stocks are the kind that require less capital than typical to 'move' a stock. The irony here is when putting on a position, the trader's goal is typically NOT to move the stock with his actions!
  
I still think GME is wildly overvalued, but that doesn't exactly mean I'm 'bearish'. One funny idea here is reflexivity: GME stockholders may become serious GME customers and the company's fundamentals improve that way! Excluding some such miracle, eventually GME stock will trade at <50 again. I still think it will trade at 1,000 or more BEFORE that happens, and that the decline process will take a long, long time (several years). Keep in mind, anything can change. GME can do serial secondaries that destroy its stock. Management's job is to create value for their shareholders--but perhaps they will avoid pissing them off. There's a strange loop! Finally, the stock could be halted by the SEC or completely banned by brokers. Don't overdo it. Watch the borrow rate. Keep your positions at less than 25% of your capital--live to play another day. 
  
Disclosure: I've never traded GME stock and do not intend to.

If you have EXTRA money and are already hodling GME, or cannot afford GME you should join the BLNK train.**

So let me preface this by saying **BLNK** will not be the next **GME**. There will probably not be another **GME**. For starters it's not going to have an army of kids who used to shop there 15 years ago hyping it, not to mention over 100% short interest and the fact that in the early days it wasn't even 1b dollar market cap.. But it can a squeeze of it's own for it's own reasons entirely and so I have spent time looking beyond just the stock price movements which is what initially led me to start the idea of a **BLNK** DD. I do want to point out some things I noticed while the big squeeze started happening.

* A lot of companies with high short interest such as **IRBT** and **BLNK**, along with those more talked about companies such as **AMC** just started causing the shorts to cover all sorts of positions and move their money around. **BLNK** share price was up to about 65 dollars before falling down to 50 over the past 2 days. It has reached 55 dollars in the past so this wasn't even a squeeze it was just a few shorts deciding to cover their positions most likely because they were getting reamed elsewhere, or just a natural run up because people seem to really like **BLNK** stock. As a matter of fact, they like it so much that it is up *2400%* from 1 year ago. And it's still got relatively small market cap though we aren't in the millions anymore.
* If **BLNK** were to actually squeeze as hard as some of these other companies  have been and somehow reach **GME**'s current 20b dollar market cap it's share price would be $500 dollars. There are plenty of companies with 20 billion dollar market cap. If it just pulled an **AMC** and only jumped 200% in a day it would still be at 150 dollars. Of course if you believed **GME** squeezed already you're obviously mistaken yourself, but the sentence still applies that **BLNK** 10x would still leave it at only 20b market cap.

Is this realistic? Lets take a look at the ways in which **BLNK** is SETTING ITSELF UP to make money in the future, and I say that because as we go into details later you will realized they are currently not exactly succeeding financially, though when has that stopped a company from turning into a success in the past? We will also take a little bit of look at the short interest. Also, these are the kinds of companies who continue to gain more short interest as the price continues to rise.

Okay so **BLNK** is not some new company who just started because of the EV hype, **BLNK** has been a public company since only 2018 but has been a private company since 2008. They had a different name, but merged and acquired a few companies or something, and somehow ended up with the name **BLNK**. Many companies fight for years to break out of the depths of nothingness into a sound business model. According to their CEO: They design, manufacture, maintain, own, and operate charging stations. Their main business goal is to be the owner and operator, so they can be the fuel of the future. They put their focus on areas where you have no other choice but to use public charging.

**BLNK revenue comes from a few different things:**

* **Selling charging equipment:** They sell to third parties Okay, this is not great, but when you add the fact that they are **VERTICALLY INTEGRATED** it really changes the narrative a bit. **AAPL** just decided to go vertically integrated by designing building their own chips for their products, when you design your product and control the supply chain you can make greater strides to improving your margins and expanding your business through natural growth.
* **Utilization**: from people utilizing their charging stations, this is standard and easy to understand. They apparently pay about .12 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity and charge about .39 cents per kilowatt hour. These are pretty good margins and once more than 50% of the cars are the road become EVs this is going to grow exponentially. This will obviously take time but might not be as far away as people are trying to say either.
* **Network of charging stations:**  **BLNK** has it's own cloud based network which will collected *recurring* fees every month. It will also need to be managed, which is also recurring fees. This is also where shit gets interesting because they can use data integration of the network on top of utilization. Of course utilization is going to cost people money but what do we know about companies abilities to collect and sell data in the **AGE OF DATA**? We know that **DATA** is the next oil, that's something we do know, how long and how far will people go to learn your every move, where you charge your car, what stores you're nearby, for how long, etc. This data is will be worth money in time.

* **BLNK** recently acquired BlueLA, an EV carsharing company. This was a big move for a little company with negative earnings and cash flow, the fact that they are acquiring things leads me to believe they are actively trying to expand, and beyond just chargers as well. They seem committed to take on the EV industry without being a car manufacturer.
* **BLNK** inked a deal with Cushman and Wakefield, for those of you who do not know they are a global commercial real estate services firm.
* International expansion. **BLNK** has a deal in Greece with **Nissan** to provide chargers to anyone who buys an electric **Nissan**. These people will get access to all of **BLNK**'s network. Let me inform you simpletons who have never left your moms basement, in other countries they are taking the whole EV movement more serious than America has been for some time, with certain countries already having pledged to ban gas powered cars by certain dates. I know the USA is making strides too and not to mention we have Elon but even if penetration is slow here it will not be slow internationally.
* **BLNK** announced on Dec. 15th it was signing an *exclusive* deal with Blessing Health System.
* When **BLNK** signs these types of exclusive deals it often times has contracts for 5-15 years to be the sole provider of charging within the property, this includes charging of all types of equipment not only electric cars.
* **BLNK** received a grant aimed at facilitating the deployment of 200 Blink Fast Level 2 - 19.2 kW charging stations across the mid-Atlantic region, including locations in Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia and Washington, DC. I smell more grants with incoming administration.
*  On 28th of July, **BLNK** and **ENS** entered an agreement  to jointly develop high-power wireless and enhanced DC (direct current for you actual retards) fast charging (DCFC) systems with integrated battery storage for the transportation market. This shows they are looking ahead and willing to work with whoever they need to stay on top of the technology. The resulting DCFC charging solution with high power energy storage will purportedly feature a modular design, and a power output from 100-500 kW. Supposedly it is going to be “economically priced”. They are going to look like the concrete parking guard things we see all over the place and they will be able to wireless charge certain vehicles is the idea.
* On the topic of DC chargers (non wireless). **TSLA** uses this same tech for it's superchargers. What else are DC chargers going to allow in the future? Bi directional charging! With bi-directional charging you can go Vehicle to Grid or Vehicle to Home . This means cars can one day be used to help balance energy needs by allowing EVs to charge during off peak hours and give back during peak hours. This is futuristic shit. Lots of stuff to be excited about. If you are confused and don't care about the future, all you need to know today is that direct current chargers have the converter in the charger itself, so they are bigger and faster at charging cars than the AC converters which have to have an onboard converter which converts AC into DC to feed the battery.  It is also going to lead to people to wanting and needing more advanced charging solutions in their home rather than using the ""well I can just charge over night"" logic with a slow level 1 charger. Having the charger do the conversion is the way of the future. This is the way.
* **VERTICAL INTEGRATION**. Did I fucking mention they are a vertically integrated charging company? This is huge. This needs reiteration. This means they design their own product plus build their own infrastructure out, not to mention provide own their own network, technicians, everything. It is very ambitious and nobody knows how far **BLNK** can take their business yet, but what we do know is that EVs are the future and it is still only the beginning of the EV revolution. Advantages of Vertical Integration include lower costs, faster getting products to consumers, less supply disruption or them raising the price on the company, less transportation costs and reduced delivery turnaround times, improved sales and profitability. I really think this is big to the companies growth trajectory yet it is not widely available information about the company.

**Some Other Points to Consider**

* Supposedly **BLNK** has the only 80 amp level 2 charging station currently on the market. Why does this matter to the small brained? That means it's faster than other chargers you say? Sure, that could be technically true, if that's what it was used for. Then why does it matter? Because **BLNK** chargers have **load-sharing capabilities**. The **BLNK** IQ 200 has the ability to load-share between 2 and 20 units from a single 100 amp feed. This is going to be a game changer for apartments, hospitals, any MUD's, honestly any commercial space that has access to a hundred amp feed. They will be able to service many cars with that single feed. But it gets better, the IQ 200 can intelligently share power, and even queue up cars that are plugged in but not charging, so that they can charge once other cars finish charging. **BLNK** envisions higher output being necessary to facilitate larger companies electric fleets, which we can now see happening in the EV space with trucks and couriers looking to go electric. 
* **BLNK**'s pricing scheme seems to be superior to that of **Chargepoint**. For those of you who do not know **Chargepoint** is another EV charging company, who was recently acquired by **SBE** and they are voting in February to finalize everything I believe. With **Chargepoint** they just sell the chargers to apartments and such and let them determine the pricing. They only manage the network. This means if you have to fill your battery up you have to constantly double check prices to see if you are getting reamed from one of their chargers vs another one. On **BLNK**'s network they will charge the same price everywhere. This is a huge plus in my eyes. I am a little unclear which policy would be in effect for chargers that **BLNK** does not have on it's network, because as I've said it does sell equipment as well.
* **BLNK** has mobile chargers with the same power as their IQ 200 but in a mobile factor in case you run out of fuel on the road.
* **BLNK** does not give a shit to what kind of car you drive, it wasn't to fuel all electric vehicles of the future.
* Fleets are coming, **BLNK** seems ready for this.
* **BLNK** can have partnerships with and target the following sectors which we already see some starting to play out: Parking & Services, Commercial & Residential, Workplace, Healthcare, Education, Retail, Hospitality/Food & Beverage, Entertainment, Governmental.
* Consumer stores that add EV charging stations tend to see costumers staying in their stores longer according to data which I have not seen. This reiterates the point about being able to collect money from data.
* So you may or may not know that in the USA **TSLA** still owns about 80% market share of EVs. We also know this will not last forever as every car company and their mother's boyfriend on top of car companies we've never even heard of are all on the EV bandwagon right now. This is going to make a lot of cars that need charging stations and it will be impossible for any one company to win this battle we can safely assume there will be 2-4 major players.
* Low estimates are expecting the amount of charging stations in America to jump from between a quarter and a half million now, depending on if you are counting Gen 1, to low estimates stating there will be between 13 and 14 million charging stations over the next 7 or 8 years.

**The Possible Concerns that keep getting thrown around**

* **BLNK** seems to be issuing more public shares from time to time (yes, dilution) but we know that when a company is trying to raise capital to expand this is a common strategy, and I don't really think is something to be worried about as long as you believe EV's are really going to be the future. I do.
* **BLNK**'s owner and CEO Michael D Farkas sold shares last month, to the tune of 22 million dollars worth. This always makes companies look bad but many people who own and operate a business would scrape some off the top to support their family in case things don't go according to plan, not everyone is an Elon (and Elon was still set before **TSLA** lets be real), doesn't mean he is necessarily up to no good. Not to mention if shorts were attacking you with even shorter shorts every day would it not worry you a bit that they win? This is an ongoing battle for small companies that don't get along with Wall Street. Plus, he still has 6.7 million shares, he only sold about 540,000 for 22 million dollars. This is a drop in the bucket and the man should not be faulted for this, my opinion is that it is no warning sign.
* This might end up being a competitive space that could lower margins and cause financial hardships for the company. This is an actual concern. It could also take a lot longer than people are expecting to achieve meaningful penetration fully electric cars. I do think **BLNK** being poised to expand internationally will help them offset some of this.
* EV is just a bubble blah blah blah blah okay then don't buy any EV stocks, you might be right but you're also a little bitch.

&#x200B;

**BACK TO SHORT SHORTS**

&#x200B;

So if the last data I see on yahoo says that that the float is around 27 or 28 million. This is what's not held by insiders, who are unlikely to sell right now due to the fact that everyone knows we are collectively fucking over people who traditionally fuck them over. If a few weeks ago there was 8.8 million shares shorted and the average daily trading volume as of last week close was 14,263,640. This would make it a modest  .61 days to cover. While it's no **GME**, I do believe this is a pretty large short ratio. Especially when you consider how small the public float is. I do believe this situation will be amplified the further **BLNK** moves away from it's ""valuation."" Also with what we've seen this week these people are willing to double down on things because apparently maybe they are just as retarded as we are. 

So **BLNK**'s short interest is increasing at a rate of about 20% per every 20 dollars the stock rises. This is only a simple estimate based off of quick calculations but you can see that Dec. 15 the stock price was 28 dollars and amount of shares shorted was 6.18 million. On Jan 15th  the share price was $47 and the total amount of shares sold short were 8.8 million. That's about 23%. As of right now it's still less than a day to cover but that does not mean we can't see things get frothy from this point on. Most people think **BLNK**'s chance of success sit somewhere around the 0-3% mark I'd estimate based on the general sentiment not only here on WSB but also anywhere else on the internet you look. The consensus seems to be to stay away from it.

Months back some shady research company probably wrote a hit piece on **BLNK** causing it's share price to tank nearly 50%, it had no real substance, none of the claims were found to have any evidence of being true and it is being investigated by the SEC and such, This same company ran an inaccurate hit piece on **CLSK** some time ago. Culper Research is the name if you'd like to look it up and read the hit piece. **BLNK** managed to defeat the shorts that time but will they again? 

Did I mention who else hates **BLNK** charging? **SHITRON** himself. Here's a quote from the shitman himself back in November:

Shitron said, ""**BLNK**’s valuation makes no sense"" and called the company a “total scheme.” Left said it is “insulting” to call **BLNK** an EV stock.

“New most ridiculous EV stock is $**BLNK**. No $$ for R&D, management accused of securities fraud, no real revenues,” Shitron tweeted.

This goes without saying but every word that comes out of that mans mouth is horse shit. You know this. At this point, literally the whole world knows this. It's not even a question of does he write things based off of any evidence, we all know he would only say negative things that are to cause companies to go down because he has a position shorting them. Does he still have a position? Who knows, but we can safely assume at least at one point he did.

**I try not to use the** ***F*** **word but here goes a bit of simple** ***Fundamentals*** **for you tards:**

Current market cap: **1.85b** Don't need to remind you guys this is still tiny and can still go through some explosive growth at a market cap this small in todays world with the amount of retail investors that throw their money at the most retarded shit you could ever possibly think of, for reference look at **NKLA**. Pretty sure **NKLA** reached a 20b dollar market cap at one point.

**BLNK** has negative earnings per share, and although their revenue is increasing a good amount from quarter to quarter and beating expectations they only earned about 2.26 million last quarter. 

Last quarter GAAP EPS: -.12

Operating Income: -3.50 M

Profit margin: -285.81% 

Return on Equity: -97.33% This tells you how well they are spending their money. 

Yes those are negatives. Impressive, to say the least.

As a matter of fact just about everything you read about this company screams ""***SHORT ME!***"" Think about how many rich powerful scumbags are trying to run this company into the ground. Are they right? Or is EV charging just the future that has not come yet!? What I take from this is that they are spending every dollar they have trying to make it. This is all or nothing for this company. 

**Final Thoughts**

Can we think of any other companies with negative earnings per share that still ended up being great success stories? It's almost like that hasn't been the blueprint for the past 10 years now.. Will it work? Only time will tell. But it definitely will not if these short sellers have their way with it. Also for reference just look at **QS**'s 16b dollar market cap and they don't even have a product. **BLNK** at least has products that are currently going out into the world to be used. Of course the real move could just be puts on **QS,** but I stay out of bear territory especially during bull feeding frenzies. My outlook is that Billions are just the Millions of some years ago, especially when we're printing Trillions out of thin air (Obligatory shout out to the printer man himself **JPOW**). Just remember that we live in a brave new world where kids with phone apps can invest in what they believe the future is going to look like.

Lastly, this is a stock no one has restricted trading to yet, allowing people to buy more than 2-3 shares could seriously cause **BLNK** to quadruple in value. We've seen how fast small market cap companies can jump when millions of autists all buy shares at the same time. Strength in numbers. The revolution of the retail investor has only begun my friends.

Remember I'm just a retard not a financial advisor so this is not advice or anything but I'll let my positions speak for themselves:

**GME** 500 c jan 29 (RIP I TRIED TO IGNITE THE INFINITE GAMMA SQUEEZE GUYS, I DID MY PART AND BOUGHT THAT SHIT ON THURSDAY, GUESSING IF 500C WENT IN THE MONEY IT WAS GOING TO IGNITE A DOMINO EFFECT, I TRIED AND FAILED BUT I LOVE YOU ALL, BUYING MORE SHARES ON MONDAY)

**GME** shares

**PLTR** 30c May 2021

**BB** 14c Jan 2023

**BLNK** 14c Jan 2022

&#x200B;

TLDR: **BLNK** is the only vertically integrated EV charging company, **BLNK** has international presence, **BLNK** shares are up 2400% in the past year. It will take .61 days to cover and this number DEFINITELY rising, very small amount of float available, Shitron hates **BLNK**, so do all other short sellers, make no mistake they have put the hit out on **BLNK** and would love to see it run into the ground, **BLNK** is small enough to still rocketship pretty hard, **GME** to the moon."

I just got off a conference call with all your wives' boyfriends and I got some DD to drop on you. Everyone here knows about the big four stocks right now. If not, GTFO.

What I’m here to tell is to not focus 100% on these four and let other great opportunities pass you by. (Note – What I am NOT TELLING YOU is to sell your GME. Hodor that sh\*t). While you all have been foaming at he mouth over your GME games, you’ve likely missed what is going on with the rest of the market. Several great performing stocks have been dumping since this GME craze began. Oh, need examples?  To name a few you may have heard of: 

AAPL – Down 5.11% 

AMD – Down 7.7% 

BIDU – Down 7%

DOCU – Down 8.7%

F – Down 8.6%

PINS – Down 6.25%

NIO - down 8%

Wondering why this may be? Two theories They both might be right, or I might have a really smooth brain. 

1) These hedge funds everyone here is so keen on financially ruining need to cover their losses somehow. What better way than to liquidate stocks that have had crazy runs the last few months.  If this is true it will be extra enjoyable to watch them pay more to re-enter these positions when the stocks inevitably bounce back.

2) You people selling your shares in other stuff to buy more GME. (again, great job holding the line) I have seen several posts on here from other smooth brains selling their shares of some of those listed here. I applaud your enthusiasm for the cause and wish you the best. 

With these two combined, you end up with tons of shares dumping from these 401K stocks, with the buyers foaming at the mouth for more GME, NOK, AMC, BB. 

Once this is all over and the world of normies forget all about the GME madness, they are going to put their money back into their boomer stocks and standard 401K stocks. What does this mean for you? Don’t miss the dips happening all around you while the world is focused on 4 stocks and a shiba inu. If you have any extra money and cant afford GME, check out the rest of the market for buying opportunities. 

TLDR – Keep holding the line! If you have any money left, buy the dips on others for bonus tendies

(This is not financial advice)

Edit - added NIO."

AMC and GME are now historic, household names. Buffett didn't sell AAPL as shares climbed and climbed. He accumulated more every time public faith in the company wavered.


There is no price target for me. I will hold these shares until someone pries them from my cold, dead 💎👐. Asset prices will continue to climb, and there will be increasing systemic pressure to invest. When other investors see that we aren't just trying to play these stocks, but that they are icons, trophies in our war chest, they will join with us. I believe that no strategy beats buy and hold, especially when other investors believe that idea too. I won't trade this stock, I believe in what AMC represents: the rebellion against the 0.1% that will refuse to let them off easily for plundering coronavirus relief funds, causing the housing market crisis, and more.

Posting this article here as it seems like information worth digesting prior to the Robinhood mass exodus. Not advocating one way or the other, simply interested in the truth. To those of you that actually know... is this true? Article below:

A little-known intermediary in the process of buying and selling equities forced Robinhood and other brokers to restrict trading in several securities on Thursday, including GameStop , AMC Entertainment , BlackBerry , and Nokia . All have been swept up in the WallStreetBets-fueled short-squeeze phenomenon and have seen intense volatility in recent days.

Theories abounded online about Robinhood—a mobile-first, low-cost brokerage founded on the idea of expanding access to trading to more people—being in league with the “men in suits” at hedge funds on the losing side of those trades. Politicians on Twitter from across the political spectrum condemned the broker’s move. But Robinhood’s provided reason that it needed to restrict trading in those stocks until it could increase its collateral with the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation, or DTCC, holds water.

Explaining that requires getting into a bit of market plumbing and elements of the trading process that usually don’t get much attention.

When an investor orders their broker—Robinhood or E*Trade, for example—to buy or sell a security, the broker accepts the trade and sends it to an exchange like the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. The exchange then matches buyers with sellers, and from the investor’s perspective, the transaction is as good as done. But there are still some mechanics that need to be worked out behind the scenes.

Investors may have noticed that the cash proceeds from selling a stock aren’t immediately available to withdraw from their account after a trade is completed—that usually takes a business day or two. Back in the day, that time was spent physically exchanging stock certificates between brokers. Today’s trading volumes make that an impossible task.

Today, after a stock exchange completes a trade, it sends the information to the DTCC, which keeps track of brokers’ books. The DTCC is a clearing house, an important part of the financial system. Clearing houses not only process and complete trades in an efficient manner, they help limit systemic risk. The clearing house promises to make good on all trades that happen regardless of what happens to an individual broker.

The DTCC is responsible for transferring ownership of the stock from the seller’s broker to the buyer’s broker—and vice versa for the cash involved. Rather than doing that after every single one of the trillions of dollars of trades each day, the DTCC waits until it can net several trades into “one position per security, per client, per settlement date,” according to its website. The settlement date is the day when the cash and securities involved in a trade actually change hands.

At the settlement date, which falls two days after the investor places their trade, the seller’s broker must deliver the stock being sold and the buyer’s broker must provide the cash. The DTCC guarantees that the transfer will happen and eliminates the risk of a single broker going under rippling across the market.

In exchange, the DTCC collects a fee per trade and requires some collateral from the brokers to ensure they have the assets to complete the transaction. It’s like putting a refundable deposit on a purchase that reduces the middleman’s risk while the package is in the mail, with full payment due once it arrives. The DTCC’s collateral requirements for brokers are calculated by a much more complex formula, based on the specific shares’ notional value, volatility, and other variables.

For a relatively risk-free transaction—in liquid, less volatile stocks like, say, Apple (AAPL) or Microsoft (MSFT)—that collateral requirement could be around the order of 10% of the transaction value. For a stock like GameStop this week, the DTCC’s formula might spit out a collateral requirement several times higher than that because it takes on greater risk. That’s because the DTCC could be on the hook to deliver an asset that’s worth a materially different amount on the settlement date than the trade date if one of the brokers involved can’t complete the transaction.

When traders are using margin to buy, the broker needs to come up with the cash on its own. And when there’s a large imbalance between a broker’s buy and sell orders for a given security, it doesn’t net out as cleanly at the end of the day, meaning more collateral is required.

All of those factors applied to Robinhood and Gamestop on Thursday. The stock traded in a wide range from $112 to $438 on heavy volume, its users were predominantly placing buy orders for the shares, and many were using margin.

And those are the reasons the DTCC asked brokers for more collateral for each such trade. The clearing house didn’t want to be caught with brokers not having the funds they need to settle. Therefore, Robinhood and others restricted buying on these highflying stocks until it could come up with enough cash to pay collateral. Robinhood allowed users to sell the stocks because the selling broker puts up the shares as collateral, not cash.

Since then, the brokerage has drawn down its credit lines at several banks and brought in $1 billion from existing investors to fund additional collateral requirements. On Friday, Robinhood reopened buying of Gamestop and other recently popular stocks.

The DTCC says it processes trillions of dollars of transactions a day, including equities, bonds, mutual funds, and derivatives. It said that collateral requirements for all of its broker clients were $33.5 billion on Thursday, up from $26 billion the day before.

There are now 7M of us in here, this growth is insane and the movement is incredible, but do not be fooled... there are a large number of plants🌱 and snakes now in here with us.

Who cares I hear you say, they only want to laugh along and run a bit of sentiment analysis on us, no harm in that right?

**WRONG**.

**THEY WANT YOUR AUTISM.**

These motherfuckers will be attempting to bottle up our autistic tendencies and use them as a nuclear weapon to enrich themselves. Weaponized autism has been harnessed since the beginning of WSB but this latest event is up there with the discovery of Nuclear Fission and the invention of Chicken tenders. Please do not underestimate how crafty these slimy cunts will be now that our true power has been revealed to the world.

Significant resources will be directed and unleashed here (if it isn't already), I'm talking Cambridge Analytica/Nation-State bot farm level attacks to influence and control narratives, they will run clever and subtle social media strategies. Everything will be camouflaged as grassroots to lure us in and bite the poison apple.

We cannot let this happen but I'm afraid I do not come with answers or solutions, we need to crowdfund our defenses. We must be vigilant after this historical event plays out and we must protect the sub at all costs. This is about to become a real-life game of Among us.

Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. 

Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.

I've held AMD since November 2015 (@$1.94) and have weathered these speculative downturns many times. IMO the latest downturn is driven purely by an anticipated return to greatness due to Gelsinger's return. This confidence in Gelsinger is greatly misplaced for two reasons:

1. Gelsinger may be better than Intels past 3 dipshit ceos, but he's no Andy Grove. Gelsinger's retarded baby was Itanium, which AMD handily beat with x86_64.

2. Even if Intel burried Andy Fucking Grove in a Pet Semetary it would take years for him to turn that steaming turd of a company around. Serioulsy retards, look at AAPL when Steve Jobs returned in July 1997. The stock peaked briefly in 2000 before quickly tanking again. It took the goddam legendary Steve Jobs 5 years to achieve a sustained turn around at AAPL."

AAPL earnings were last week and they were spectacular, sales up 21% YOY, SMASHED 100 billion in revenue in one quarter for the first time ever at 111.4 billion, sales in all product categories are up double digit percentage points and bassicaly crushed the revenue estimates for every one of their product categories aside from being under by 0.01% for mac revenue (mac revenue still up 21% YOY). Earnings per share were at $1.68 vs the estimated $1.41. It's also important to note that sales in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan are up 57%.

But what happened? You ask, like a wide eyed retard fresh outta mommies cunt. We've all seen this shit before, blowout earning report and a steep sell off straight afterwards. It's why only the retardiest of retards play earnings. They almost always recover after said sell off and If you look at the chart, apple is prime for a swift recovery judging by the Extremely bullish Batman throwing a batarang pattern that developed in the last few hours on friday.

https://imgur.com/gallery/KCjZdbZ

The reason I believe the recovery will be swift is because this sell off was almost certainly caused by a few big funds needing liquidity to cover their GME shorts + short more GME. Also autists liquidating their positions to buy more gme. This dip will be bought right back up by institutions that have no interest in GME.

TLDR; AAPL going back over 140 by the end of next week cuz I said so.

**MOST TICKERS BEING SPAMMED ARE NOT PRIMED TO SQUEEZE**

Get one thing straight idiots...GME is truly a unicorn right now. It was bet to basically go into the ground. I hope it keeps rising but let’s be real, the restriction on share count and removal of fractional shares on RH could slow this down. 

But.

These other tickers that are being harpooned into space are not without cause. Why are they being harpooned?

Because we LIKE these companies.

Because these companies have been beaten down during COVID or the current tech onslaught.

And...because they are not OVERVALUED.

Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Netflix, etc. are at or near ALL TIME HIGHS. Their ongoing innovation is by buying up companies like GME to put under their umbrella.

We're ""advised"" not to buy at the peak but when we switch to tickers that are on the bottom floor...we're told not to do that too?

Fuck that. And Fuck Wall Street.

#TL;DR (even though I literally have single word lines you lazy fucks)

Robinhood's baby gloves ticker list are the next wave because they're all severely undervalued. Wall St wants to continue to inflate big tech to screw us when they ride the wave back down.

I realize this has been talked about non stop on this sub, but I am going to actually start doing something about it.

Starting on Monday I am going to liquidate my 401k and every other stock I have besides GME (500k). I don't care if this market moons or falls apart, but I want change. Change so these giant funds can't manipulate the market the way they want. Change so that the playing field is leveled and I am not going back until this happens. Maybe if enough people really start to pull out we can finally start sending a real message.

In regards to GME I like the stock, and going forward I want to buy more. If I die on this hill then so be it, but it's the last time I get manipulated.  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

In addition I have money going to brokerages that can't restrict what I buy. It will be there on Monday

Edit 1: I am not cashing out my 401k to stick it into GME. I am cashing out and letting it sit in a money market for a while. Same with all my other accounts. No I am not going to withdraw my 401k just let it sit in a money market for a while.

I have been investing using fundamentals for a while and I was recently thinking of this overall new dynamic which the market hasn't seen.

With the rise of social media, this was bound to happen sooner rather than later and this whole GME situation might be the tipping point.

Thinking back to Apple and the whole 1984 ad, one can think of that to be a certain meme multiplier back in the day. In fact I think one of the reason Apple is still valued so highly on the market is because out of all the other large tech they actually have the highest MM. Buying Beats and bringing in Dr. Dre for example is something which increases the MM.

A classic example of a MM (which can be thought of as a ratio if nothing else) gain is when Ryan Cohen tweets this for example: https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1350877969816956934

Of course daddy Musk would have the highest MM so far and the stock prices reflect that.

I will try and come up with a mathematical formula to calculate MM better in the next few days. This is just an idea for now."

There are other short sellers. And these stocks, not just GME , but others too, became extremely volatile and on giant volume.

So first there is the issue of liquidated funds that do not have immediate cash.

They hold positions and would have to unwind them to get cash to cover their margin calls.

Melvin Capital I read was down 30% and got bailed out, so they still have assets, just not liquid, no immediately available cash.

Trust me, if they had a gun to their head they'd have immediately available cash, they'd manage.

Second, even after what happened in 2007-2009, financial institutions with systemic risk are not THAT capitalized.

It's not new and never gets solved: in 1987 NYSE specialists had to bed big banks to provide them with more cash or the whole world would collapse.

And I think bureaucrats do not understand how this all works very well. No one does honestly. But bureaucrats are really clueless and under or overreact. Always.

It gets scary for the clearing firms when you have GME making $35 billion volume and going up 400% in 2 days, AMC making $20 billion and gap 300%, higher volumes than Apple and Amazon that are already higher than usual and on 100 times the volatility .

Interactive Broker CEO was the most honest in my eyes and in an interview with CNBC said they halted trading to protect their clients, the clearing houses, the market, and themselves. He said if they had not done it the short squeeze would have kept ""going and going"", so regulators & brokers agreed to stop it all to ""stop the losses"".

Robinhood decided to re-open trading and the CEO pretended he halted trading of the very volatile stocks as routine like ""oh didn't notice anything special was going on"" 🤡.

Webull CEO said in an interview their clearing house told them they could not take trades anymore. I think they use another entity than Robinhood does.

Not sure why Robinhood halted buying (and not selling). There's really the need for an investigation here. I can't tell you what happened because we do not know.

&#x200B;

My 2 cents:

Short sellers are still very strong on this stock, I think they might even have added, I don't know if they are friends with the clearing house but either way they (ch) get stuck in this game, and retail investors are understandably angry at getting blocked like this.

Brokers don't have billions to my knowledge with which they can cover counterparty risk and they have no contractual obligation to do so and I mean they're not santa claus.

My personal opinion is short sellers refusing to liquidate and take the L is the source of all risks and problems (most of it might be options that they can just hold? Not sure how this gets counted in short interest).

Maybe already the counterparty clearing firms got wiped clean, but regardless of this if the price skyrockets further and the bagholding shorts that refuse to close while they can end up being liquidated and margin called, it's truly over for the market. Everyone is going bankrupt, WSB crashed the world.

The counterparty providers risk is real, but I am not their accountant, I do not know how bad things are, and we don't know what actors (if any) are of good faith. It could be (it probably is) shorties refusing to take the L, putting the whole market at risk.

I think they are really worried the price gets to 5000. From the Peterffy ( IBKR ) interview they really expected this. And it might still happen.

Lehman Brothers, James Cordier, Melvin, same story. They get greedy, they refuse to get out, they get rekt.

And sometimes they get an unfair bailout, and are so deluded they actually think they got unlucky when they really messed up.

TLDR: We didn't just screw over some poorly leveraged hedge funds. We put the whole system to the test and almost broke the plumbing."

&#x200B;

Congrats on holding the line above $320 today. 

&#x200B;

As sad as it is, some of us would like to exit our GME position at some point in our lives. To strategize for this, I decided to do some quick math.

&#x200B;

As most of you degenerates know, VW temporarily became the most valuable company in the world in the great squeeze of '08. Well, why can the same not happen to GME? Surely, some will argue about the difference in the underlying financials between the two stocks. But to that, I ask, was VW ever shorted by 140%? Fuck no.

Let's do some quick math.

&#x200B;

Apple is the worlds most valuable company, at $2.215T.

GME has 69.75M shares outstanding

For GME to become the world's most valuable company, each share should be worth at least:

$2.215T / 69.75M = **$31,756 per share**

&#x200B;

Given the historical precedent of major squeezes becoming the world's most valuable company, I will be setting my limit value at **no less than $30,000 per share.**

&#x200B;

$1000 is not a meme. $5000 is not a meme. $10,000 is not a meme. and even $30,000 is not a meme.

&#x200B;

I'm not a financial advisor and I do not recommend you follow some blind retard hoping to change his family's life at the expense of these greedy fucks. All views are my own and again, I am retarded so do not follow my advice, I am simply explaining my own personal strategy.

EDIT: Someone in the comments said they believe that some people are retarded enough to actually believe this DD. This is a shitpost and you are mentally unable to be helped if you believe this."

Millions of people love what we did. Those millions of people will buy whatever GME produces because they are financially invested in its profit margin. Or maybe because they are emotionally sympathetic to it succeeding because their family members, friends, coworkers, or neighbors own a share.

If Gamestop wanted to introduce a movie streaming platform,  millions of people would subscribe to the GME movie app. We'd be as rich as Netflix. We are going to buy our products BECAUSE IT'S OUR COMPANY.

We wouldn't buy games from any other retailer, we would buy it from GME. 

If Gamestop started a music streaming platform, we'd download and subscribe to GME Music. We'd be as rich as Spotify and Apple Music.

We are the consumers. We have all the economic power in this situation.

Why do you keep doubling down on your short positions? Why are new hedge funds are coming in and scooping up new short positions? What the fuck are you shitstains on society doing? What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you understand who we are?

We don’t fucking play here. We lose money for fucking breakfast. Every day. And then we come back and lose even more fucking money. We buy out of the money weeklies on fucking THURSDAYS. We don’t give a fuck. This is what we do. We do this. We don’t fucking play around. We come here to risk it all. We come here to YOLO our children’s college funds away just to post memes about it.

Your plan was really just to put us in a position where all we have to do is hold SHARES? Say less fam. I haven’t owned a share in four years. I sold AAPL AMD and ENPH calls last week just to buy shares of GameStop and fuck you up as much as possible so we can make memes about it.

Double down, triple down, quadruple down, take every penny of your rich boomer clients money and put it on the table. Sink the entire already artificially propped up economy over it. We know you will. And because we know you will, we are going to make you do it. Just like the coyote blindly chasing the roadrunner off of a fucking cliff. Chop off your whole head to spite your face. 

Take all your boomer ass money and put it on the table. We are here for it. My shares are available for $10,000 before 6 pm today. For every hour after that, Im asking another $250. Go fuck yourself."

The broader market took a nose dive today as volatility resume in earnest due to, of all things, fucking meme stocks. As GME, AMC, KOSS, and others continue their large swings to the stratosphere much to the grief of short sides, chatters are now about that sell-offs are partly a liquidity issue as funds close out their long position to cover (and prevent a margin call) on their decimated short positions in GME et al. VIX continues the spike from Wednesday and was up as high as 19% as systemic risk to the market are now fully in the spotlight.

* During intraday low, the DOW was down as much as -747 pts while SPX was down -94 pts and Chadsdaq was down -352 pts. Almost all sectors are being punished while a few medical products company in SPX escape into the greens due to a strong ER and an overall strengthened demand - cuz there's a fucking global pandemic. TMO is up 2.93% for the day to $511 while DHR is up 4% to $237. Conversely, big tech are big fucked as AAPL, FB, and MSFT are all down significantly. AAPL closed down -3.74%, FB down -2.52%, and MSFT closed down -2.92% (despite a strong ER result earlier in the week). AMZN, GOOGL, and NFLX are all down around -1%.

* GME swings to a strong green opening after RH relents being a shill bag for Citadel, allowing limited GME and AMC trading (to one or five fucking shares? what a joke). Turns out when the product is free, you're the product? In yet another volatile session, intraday high was at the opening $413 and intraday low was at $250 (a 40% intraday move) as MMs clear out their delta and escapes a total gamma squeeze to live yet another day. The short squeeze, however, is still in play as GME closes up 68% to close at $325, thanks to a reversal of movement shortly before power hour. As of writing, short sellers are at mark-to-market loss of almost 20 bil. You gotta feel for them as they might need to downgrade from a super yacht to a pleb boat. Such shame.

* Congress critters, media pundits, and everyone's moms continue to give their 2cents on the GME and gang episode - and while consensus is usually in favor of the little guys, being a cynical F - you should expect regulations and further restrictions from regulators/industry moving forward. One likely curb to help save MMs would be restricting options trading to a certain account size, or further restricting access to 0dte, particularly for volatile underlyings. Expect all this to come out with messaging of ""helping to protect our customers.""

* RoaringKitty AKA DFV gets [nice profile from the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/roaring-kitty-reddit-gamestop-markets.html) and if you are one of the few millions who are new to the story + sub, the piece does a good job giving a history of how DFV got started. Yours truly somehow got quoted in the piece as well and while the quote was decisively retarded as F, no cap it was an accurate description of most of our mindset. (Of all the fucking quotes to pick out from DFV's updates since 2019...). DFV posted his [latest YOLO update](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l846a1/gme_yolo_monthend_update_jan_2021/) minutes after market close. Don't click thru. Guess if he's still in?

* If you're unhappy with your broker due to restrictions, select veteran brokerages such as Fidelity, Vanguard, ETrade, has placed zero restriction (short of whatever that is already existed) on meme stock trading. As it turns out companies with decent corporate value are actually NOT dick bags, even in the face of market volatility. (Sure their UI might be stuck in the 90s and early 2000s). Things are especially helpful as these brokerages do their own clearing and aren't beholden to Citadel and others. While brokers who use Apex as a clearing house has had limited time restriction (Ally, TDA, Tasty etc.) they are definitely far better than whatever RH has done to their customer.

* Notable upgrades and downgrades: Despite receiving a strong upgrades this AM, BA couldn't handle overall macro pressure and its green opening of +2% swung to red as the day chugs on. Morgan Stanley double upgraded Boeing to overweight form underweight with a PT of $230, up from $165. BA closed the day down -1.54% to $194, further contributing to DOW's demise. SFIX, who rode quite a bit of the short squeeze mania in recent days (from $55 to $100 within two weeks) was hit with a downgrade by Baird as they notch the shares down to neutral from outperform with a PT of $85. SFIX closed the day down -4.44% to $95. GM, who's looking more and more likely to be the next strong EV contender receives another PT hike to $80 from $57 by Morgan Stanley. Shares remain unchanged given the recent run-up and closed the day flat at -0.7% to $50.68.

* After a decent rally from ER, AAL immediately sets out to offer another round of 1 bil in stocks, further fucking over their long term boomer shareholders. Already selling 1 bil in stock back in Oct of last year, the new offering will be selling up to 1.12 bil in more. Shares of American Airline close the day down -5% to $17. Others in the sector are also down, particular as UAL warns that thousands of job are at risk again - despite a 15 bil handout from the recent stimulus package. UAL close down -6% to $40, DAL down -5.29% to $38. Meanwhile JBLU and LUV handles the sector news a bit better given their management isn't complete trash.

* In WSB meme stock land, everything is a fucking meme stock now. AMC close the day up 53% back above $13. BB, a stock without the short squeeze factor closed the day down -3.75% to $14. If you like the previous DDs and plays on BB - you can always regrab $15c or $20c leaps when IV has cool down some more after VIX has retreated. As of writing Jan 22 and Jan 23 leaps are still looking at 140-150% IV. Which is a bit too expensive in premium. ICLN retreats yet again, down -3.3%. MT is down -3.8% after running up almost 7% the day before, and PLTR close the day down -1.35% to $35 ish. TSLA took another haircut of -5% to close out at $793, furthering yesterday's decline after an ER profit miss that didn't impress the market. Yeah, you almost forgot about all these tickers, didn't ya?

* Looking for a bullish meme stock play but just can't stomach the IV or premiums level and shares are too boomer (or out of reach in the case of GME lol)? Thanks to crazy high IV, you can join theta gang sell GME puts (cash covered or spread) at strikes of $25p to $35p for April, netting you premium of around $7 to $11. This bakes in one Q4 ER which GME should do well in, and with IV at +400% and delta of under 0.02 and lower (heh), the odds are stacked in your favor to come out ahead of the play. If assigned, you'll be paying only $18 for GME for the 25p and $24 for the 35p. Another company that will likely be a decent hold if assigned: BB puts are also going for decent premium. Feb 19 10p is going for around $1.75 with a delta of 0.2, or you can go further out to March 10p which nets you about $2.5 with a delta of 0.2 as well.

* **Noteworthy ERs:** With most of the big bois ER behind us (and overshadowed by meme stocks), earnings season continues next week with a few more market movers. On Feb 2nd, BABA, PFE, and UPS all reports before market opens. Later that afternoon, AMZN will report after market close. Further along the week, PYPL reports on Feb 3 after market close while PINS reports Feb 4 after market close. (PINS doesn't really move market but its noteworthy enough).

* **Notable econ numbers** includes the usual boys with Monday PMI at 9:45 AM ET, ISM manufacturing index at 10 AM ET, jobless claims on Thursday at 8:30 AM and the big daddy employment situation (nonfarm payroll etc) on Friday at 8:30 AM ET. 

* The DOW closed down -2% or -622 pts, Nasdaq down -2% or -266 pts, SPX down -1.93% or -73 pts, and RUT close down -1.57% or -32 pts.

(Yesterday's recap: none, but you can read [last's week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2a0e9/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_marketdriving_news_jan_21/) and bask in the past before GME and the Internet toppled the hedgies)"

It seems like the main metric we're using is the number of outstanding short positions without knowing how many shares they outright own.  


All of us know when a position we own goes up or down by 10x. I feel like the shorts absolutely focused on this after the jump from $4 to $40. Who's saying they didn't buy it all the way up to $400 with us. (And then bought it on the way down to $200 yesterday).

I see people who have never invested before buying shares and we assume the hedge funds haven't done the same? Robinhood is the #1 app on the Apple App Store. I'm getting multiple texts a day about GME from people who have never touched stonks. They own GME but the shorts dont? 

Its weird to me because one side of this has been showing their cards the entire time (us). I worry that we're underestimating the other side because we can't see what they're doing. Knowing what we intended on doing, couldn't they have bought shares and just not closed their position just to keep this fire burning?"

One of the concerns with foundries, from a fundamental perspective, is the potential that the high capital costs with expansion can cause the foundries to be underutilized during periods of dormancy in demand. Which historically may have been true, but as we surge forward as a society technologically, semiconductor demand will only increase and increase and increase with time...computing demands, graphics, autos, IoT, everything...TSM has a wide lead with HUGE barriers to entry with foundries.

Bullish checklist:

1. Incredible demand for semiconductors, unlikely to dwindle soon.

2. Monopoly on market share (54%) / world leading production capacity.

3. partnerships with the best fabless firms, apple, amd, nvda, etc.

4. industry leading in technological advancements - ahead of the game on 7nm, 5nm, 3nm, and 2nm r&d

5. not significant antitrust risk as they focus purely on manufacture of semiconductors and have not been trying to buy out other biz

The main risks imo are below:

1. geopolitical risk, literally getting caught in a war/raid between china/us in the semiconductor arms race. & 

2. intellectual property theft. Something that I don't think would fatal to them considering the barriers to entry with semis.

RH has been a “featured” app on the iOS App Store practically since the app was released. It also holds the #1 rank in finance, something they don’t believe we (the autists holding the market by the balls) deserve, apparently. 

You don’t even have to write a review, but written reviews leave more of an impact to those seeing the app for the first time. When an app falls below 4.0 stars on the App Store, it is removed from the “featured” section - something RH’s developers hold dearly because that means free advertisement + the ability to hold #1 in finance. Nobody wants to promote an app with less than 3.0 stars. If they don’t wanna promote the people, why help them get promoted.

They may not have taken *all* of the tendies, but they sure are keeping us from the
#**SAUCE**. 

Who the fuck wants to enjoy their tendies on Mars, a desolate, desert planet without any god damn **sauce**?"

Robinhood et al were right to shit down trading of GME and others. They’re a bubble. There’s no underlying value to GameStop to support this stock price. If I invest in Apple to make a profit, it’s with the hope that they’re going to sell a bunch of iPhones. There’s an underlying value to support the share price. GameStop doesn’t have any underlying value to support its current share price. People who want to buy its stock right now are doing so in the hope that other people are going to also continue buying stock, driving the price up to make a profit. This is, in effect, a Ponzi scheme. So many people are flying high right now with the success stories coming out of this short squeeze, but when the bubble pops, and it will, all bubbles pop eventually, *a lot* of ordinary people are going to be out of *a lot* of money.

Edit: You really are a bunch of fucking retards, thinking short squeezing a handful of stocks
 into bubbles makes you crusaders against Wall Street. I genuinely hope you all make money though. Enjoy your LARP while it lasts, tilt at them windmills bois."

**Feb 4, mid-market:** Thank you everyone for your support. I really don't know what to say. The company keeps getting pounded because GME is having a sell-off, which doesn't make any sense. But that's the market for you. It doesn't always make sense.

I still believe 2021 will be a big year for Nokia, although it doesn't look like there is any way we'll manage the crazy play anymore. Still, it was nice to see something that was impossible become possible, even if it was for only a few days.

And remember, we can still do it any day. All it takes is for us to work together. If you want. Make up your own mind. 

I'm still holding. NOK will recover from this. Fair value is at least 4.81, and way more when 5G really gets going. So if you can, I would buy some more now. You'll thank me later for the tip. It may not be the most exciting play, but it is what investing is all about. Slow and steady growth that compounds to make a big change.

One of these days I'll be able to post again, when the mods lift the restrictions on new posts and things get a little less crazy around here. When I post again about NOK, I'll post the link here too. Thanks everyone!

**Feb 4 premarket:** Earnings out! They beat expectations a bit, their revenue was a little smaller than expected. Overall, good quarter, good year. Here it is: [https://www.nokia.com/system/files/2021-02/nokia\_results\_2020\_q4.pdf](https://www.nokia.com/system/files/2021-02/nokia_results_2020_q4.pdf)

**Feb 2, end of da**y: It's getting pretty crazy out there, but here's what you should know. The NOK chart is following the GME chart. It's got way more shares so the bumps and dips are more stable, but that's the main trend.

**What that means**: GME has no underlying value at this level. It is a gamble on the short squeeze. It might pay off, or it might not. If people panic sell like yesterday, it won't.

NOK is very different. It has underlying value. So if someone dumps it below its target price, the best thing to do is just to buy and wait for the value to go down. Thursday NOK reveals its earnings, and they are likely to be good based on what Ericsson revealed. Ericsson is one of its main competitors and a very similar company currently trading at twice the NOK price.

Feb 1, end of day: Told you it was a value share! Still trading at target, still low risk.

Either dumping has stopped, or normies are piling in because of the results. Either way good news, hope you made some money today!Vol today 190m, still way above average. Normal average 30m before we changed it lol. That means since Wednesday over 2bn shares have changed hands. Hope you got em!

Ericsson (NOK competitor) results suggest NOK will report good numbers this week, NOK upped to BUY on market watch: [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nokia-upped-to-buy-after-ericsson-results-2021-02-01](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nokia-upped-to-buy-after-ericsson-results-2021-02-01)

Unless my math is retarded (which it is cos ahmsodumb), if everyone (7m) on this sub spends $3000 at current price ($4.55) we BUY THE FLOAT. The more they keep dumping, the more shares we get cheap. Think about it.EDIT: buying the ENTIRE float is NOT the point of this play. I know share price goes up when supply is restricted, just read the play. This is just an example of what happens when they dump a value share on millions of retail investors.

&#x200B;

Added new summary (30 Jan), and Q&A.

FIRST OFF: This post is not financial advice or anything except the rant of some idiot retard who is an idiot. I tell you straight up that there is a normal investment side to the NOK play (STILL MEANS RISK, which YOU will have to decide!) and that there is a CRAZY side that is PROBABLY IMPOSSIBLE. If you want to play the crazy play then you’re also a crazy retard idiot just like me.

I don’t know shit, I just look at graphs and go WOW. Do your own due diligence, I am not a financial advisor. Don’t ask me if you should buy, I don’t know, can you afford to? Are you comfortable with the risks? I don’t know these things. You do.

**NOK PLAY:**

Here’s how it works. YOU DECIDE if you want to take part.

1.It’s **not a short squeeze like GME**. Get that out of your head.

2.It’s a **value/momentum** play. The value part is just normal granny&grampa investing. See a good company going cheap, buy and hold. Tell your mom, dad, granny and grampa, cousins, relatives, friends.

3.The **momentum part is the crazy part**, and if it works the share will SKYROCKET as long as YOU DON’T SELL. GME is the biggest short squeeze in history, the NOK play could be the biggest value buy in history.

4. The beauty of it is that **it works because Wall St is dumping NOK irrationally**. That’s why the price is going down (slowly). They think they’re attacking us and slowly winning, but they’re giving us a value share cheap = their money, our pockets. By the time they realize what we did, it will be too late.

5. **Don’t panic, and keep buying the dumps (if you think the company has value)**, and if we hold the line **you could see a miracle.**

3310 HANDS

&#x200B;

**Value Part (crazy part in Q&A):**

The company is healthy, has good financials, it’s a market leader in 5G (it’s main competitors are Huawei and Ericsson, they have about the same market share share of 5G) a lot of potential to be the company that builds 5G for a large part of the world. NOK is currently trading at a standard price for the value it holds. It is not a bubble.

Here’s Nokia’s 5G contracts: [https://www.nokia.com/networks/5g/5g-contracts/](https://www.nokia.com/networks/5g/5g-contracts/)

Here’s Bloomberg shitting bricks that we’ve realized that Nokia is a value bet: [https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-28/gamestop-may-be-a-reddit-wallstreetbets-game-but-nokia-sure-isn-t](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-28/gamestop-may-be-a-reddit-wallstreetbets-game-but-nokia-sure-isn-t)

Nokia also just unveiled new 1tb tech, the thing AFTER 5G. First on the world. They have it, they’re showing the world it works. Here is their press release from Wednesday: [https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/nokia-and-elisa-push-network-boundaries-with-worlds-first-1t-deployment-2021-01-27](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/nokia-and-elisa-push-network-boundaries-with-worlds-first-1t-deployment-2021-01-27)

They are so trusted that NASA got them to build a cell network on the MOON. Literally. If you’re NASA, would you hire your retard uncle Earl to build cell towers on the moon? No, you hire someone who CAN ACTUALLY DO IT. Imagine what it takes to build something really big and complicated on the moon? Now imagine who’s the likely guy who can do it. That’s right, NOKIA. Here they are, going to the moon: [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/)

If the Huawei 5G war continues, who do you think US and Europe is going to back, especially since NOK already has the next tech, owns a bunch of patents, is from FINLAND that has never tried to take over the world and has a brand that EVERYONE who lived in 2000s remembers?

Here’s a guy who’s been doing the numbers for a while now in case you want to see them: [https://www.reddit.com/user/Jimming/comments/l7f6ua/part\_iv\_option\_chain\_analysis\_on\_nok\_and\_why\_you/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jimming/comments/l7f6ua/part_iv_option_chain_analysis_on_nok_and_why_you/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I don’t know him, I don’t know the numbers as well, but looks pretty good to me. Amazing due diligence. But what do I know, I’m an idiot. So is he. So are you. We’re all fucking retards, just ask Wall Street. I poked myself in the same eye twice yesterday. We’re “dumb money”. They have other names for us too.

So, worst case, you just bought into a good company at a fair value. If the crazy play doesn’t work, you just hold on to them and let them become the world leader in 5G. Unlike GME (NOT SAYING SELL!), NOK will not fall 99%. Or if it does, I'M BUYING THAT SHIT because if a HEALTHY COMPANY FALLS 99% you make some CRAZY MONEY on that when it bounces back.

**Q&A**

**Q: You retards were tricked by bots to buying NOK, there’s no short**

A: This just full on doesn’t get what the play is about. IT IS NOT A SHORT SQUEEZE. THIS IS NOT GME RINSE REPEAT. GME IS A DIFFERENT PLAY. NOK IS A VALUE PLAY. How many more ways can I say it? Not sure. How many more do I have to?

**Q: Stop taking attention away from GME you retards**

A: Nobody is saying sell your GME. Nobody is saying that. GME is too expensive for a lot of people, and GME is VERY RISKY and NOK has genuine value behind it. If the NOK play works, those people who couldn’t afford GME can still get on & get rich. If it doesn’t, they most likely still make money on a good company.

**Q: This play is impossible / crazy / it’ll never work / there are too many shares you retards**

A: This is ALMOST true. This play WAS impossible until 1/27/2021. That is why nobody has EVER tried anything like this. But it’s NOT impossible anymore. Look at this graph. Look at it. See that spike? What the fuck is that? I’ll tell you my fellow autistic space boot packin 3310 using NOKSTER.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v473xl00ghe61.png?width=2182&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf5aac455156dbadb919b80afacb5232af0a05b5

That spike was them running out of shares for half an hour. Trade was stopped until they could find more, to avoid an artificial spike in the price.

Proof? Look at the volumes. A small sale (red) causes a small dip. Two small buys cause a MASSIVE SPIKE. They ran out, and had to call their friends to liquidate more shares so the price wouldn’t skyrocket ""artificially"".

But that’s IMPOSSIBLE for NOK. NOK has 5bn shares. Nokia should be much more stable because it has so many shares, having a crazy demand spike is crazy. I saw it, and fell off my chair and since I’m such a retard it took me an hour to get back up.

So it **was** impossible, and that’s why Wall Street won’t see it coming. They think this is their attack and they’re about to break through our ranks, but they’re actually playing right into our hands.

Wendnesday, we moved 1bn shares. Thursday, when nobody could buy, we still moved 500m. Yesterday, we still moved 360m. We’ve moved so much NOK in the past three days, the average volume of the share has MORE THAN DOUBLED in THREE DAYS. The play is not impossible anymore, but Wall St thinks it is, which is how we can use their own strength and mass against them. But the value buy still makes sense WHENEVER you see someone dump a valuable share. Someone sells you a 100$ bill for 90$? Buy it.

They attack? We absorb. They dump, we buy, they run out of shares, we hold. They’re fucked, and they just handed us a bunch of value shares at an undervalue = they just gave us their money. They are just giving it to you. When they realize they can’t buy them back at a lower value, what do you think is going to happen?

**Q: We don’t do value plays, we do short squeezes you retards**

A: Go back to April. Look at u/DeepFuckingValue’s position. **GME was a value play**. It’s only in April that the Short Squeeze became possible. Look it up yourself.

Will a short squeeze also happen with NOK? It’s unlikely. Hedge Fund Assholes have been increasing their shorts in NOK in the last few days, but they won’t go over 100% on 5bn shares because they're not as stupid as me. But it doesn’t have to happen. We just need to buy the dumps. If they short, great. More money for us as long as we don’t let them drive the price down with the dumps.

**Q: Why is NOK not rocketing?**

A: Because Wall Street is dumping, just like I said they would after the Wednesday spike. That’s the whole plan. They dump, we hold the line, buy the dumps and keep the price steady.

The GME short squeeze guys waited for this for UP TO TWO YEARS. I saw it in April. I thought it was crazy. I didn’t jump in back then. If I did, I’d have about as much money as u/DeepFuckingValue. On a value share, you can afford to wait. GME was originally a value play. That’s what I should have realized in April.

SO JUST WAIT AND HOLD (if you believe and idiot like me, which you shouldn't, no need to message me about it). It’s been two days since this play even became possible.

**Q: How do we know it’s working?**

A: Look at the volume of shares traded. Nokia has 5bn shares. In the last three days, nearly 2bn have been traded. The price is still up from last week. That’s how.

This has already been a giant dumping campaign. How come the price hasn’t floored? What happens if we just buy it all up?

What happens if they run out, and then their shorts blow, the price bumps up, CNBC tells the world we broke another short wall, everyone piles on, Wall Street realizes they just gave us their shares at an undervalue and try to buy back, we don’t sell, we have all the shares? The Wednesday spike is what happens, except this time there is no stopping it. If they stop trading again and try to dump some more, you just buy up the dump and keep the spike going. Spike stops being a spike and becomes a floor.

&#x200B;

**Q: Where will this max out and when?**

A: What do you think I’m from the future? I just saw an impossible thing happen on Wednesday, and we need to make it happen again. Look at the graph. Look at it.

Set your targets to $3310, that should do it.

**Q: When should I buy? What should I buy? Should I buy?**

A: Be your own person. Buy when you feel like it, if you feel like it.

**Q: Wall street bots are promoting NOK.**

A: I don’t give a shit. If they are, and we keep buying, they are promoting giving us money.

&#x200B;

Part 2: (29 Jan)

First off, much as I appreciate the love, I can’t play your hand for you. You have to make your own decisions. Do I know where NOK is going to be tomorrow? Nope. Nobody does. All that I have for you is the news from Wednesday that this play is no longer totally impossible:

1. I think the assholes are going to try to dump you out of the market
2. It won’t work if we keep the demand up.
3. The way we keep demand up is we buy, and others will follow us because the company is good.
4. When they realize it won’t work, they’ll need to start buying back in.
5. Then it’ll be too late, cos they dumped their shares on US and we are RETARDS who HOLD. That means that when their shorts start to go bust, the price will jump up (a little bit, not like with GME at first – this is a different play based on the health of the company, not a straight up short squeeze. The short position on NOK is much smaller).
6. When the price jumps up, and the GME guys start cashing out, they need somewhere to put that cash. Some of them pay off student loans, or buy cars or whatever, but the smart ones will go NOK.

How you play it is up to you. I can’t tell you if you should buy, what minute to buy, what app to use and so on. All I can say is I buy the dumps. You need to decide for yourself if you want to do it. You can see the dumps on any app, or even yahoo finance. I buy NOK on NYSE, and I buy straight up shares (so they can’t lend out mine for shorts) but you’re free to do what you want. I’m a retard, you’re a retard, we’re all autistic fucks, we make up our own mind and stick with it.

Secondly, what I said yesterday morning would happen, did happen. And it happened exactly like I said it would. So don’t get scared off, just buy the dumps. And they know that they’ll be fucked if we keep buying the dumps. That’s why they stopped us from buying NOK.

NOK hasn’t bubbled, stopping us from buying NOK was because they know we’re on to them. They know the dumps won’t work if we JUST KEEP BUYING and HOLDING. The play works, they’re scared, we caught them with their pants down, they’re trying to get ahead of us.

OK, so about what happened yesterday with RH and others. I’m so fucking angry about this.

What RH and others did is completely insane. Their argument is “you guys are throwing your money away on a bubble, we’re just protecting you”. Bullshit. I won’t comment on GME, I’ll let u/DeepFuckingValue or one of those guys do that. I’ll just say, that short squeezes happen with hedge funds all the fucking time. Why is trading not stopped for them? They have people’s fucking pensions that they’re playing with.

But for NOK, it’s TOTAL BULLSHIT. Here’s why:

1. NOK HAS NOT BUBBLED. Look at the graph. Look at it. It is still down from 2016. NOK is well within normal variation. Long term, you barely see the spike from a couple of days ago. There is nothing to “protect us” from. They’re protecting themselves.
2. The NOK play is not a straight up short squeeze. The play is HELPED by the shorts that are there, as long as we can keep the demand up and keep the price up against the dumping, but that’s all.
3. NOK is a healthy company, with new and important tech, a great brand, a lot of potential. You want to see why, read the original post. ANYONE who sees a company like that being dumped for NO REASON would buy. So should you. They are only dumping it because they’re trying to fuck up our play.

Ok that’s enough for now. I’ll see you all when I’ve got my space boots on, in my house on the FUCKING MOON, next to a NOKIA Comms tower, or I’ll see you in VALHALLA with my broke ass. If this doesn’t work, then at least you TOOK ON THE MOTHERFUCKERS and EARNED A PLACE at the table with FUCKING ODIN.

UNBREAKABLE 3310!

**ORIGINAL POST (28 Jan):**

I get it, it’s not the play. I’m not saying sell your GME. I’m not a bot or a spy or a wall street asshole. I’m a regular guy who’s got a couple of bucks in his bank account and plays videogames and wants a fucking house to live in like my parents had when they were young. If you don’t agree with me, just say so.

I’m also not a financial advisor, so make up your own minds you autistic fucks.

But, BUT, yesterday we did something they’ve never seen. Yesterday, we made them run out of NOK shares. That’s what that big spike was, and that’s why trading was stopped for 2h. If we keep doing that, it will be the biggest wall street wealth transfer from assholes to retards in history. Because they will keep dumping it until it’s too late.

Impossible, you say. Too many shares, you say. Well listen up. Yesterday, in ONE DAY, we traded, or caused others to trade, 1bn shares of Nokia. That is 1/5 of all the Nokia shares in the world. That’s never happened, *EVER*. Not even when Nokia was the biggest phone company in the world.

3516.16% of average trading volume.

Do you get it? They’ll keep dumping their stock, we keep buying them cheap, and then they won’t be so cheap anymore when they try to buy back in. We can move 1bn shares IN A DAY. ONE DAY. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Why do they stop trading in NYSE? Cos they ran out of shares temporarily and they don’t want “artificial” spikes in the prices. So they made us retards wait a couple of hours while some assholes called some other assholes to unload their shares into the market, and once they had enough, they started again. That’s why that spike went down right after the freeze.

But then we did it again. And they had to stop again. The price just wouldn’t go down. The assholes who’d just unloaded shares were probably back on the phone with the other assholes who’d convinced them.

Everyone is watching us. What we do, millions of normal folks do with us, and every wallstreet asshole does against us.

What did the asshole brigade do? They started shorting NOK. They will continue to do that, because they think we’re retards (they are correct).

But how come the price didn’t go down? It’s got 5bn shares, and everyone whos ever held it was dumping it. How could we ever keep up the demand when there are so many shares out there? How is this going to work?

Because the retard brigade was buying it. There’s 3m of us and counting. If we each put 600 bucks on NOK, we get 100 shares, and that’s 300m shares.

Now imagine what happens if we put 6000 on it. AND. FUCKING. HOLD. And every dip you see, you buy more. AND. FUCKING. HOLD. They'll keep dumping, we keep buying, until they realize the price isn't going down. Then they start buying, we keep holding, the market runs out of NOK. Price skyrockets.

And normies outside were following us. They can see that the stock is still LOW, lower than 2016. This means they don’t think it’s a bubble that’s going to crash on them.

So why do the normies follow us on this, and not on GME? (I’m not saying sell GME).

Because GME has never, ever been anywhere near where it is now. That scares a normal guy who’s just trying to put in some savings for his family. They think this is some Dutch tulip market shit.

Not so with NOK. Even with the spike from yesterday, NOK is still *DOWN* from 2016. Remember 2016? Remember that being a really big year for Nokia? No, me neither. And let’s not even get started on where it has been in the past. Yesterday's spike barely shows on the graph.

You know what is going to be a big year? 2021 and 2022. Why?

What else did NOK say yesterday? Well, they revealed that they have a new kind of 1 terabit data transfer networks shit, what do I know, I’m not a techie. But it IS a new kind of technology that’s going to kick 5Gs ass. And my fellow retards of the most honorable retard brigade – Do you think we’re going to need more data this year than last year?

Remember how Netflix had to downgrade its picture quality in March because the networks couldn’t handle the amount people were streaming? What do you think is going to happen with the company that solves that?

But why would NOK be the company? Well, remember the 5G war with China?

US and Europe can’t buy 5G from China, because then China has our networks. But guess who US and Europe aren’t afraid of? Fucking FINLAND. Finland, the land of NOKIA. So tiny that some people think the whole country is a conspiracy theory and doesn’t really exist. Sorry Finnish people, nobody gives a shit about you. Good thing for you, cos you get to build the 5G network on the moon and shit because nobody is scared that Finland will take over the world.

Want proof? They are literally building one on the FUCKING MOON: [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/)

And we’re going to send them there. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

But hang on, why is NOK so low in the first place if it’s so great?

Answer: because Microsoft fucked them. That’s right, they sent one of their own assholes to infiltrate the NOK, leak a bunch shit to drive the share price down, and then buy the phone part of the company. These assholes wrecked the company, the Finnish economy, and every middle class shareholder who was just trying to put their kids to college. Imagine everyone who’d be fucked if someone did that to Apple now.

Worked like a charm. Firesale. Business restructuring. Lost their phones. NOK never recovered.

The asshole they sent from Microsoft? Went back to work for Microsoft, and was paid a shit ton of money for what he did. His name is Stephen Elop. Look it up.

So they have tech that nobody else has and a brand that everyone recognizes. But what don’t they have? Money. That’s why they’re building this 1tb magic network thing in tiny fucking possibly fake Finland to show everyone it works.

But if we drive the share price up, do you think that’s going to change?

So FUCK IT. I’m in for every penny, and I am HOLDING. I’ll see you in my house ON the MOON next to a NOKIA Comms tower, or I’ll see you in VALHALLA you BEAUTIFUL RETARDED MOTHERFUCKERS.

TL;DR: NOK is literally going to the moon. Go there with them. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Okay GME gang. We’ve got the shorts on the ropes. They’re bleeding hard and all the billionaire suits are shitting themselves out of fear. They’ve tried false information, getting on CNBC and screaming for regulation of our “market manipulation,” trying to get us shut down, Biden administration tweet, saying shorts have already covered, etc. None of it has worked so far and they’re still bleeding money.

Now they’re truly desperate. What’s something they haven’t tried quite yet but very well could be setting up to do?

MARKET CRASH

Yes, that’s right. I believe with what I’m currently seeing, they are going to crash the market and blame it on us. Do I think you need to be concerned about GME? No, because holding it should still work and they still have to cover anyway, but this is definitely to try to get you scared and sell GME and so they can take your money back when you reinvest elsewhere.

I don’t think I have to tell many of you that the current levels are at/above where the market was valued in 2008 before the crash according to the Buffet indicator. All this says is that we’re probably in a market bubble, and it’s been at these levels for months now. But guess what just started getting talked about by all the suits? That’s right. A bubble. And who are they blaming? Us.

Now that I have your attention, let’s look at a few other things.

[This is the Volatility Index the past week.](https://imgur.com/gallery/C9ETmMR) Notice how it’s been steadily rising and suddenly spiked today? 40 is typically the resistance before the market makes a downturn. If this thing gets above that we’ll probably be seeing the market dropping quickly.

Additionally, there the spurts of high volume absolutely dumping stocks for short amounts of time. That’s one of the first things I noticed before the March crash and I’ve been seeing it get more and more abundant the last few weeks and picking up a lot today. [Notice the large red volume candles on the weekly SPY chart.](https://imgur.com/a/w0y33Lq) (Robinhood screenshot on a DD post??? Yes, I know. I’m on my phone with limited time. Deal with it lol.)

Now you might say, “it’s earnings season and there have been some bad earnings so far and that’s expected in this tough time.” Well yes, but there’s the Apple earnings today. They beat earnings pretty nicely and what did the stock do? [You guessed it (I hope).](https://imgur.com/a/Txc7po6)

Currently we’re seeing fundamentally strong companies as well as the S&P 500 beginning to drop and the volatility increase market wide. You could say this is “smart money” pulling out because they see the overvalued stocks. However, there were many worldwide financial issues sparking before the March crash. It just needed a catalyst, AKA global pandemic. Now we’re in a similar boat. Market issues in need of a catalyst.

What is that catalyst this time around? That’s right. A bunch of “millennials on a message board who have no place in stocks creating a market bubble.” Basically this isn’t smart money pulling out here. It’s MAD MONEY (hi Cramer). They are declaring WAR. They are pissed that we are “stealing” their billions on billions of dollars from them and they will do whatever it takes to get you to sell and take your money away from you again, including wrecking the market and the economy once again. The suits are out for blood now.

Do I think this will effect GME much? Only if you don’t sell. All this is scare tactics and ways to win your money back if keeping GME suppressed fails even more than it already has. There are hardly any shares to short if any at all and retail investors and autists are likely the ones holding most of the shares that could be sold.

Be careful out there autists

TLDR: GME TO VALHALLA. Rest of the market, potentially to the depths of Avernus soon.

Nokia is now a market leader in networking and enterprise level technology, essentially providing infrastructure for all types of networks. They also manufacture telecommunications equipment and engage in licensing. The most exciting opportunity in their current business model is 5G, which could be the main catalyst for this seemingly boring stock to finally break through resistance and become a valuable asset in portfolios. I'll give some key updates and price targets below. 


Partnerships and beneficiary of 5G rollouts


For starters, it's been a common thesis that 5G will be the greatest investing opportunity of the decade, yet Nokia remains in a flat/downward pattern on the chart. They've recently earned several contracts that will give them a stronger moat in the 5G domain as well as steady revenues and growth opportunities. Recent contracts come from a very diverse group of partners, including: 

-A 5 year deal with T-Mobile, in which T-Mobile will power it's 2.5GHz mid-band spectrum using Nokia's AirScale Radio platform. In addition, Nokia will facilitate T-Mobile to upgrade it's mid-band LTE network to a 5G network. 

-Secured a government contract via the National Cybersecurity Center for Excellence. Nokia was selected as the tech provider and collaborator for the 5G Cybersecurity Project. The federal agency plans to utilize Nokia's technology for the transition to 5G from 4G. The project intends to identify 5G use cases to highlight the efficacy of the components of 5G architecture against security threats as part of a government initiative to beef up it's cyber security and anti-spying tools.

-Partnership with Google Cloud in which the 2 firms will work in unison on businesses' digital transformation at the network edge through both 5G connectivity and cloud-native applications and capabilities. The partnership's purpose is to develop solutions for communication service providers to modernize network infrastructure and ensure smooth transitions to cloud-native 5G-core. This will likely build an ecosystem of services that deployable anywhere, from network edge, to public clouds, private clouds, and carrier networks. 

-Nokia has also recently announced partnerships with M1 for 5G solutions in Singarpore, as well as TeleZ to deploy key infrastructure solutions for TeleZ subsribers in Sweden, Lativa, Lithuania, and Estonia. They were also awarded a contract by NASA for $14.1 million to build 4G infrastructure on the moon. 


Nokia has more than 220 large enterprise customers across industries worldwide, of which at least 30 have deployed 5G. They were also in a geopolitical battle in which the U.S. expressed interest in owning a piece of the company, and in response Finland built it's stake in Nokia via Solidium Oy, the state's equity-asset manager, to 1 billion euros($1.2b usd). Nokia also intends to repurchase 500 million shares in the coming months, so demand for the stock is picking up on all levels. 


In addition to infrastructure, licensing is a huge part of Nokia's business model that will benefit from 5G. The ""Nokia Technologies"" Arm handles patent licensing, technology licensing, and brand licensing. This includes an industry-leading patent portfolio including ~20,000 patent families including ~3500 5G standard essential patent families. 


So why is a company with so many valuable assets and recently announced deals/partnerships still trading flat and so seemingly undervalued? The short answer is the former CEO made several bad choices which gave Nokia's competitors an upper hand on the current 5G landscape and put NOK share price in a long term downtrend which has gave it a reputation as a boring stock with an ugly chart. However, with new CEO Pekka Lundmark's expertise in driving returns to shareholders, as well as the scrutiny and subsequent bans of Huawei opening the door for competition, Nokia now has a much needed breath of life and a chance to gain market share to become the biggest beneficiary of the 5G revolution. The new CEO is determined to get Nokia to the top and pull in solid returns to shareholders, as evidenced by the slew of recent contracts/partnerships along with his plans for spending aggressively on R&D, as well as developing a leaner business model by cutting unnecessary expenses and unprofitable endeavors. 


Nokia is primed for growth as they plan into several emerging, high growth markets including 5G, IoT, Edge computing, Network Encryption, Cloud Radio Access, Software Defined Infrastructure(SDI), Cloud Managed LAN, Optical Communications and Networking, as well as established high growth markets such as Smart Wearables, Defense/Security, and LTE. 



Despite the slew of positive news surrounding Nokia and their partnerships/contracts, the stock is still very undervalued, even at today's price surge. 

That may soon change, as the stock's chart is beginning to signal incoming volatility. The implied volatility(IV) and volume for NOK call options are indicating big moves in the coming months. Open interest is on the rise as well. 




NOK is trading at a Price/Book ratio of 1.3x, compared to it's peers average of 4.0x and the sector average 2.2x 

NOK is also undervalued in terms of Price/LTM sales. It has a ratio of 0.9x, it's peers trade at an average of 3.9x, and the sector average of 1.8x

To establish the Fair Value Estimate, we'll use 2 models taking input from previous NOK financials, as well as data from competitors. (Competitors include: CSCO, ERIC, MSI, MSFT, and AAPL.

P/E Multiples: $14.94 target 

Earnings Power Value: $15.64 target 

The average for the 2 models imply a Fair Value Estimate of $15.29 




These estimates are based on historical data, therefore are fair values for the current price and past performance, not taking into account the market share and recurring revenue recently secured. I believe over the 3 months ad beyond the fair value will be much higher as earnings begin to reflect the value and growth from 5G contracts and recurring revenues. 


Even currently, those estimates are a bit low as Nokia's closest competitor, Ericsson, has a market cap that is nearly 70% higher than Nokia, despite the two having very similar financials and even trailing Nokia in several key metrics. 



At NOK's current share price of, it remains undervalued as ERIC is only ahead of NOK in 2 key categories, EBITDA and Profit Margin, and ERIC is only outperforming NOK by a slim margin in these categories. I believe NOK should be valued much higher, than ERIC since they are gaining contracts MUCH faster than ERIC and also Huawei, which would imply a share price of $7.11 before any buybacks place shares into the treasury, which would increase the price even further. 


Nokias Fair value is over $25

This is based on competitor ERIC who is valued 68.4% higher despite having trailing NOK in almost every key metric for valuation, and the valuation of Huawei who is losing tons of revenue and contracts in favor of Nokia"

I have been in and out of GME (currently have 35 shares, plus two call options totaling about $35k) but it is clear to me that as hedge funds move to cover the shorts they have laid, they are liquidating other assets, including their holdings in stalwarts like AMZN, AAPL, GOOGL, and the like. Just something to keep in mind if you are playing both GME AND FAANG earnings. Until the squeeze fully plays out, we can expect occasional sell-offs of the FAANGs and others that might impact the rest of your portfolio, assuming it isn't just GME.

This is v2, as v1 had various comments, which is fixed in this version.  Disclaimer: I am no way affiliated with Microvision, and this was created by me on January 24, 2020 to help spread information about the company. I am currently an investor of $MVIS and help moderate a forum on reddit - /r/mvis  Investment/Technology Speculation DD for Microvision – Microvision has been working and perfecting technology for a future emerging market for 28 years and those emerging markets have finally arrived.   In these slides, I will introduce Microvision, and their verticals, and why their technology is considered disruptive by many of their investors, and why I invested in the company, and stay invested after 3 years.  This Gallery does not go over financial DD of $MVIS, which you can easily do by going through their quarterly reports found here: [https://microvision.gcs-web.com/financial-information/quarterly-results](https://microvision.gcs-web.com/financial-information/quarterly-results)

Microvision was founded in 1993 to commercialize Virtual Retinal Display technology, in which images are drawn directly on the viewer’s retina.  Massive amounts of wealth has been pushed into R&D and patents, and has taken their toll in the past 28 years, accumulating a $572.6M deficit as of Dec 31, 2019. This amount has allowed them to accumulate 484 Granted and Pending Patents, and 28 years worth of Intellectual Property in design, testing, and manufacturing laser scanning devices.   Microvision is currently run by CEO Sumit Sharma. Before joining MicroVision Sumit Sharma was also Head of Operations for Google Glass for over 2.5yrs.   On April 2, 2020 they hired Craig-Hallum to help them find a strategic investment (which include M&A).. They signed Mark Spitzer, and Judy Curran to the board to help them facilitate this strategic investment.

 Microvision is the leader in MEMs Laser Beam Scanners (LBS). A key technology which could unlock consumer grade near eye displays, and long range automotive LIDAR.  (Explain like I’m 5) – The lasers work in coordination with the mems mirror. A current is applied through the silicon, which produces a “wobble” as seen in the gif. ASICs (basically a chip) controls the lasers, and the wobble of the mirror to be able to paint a 1440p image at 120hz (in the Hololens 2). The same method is applied with an infrared laser to be able to track objects, and provide 20 million pts/s.

Microvision allowed Microsoft to double their field of view (surface area), by switching from Liquid Crysta on Silicon Panels (built by Himax), to the laser scanning system without increasing the volume of the Light engine, while reducing the weight, and power found in the Hololens 2.   The doubling of field of view, does not mean less pixels per inch either.. As Hololens 2 has been able to maintain their pixel density, allowing user to be able to still read fine print through the near eye displays, unlike other components.

The basic concept of why Microsoft switched from a “Panel” type display like Liquid Crystal on Silicon, and decided not to use more expensive, and less mature technologies like MicroLED or MicroOLED is that with the panel type displays, the panel needs to proportionally get larger as the field of view expands. This makes it a challenge for designers and engineers trying to make a light weight consumer near eye display for augmented reality and mixed reality.  The beauty of the laser scanners is by adding a mirror, and a RGB module, they can change the angle, and create a larger FOV without proportionally getting larger.

Sharp / Socle (Foxconn) have already roadmapped a smaller RGB Laser Module to be used for near eye displays. Their mass production of these modules will only make it cheaper to use, as the technology accelerates. This also solves other issues regarding how much power the lasers draw (barely already), being able to create even greater efficiencies in immersion by creating wider field of views and something called “foveated rendering” which reducers graphical processing power by up to 70% in some cases.  High definition, wide field of view, low cost of processing. Holy grail of near eye displays. This is another reason why we believe Dr. Mark Spitzer come out of retirement, to join Sumit Sharma on the Board of Directors of Microvision.

 The estimated increase in the market is going to be a total of 41.3% more each year.  

 2021 - 8.6 Billion  

2022 - 12.2 Billion  

2023 - 17.2 Billion  

2024 - 24.3 Billion  

2025 - 34.3 Billion  

Or an estimated market market opportunity of 96.6 Billion dollars total of potential in the next 5 years. Now if a purchase of MVIS can capture even 30% of that potential, a purchase of the company, even with the associated yearly operating expenditures of many million dollars a year, the potential market share would be nearly 29 Billion dollars of value. How much does a prospective buyer pay for just the AR related MVIS tech when they could control 30% of a nearly 100 Billion dollar market over the next 5 years?

There is no confirmation that Microsoft is utilizing Laser Beam Scanners for their Integrated Visual Augmentation System contract for the US Army.   We only have Microsoft patents that show how they plan on achieving wider FOV’s, and that the Hololens 2 was used as the platform to create the IVAS device. Currently Microvision has not given guidance for finances in 2021, which we assumed is because of ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) regulations and NDAAs.  Most evidence we've compiled is circumstantial, but it's the same kind of information that allowed us to realize Microsoft was utilizing Laser Beam Scanners from Microvision in the first place.

Microvision is leveraging their 28 years of experience to create small (size of a VHS tape), powerful (OVER 200m range), and wide FOV’s (dynamically changing).  Re: How this is Solid State-  The weight/mass is so minimal, it is considered part of the chip... impervious to vibration. If I understand it correctly. From a physics perspective, imagine a brick and a tiny piece of fabric sitting on the passenger seat next to you when you drive. The brick is going to jump around with every bump. The fabric will be unaffected. Too small and light.

Low cost, small size.  Think of how Microvision was able to create an interactive laser projection system in a smart speaker with an MSRP of $199. One word: “Scalability”

Luminar, the market leader for LIDAR with it’s recent SPAC, is currently using a Mechanical MEMS system utilizing a polygon mirror the size of your eye, that spins aong with a planar mirror.  Their “Solid State” Lidar solution called IRIS doesn’t have very much published information, but a dive into their patent holdings shows the use of DMD style MEMS (solid state) which is owned by Texas Instruments.   This is the same technology used in Laser Projectors for theatres, that have excessive heat, excessive price, and excessive sizes (due to the heat sinks and fans required to manage the heat).   Had to look up the Luminar patent to find the vertical FOV, 120degx45degx300pts per squaredegree = 1.6 Million points... and we can't even complete the calc because hey maybe it refreshes a bunch of times a second...

Craig-Hallum and Microvision are currently focused on finding a strategic alternative, which incudes the possible sale of the company. It’s a dragged out process, but we’ve found multiple Tier 1’s that have shown they plan on expanding into the space Microvision currently holds large IP for (near eye displays and Lidar) which would unlock Consumer grade products for these OEMs.   Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook is just a small sample… which would include companies like Amazon, Google and other large whales.

320 was the highest strike available EOW.  
I couldn't resist any longer after what happened this morning.  
I was unable to close/open some of my positions due to the BS outings from the brokerages.

Also, CNBC/Melvin's statement this morning made me even more bullish.  
The fact that they stated they're out of GME is a huge green flag for me.

I put my money where my mouth is and going to let it ride until Friday (I don't care if it moons 300% tomorrow, I am holding).

I'll be sweating an 85K yolo on apple earnings tonight.  
If that goes well, I will be adding to my GME YOLO.

Despite all the differences I've had with the mods and other users, I will gladly set them aside for the greater good. We got this as a community!"

Smartphones

As you all know blackberry used to be one of the top leaders in phones but due to the invention of the smartphone and as their brand was known for their physical keyboards which cant really be translated into a smartphone they had to find a way to transition, apple kicked blackberry out the park with the original iphone and while blackberry was hesitant about the iPhones success they soon realized they needed to change their software as that was one of the reasons they were behind. So they went from a java based OS and built QNX but developers decided not to build for QNX and focused on iOS and Android, this led to a spiral in which blackberry didn’t sell many phones with QNX as there weren’t that many apps and developers weren’t focused on QNX because there wasn’t enough users, so they did the only thing they could do and changed to Android which meant they had no USP for their products. In 2016 blackberry announced that it would stop manufacturing their phones and license their brand to TCL which would manufacture and sell their phones until August 2020 where the contract ended, now they recently announced that they’re going to be working with a startup called OnwardMobility which means they could possibly gain some market share back depending on the phone.

Automative Software

Remember Blackberrys QNX software that failed, well they decided to use it for automotive software as it was designed as a RTOS (real-time operating system) which means it can prioritize performance and speed while also being secure, it isn’t an open software like Tesla which means it cant easily be hacked and they have been licensing this software for car manufacturers who use it for their infotainment. They have already struck a deal with amazon for their IVY program which is a scalable cloud based software that will read vehicle sensor data and create insights based off it for app developers without compromising security.

Huge EV potential for BlackBerry, and we know those old keyboards were the shit

You leave the Michelin 3-star restaurant that you decided to bring your wife and her boyfriend to. As you walk to your newly purchased custom made Tesla (codenamed Model G), in the corner of your eye you see your old workplace. You think to yourself *hmm.. brings back memories.* You take out your BlackBerry G1000 and tell SiriQ to drive your wife and her boyfriend home as you cross the street. You think to yourself *wow* *Siri has gotten 10 times better after BB bought over AAPL and merged Siri with QNX.*

As you enter your previous 9-5 abode, you smirk as you say to yourself *Sir, this is a Wendy’s.* That joke just never gets old. Upon entering you immediately recognize the server. You used to hate him but that hatred has now turned to pity. *Ah I’ll throw him a bone* you think to yourself as you give Andrew the secret hand signal to meet you at the back for the Wendy’s Special.

You go out back to your usual spot but notice there’s a homeless man there sleeping in the dumpster. Andrew then says *It’s $12,200 for a handie*. Exactly the price of one GME share. Oh god… has he really not covered his short position yet?! You take out your wallet to pay Andrew his fee but he catches you off-guard and snatches it away from you. He throws your wallet to the man in the dumpster and they both made a run for it. In the darkness you vaguely make up the back of the man’s shirt which read “Melvin Capital”.

You shake your head as you take out your phone and tell SiriQ to send aid. Two beams of light descend from the sky and blast Andrew & Melvin. *Impressive* you think to yourself as you witness first hand the power of GothamX, a collaboration between Palantir and SpaceX. GothamX blasted a non-lethal laser developed by Tesla from a SpaceX satellite using the pinpoint accurate latitude and longitudes provided by Palantir. *What a technological marvel* you think to yourself. This was the only DD that you needed.

*What perfect timing* you think to yourself as your self driving Tesla Model G comes back after sending your wife and her boyfriend home. You submit your limit order for 10,000x contracts of Palantir & Tesla FD’s, get in your Tesla and head home. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.

This is what you said in response: ""The company is not aware of any material, undisclosed corporate developments and has not material change in its business or affairs that has not been publicly disclosed that would account for the recent increase in the market price or trading volume of its common shares.""

Seriously, BB Comms? This was a fantastic opportunity for you to hammer home the turnaround narrative, that BB is no longer the washed-up datapad/phone company that lost out to Apple and Samsung ten years ago, but is now an EV data and security play, and that the broader market is starting to realize and reward the valuable turnaround efforts you have made. Instead, you go with \*this\* ham-handed, mealy-mouthed comment? Show some backbone and have your investors' backs, ffs.

Edit: Disclosure, 323 shares at avg basis of $10.31. Ngl, that response made me want to pull out my investment on principle. If you can't even execute on a simple comms message, how the fuck are you going to execute on IVY, QNX, recurring revenue streams, etc.? "

I've been shilling the same shit since 7 months ago consistently, the stock is up around 130% during that period, and I am personally up 5x with a variety of calls.

https://preview.redd.it/tcfjvcpcqed61.png?width=1969&format=png&auto=webp&s=5884c4ce0b27d9c5c0d2db34d4c0f6d2592650c5

The fundamental thesis is still the same, from a valuation standpoint, JD is the cheapest out of JD, PDD, BABA, which are the largest e-commerce players and are all available in the US so you can buy the hell out of options. Why is it being cheap a good thing? You can load up on positions without the worry of being weekly yolos and holding garbage. There are also a number of momentum-based factors I will outline.

Why eCommerce? Consider it the most direct way to tap into the Chinese consumer, instead of Starbucks, Nike, or Apple, where the Chinese market takes a heavy share, eCommerce accounts for 1/5 of all retail in China, compared to 14% in the US. ECommerce in China is better supported by financial technology, and it shows in the sense that all the eCommerce players expanding into finance, squeezing the hell out of the 600M people in China with less than 1000 Yuan ($154) income through loans.

Besides its core business, both BABA and JD provide alternate exposure, BABA its cloud sector, ANT, as well as a variety of investments, and JD its logistics, teledoc platform, as well as fintech (JD digits).

https://preview.redd.it/8ddbtvzvqed61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=444d00497569d3db92a768bc1099d84886608bad

||Market Cap|Revenue|Revenue Growth|Net Income|Income Growth|Annual Active Customers|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|BABA|700B|22.8B|30%|7B|44%|757M|
|JD|149B|25.7B|29.2%|0.8B|80%|441.6M|
|PDD|211B|2.09B|89%|\-0.067B|Lost 1/3 of the same quarter 2019|731.3M|

What can we tell from these metrics?

1. JD still has much higher room for customer penetration, and comparatively has a much higher spend per user compared to PDD
2. JD has a similar revenue and growth rate as BABA, the only issue is low margins, which is growing at a faster rate than BABA

https://preview.redd.it/984cw23fved61.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=49015022d18645efb234bd193806c0712f6b60b8

As long as margins improve, JD will remain a cash machine. One can easily see how the most emergence into positive margins led to the rally from 2019 (obviously other factors exist, Chinese market as a whole low, CEO scandal, etc.).

Momentum-wise there are also a few reasons why you should be having at least a portion of your portfolio exposed in China:

1) Biden announcing some sort of resolution with China that is not continuing the trade war will send the entire sector soaring (Chinese equities showed the opposite during the trade war)

2) China is a better growth opportunity, faster GDP, income growth, growing consumer spending in general

3) Xi wants the companies back in China, there are clear inflows of mainland money into HK, where many Chinese companies have done secondary listings 

Most of the price increases I see first in HK, which continue into the US (why the PM tends to be green). 

4) Xi is opening up to WS, and WS is drooling at Chinese exposure considering US firms are allowed to operate independently/ joint ventures with majority holdings in China

Hong Kong and international investors held a total of 2.1 trillion yuan (US$320 billion) worth of Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchange A-shares as at November 10, 2020, compared with 86.5 billion yuan at the end of 2014, shortly after the launch of Stock Connect.

Mainland investors held HK$1.88 trillion (US$240 billion) worth of Hong Kong-listed shares through Stock Connect as at November 10, 2020, up from HK$13.1 billion at the end of 2014.

5) Flow of index money, HK changing rules so that tech stocks will be added into Hang Seng, which currently extremely conservative even more than the DOW

6) I wrote about why I was bearish about BABA a few weeks ago, I think the tide has turned on that matter. I have held calls that captured almost all of the 15% spike, and am also bullish. A government resolution will push all Chinese stocks higher, consider how the day Ma was found, all the peers of BABA rallied both in HK and the US market

7) Earnings are coming up, similar trends of ""Best Quarter Ever"" will probably continue, given last quarter does not capture all of the sales during EOY ""festivals""

I am interpreting this release since I can't find the actual study published (probably as it is prelim data)

[https://investorrelations.sarepta.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sarepta-therapeutics-announces-top-line-results-part-1-study-102](https://investorrelations.sarepta.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sarepta-therapeutics-announces-top-line-results-part-1-study-102)

To begin with Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) affects boys.  about 1/5000.  So more accurately around 1/10000 in the general population.  A lot of the DD says it is 1/3000-1/5000 but it is almost exclusive in boys.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchenne\_muscular\_dystrophy#:\~:text=Duchenne%20muscular%20dystrophy%20(DMD)%20is,pelvis%20followed%20by%20the%20arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy#:~:text=Duchenne%20muscular%20dystrophy%20(DMD)%20is,pelvis%20followed%20by%20the%20arms).

The words they use the describe the study are good, I like placebo control and double blinded.  It is a small trial on 41 people with 21 getting placebo and 20 getting the actual drug.  It looks like this was on 4-7 year olds.  I haven't seen a Duchenne's patient since residency so I can't tell you if this is the best time to treat or if they should be treated earlier.  There were more 6-7 year olds than 4-5 year olds.

&#x200B;

To begin with their biologic markers look worse than their previous study.  There they got ""mean of 81.2% of muscle fibers expressing micro-dystrophin"".

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7296461/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7296461/)

In the new study ""*Participants who received SRP-9001 (n=20) had mean micro-dystrophin expression of 28.1%, as measured by western blot*."" (link above).  To me that reads bad results.  Then again the mean age was 4.8 so this might work better for younger kids. As more of the kids in the second trial were older  (again not my area so I am outside of my scope).  

&#x200B;

They are able to show a less than 1/100 chance (the P value of 0.009) that improvement on the standard scale for assessing DMD symptoms in the group that got treatment.  The group that got placebo also improved which is weird but improved by about half as much

*At every time point measured, the cohort of SRP-9001 treated participants outperformed the placebo group, and, at 48 weeks, participants in the treatment group demonstrated a statistically significant increase of 1.7 points in NSAA total score compared to baseline (P=0.009), while participants in the placebo group saw an increase of 0.9 points on the NSAA total score compared to baseline, which was not statistically significant (n=21, P=0.1411).*

I said that it might work better in younger kids, this makes sense as there is more development to happen.  

S*tudy randomization was stratified by age group and, in the pre-specified analysis of participants aged 4-5 (n=16) at the time of treatment, the treatment group demonstrated a statistically significant 4.3-point improvement on NSAA total score at 48 weeks post treatment compared to a 1.9-point improvement in the age-matched placebo group (P=0.0172). The functional status at baseline for participants in the 4-5 age group was balanced across the placebo and treatment cohorts.*

This looks like a win to me.  The NSAA is an appropriate test and is very common looking at DMD (I googled so again out of scope [https://www.physio-pedia.com/North\_Star\_Ambulatory\_Assessment#:\~:text=Duration%20%2D%20Participants%20%E2%80%A2-,Objective,the%20disease%20and%20treatment%20effects](https://www.physio-pedia.com/North_Star_Ambulatory_Assessment#:~:text=Duration%20%2D%20Participants%20%E2%80%A2-,Objective,the%20disease%20and%20treatment%20effects).).  That improvement is comparable to the improvement in their previous results. 

*All 4 patients showed improvements in NSAA scores and reductions in CK levels from baseline throughout the study and up to 1 year after treatment (*[*Table 2*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7296461/table/noi200033t2/)*). The 1-year NSAA score improvement was 7 points in patient 1, 8 points in patient 2, 2 points in patient 3, and 5 points in patient 4 (mean, 5.5 points). Patient 3 (aged 6 years) would be expected to decline, and thus the true Δ of improvement was likely greater than 2 points.* 

Looking at older kids there would expect to be some decline and their randomization screwed them over it looks like.

*A statistically significant imbalance (P=0.0046) in baseline NSAA total score was present in the cohort of 6-7-year-old participants (n=25), resulting in milder participants in the placebo arm (n=13) than in the treated arm (n=12). The significantly different baseline characteristics between treatment and control groups in the 6-7 age group may have contributed to the inability to observe a treatment effect in the 6-7 age group at the week 48 timepoint in Part 1.*

In summary, this isn't a cure.  The NSAA scores don't resolve to normal, but it improves things.  We don't know long long the improvement lasts when it is given in young kids (if it slows the expected decline as compared to a placebo by a clincially significant amount it would be a game changer).

&#x200B;

From an investment prescriptive I try to avoid health care related stuff to avoid conflict of interest (medicine has professional standards and stuff).  That said I personally think it probably got beat downmore than the study would point to (I would think the market shrunk from 4-7 to 4-5 based on this) but no scary side effects and for lack of a better treatment this is probably the only game in town.  When I take action on my aapl call gains I am thinking of putting some into this.  I would want a year before on expiry on any option plays so more news can come out 2 years would be better and 3 years best since the study runs to 2025.  I do think from what I see that it will win approval in the 4-5 year age range.

&#x200B;

TL;DR. The study looks like it was well done but the should have targetted 4-5 year olds it seems to work to some degree there.  If the US were like the UK/Europe it woud be compex but in the USA it looks like based on this data it will eventually win approval.  Longer term play.

BlackBerry IVY is like the browser, it unlocks a shit ton of monetization opportunities. BB 100x by 2030. 🚀🚀🚀🚀

IVY is the upcoming vehicle data platform built by BB with AWS providing the infrastructure.

According the McKinsey, potential revenue generated by car data will reach 450-750B by 2030. This was written back in 2016 so I'd say this estimate should be at least 50% higher. Thanks JPOW.

I think by 2030, BB will have this sector BY THE BALLS. BB QNX is already in cars manufactured by TOYOTA, HONDA, GM, FORD, MERCEDES-BENZ, VW GROUP, BMW, HYUNDAI, MASERATI (FCA, Now STELLANTIS), JAGUAR (TATA MOTORS). That's literally ALL of the major car companies in the world. By having an existing business relationship with them BB will take them to bed and make sweet love to them with their IVY dildo.

If you look at current ""platform"" revenue models from VISA to AAPL, the platform can take in anywhere from 2.5% to 30% of the revenue. Given a 50% market share and 15% revenue share that would be 50B revenue a year for BB. Thats ONLY from cars. They can expand the data platform to other embedded platforms like... anything you fucking want. By 2030 Starbucks' coffee cup's gonna be an embedded system.

Risks:

Car companies are known fuck ups. They fucking suck at everything, even making cars. Hopefully they invest enough to build something meaningful on top of IVY.

Position: 300 shares, various calls.

Buying more shares on Monday. probably $10-15K total.

After seeing a recent post in which the OP excitedly paid off their student loans, during a 0 interest/0 payment period with the possibility of future loan forgiveness in the upcoming stimulus bill, my jaw hit the floor. Why would this paper hand take his gains and all but waste them like this? Why not continue making bank on the meme stocks? After 30 seconds of discussion, my friend and I thought of a new investment tool to help these poor smooth brained souls. 

ATFs

These ATFs, or Autist Trust Funds, would work similarly to the very popular ETFs (love you Cathie). 
When an autist hits it big on a WSB yolo on robinhood, they must take a test before withdrawing their winnings. Some possible questions would be:
“Would you use these funds to pay off 0 interest student loans?”
“Do you think NKLA is an undervalued company just waiting to make a comeback?”
“Did you buy Hertz after the bankruptcy announcement?”
“Have you ever lost money selling naked calls that was meant for the IRS?”


If said autist answers YES to any of these, they fail, and the money is automatically reinvested into an ATF which contains your typical trustworthy stocks like AAPL. They would of course be allowed to keep $1000 to continue playing roulette with their robinhood account to entertain themselves. The managers of the ATF would control the funds until a worthy expenditure was provided by the degenerate.

Howdy folks, 

First of all, I apologize about the poor formatting here. If anyone wants my spreadsheets which comes with the equations and algorithms in the proper cell, I'll be happy to share it with you, but only if you're an academic or institutional investor. I'd love to get your insights and thoughts about this offline if you're an academic or an institutional investor.  

I a developing a math model for stocks based on the entire universe of calls and puts which expire on January 2018. My assumptions in developing this model, which I call the Omniscient Option Writer’s Model (OOWM), are the following:
1.	The options writers are the smartest investors. They’re like a Supercomputing Godhead.  
2.	If a person were to buy the entire calls/puts for a stock whose expiration date is on January 19th, 2018, there is a range of stock prices that this Universal Options Investor (UOI) would profit. Note, that the motives of the OOW and the UOI are opposing. 
3.	There is a stock price where the UOI would make the least money, and this coincides with the OOW making their greatest profit. This stock price which maximizes the OOW is, imaginatively, called the OOW’s Max Profit Price, OOWMPP.
4.	Conversely, there is a stock price that the UOI would make the most money, and this coincides with the OOW losing the most money.
5.	I’m assuming that the future movement of the stock is based on the OOW Stock Price. So another words, today’s stock price will converge to the OOWMPP on Friday, January 19th, 2018.

To determine the OOWMPP, I must net the entire universe of calls and puts which expire next January 19th. From experience, this requires an iterative algorithm. But just to give you an idea of how I determine the OOWMPP for a stock like AAPL, we will look at the entire options for AAPL. These strike prices for the calls/options are all found here: https://www.google.com/finance/option_chain?q=NASDAQ%3AAAPL&ei=FgDXWPHFIoaa2AbhtY_gAQ

Here is the source code that I used in MS Excel to determine the gains/losses of a call option for a given price. 

This would be placed in H6: =$G6*(IF(H$1< $A6, (-1*$B6), -$B6-$A6+H$1))

H$1 – the stock’s price that we’re testing to determine the OOWMPP
$A6 – Strike Price. 
$B6 – Price of this option.
H$6 – the TOTAL gains/losses if you were to own every single one of these calls based on the stock price that we’re testing from H$1. 
$G6 – Contains the number of Open Interests for this particular option price with strike price located at $a6

Similarly, here is the source code that I used in MS Excel to determine the gains/losses of a put option for a given price. 

This would be placed in H101 = $G101*(IF(H$1>$A101,(-1*$B101),(-1*$B101-H$1+$A101)))


H$1 – the stock’s price that we’re testing to determine the OOWMPP
$A101 – Strike Price. 
$B101 – Price of this option.
H$1 – the TOTAL gains/losses if you were to own every single one of these puts based on the stock price that we’re testing from H$1. 
$G101 – Contains the number of Open Interests for this particular option price with strike price located at $A101

I do this for the entire calls and puts. I graph the total gains/losses VS the stock price for the OOW. For AAPL with a stock price on $139.04, here are the data points to give you an idea of what the curve looks like:

Stock Price
$0
$10
$20
$30
$40
$50
$60
$70
$80
$90
$100
$110
$120
$130
$140
$150
$160
$170
$180
$190
$200


Here is the total gains for each stock price if you’re interested in seeing this curve yourself. 
Total Gains
-$33,005,172
-$28,050,362
-$23,095,552
-$18,140,742
-$13,185,932
-$8,269,550
-$3,511,425
$1,016,960
$5,252,510
$8,939,673
$11,256,440
$11,523,520
$10,565,730
$8,012,385
$4,188,220
-$864,925
-$6,574,400
-$12,523,505
-$18,707,900
-$25,079,490
-$31,451,080

If you graph this, you’ll see that this curve has an apogee (a maximum), and that it intersects the X-axis twice. The points where it intersects the X-axis represents the stock prices where the OOW breaks even. 

The two stock prices where the OOW breaks even are exactly: 
First $0 Gains stock price  - $67.73
Second $0 Gains stock price - $148.32

So another words, the OOW would only make money if the AAPL were priced between $67.73 - $148.32. 

In order to determine the MAXIMUM profit and the OOWMPP at which the maximum profit occurs, we see based on these data points that the OOWMPP occurs at around $110. When I “zoom in” on this model and test prices from $100-$120 using a $1 increment instead of a $10 increment, I see, once again, that the OOWMPP is at $110. As a matter of fact, when I superfine tune this and use a $0.01 resolution, I see that the OOWMPP is EXACTLY $110. 

First $0 Gains stock price  - $67.73
Second $0 Gains stock price - $148.32
OOWMPP - $110.00

-got a nice upgrade to BUY, ER Is around the corner. I don’t think the algos picked up the upgrade yet

[SPCE](https://i.imgur.com/qKQ1nS4.jpg)
-somebody rushed a bunch of calls through EOD. My best guess is imminent space launch or something 

[NVAX](https://i.imgur.com/ebyj4B7.jpg)
-saw deep OTM calls coming in towards the end of the week. Could be big news coming, or could’ve been an assumption based on all the weird vaccine news about PFE and MRNA that came

**Edit**: there were some I forgot to mention because I didn’t have screenshots. ZNGA going absolutely apeshit, FSLY with quite a few calls after an upgrade, and INTC very bullish call volume and OI on the heels of a few upgrades after their ER plunge. There were tons of PT upgrades for tech last week, seems like names can 🚀 next week with earnings season here. 

Many more to be added Monday probably since it’s statistically the best day to follow whales. Some of these already had decent AH pops yesterday.

A friend asked me, what would happen to stock prices of big international companies like AAPL if we ever entered into a sideways market like Japan for an extended period of time?  Would these companies still find growth?  He thinks that stocks always come back up after a big crash and says there is never any reason to sell but I told him to look at the Japanese market.

# What is Corsair?

*“CORSAIR offers a complete range of products to equip gamers, enthusiasts, and esports athletes, including mechanical keyboards, precision gaming mice, wireless headsets, premium PC components, and the CORSAIR ONE fully-integrated gaming PC.”* **Basically, they sell high-quality items to gamers.**



## Gaming Peripheral Industry as a Whole

The global gaming peripheral market size was valued at USD **3.88 billion in 2019** and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of **10.4% from 2020 to 2025.**

And who tf sells gaming peripherals? CRSR and its main competitor Logitech (LOGI)...

**Now let's step into the ring with LOGI and CRSR**

($LOGI)

Net Revenue: +73%

Gross Profit: +108%

Operating Income: +18%

Net Income: +276%

($CRSR)

Corsair Net Revenue: +60.7%

Gross Profit: +112.4%

Operating Income: +353.6%

Net Income: +2293.5%



Obviously, Corsair is expanding like a fucking madman and will continue to do so this year. They are stacking up very well against LOGI numbers-wise.

The fun doesn't stop there... ""\[Corsair\] commands over 18 percent of the US market share in gaming peripherals and nearly 42 percent of gaming PC components.""

Logitech has a current price of $104 and a market cap of $17.2B Corsair has a current price of $38 and a market cap of $3.35B

**CORSAIR IS LIKE 2/5 THE PRICE OF LOGI BUT IS EXPANDING QUICKER, ACQUIRING MORE COMPANIES, AND HAS AWAY MORE LOYAL FOLLOWING**

## What differentiates them from the competition?

1. **Quality:** Anyone who buys a corsair product will instantly realize the superior build quality and feel. Somewhat like Apple products, Corsair products are ascetically pleasing, last for ages, and offer many creature comforts.
2. **Name Brand:** If you look at any PC forum that recommends what parts to buy Corsairs’ name will always be popping up. Experienced gamers know what Corsair offers and superior build quality. Most of the time one-off Chinese brands that also sell PC peripherals are not named; People recommend Corsair instead. Almost all of the commentators on this Reddit post swear by Corsair's product line. This is not just a one-time occurrence, it can be seen regularly; Enthusiasts recommending Corsair due to their amazing products.
3. **United Product Front:** Unlike a lot of their competitors, like Logitech or Razer, Corsair has a diverse product lineup for inside and outside of gamers’ PCs. Almost all of these product lighting can be controlled by Corsair's proprietary lighting software. Lighting sounds very stupid, I know, but gamers love it as it makes their PC look cool. With iCue all of the owner’s Corsair products can be controlled from a single interface. This encourages people to stay in the Corsair ecosystem once they purchase their first Corsair product. Everything just works together perfectly.

To sum up, they shit on their competitors for their better execution.

**Their products:**

Computer RAM (light up)

CPU air and water coolers (light up) Keyboards (light up)

Mice (light up)

Headsets (light up)

Mouse Pads (light up)

Computer power supplies (light up)

Headset stands (light up) RGB strips (light up)

PC Cases (light up)

PC Case fans (you guessed it, light up)

**If a consumer can buy all of their peripherals from one company and have them work harmonically together, why not?**

## But consoles are becoming more and more popular…right?

Yes - and Corsair is covered. They own “Scuff Gaming” which is “a global innovator and creator of high-performance gaming controllers, providing superior accessories and customized gaming controllers for console and PC that are used by top professional gamers as well as casual gamers”

Scuff has cornered the 3rd party controller market. When someone has a non Xbox or PS4 brand controller they ask, “Is that a scuff?” Scuff is the only real name brand company that makes comfortable and quality 3rd party controllers. Unlike Corsair there is much less high level competition in this space. Also almost all competitive console players use a scuff controller due to the superior button layout and customizability.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/91fonxmq7yc61.png?width=914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ef39e5a08918c9c38ebf3048241f4fdbd8a61c7

## I see a lot more people streaming on youtube and twitch now…Is there money to be made?

Yes! Corsair also owns Elgato which creates necessities for streamers. Elgato does not only offer necessities for steamers but also for YouTubers, filmmakers, and hobbyists. They offer a wide variety of products to produce high-quality videos. Again like Corsair, Elgato is one of the best, if not the best, at what it does in its industry.

## But who wants to build their own PC when I can just build a prebuilt?

I think you know what I am going to say. Corsair offers this through their subsidiary Origin PCs. Origin offers some great value for money prebuilt PCs because they can secure exclusive deals with Corsair as it is its parent company. I am not going to sugarcoat this, but Origin does have ALOT of competition in this space but I think it is good that Corsair has exposure. I know multiple people who really like their Origin PCs but I know just as many who own other prebuilt that get the job done.


**Your whole setup could be Corsair…**


https://preview.redd.it/js7wto5s7yc61.png?width=529&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1be497c21bdef1b9292840378107f03aff9dd73b


**TLDR: CRSR** 🚀 🚀 🚀🚀

They shit on their competition, that plain and simple

**So how am I playing all of this?**

**SHARES SHARES SHARES (for their next ER which is expected around Febuary 10th but has not been confirmed yet).**

There will probably be a runup if the hype is there so calls could be good to capture that IV runup but I am sticking to shares so I have less risk holding through ER.

Edit: I’m only in shares

If you’ve been on this subreddit or know anything about meme stocks, you know about the stocks that have skyrocketed recently. GME, AMD, PLTR, AAPL, TSLA, NVIDIA, CRSR, etc. 

There is a stock that almost all the big tech companies, EV companies, and meme stocks had in common. TSM

If you don’t know what TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing) makes computer chips. You definitely own at least one TSM chip, whether you know it or not. 

Here is a list of a few of the companies that manufacture their chips with TSMC: (from [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20leading%20fabless%20semiconductor%20companies%20such,such%20as%20Allwinner%20Technology%2C%20HiSilicon%2C%20Spectra7%2C%20and%20Spreadtrum.))

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Apple Inc., Nvidia, Intel, Qualcomm, Xilinx,  Altera,Texas Instruments. 

It would take me years to research every single product that TSMC manufactures, but here are a few of the most significant ones that I found:


AMD:All AMD chips are manufactured by TSM any reason to buy AMD is also a reason to buyTSM 
   AMD CPU’s: This also includes AMD Ryzen Processors which are the most bought CPUS on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computers-Accessories-Computer-CPU-Processors/zgbs/pc/229189) As well as the processors that go into many laptops. 
   AMD Graphics Cards: Apple uses AMD Graphics card in their Mac products. They are also in many windows PC’s and laptops, and they are used by miners. 
   Xbox/PlayStation Internals: The PS5 and Xbox Series both use AMD CPU’s and Graphics, which are manufactured by TSM. 

Apple: Apple manufactures All of its processors at TSM. TSM made chips are in every iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, Air Pod, etc. the new M1 Apple in house silicon Macs are also made by TSM. 

Nvidia: Nvidia is the world largest GPU company. They also make self driving processors for Tesla, Nio and other companies. 

Qualcomm: Qualcomm makes Arm processors. Qualcomm processors power everything from Samsung phones to smart TV’s to Amazon Alexa. 

Xilinx: they make most of the 5G processors that go in towers and phones. Samsung Phones use Xilix cellular chips. 

Texas Instruments: they make your fucking calculator. 

There are many many more companies that TSM manufactures chips for. They are also on a more advanced process mode than any other company in the world. Do some of your own research and find out what other products TSM makes. 

See how many products in your life are powered by TSM. 

Chances are, A TSM manufactured chip could be inside your phone, your computer, your TV, your smart speaker and other smart home devices, your wifi router, your cars radio/gps, your cars self driving system (if your car has it). Your wireless headphones, the cell tower in your neighborhood. Even your calculator.

The “cloud” is also powered by TSM. The servers that google, Amazon, one drive, Spotify, Palantir, etc. 

If you can find just one area of technology that does not, at some point, use TSM manufacturing, comment it below. 

If you can’t then buy some fucking shares. 🚀🚀🚀"

Here’s what we know. 

Canoo - $GOEV has a deal with Hyundai to provide them with their B2B skateboard platform for their new electric cars. This is great and all, but let’s be honest, we’re not moving away from GME for a fucking Hyundai here. All you fuckers have Lambos and Tesla’s already, no time for that shit. 

So here we are back in the glory days of February 2020. TSLA, SPCE, PLUG, and Lumber Liquidators were rocketing 🚀🚀🚀 off to the moon 🌖. No wearing a fucking mask all day, we could drink with our friends, pass a blunt, and snort cocaine off hookers asses without first having to douse them in sanitizer. Ah the good ol days... anyways back to this gem of a deal that has brought us to where we are today. 

Hyundai and Canoo collaborate and agree to use Canoo’s skateboard platform for their upcoming EVs. See article below;

[Hyundai News Release](https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/2982)

Also check out the skateboard (slick marketing, very inline with a fruit named company 🍎)

[Slick as fuck Skateboard video](https://youtu.be/3ucsFNUTqtM)

Now I know your pants are starting to get a little tight or damp, and that’s ok, but stay with me here. 

Hyundai acquired Kia back in the 90’s, as a whole they sell about 7 million or so cars a year. They have set a goal of 25% of their cars sold to be electric by 2025 (not that far away). 

For those who can somehow read, but aren’t so good with this things that aren’t letters but are used in math. Let’s do some for you. 

7,000,000 cars x 25% = 1,750,000 that’s like, over a million for the folks above. Now I’m sure you’re wondering where the fuck are my rockets??? 🚀🚀🚀 There have a couple to keep you going through the next bit. 

Let’s move ahead to current day, world’s a fucking mess 😷, but Shittron is eating some of that 💩 for breakfast because they’re broke as fuck after trying to short GME. 🌈🐻s have all realized Stonks only go 📈, and they’re looking for a way to rebuild their kids education fund after blowing it all on puts. Apple has decided they want some of that dirty Tesla action, and head out looking for a way to get into the electric car business. Not knowing how the fuck you actually make a car, they go out looking for someone who does since they hope to be selling 400,000 cars by 2025ish. Here comes Hyundai, yeah they used to make shitboxes that no one other than Shittron employees and 🌈🐻s would drive, but now they’re stepping up their game. They’ve partnered with this up and coming company, who are doing some pretty cool shit - Canoo. 

So hypothetically Apple has been rumoured to be working with Hyundai/Kia for their new car, who had partnered with Canoo to use their skateboard as a base. So here we are with this little stonk with a market cap of somewhere around $4 Billion and a $17 share price. 

[Article about Apple working with Hyundai/Kia](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/apple-car-kia-hyundai-work/)

Skip this if you don’t want numbers, but I think you’re going to like this part. 

Canoo is going to be making some cars, yeah cool, whatever. The real value in here though is their B2B skateboard platform for EVs. We already figured out if Hyundai is selling 1.75 Million cars, and Apple wants another 400k or so, we’re now over 2 million cars a year. I’m going to go ahead and guess that this skateboard is worth somewhere conservatively between 5,000 - 10,000 (Canoo has already said their cars will cost 33,000, so I’ve estimated but let’s call it $7,500). 

2 million cars x $7,500 = A whole lot of fucking 

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Or give or take $15,000,000,000 yup $15 Billion fucking 💵. We’ll go with a revenue multiplier of 5x because I think that’s fair. 

5 x 15,000,000,000 = $75,000,000,000 Valuation. 

Let’s remember today’s market cap is $4 Billion. 4B x 18.75 = 75B again for all you simple folks out there that’s 18 full rockets 

🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 + a semi erect dick. 

So is this Tesla, not yet, but am I in for a potential 18x ride to the moon? Fucking right I am! 

Now let’s show this little stonk some love, and make some fucking Millionaires. 

TLDR 

GOEV = 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 + a semi erect dick. 

Side Note: Don’t be the guy that has to live with telling people that you sold your Canoo stock at $25 💎🙌🏼 Let’s go to tendie town

EDIT: Thanks for the awards, but buy positions instead!

For all clarity my position in this is small, but adding whenever I have cash available. 

Bought at $17.33 and $17.05 still waiting on approval for options trading but I think the calls are looking tasty as fuck around $20-$25 1-2 months out. Maybe a bad call to post this before I could buy more, but this one’s for all of us to make some money on."

**Intro:**

Most people look at Blackberry (formerly known as RIM) as a dead cellphone company. A company that’s basically a prehistoric dinosaur at this point with a small cybersecurity portfolio left of their business. Their inability to adapt against cell phone companies such as Apple & Android vendors has caused their main revenue driver to plummet into non-existence. However, their business has been able to keep afloat in the past few years due to their competitive advantages around cybersecurity. Many government officials & corporations till this day still use QNX from BB as their mobile/security platform due to these advantages.

**Word on the street:**

Around last year summer, word on the street was that BB is looking to partner with Amazon on a EV platform around data sensors, automation, and cybersecurity. Stock prices at the time was around $4-6 CAD. Just looking at financials alone and the amount of $ revenue they bring in compared to the industry standards, $BB stock price seemed quite undervalued in comparison. However, this made sense since $BB has failed to deliver and disappointed shareholders over the past years.

Whether we’d like to believe it or not -- EV (electric vehicle) is the future in the next 5 years. Whether that is one day where we run out of fossil fuel… or people moving towards environmentally friendly options, there is much to be explored and the market is relatively immature.

In today’s world, every automotive company is chasing EV currently and wants to avoid becoming the next “Blockbuster” prehistoric company. The question we need to ask next is, “Do they have the necessary tools & solutions to help them transition in that journey?” To answer this, I will give a quick example. Most farmers do not build a tractor to farm their crops. They instead go out and buy one than to waste precious time seeing their crops die. I believe this holds true for automotives as they lack the necessary skill sets to develop a platform that can run cybersecurity, data sensors, and automation for their cars. If you didn’t know already, popular car services such as Apple’s CarPlay and Google’s Android Auto all already operate on top of QNX today in our cars today. Amazon’s partnership will only help accelerate that movement as QNX will be linked to their public cloud to do over-the-air monitoring, upgrade, security, collision crashing assistance, autonomous driving, AI machine learning, and many many more.

**What’s happened recently**:

Well… their partnership with Amazon came true around December. In addition to this, they’ve sold off their 💩 cell phone patents to Huawei so they can finally focus purely on Cybersecurity and EV.

Icing to the cake, they’ve recently won a settlement against Facebook so they gotta pay up that $$$ to $BB which hasn’t been reflected in their quarterly report yet.

SpaceX, Zoom, Qualcomm, governments, and many more are working with $BB as we speak today. Sony recently just announced their partnership with $BB for their next upcoming car last week. Overall, lots of exciting news back to back.

This explains the excitement around $BB and why it’s been taking off recently. I believe they will continue to do so as the EV and Cybersecurity market continues to evolve from its infancy. (With other digital ""currencies"" growing, would there be a bigger cybersecurity play for $BB? Who knows)

**So.. what are the Risks:**

3 things I can think of currently:

1. No Revenue Growth despite all of the above
2. EV doesn’t take off as much as it should. COVID is impacting sales of cars or sales of anything in general. Self-explanatory there
3. Someone creates a better platform over $BB

This all depends if $BB is capable of hiring great salespeople to execute on their job. Only time will tell.

**TLDR; In Conclusion**

Most boomers will avoid $BB because they think it’s a cellphone company. Anyone that’s googled it recently will know that this isn’t true. I personally think $BB is very undervalued and with the reasons I’ve explained above, I feel there’s much potential for the company to grow. Lots of people are going to be selling it when there’s a bit of a profit but I think the company’s barely scratched it’s potential.

Finally, the ret….s WSB from reddit are using lingos such as “to the moon” and “Rockets 🚀🚀” for $BB so we all know people are dumping hard on this to make it the next big thing.

Let’s head to Mars bro📈 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Every year new Gen z social retards become 18 and add to the pool of people swiping their life away on Tinder. You ever meet a fucking teenager these days? All they do is look at their phone. They are literal social retards.

This pandemic has forced everyone onto dating aps who is looking for a little piece. IDK how shit is where you live, but you're not even allowed to talk to strangers in a bar here, and the bars are forced to close at ten. Anyone who was averse to meeting people online has adapted to the new norm.

Hinge is a trillion times better than bumble, and even though Bumble is doing what the retarded people at Instagram should have done they still have no chance against MTCH. 

MTCH's earnings is coming up in early Feb and they are going to demolish it. You ever hear of thing called cuffing season? Your wife's boyfriend will let you know. It's when it starts to get cold outside and women go searching for someone to cuddle with before it gets cold. This earnings will cover cuffing season in a PANDEMIC.

AAPL extended their rally to close the day up 3.67% to $136.87, nearing ATH once again thanks to some more positive comments from analysts this morning. Morgan Stanley up their AAPL PT from $144 to $152, while Bernstein notes Apple's strong iPhone 12 demand cycle. In other big tech moves, FB closed up 2% to $272 as Evercore ups their PT from $320 to $355; AMZN trimmed their earlier morning gains but still closed the day up 1.34% to $3,300; finally, after running up 6% yesterday, GOOGL retreated from a morning high that almost touched ATH to close the day at 0.22%.

* GME euphoria roars along unabated as WSB continues to go all-in on the gaming retailer. With intraday moves of over 13%, GME is as volatile as ever. Shares initially traded red in the morning but soon rally to as high as $42 when it became apparent Citron's video was postponed yet again (damn hAxOr!), but the stock soon went red once the video was uploaded. Suffice to say, Citron's video on YouTube immediately accumulated thousands of dislikes while not revealing anything material that the market wouldn't know about already - and shares recovered after an initial dive. Through the rest of the day, shares bounced from low $40s to the ~$42 sell wall, but eventually broke through during power hour and closed the day up 9.99% to $43 - a relatively strong bullish close considering GME hasn't closed above $40+ since last week's big pump. Support appears to be around $35-$37 and resistance is around $42-$43.

* Morning numbers had jobless claims falling slightly by 26k to 900k for the week ending in Jan 16 with consensus being 910k. Housing Starts saw another strong month with a 5.8% increase to 1.67m in Dec. Finally, Philly Fed manufacturing index showed a strong uptick with numbers at 26.5 vs the consensus of 12, representing an 11-month high. 

* Airlines took a beating today with UAL leading the charge. With steeper than expected rev miss from their ER, UAL closed the day down -5.7% to $42.69. DAL closed down -2.28%, JBLU -2.37%, LUV -0.91%, and AAL closed down -2.10%.

* In an unexpected move, INTC released their earnings early before the market closed and the stock traded with strength to close the day up 6.46% to $62.46. After digesting the numbers, shares retreated in AH to a current -3% to around $60. INTC reports Q4 EPS of $1.52 while consensus was $1.10 (hence the pump minutes before close) and they also projected Q1 EPS of $1.10 while consensus is at $0.93. The blue-chip semiconductor company is also upping its quarterly cash dividend by 5% (boomers love their dividend). The sector performed well today with AMD up 3% and NVDA up 3.75%. As with before, AMD's AH is a reverse of INTC with Su Bae showing boomer INTC what's up. AMD is up another 2.8% AH to $94.10.

* IBM took a heavy beating, with AH currently at -6.4% to $123 as the large IT company reports fell short of the street's expectation. While adjusted Q4 EPS was $2.07 beating the consensus of $1.79, revenue was $20.37 bil vs $20.67 expected. Especially troubling was IBM's cloud segment, producing 6.84 bil instead of the consensus of 7.18 bil.

* In WSB meme stock land BB traded red for most of the day but edged out a flat close to 0.47% to $12.85 (though it is retreating again in AH as of writing at -1.87%). ICLN closed up 4.41% to $32.66, filling the gap from last Friday's sell-off. Meanwhile, MT continues being pressured and closed the day at -1.49% to $23.

* More notable ER movers: STX reported ER and while numbers were decent, shares are retreating AH to -4.83%. WDC follows suit AH to -2.45%. TAL, the Chinese after school online learning platform, rocketed up 15% for the day after reporting a strong quarter. Shares of other Chinese ADRs in the sector also performed strongly with GSX (a Citron short) up 11.62% and EDU up 6.95% for the day.

* The DOW closed down 0.04% or -12 pts, Nasdaq up 0.55% or 73 pts, SPX up 0.03% or 1 pt (look at all those gains), and RUT close down -0.89% or -19 pts.

* Notable numbers tomorrow: PMI at 9:45 AM ET with existing home sales soon to follow at 10 AM ET.

1. People believe we're in a short squeeze.  TL;DR People that are short have no problem selling more at a higher price
2. The numbers are bad.  Gamestop's retail hardware sales are down even as hardware sales tripled.
3. Valuation

* Hedgeye rec at 14$ at at time when exp EBITDA 330M, not 71M.  If they actually hit 330M (which he feels is impossible), price target would be 26$
* Trades at 40x forward 12M EV - EBITDA.  Apple trades at 23.  Bestbuy 7, Wallmart 13.  Too expensive

4. The funds that are shorting are smarter than you and have big names

5. Company can become your biggest enemy by selling additional stock if the stock is high.

She expects the company to post fiscal first-quarter revenue of $108.2 billion driven by strong iPhone 12 sales, and she boosted her price target on Apple’s stock to $152 from $144 ahead of next Wednesday’s report. Huberty also expects record earnings per share of $1.50, above the $1.41 that analysts surveyed by FactSet are projecting.

Huberty called the iPhone 12 “Apple’s most successful product launch in the last five years,” which she said likely set the company up for success in the holiday quarter and beyond. Consumers seem to be opting for higher-priced iPhone models with bigger and more expansion storage configurations, she wrote, a boon for margins.
She isn’t so concerned about potential weakness for the smaller iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini models, since she said those devices are more popular in international markets with more price-conscious consumers. Apple also looks poised to continue benefiting from challenges at China’s Huawei, she argued, as the rate of customers switching from Huawei to Apple is at a 15-month high.

Other product categories could also be set up well amid the pandemic. “Sustained work and learn from home demand coupled with a strong holiday season give us confidence in our above consensus iPad, Mac and Wearables December-quarter forecast,” Huberty wrote. Though she’s slightly below the consensus forecast with her services projections, she sees opportunity for upside there as the App Store appeared to have another strong quarter. Her main concern on services is that AppleCare purchases are often tied to in-store shopping, which isn’t as prevalent given store closures and stay-home trends.

TLDR: Apple to the 🌕 incoming 🚀

PLTR is experiencing a heavy strong trend with a bull and flag. It's broken support this morning and is back up. PLTR has had positive momentum, tons of new contracts and lots of volume. It's been in this pennant and is due for a breakout. PLTR's Demo day is the 26th of Jan and earnings is Feb 11. Demo day is gonna showcase new Palantir products and outline what PLTR has in store for 2021. 

**A case for longs:**

Palantir aims to put together software that compiles data that provides insights into potential problems, solutions to these problems, and help solve complex, real-world problems. This data and analytics is fully interactive, and machine-assisted. So far, Gotham and Foundry are Palantir's products. Gotham is the military/government grade software and Foundry is the commercial equivalent. Apollo is a program that essentially removes the need for support teams when Gotham and Foundry need an update. Apollo gives Foundry and Gotham users the luxury of updating their software like it's an IOS update. These three products are the fundamentals of PLTR

Palantir's goal in the commercial and govt space is to grow in scope and scale. This prepares them for a horizontal integration. They are trying to build a wide moat for themselves in order to secure an opportunity for vertical integration as well. By preparing themselves for both vertical and horizontal integration, they are going down a road not dissimilar to that of Standard Oil. There is not a doubt in my mind that this company is run by people who know what they're doing. 

PLTR is now the biggest company involved in government data. The US cannot afford to have PLTR go under, and thus it will never go away- the only way is up. The real question is, how fast is it going up?

""Looking ahead, Palantir is poised to become the default central operating system for data across the U.S. government and its allies. The company also aspires to be the central operating system for data at large businesses and even entire industries. To appreciate Palantir's ambition with regard to B2B big data, it may be helpful to recall how much economic benefit has been captured by Microsoft (MSFT) after Windows OS took the lead over MacOS of Apple (AAPL) in the PC era, and by Google and Apple in the consumer mobile phone age with their respective Android and iOS operating systems.""

Competitors in this niche tech field are quickly swatted away. BAH and ACN lack the technical power and can't compete with PLTR pricing. Even defense contractors such as RTX, BAH, SAIC, and BAESF cannot compete with the costs and user-responsiveness of PLTR. You might ask why a big shot like google isn't stepping in to work with the government, to which I would chuckle and remind you that google stated they think the pentagon is ""unethical"" and prefer to work with the Chinese government on Project Dragonfly ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly\_(search\_engine)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly_(search_engine))). 

I'll go ahead and rattle off some quick deductions of mine. They have an aggressive merger and acquisition campaign. To grow into adjacent verticals, they absorb companies that are already there, quickening the speed they grow at. They are Capital-light and operationally efficient. Their ROI is very high and they can sell their product with existing hardware for as long as they are the best program to use. Meaning their software needs to be installed once but can be sold as many times as they like, as long as they keep their shit together. They are seriously dominating domestically in their niche. Their wide moat due to the M&A campaign and good management for vertical + horizontal growth gives them a monopolistic outlook. They are in the captains chair. 

**Forward thinking**

PLTR's last Q described sales growth of 46% in international sales. They want to move into Canada, Australia, UK, France and other allies of the U.S. They will very likely establish themselves there as well. They have a Foundry Joint Venture contract in Japan with Sampo Holdings for the wellbeing of the Japanese people. It was $500M. They are likely looking for a contract with Japan's government as well. 

My short-term PT for PLTR is $34, passing ATH. This pennant is a strong trend and it is gonna break out hard. All signs point towards a bullish breakout so I'm loaded up on calls, overexposing myself three times with what I'm usually comfortable with exposing myself to. 

Long term, I can imagine PLTR breaking $100 within 2 years. With a growing need of govt software and national security, *PLTR's value can only go up*

**TLDR: PLTR $34 by early Feb.**🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"

He currently drives a 2008 Ford Five Hundred with 280K miles on it. For comparison, I drive a Model 3 and don't make as much as him.

He agreed to the following: I instruct him how to invest $10K and if I can grow it to $45K, he'll buy the Model Y.

Position thesis:

$STPK (Stem Inc): They are incredibly undervalued at $1.3B. Tesla's valuation is significantly dependent on them ""not being a car company."" This points to their energy storage business which most analysts have projected would account for half of their revenue in the future. Energy storage is a $1.2T industry and Stem is the current market leader (ahead of Tesla!). Their Athena software controls how that energy is used based on demand charges/variable electric rate/renewable generation/ect. This SaaS allows the owner to improve their ROI. Citron price target of $100 puts their market cap at around $15B which is incredibly conservative. Considering their 348% growth target this year BEFORE Biden's clean energy plans-this stock is set to explode.

$GOEV (Canoo): There was just a fair market analysis done that suggests their business is worth over $26/share. That's before any Lyft or Apple agreements which we should learn about by March. There seems to be a lot of discussion/confusion around Hyundai's E-GMP skateboard design. The E-GMP platform has been co-developed with Canoo using their IP. Canoo should get mentioned when Hyundai/Kia begin announcing their new EVs built on this new modular skateboard EV platform. A Apple/Hyundai agreement on an EV would certainly benefit Canoo. They were seeking an investment in early 2020 from Apple and instead, Apple wanted to discuss an acquisition. Canoo turned them down and went public instead which shows their tech is legit.

Apple announced in 2020 that they plan to increase the level of privacy of the iOS users, with the release of iOS 14. What does that mean concretely?

\--> As soon as you open a new app, they will ask with a pop up ""Do you allow this app to track you across different apps"". We expect that 10 to 20% of the users will say yes. Bumble officially said while filing their IPOs that could be a major risk for them, to do proper analytics on their users.

Therefore, all the apps relying on paid acquisition, won't be able to track where you are coming from, and if you are a rentable user. Therefore, it makes it even harder to create profitable user acquisition campaigns on mobile. Those who will suffer from it are casino, midcore, casual games, as well as all the apps relying on paid subscriptions. It will provoke a drop of eCPMS (price per 1000 impressions of ads), as there will be less demand on the ad networks.

Certain networks will suffer more than other, but the biggest one is Facebook.

99% of the revenue of Facebook is coming from ads. It means that they will still be able to do targeting on Facebook itself, but not on the networks of apps that run ads (like all the games). Facebook is a key player in this industry, and this will certainly provoke a drop in terms of revenue (9M businesses are relying on their ad network).  They officially said that IDFA change (this iOS privacy update) "" Could Have A Material Business Impact"".

Apple postponed their measure to Q1 2021, but this will come.

Google usually follow suit with these kind of measures.

More info:

 

1. Some quotes:

Facebook [published](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2020/06/18/value-of-personalized-ads-thriving-app-ecosystem/) a blog post outlining a test it had conducted comparing how revenue differed between personalized and non personalized ads on its Audience Network. Facebook said it observed “more than a 50% drop” in publisher revenue when personalized targeting was taken out of the equation —though it didn’t publish a detailed outline of the study.

2. The iOS market is the most profitable mobile market. It represents around 50% of the total revenue for app publishers, while only 27% of mobile owners have an iPhone.

3. In any case, the advertisers won't be able to track properly the performances of their campaigns. Even if they will still be able to target users, they won't be able to know how efficient it is, as we used to today. Moreover, if you increase the amount of ads in Facebook, this will definitely have an impact on the retention rate / session length. This is a lot of fine-tuning, but the solution isn't there.

&#x200B;

TLDR : Significant drop in terms of ad revenue on mobile due to the new iOS privacy change. It will prevent targeting and tracking of the users. Facebook will suffer from it like crazy, as well as other ad players such as Unity, Ironsource (IPO soon) or Applovin (IPO soon), and apps Bumble (IPO soon).

Play : Wait for Q4 Revenue annoucement of Facebook. Then short Facebook until next quarter, when the measure will show its impact

Spurred by zero-commission trading and COVID tailwinds, this booming segment of stock market traders has reshaped market behavior. 

I've been scraping discussion on WallStreetBets for several months, and tracking how often different tickers are mentioned every day.

The graph below visualizes yesterday's discussion on the forum. Size represents the number of times a ticker has been mentioned, whereas color brightness represents the performance of the stock. GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) had the highest discussion count with 495 mentions and returned 10.89% for the day.

[WSB Heat Map](https://preview.redd.it/48jg1izvjic61.png?width=1119&format=png&auto=webp&s=089b824acc9dcd7f89689c71d661f0d127d164ee)

A quick look at the above graph shows that many of the companies listed have experienced parabolic stock growth and volatility over the last several months. This begs the question: **Has WSB discussion been a leading indicator for stock performance?**

To test this question, I backtested a simple strategy that buys and holds the 5 stocks that were most discussed on WallStreetBets in the previous week. We ran this backtest using data from 2020.

The graph below shows the portfolio holdings by week (click for full-size image):

[WSB Portfolio Holdings](https://preview.redd.it/smkp7dualic61.png?width=1119&format=png&auto=webp&s=c95d1d4bbc1047a2c76b26fbfc3305143dc39d6d)

Tesla, Apple, AMD, Nio, and Microsoft were among the stocks that most frequently cracked the weekly top five most-mentioned tickers.

Over the last year this simple strategy was up over 61%, with especially strong returns in the last quarter of 2020. The ""WallStreetBets Portfolio"" was more volatile than the S&P 500, but outperformed even during the downturn at the start of the year.

To take a look at the relationship between WallStreetBets discussion and market activity at a stock-level, I’ve picked a couple stocks that were among the most popular on WSB in the last 120 days and examined them to determine if there is a correlation between WSB discussion and share price and volume.

**Palantir Technologies Inc (NASDAQ: PLTR)**

Big data analytics company, Palantir Technologies Inc, had its highly anticipated IPO on September 30, 2020 trading at $8.20. Shortly after, on October 14, the discussion volume of PLTR tripled to nine counts as well as achieving a 4.65% gain on the day. WSB count and share price activity continue to share a positive correlation coefficient of 0.592 as the stock reached a 52-week high of 33.05 on November 27, 2020. *\[Note: A value of greater than 0.7 is considered a strong correlation. Anything between 0.5 and 0.7 is a moderate correlation, and anything less than 0.4 is considered a weak or no correlation.\]*

&#x200B;

[Palantir Price vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/f8p41x1jkic61.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=2090f0fba5f9ee39cf7f3ed21932d31d6a0e1264)

WSB counts and PLTR volume for the same dates recorded a correlation coefficient of 0.803. This could indicate a large amount of individual-investor interest driving the recent valuation of Palantir which features a low proportion of institutional ownership at 14.41% (3Q20), compared to the industry average.

&#x200B;

[Palantir Volume vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/4qiik9ekkic61.png?width=1354&format=png&auto=webp&s=074100895bb7e99da71462126ed7f972d5763948)

PLTR received three downgrades from investment banks between October and December 2020 but added a price target increase to $30.00 (from $18.00) by Jeffries on January 11, 2021, well above its current price of $25.64. Risks still linger as 2Q20 to 3Q20 EBITDA losses increased by 83% to an $848.1m loss and, as of now, positive investor sentiment continues to support an uptrend.

**GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME)**

GameStop Corp. has experienced financial stress in recent years as the retail trends which had worked in its favor continue to decline globally. Total Liabilities climbed 12.18% to $2.26B from 2Q20 to 3Q20. Before May 5, 2020, WSB activity on GME had been dormant averaging 3.83 counts daily YTD.

Shortly following this, several threads on WSB began to speculate on a GME recovery due to increased gaming activity and a large existing short position of 57 million shares at the time. WSB counts would be amplified after an investment from activist investor and founder of Chewy (NYSE: CHWY), Ryan Cohen.

Since May 5, 2020, GME has rallied 755.33% and WSB discussion counts averaged 55.34 a day making a positive correlation coefficient at 0.688.

&#x200B;

[GME Price vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/g8xj575nkic61.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b458e40d9866fbecbedc224b5679ba885463f5d)

The WSB counts and stock volume also shared a correlation coefficient of 0.628. This was exemplified on November 30, 2020, when stock volume spiked by 31.3m and discussion counts followed suit at 227 for the day.

&#x200B;

[GME Volume vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/3d3xn8dokic61.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=af618e9f2ea29d71d69d86dc1884a44ec42bbf24)

The mainly optimistic speculation of a GME recovery in May on WSB contrasted with most major media outlets at the time, which appeared to focus on store closures due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The rally and enthusiasm behind GME since that time was in stark contrast to many other corporations, 630 of which filed for bankruptcy in 2020 marking a 10 year high.

## Summary

There is no universal method of finding actionable insights when analyzing WSB, but discussion on the forum can serve as a useful estimation of retail interest. Companies that have had exponential growth with help from forums such as WSB are more likely to become transition to an organic growth phase with more institutional investors and less volume. Keeping an eye on rising companies on WSB could help identify an opportunity that many may have overlooked."

Even if you ignore the fact that it's grossly undervalued given their cash flow, even if you ignore they are the major player in 5G space and are already making billions in patent royalty a year.

Let's put all that a side for a second. The new national security concerns after the major Russian Hack and Chinese compromised hardware will continue to become top priority for many countries. NOK is a MOON stock in the making. 

* Finland is bidding the stock up to retain ownership and to prevent acquisition.
* Nokia itself has so much cash it has also been buying back back shares and will continue to do so. We are at the lows!
* Now USA is trying to buy stakes now that it's dumping Huawei.

Also since I expect people talking about the 5 billion shares outstanding. Yes but realize its a $4 stock, the average buys are much larger orders. Also for reference apple has 16 billion shares.

The 5G play just started this year with the release of Apple's first 5G phone, sorry for those who invested too early the years prior and got burned.

This is a huge event for the stock and a major catalyst for their streaming business including many new titles that have not yet been announced. I am expecting more demand for the stock after this date. This is a show an prove story abd the company has already proved with 100% revenue growth in Pluto TV. 

You have Pluto, paramount plus, and showtime, the IP catalog is deeper than anyone else and second only to Disney in top tier franchises. The catalog of the older films and shows can be remade in addition to the massive existing pipeline of content. I’m expectIng a lot from paramount and the MiraMax deal is still not being talked about. Expect a huge drop of content in late February. 

You should all put VIAC in the watchlist, I’m long with options that expire 45c end of week, 47c 2/5  52.5c and a bunch of equity plus leaps at 2023 at 55. 

I’m long on streaming with Disney too but this trades at a fraction of the p/e and undervalued by any measure. People are talking about them getting acquired but that’s past this point they are going deep with streaming and I think you’ll see even more content coming from then to others like Netflix and Amazon and Apple. Viacom cbs has more production capacity than anyone else because of all their cable projects as well as CBS. CBS sports, showtime, BET, MTV, Comedy Central, and many more brands. 

Also see the NFL on nick was a huge success and I think it could lead to even more sports content on the network.

There have been a lot of DD posts on this name recently, all of them see what I see. 

Serious fucking value right in front of you. This stock is gonna be a 🚀🚀🚀 and it’s already making headwinds in free streaming which is going to be a massive ad market. 

I see the best value play on one of the top 3 best streaming plays, Disney is first and Netflix second and it’s obvious viacomcbs is a third place lock given how poorly others have launched like HBO max was a disaster. 

Do your own research on this one but we are few months away from this becoming the biggest play for streaming in terms of pure upside. Viacomcbs are still priced so low they can make mistakes abd the stock will still go up. If you consider how well they have done on execution post merger this price is ridiculous. 

On any meaningful valuation analysis this company is objectively undervalued and will continue to increase in price as more news comes out about paramount plus.

We will also get updated financials as end of year result on the 24th and it will lead to another big signal that this firm is finally in the right direction. 

If your pissed you missed Disney or Netflix big moves you need to be looking at viacomcbs."

-Incredible value
You’ve heard this before, now let’s understand why.  Looking at the cyber security industry, BB outperforms on a number of metrics.  Price to sales is 5.85 vs 11.31 industry.  As well price to book is 3.11 vs industry 11.44, this indicates relative to its industry BB is highly undervalued(Value investors look for P/B ~(0-3), so BB just about fits in there). They also operate on gross margins 3.3% higher than industry.  All this to say, BB is going to reach a more accurate share price, it’s just a matter of time🚀🚀🚀
-outperforms market in cyber security, 10% more growth on the year than the industry average and it still has undervalued metrics, this is only the beginning🚀🚀🚀
AWS Partnership

-Partnership with Amazon Web Services to expand QNX systems that are already trusted and viable.  New system will be backed by Amazon and allow new capabilities for car manufacturers to interpret sensor data and improve driving experience for their cars.  Possible features included but not limited to predictive maintenance, tracking driving habits and even book spots for EV charging along your route.  Once integrated with Amazon’s IoT and machine learning services, IVY will be ready and is expected in 2023.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

-Amazon is helping to market IVY so it will be extremely competitive from an industry leading cloud computing company and also backed by the goat of cyber security (BB), their birth child IVY will secure Tendies for all WSB retards🚀🚀🚀🚀
-John Chen👑

Saved BB in 2013 from sinking to nothing with Apple as competition, pioneered them back to the front(soon)of another field and is still CEO.  If that wasn’t enough, he is taking bonuses in shares and gets a huge bonus when shares reach $30, this means his bottom line for the company vision is the same as ours. Shares🚀🚀🚀🚀🌚
-Large Mobilization of Funds

BB sold 90 patents to Huawei, which serves 2 fold, no more fees on those patents and also increased capital.  As well they settled with FB for an unknown amount, this also is a double edged sword, no more uncertainty(or fees) due to lawsuit and they will have a sizable settlement (hopefully to spend on R &amp;amp; D) for IVY🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Reasons (not)to Buy:

Earnings Down/
Analysis, QNX loses a significant portion of revenue, given auto industry was significantly impacted, so was licensing sales of QNX, Chen says sales will return to previous when auto sales correct.

If IVY cannot increase profit margins or expand user base it will be an R and D cost alone...  Given the new value however, I’m confident in its larger profit margin. Or at the very least in leu of new value and a credible partnership significant increase in licensing sales, especially so in the Emerging EV market!🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

In conclusion BB 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌚
Position: 80 shares @9.70

Edit: BB gapped the shit put of GME on the day, +25% on the day we’re bursting through the stratosphere Retards🚀🚀🚀"

Smart move my fellow degens 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 strap in, cause you're in for a ride to the moons of fucking pluto.

TL;DR Blackberry/AWS IVY will be in every single vehicle produced after 2022. EV or ICE, self-driving or boomer driving, it doesn't fucking matter. It 🚀 will 🚀 be 🚀 in 🚀 every 🚀 single 🚀 one 🚀 Oh, and Blackberry QNX Neutrinos RTOS is fun too.

Before you start reading, I'd suggest grabbing a snack and a drink. Cause I'm about to drop a fucking novel.

You've probably heard Blackberry QNX a few times around other DDs but you're wondering wtf is it and who the hell is even using it. QNX is an Real Time Operating System (more on this later) meant for vehicles, and it's been around for a really long time. Currently there are at least 175m cars running around with QNX. As for what cars those are, I'll keep it short: Apple Car Play was developed on QNX.

So why haven't we heard more about Blackberry in recent years since there's so many QNX cars around? 2 reasons. 1: Dumbasses like you thought it was a phone company. 2: QNX is so ahead of the fucking game that boomer auto manufacturers like Ford and Mercedes were too stupid to use it effectively. For the last few years it's just been used to turn on your car's radio. *But things have changed now.*

**Zombie cars and QNX**

QNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. *What the fuck does that even mean nerd?* For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.

Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.

Fast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot *program* but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?

[SONY?](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-reveals-more-details-on-its-secretive-vision-s-sedan/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGWdfOT_GLnUXiZBQr4m4lDr6V0nzG6pkRMU6WLRNhsLRKDJHY4MAwxHb-HWZr3pDmEfBYyleSgqSAIjoeXMqU6MfKVSgBbWY5t8brOzZ61dAfzBMOQezOwKfHLLecBdHNEqSjqSskM_c-uUKa-IndxUGWi_Ay9pQMD4kj0iDqvI) Blackberry QNX.

If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? [Li Auto](https://en.desaysv.com/index.php?id=4974) But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using [Nvidia](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/nvidia-announces-world-first-functionally-safe-ai-self-driving-platform) DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both [Canoo](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/blackberry-to-power-autonomy-systems-in-canoos-next-generation-electric-vehicles) and [Hyundai](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2019/hyundai-autron-selects-blackberry-qnx-to-power-next-generation-adas-and-autonomous-driving-software-platform) makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. *But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.*

You might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Linux is also an open source OS and this becomes a huge problem when we talk about zombie cars.

That's right. *Motherfucking zombie cars*. You know that scene in ""Fate of the Furious"" where Charlize Theron straight up just hacks all the cars in the city and starts slamming them into buildings? Yea, this is a legitimate fear of the U.S. government and Linux is not going to pass any safety regulations. And you better believe after SolarWind and FireEye hacks, Cybersecurity is the hottest topic right now when it comes to national security. You better believe the U.S. Government won't just allow open source OS flowing around millions of autonomous driving cars that can be hijacked at any time of day.

You know who does have MULTIPLE government certifications already though? Blackberry bb. I won't get it, but you can read [u/josh\_moworld](https://www.reddit.com/u/josh_moworld/)'s post right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/) to get a better idea Blackberry's history with the U.S. government and security.

The best part about it all is, Blackberry designed QNX to be 100% POSIX compliant. In dumbass terms it basically means any LINUX based program can be ported over easily. Come join the dark side, Elon.

Now that you're pretty much caught up to speed on QNX, let's move over to IVY and why I believe IVY will be Blackberry's return to the throne 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

IVY is a co-development between Blackberry and Amazon and it is a 50/50 partnership. That's right; Jeff Bezos, the second richest man in the world and king of predatory business practices chose to partner with a company that has a $5.5b market cap. All hail, John Chen 👑👑👑

So what is IVY? Basically IVY cloud-based software that OEMs can install into their QNX vehicles (or any OS) and read sensor data from the vehicle's DCUs (domain controller units). These are basically sensors that give you data such as: times that you unlocked and locked your car, your car's wheel speed sensors, wiper arm sensors, tire pressure etc. In a Tesla, which is loaded with sensors, you will also see: sentry mode data, when an small object hits your car while parked, how hard you step on the accelerator, how hard you brake etc.

IVY basically captures this data and in real time sends it to OEMs for them to analyze. Cars are going to be fitted with more and more sensors (regardless of if they have autonomous systems or not) and the data that IVY provides is very helpful. This allows OEMs to see their customer's car preferences or driving styles and can further develop their future vehicles to match customer's interests. Also, since the data is transferred in REAL TIME, things like horrible weather conditions, traffic updates, and icy roads can be communicated to all vehicles within the OEM network so that people can be notified ahead of time.

But you know which industry would *love* this? Insurance companies. OEMs can gather all the safety data that IVY delivers and actually PROVE to insurance companies that their cars are safer. You know how Tesla had to come up with their own auto insurance? That was because Insurance companies were charging crazy high rates for Tesla's that had auto pilot. They didn't know exactly how to rate the risk, or who would take the blame. With Blackberry IVY, OEMs and insurance companies can partner together and have reliable data to work off of.

Best part of it all, IVY is extremely scalable and is a subscription based service. There isn't an exact price announced yet, but you know if Jeff Bezos is involved then there will definitely be a lot of profits flowing in from IVY.

For me, I'm long-term on $BB with some options to take advantage of the recent hype. I plan on holding shares until I see an actual competitor to QNX and IVY... which I've looked all over the internet and I can't find any. And honestly, Blackberry's security suite has so much to offer this isn't even the complete DD. I've just been typing for too long and figured it was a good time to stop. Maybe I will write another post in the future."

TLDR up front, BlackBerry has pivoted away from making phones and instead is in the software sector. Some big names that they have include,  [SpaceX](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=0&article=1737&context=smallsat&type=additional), **Nvidia**, **NIO**, **Xpeng**, **Ford** and 19 out of the 25 EV companies now use QNX.

**Software**

BlackBerry has gone away from the phones business and has reinvented itself to become the main player in Automobile OS systems. They have lock and key in this market since many OEMs don't want to start from the ground up making the software themselves. As of June,2020 they have the QNS software in over[175 million cars](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-175-million-vehicles-301081594.html). Nvidia uses BlackBerries QNX for the base of its [self-driving car](https://channeldailynews.com/news/nvidia-to-build-its-ai-self-driving-platform-on-blackberry-qnx/58048). Sony is also partners with Nvidia and BlackBerry for the car they are [making.](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-reveals-more-details-on-its-secretive-vision-s-sedan/) Not to mention the companies that use QNX are subscription based, so reoccurring revenue. This is speculation on this part but Hyundai is using QNX and has partnered with Apple, and carplay is a layer built on QNX.

**Fundamentals**

BlackBerry recently just sold all of there phone [patents](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-blackberry-sells-90-patents-to-huawei-covering-key-smartphone/) to Huawai showing that they are no longer in the phone sector. Big Boys have been adding more BB to there pockets and the last 13F was on the 15th (1/15/21) (Fin---tel)

[https://gyazo.com/d9894e59a75885c1506dd3a2ef576ebe](https://gyazo.com/d9894e59a75885c1506dd3a2ef576ebe) I had pictures to show it but the braindead bot removed it.

Other big short inst---itutions have a hard on for keeping this low, BB was in the top 20 most shorted stocks but GME was number 1. Just this Friday(1/15) Shorts and inst---itutions sold alot.

The **50 dayMA crossed the 200dayMA** in December and has held since then. Also check out that 188million green.

Morningstar and CFRA both put $BB with a fair value price of 6.40, so you can assume that is the absolute bottom. (copied from [u/ThegreatLoudini](https://www.reddit.com/u/ThegreatLoudini/))

They also have **more cash** **than Debt**.

Blackberries Future is looking good.

Y'all need to read this cos this is the whole fucking thing.

this is also basically my magnum fucking opus so upvote retards. Dont give me awards, legit go buy a powerup membership for a year. Cant tell you to buy shares because we gonna get closed down by SEC somehow.

im also not some fininacial advisor or whatever just read this and make your own conclusions degenerates. Im not fucking liable lmao but i am balls deep 125 shares @ 19 average now, its literally all I have on this earth.

TLDR: GME DD sumarized, Margin wont affect longs the same way as shorts right now. Dont buy shares on margin though and get ready to supply collateral regardless. Short interest is up and some smart retards are on our side. Read the post to raise your IQ from 8 to 9 though. **🐻 🌈s  mega fuk and even posting high level bear shit to scare us.**

Compulsory 7 rockets so you autists dont start having a seizure or something:

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Basically been seeing posts about ""blah blah margin this, short interest this, WS to clever blah"". Going to split this post into distinct sections but im no english degree so dont expect any bear bloomberg  level shit or something

# 1. GME is a fucking steal regardless of squeeze. Buy now or be left on a dying planet while we head to alpha fucking centauri.

So basically everyone here knows about Ryan cohen and his horsemen of the apocalypse coming to steal melvins lunch money. This man bought apple stock in 2017. Hes fucking rich. Hes also an eccommerce wizard, taking CHEWY from a measly 100k co-founded company to a $4 Billion company in 2017 at which point he sold it to petsmart or something. Its now valued at $40 Billion, granted anything eccommerce now gets money thrown at it like a stripper in a high flying strip club or some shit , so dont listen to me, so it may well be a bubble. Regardless the thing grows its revenue like bacteria doing binary fission on agar jelly 🚀🚀🚀🚀.

THEY SELL FUCKING PET FOOD. the market for that is like what? $1?. Gaming is going to the moon and is basically recession proof because of how cheap game is compared to other things for how much you get out of it. Any bears saying that Gamestop cant compete with digital or with amazon. Ryan cohen already slapped amazons head in with a no name brand. Hell fucking do it again. About digital everyone here already knows, microsoft deal, Ryan cohen also mentioned the possibility of having ""Digital game exchanging"" or something, image below.

[Online trade ins. It says online.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/2ba9j5d2zvb61.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b6f3f26c3588fdb8cc779aee8a3b1ce42859f33)

He also mentions streaming, digital content etc and aside from all the digital stuff wants GME to move to a community centric structure where big stores operate with VR centres, Internet cafe, table games like Dungeons and dragons and  40k (rapidly growing somehow will boom post covid) and as we now might know due to this post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme\_dd\_buildapc\_kiosks\_coming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/)

BUILD YOUR OWN PC KIOSKS. This is the literal smell of money. Go to your Gamestop to build your PC with your kid? Gamestop is already the goto place wher your parents go to get you your latest digital fix so now they can go build PC's and it cant go tits up?

**Now for some pussy boomer talk (aka fundametals or something).**

The expected Q3 EPS was -0.84$ or something close to that. The actual loss was -0.53$ but boomzoids only talked about the revenue drop. No shit sherlock its closing all its dead weight stores.

In the holiday report I will talk about a bit more below, 11% of stores were closed and revenue dropped only 3%. Comparitive store sales increased nearly 5%. They cant get enough consoles to sell so expect the momentum to carry on for the whole year I expect. Eccommerce is up 300% over holidays. In Q3 they reported 800% to date. In 2020 Gamestops eccomerce went up 24x. YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT. Online sales now account for \~33% of Gamestops sales now. This is literally gold dust for ryan cohen.

We are still trading at 0.38 P/S at this price. The average P/S for the SP500 is 2.753. Massive upside on these two numbers alone.

Burry got in this for the MOASS and the intrinsic value. At the time intrinsic value was like $22 and this will pump up as RC takes it to new heights.

GME in Q3 somehow halved the expected loss. Big Bad Boomer sherman somehow didnt fuck it up that bad by saying ""omnichannel"" at the speed of light. Yes the revenue dropped 30% but thats covid for you. As the PC kiosk post above shows GME now sells small items basically so fast they have to have fake stock lmao. The new console cycle always spikes the share price sky high too, as youll see in a crayon drawing later. The potential revenue that this console cycle brings in could be huge. Biggest ever is potentially a true statement and Gamestop sells every fucker they get. Combine the fact that they share game pass ( a massive hit) revenue from the xboxes they sell, something no other retailer has, revenue could be sky high.

Now I know you autists are starting to develop short term dyslexia or something but keep reading. This could be the most important piece of shit you read in your life. How do you think I feel? My brains overheating just trying to write coherent sentences.

Holdiay report was a bear trap imo, saw people saying the decrease in revenue was bearish blah blah blah. Lies. Comparitve store sales rose 5% and thats with some towns having like 4 gamestops. When the leases dont get renewed and these stores get liquidated (Also in Ryan cohens letter) they can just get this influx of cash and pay down debt and invest in logistics and marketing and new growth. Gamestop realistically needs like 1/2 the stores they have now and just need to improve efficiency.

[https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890) this article the messiah himself wrote. In it he states:

>At Chewy, we had maniacal discipline when it came to how we spent money. The company-wide culture of frugality came from his example. Free cash flow was our unwavering governor of growth. We grew Chewy from $200 million in sales in 2013 to $3.5 billion in 2018 while spending only $130 million in capital, all of which went into opening distribution centers across the country and acquiring new customers.

Maniacal. Thats all I need to say. The guy is going to get to mars before papa musk and he wont even break a sweat. When FCF starts to catch up to WS expectations every analyst who donwgraded them is gonna get ditched and upgrades will start to happen.

So in the heading i said its a steal. That implies some future higher price target right? Well here is my guess for a conservative price target based on the information above and also some more I probably forgot cos im a retard.

&#x200B;

[The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares \(another reason shorts are fuk\)](https://preview.redd.it/dehiug393wb61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=f198773c36d5109382eb2beba6fade3c059121df)

>The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares (another reason shorts are fuk)

This alone means if for not inflation adjusted terms we reached 9.8Bn or whatever the crayon chart says we should reach:

9.8/2.48 = \~3.95   3.95 \* $35.5 = \~$140. The share price now to reach old mkt cap is $140 fucking dollars. Thats a 4 bagger from now. It gets better.

from [statista](https://statista.com) :

>Considering the **annual inflation rate in the United States** in recent years, a 2.24 percent **inflation rate** is a very moderate projection.

If we take 2.24% inflation, the this share price target in todays money means we should reach $182 because of $140 \* 1.0224\^12, = $182 in adjusted. Thats more than a 5 bagger. basically we could see $10 GME price from short manipulation and buying more is basically a lottery ticket!

I really dont understand the bear thesis. The only bear thesis ( short term this one) was that margin would affect longs more but I looked at it on ortex and its basically bullshit. Buy shares with cash though dont use margin. Own your piece of GME dont borrow it. Bears just spout ""DigITaL"" or ""BlOCKbuSTER"" so much Ryan tweeted a shit emoji at them. All the bears think theyre clever. What the fuck makes those guys special? How are they different now than the ones from $2, or $4, or $10.

**Bears are betting against:**

Ryan fucking cohen, buisness legend CHEWY from 100k investment, now 40 billion

Michael burry, Investing legend, predicted the housing crisis and is in GME since april

u/DeepFuckingValue , the new WSB god chad, now basically a whale

Reggie Fils-Aimé, gaming and buisness legend, former COO of nintendo

Senvest, a mega fund thats actively managed

Norweigan sovereign wealth fund

Fidelity, Vanguard and blackrock own this shit and are never selling they literally dont give a shit

All of WSB has now formed a shield wall against the bears

Microsoft gave GME highly discounted azure deals and free office use for all employees and a revenue sharing agreement. Bears are stupid if they think MSFT didnt vet GME.

&#x200B;

Some valid bear thesis left now (the only ones left) ----> Ryan Cohen dies.

# 2. Now some analysis on the short squeeze and some technical data on puts and calls and ortex data.

Ok everyone on here and their cat, dog, bedbugs and wifes boyfriend  knows about the squeeze. Jimmy chill aka cramer even talking about it. Gamestop is literally the most shorted stock of all time and space. The squeeze makes every autist salivate because its basically free money while cucking big money out of like what 1% of their fund.

Although I know all you cucks hate shares, and hate holding, if the squeeze doesnt happen selling is probably the most retarded thing anyone could do. Its literally buy high sell low and you fucking disgust me. STONK ONLY GOES UP.

This squeeze is so monumental that its been sucking sharks in like fresh blood. Most of the funds where shorting this from 30-15 dollars before this year so they didnt really care. It all changed with 2 people. u/DeepFuckingValue and Dr. Michael Burry. These guys are as OG as it gets with GME. I think u/DeepFuckingValue may have even sniffed this trade out before the legend himself. Since then funds will have churned this through their rules and started jumping on this train. Ive been in since $13 with 125 shares. If I had more money Id be buying but im just some stupid student ok. Im merely a medium for this money made information.

**The stats for this stock now short wise are, from ortex:**

*Concrete* short interest as of 31 December 2020: **71 Million**.

*Estimated* short interest, *January 11th data:* (This isnt predicted, this is from data in flow, has margin of error) : **77 Million**

Short shares on loan 7 days ago: **50 Million**

Short shares on loan *now* (This breaks the bearish margin calls affect longs more thesis): 54.2 Million

% of known float short: **147%** as of 31 December 2020

% of know free float on loaned shorts: **108%** as of January 11th.

Some [guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyocql/updated_potential_holdings_of_gme/) on here took into account extra buying on wednesday, Institutions, Burry, RC's extra 7% and WSB ownership (something so stupendously  retarded no serious firm will do it) that float on short could be in the 100s of %. Total short float now I would say could be **200-400%** if the numbers are correct.  This pisses on all other short squeezes. Some countries ban shorting above 100% cos of how autistic it is.

The recent hike in interactive brokers available shares is probably a mix of sell off on friday (remember  some guys are now buying lambos with GME money. If they held they could buy 10), calls exercising and puts being covered and brokers ditching the shares. Nakedshort even reported 5 million naked GME shorts on friday. This is bullish as fuck because the best the shorts could do on a red market day was **-10%**.

Gamestop is still on the SECs threshold list for 27 days now.

[This shows naked short selling and downwards pressure hasnt capitulated](https://preview.redd.it/xsetax08pwb61.jpg?width=1083&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=172439b81f509ba01ed3e6489671d6f009298e84)

Need rockets 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀:

Ok so now if WSB owns an estimated 6-8% of the stock and we all know to move over to cash accounts now to avoid margin calls, we should be minimizing longs getting margin called. Every bear on stockwits is a clueless cuck who spouts ""blockbuster"" and these guys dont even know what margin even is so my bet is the colossal **54 Million** shares short on loan are gonna be affected by the margin calls more. Why? Because every long on margin is in the green, and now a true zealot/extremist/autist for ryan cohen so will supply their account with collateral to avoid margin call. Shorts are in the massive red zone. How do I know you ask?

Ortex data from Jan 4th 2021:

[This is the data from ortex for short interest for Gamestop for Jan 4th](https://preview.redd.it/urqb3c3zbwb61.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=d874cd908bad7fe3e8aa4486b5a294f5c1d5724e)

So this shows for jan 4th the estimated short interest is 66.98 Million shares. From the exchange reported 71 Million on december 31st this makes a lot of sense because the share price fell from \~21 to \~17 so shorts took profits. The shares on loan arent for longs too. This is all purely short data, and 47M  shorted at $17 this shows.

These shorts are in a circle of hell we cant comprehend and makes satan scared.

SHARES ON LOAN HAVE GONE UP.  BUT 87% OF LOANED SHORTS WHERE SHORTING AT SUB $20.

Cost to borrow is also up, estimated short interest is up to a cataclysmic amount.

Longs on margin need to supply collateral, but we are in the massive green zone, shorts are underwater. Margin calls will ravage the shorts and sting the longs. We also have the uptick rule in place until the end of the day, so shorts can only short on the way up.

**Seen a lot of talk about Gamma hedging and delta.**

You realize that the fucking bankers and brokers dont understand gamma hedging right? That shits up their with the black-scholes equation and feynman-kac solution. Forget about it. The retards claiming to understand it are either payed by hedge funds or lose money. The guy who took out outs thinking options exercising and gamma hedging would lead to a collossal sell off on friday lost money on his puts because **no one** except some quants in a goldman sachs server room know this shit. The idea is simple about neutral delta on options that people take out, but the simple system interacts with every other thing in the stock market, and wow who couldve guessed it, like nearly any other element of the stock market predicting something by the day is nigh impossible. That guy talking about Gamma , Delta and margin calls is on weeklies. Hes no more autistic and equally retarded as all of us. Hes a chill guy though so dont berate a fellow brother.

**Now weve established the likelihood of longs getting margin called is far smaller than shorts, on to the options distributions**

**Two images now: Top one is before the end of the 15th, the other one is after market close:**

&#x200B;

[This shows the suspected melvin puts \(51000 contracts, 5 Million shares, rolled up from july, strike price $24\) and lots of big ITM calls.](https://preview.redd.it/t8odq9btgwb61.jpg?width=821&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61bb8a66e0ed83f0315921c295d1851a3c20c6c0)

[This shows the big put contract didnt get rolled over and the big ITM calls got exercised on friday. Large puts are underwater big timem while calls are in the big tendy zone.](https://preview.redd.it/3nqb33f0hwb61.jpg?width=675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9dc83f542dcc3565ae0424121146101b73cf0083)

These two graphs, show before market close and after. As we can see the massiver 51000 put contracts didnt get rolled over and the chances that those were melvins july puts rolled up is very high. They expired worthless. Lots of calls are printing big time while huge amounts of puts are worthless and bleeding money.

Something else we can extrapolate from the charts is that massive options trades are not present on the scale we saw before (tens of thousands).

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

We are seeing a discrepancy in the number of puts/calls opening up at the higher prices with calls gaining fast. This could show that some funds are now becoming optimistic on the long or short term prospects of gamestop. There are also more puts than options and if we assume this for shorts vs longs on margin (without even taking into account that all shorts are borrowed shares and pay interest further bleeding cash) then shorts are likely on more margin than longs.

Regardless fellow autists my main point is two show that the bears are underwater and the bulls are flying high with regards to options.

**Now lets compare this possible squeeze with others.**

Bear in mind this is the most shorted stock of all time, but differences in free float change the share price differently.

Kodak went from **$2.16 to $33.2**

Volkswagen went from **\~200 euro to nearly 1000.**

Overstock went from **\~$21 to $123**

Blue apron went from **$2.31 to $18**

Ive been seeing some estimated that 1 million shares is roughly a dollars move in share price. This maths is about to be pretty autistic so bear with me degnerates.

$1 now is 2.81% of the share price. Everything in the markets is exponential and based on percentages. So if we assume a full squeeze of ortexs estimated short interest (This assumes no sell off and no new shorts, new shorts can be positive or negative depedning on when in the squeeze they happen) **$35.5 \* 1.0281\^77 = $299.** GME to moon. 🌑 .

This shit can happen. Hold on.

**GME has squeezed and been manipulated before and it always happens around the console cycles. Shorts never win and they wont win now.**

Basically the crayon chart shows green (outstanding shares) orange ( short shares) purple (Market cap) and cyan (Share price). In 2006-2008 the share price rose in tandem with short interest ( Like now ) Until console releases when you can see an abrupt squeeze happend mooning the share price.

This happend to a degree in 2013 with the xbox one but worse conditions for the company and a worse console launch lead to slow short covering but the share price still mooned.

Now we get to the best part. History is repeating itself for the third time and the shares sold short are literally higher than the outstanding shares, which have been decreasing since 2010. Short shares are also at the highest point ever and GME hasnt had a brighter future, well ever. Ps5 and Xbox Series X. are the two most hyped consoles since the Ps2. This is setting up the foundations for massive price movements weve never seen before. This shit has literally never happend, ever. Uncharted waters and we are the captain.

**For the insurmountably retarded autists who think that the squeeze has happend look upon this and despair:**

IHOR IS A MEGA WIZARD

Ihor I quote:

>**A long-buying tsunami ... is the primary factor for the price move**

Ihor Dusaniwsky is managing director of predictive analytics at S3 a firm similar to ortex. He told bloomberg that the squeeze hasnt happend yet and that this was long buying. If someone knows this shit its him. He was talking about the tesla squeeze in january 2020. He has access to resources we can only imagine. Barrons cut his comment that the squeeze hasnt happend yet out it was that fucking bullish. All the media ramming down ""Short squeeze has happend"" down peoples throats because bears are fucking scared.

The bots on stocktwits spamming bearish sentiment should show how rattled they are.

Edit: **You fucking degens just enlightened me that cramer pump is real, funds are ruminating over the long weekend, and stmmy bills pumps stonks and that stimmy bill buys many an xbox. See you at andromeda! Also more rockets.**

Edit\*\*: Some autists thought lottery ticket was misleading so instead, gauranteed lottery numbers!\*\*

Edit 3:  [RYAN FUCKING COHEN TWEETED](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1350877969816956934?s=20)  THE HOMIE JUST TWEETED. PEANUT EMOJI. HES 1) NUTTING 2) SAYING 35 IS PEANUTS  3) GIF SAYS THERES A CHANCE, SHORT SQUEEZE IMMENINT HOMIES

Edit 4: [Amazing post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzbzhe/gme_warning_bears_are_among_us_tuesday_is_bullish/) showing that unlucky prize guy was wrong like I said. Ihor also talked about the hypothecation  agreement.

Edit 5: This is true and I forgot to add

>There’s also the chance of a ratings upgrade. Moody’s and S&P have GME at B3 and B-, which is rated “highly speculative”. Ratings are reviewed every quarter, and a review might be due this month (i.e. this coming week or next). Good chance that the agencies might upgrade GME to a B2/B, or even better to the next higher band (Ba/BB).

Edit 6: We are scraping 42 in frankfurt. Granted its low volumes but pre market should open at these prices I think?

**Conclusion: Buy shares with cash not margin. Hold shares forever unless RC dies (Shame hes a cybernetic demigod), Melvin bad, Shorts fuk, 🐻 🌈  posting bearish shit are doing weeklies for the second time after they expired red on friday, GME to $200 without squeeze, Ryan cohen a god, GME is still a value play, Good luck have fun.**"

A while ago I started mixing unusual options activity into my ~~gambling~~investing.  At first I lost a shitload of money chasing dumbass whales with zero plan, but now I actually have a pretty good feel for it.  I still fuck up alot, but more often I do not fuck up.  This is to help those of you who want to start chasing whales, or are at a basic level and want to do it better.

I'm using some plays from this week as examples because they are fresh in my mind and I have a couple screenshots.

**Tools**
I use barchart in tandem with Unusual Whales. For barchart, you can honestly get by using their free version, you just can't sort as well.  They have a free month trial too.  I also pay the 20 bucks for Unusual Whales to confirm what I scan, and they have a good stocks volume standard deviation tool.  I have zero affiliation to either, just saying what I use.

There are way more technical ways to do this, but I like to use my eyes to scan sporadically throughout the day like a boomer.

**Basic Concept**
Long story short, you're ideally chasing the options purchases of what are, presumably, deep-pocketed individuals or institutions.  UOA identifies certain options contract orders that are higher than the average daily contract order.  For example, if the average daily option volume on an GME weekly is 4,000, and an option order enters for 4,000 or higher, it's flagged as unusual activity since it's a multiple of that daily average volume--sometimes it shows as multiple orders if ""they"" push through a few smaller purchases that produce heavy volume.

MM are sneks who like to move in silence, which they can do with with stock positions via dark pools and the like.  However, they can't get away with that with options activity--it all shows.  That fact, young autist, is your slingshot against the institutional goliath.

**Hunting the Whale**
So I've got my unusual options activity page open on barchart or wherever for the current day.  I adjust the expiration date option so that the options I'm looking at don't expire past a couple weeks out (more on why later), then I'm ready to eye scan.

I typically start by looking for **one of two things: 1) large clusters of orders that belong to one ticker  or 2) sporadic orders for a ticker that consistently show up over a couple hours, but belong to non-hot, non-meme stonks that do NOT have earnings imminent.**  To make sure I'm looking at something potentially weird, I choose to exclude options that expire more than a couple weeks out.

**1) Clusters of orders—ABNB example**
The way I scope it is kind of a tiered process.  *First*, I'm looking to see if there are any clusters of orders that catch my eye on a quick scan.  *Second*, I'm looking to see if those clusters of orders contain both calls AND puts, with some OTM activity and spreads preferred.  *Third*, I look to see if the number of seperate call orders outweighs the number of put orders (or vice versa), and additionally I look to see if the volume of the calls drastically outweighs the volume of the puts (or vice versa).  

**Why?  Because it helps you determine if the options order is just a hedge, or if it’s hedging against itself as it’s own positio**n. This is super important so try to follow along-- most UOA is just institutions hedging; Mr. MM has a nice, busy life and fancy yacht and can't just exit his positions back and forth all day like a WSBer.  He also has like a billion shares of his stonks, so if he dumps it when he's got paper hands it will siginficantly tank the value and cause a ripple effect.  So, *instead* of hedging by dumping his shit, he hedges by adding OTM options against his position--next level fucking diamond hands.  That would be the type of whale order from Mr. MM we don't want to follow.  *But*, if Mr. MM buys 4,000 FB call options in a few blocks, and you see like 1,000 in FB puts go through right alongside it, the odds are that someone is betting big on FB and using the puts as a hedge, since the puts represent a smaller volume in the call/put ratio.  Instead of the options being a hedge for a bigger stock position they hold, these types of option clusters indicate that the option order itself is the big, independent play, and it's hedging itself with lower volume order vs the higher volume (4,000 calls to 1,000 puts).

**Then I do an easy confirmation**.  I check the tickers general trend the past week or so in a chart, do a news search on twitter of their ticker for news catalysts and sentiment, and google and YouTube to see if the crayola kids think it's a good nerd play.

**Example**: Here's the screenshot on some ABNB UOA I noticed and played this week.  It went to 200% and change within a couple hours, but I had unfortunate diamond hands and sold for about half that.

[ABNB UOA](https://i.imgur.com/mYDXYmN.jpg)

So, this a softball.  **First**, you can see that ABNB all of a sudden explodes with all these options showing up at 12:52–that's our cluster.  **Second**, the clusters have both calls and puts in that minute timespan, with some put orders showing at the bottom of the cluster.  Some of the calls are deep OTM, as far as 200c.  **Third**, the call orders far outweigh the put orders in both amount and volume.  *Awwwww shit, looks like we got more than a hedge—we’re onto something.*

**Confirmation time**: ABNB had been on a general uptrend, and I typically don't like to chase, but I combed twitter and saw their were rumors of the CEO speaking the following day, and that news had just broken of their DC booking cancellations.  I looked back into the morning, and saw a few more unusual blocks, and a few more rolled in just after the cluster pictured above.

Passed the smell test.  Options bought, tendies gained.

**Sparse Orders: SNAP example**

The same principles can apply to orders on tickers that pop up individual orders, not large clusters,  which **a) haven’t had much attention b) have been on a steep downtrend—this makes the order unusual, and/or c) seem to keep popping up in single orders over a few hours to a day.**The same principles as above apply, but if you see these types of orders with very little time left until expiration, you can assume assume it's probably not a hedge.  SNAP isn't the best example of the week because there wasn't a put order in this block.  But, there was positive TA sentiment when I searched, SNAP had been on an oversold downtrend, and I don't have screenshots left of the better ones I saw and went after.  **Plus, importantly, IT WAS TOWARDS THE END OF THE DAY** (this is huge, EOD is prime time for AH news whales)

[SNAP UOA](https://i.imgur.com/GGr5bra.jpg)

A better example from this week though is SPCE, which had only a few orders sprinkled throughout the day, and one toward the end of the day which was DEEP, DEEP OTM expiring 1/15.  **That’s a flag for us—sporadic listing throughout the day, OTM toward the end of the day. ** BAM! EOD SPCE OTM calls sprinkle in, ARK invests to kick off AH, SPCE moons. 

**Sparse Orders Patterns: Connecting the dots on tech rebound with FB and SNAP**

Seeing the SNAP orders above sharpened my eyes that day to looking for a pattern with tech on the whole, since big tech had been so royally gaped the past week.  I kept seeing FB options like this pop up

[https://i.imgur.com/muVGtq2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/T54peER.jpg)

Sometimes you can put together sporadic listings and create a working theory based on a sector.  Because this and similar FB orders were deep OTM and one day out, I knew there was a risk they could a hedge, but also knew that the tech sector was due for a rebound and saw SNAP posting sporadic OTM as well.  **So, I bought my options for each of those two another week out and closer to ATM (important, more below), to give the whale some breathing room** in case was it was a hedge, even though the technicals agreed with the bounce.  The whales were right, and it was an easy little overnight profit.


**How I’ve Fucked Up 1: Don’t get tricked by trends**

Although we like to believe institutions are ahead of the curve, often they are just trend-riding lemmings who follow what's already way, way up.  They buy the top, just like WSB tardies such as yourself specialize in.  So, when you see shit like this below, take a minute to think before you get excited:

[NIO UOA LIKE THIS WAS NONSTOP](https://i.imgur.com/JCZBx2s.jpg)

It was the same for all the memes: PLUG, FCEL, MARA, and RIOT all week, dominating the orders.  If something is already too popular, just stay away from it.  You can ride something up, but when you see massive orders on shit that's already like 400% IV, just...don't.

**How I’ve Fucked Up 2: DO give the MM’s some breathing room**

*Even if you’re confident in a move you see that is a few days out, extend your play a week or two further out minimum, and strike it closer to ATM.*  If you can't do either of those things because you can't afford the premium just skip that play and check back for something new later; I promise a better opportunity will arise.  You can recover from bagholding, but you cannot recover from blowing your account on an incorrect 0DTE.

Breathing room is also important because often whales will have the news but not the exact timing.  Two months ago I followed a DDOG whale on a Thursday 1DTE that expired worthless the next day.  The following Monday (1 trade day later) DDOG made the announcement that rocketed them like 20%--if I'd given them a week's breathing room, it would've been a 15 bagger.  Fucking F.

**So, to review:** look for order clusters or sporadic ticker orders that a) have a mix of calls and puts with one dominating the other b) unpopular tickers that have deep OTM or close expirations c) always check chatter afterward and fundamentals and d) try to put together a narrative of things that are related that catch your eye (this Monday's EV run or this Friday's tech bounce could be next week's airline dominance or cruiseline craze--connect the dots).  Initially look for options expiring soon, as they indicate the most riskiness--and therefore confidence--if the MM is not hedging.  Shop with a short term eye, buy with a long term choice. 

**10 Things That Will Help You Not GUH:**

**1)** Monday and Friday morning/afternoon are the most accurate whale times, according to data from Unusual Whales

**2)** If you don't have PDT always save some spending power for EOD shopping

**3**) If you don't have PDT never, ever follow a whale with a weekly.  Sometimes the news the whale bets on is a 'sell the news' event, and you won’t recover from a drop especially if there is IV crush involved. 

**4)** Always give the whale breathing room by purchasing an expiration at least a week further out

**4b**) Always give the whale breathing room by going closer to ATM strikes than theirs

**5)** Sign up for barchart monthly trial (then continue it) and unusual whales--they're each like 20 bucks and thats way less than you spend on an FD. 

**6**) You don't need to learn TA, but you need to check technicals on the tickers you want to chase--almost every major ticker has youtubers or fintwits giving their daily or weekly TA.  This way you know if it's a proper breakout happening if the whale hits, and you're not just guessing at when to take profits.  Remember, whales can buy wayyyyyyy OTM and sell for massive profit at any point--they *aren’t* bagholding a call until it's in the money like you are. You may be 10% up waiting for the next 80% GME day while your whale has sold at their target 5% profits on the play and is chillin. 

**7**) Leave at least 10% of your account spending power free each day.  I promise, the one time you go full boat you will see the most obvious whale play at the end of the day.  Then you won't be able to do shit about it and you'll hate yourself when it's a 10 bagger overnight.  Trust me.

**8**) Make sure the ticker you're chasing isn't just ER anticipation/bets.  Always check earnings dates before buying.

**9**) Remember whales are people, so they can be stupid, too.  Don't baghold a position that is clearly fucked for some news that looks unlikely to come.  They are gambling addicts just like you, except they have more money.

**10**) Always take profits if you ask yourself if it's time to.  If it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to close the position.

**Positions**:
Dumped a ton of stuff and loading up Tuesday because long weekends scare me, but saw some ineresting 2/5s I held including

WKHSc
PLTRc
SPYc (1/19, 1/22)
LMNDp

And a couple tickers that I couldn’t post lol.  also have AAPL and JD leaps

***

TLDR
Use a service to follow whales so you can get ahead of announcements.  Look for clusters of options activity that hedge themselves via call/put ratio, and do a legitimate check for TA and catalysts to confirm their moves.  Never follow a whale into a weekly, but use weeklies are your best screener.

***

*I might do a pretty consistent DD post (a couple times a week) on what I’m seeing at the end of each day if there is interest, and if it’s not a day I don’t have a ton of real work.  If something quick catches my eye I usually throw it up on my twitter @yourboymilt (there’s no notification thing on here mods, just trying to be helpful— not selling anything) I’ll also probably throw some more potential Monday positions on here over the weekend once I decide to do some more research.  Later.*"

The whole market is down, nothing makes any sense and all the paper hands probably abandoned the ship before the long weekend.

I am still mad, despite being in profit cuz I have no fucking idea how it is possible for a stock to drop 20 percent after open without crushing negative news. I have never seen something like this. However, there is no room for panic. Apple is expected to have historic earnings in less than 2 weeks and the stock experienced a huge dip today, GME fell hard also and every fucking autist here was buying it. We finished the day at 8 percent up.

I would not judge anyone who sales next week, not everyone needs to be a long term investor, but fuck the paper handed mfos who bought shares today and immediatly sold 1 hour later. How much can you actually lose? The absolute bottom is 4 per share and that would put the company at 2.5 bil valuation. The brand name is worth more than that and BB is a significant player in the IoT, Cybersecurity and EV industries. The cyber firm Crowdstrike has  180 mil revenue compared to BB near 1 billion and is valued at 50 billion, ten times more than BB. If you are gonna paper hand, at least wait till you are an in profit, the retards  who sold GME after the last dip are deeply regretting it now. 

PS: Today was tough, but the battle has just began. Report for duty soldiers, let's see how many of us are still holding."

This is the first real threat to  ENPH  and SEDG's duopoly (and their subsequent absurd x30-x200 rise in  the  last 2 years). BUY ENPH or SEDG PUTS/SHORTS asap.**

Ok retards, I've been following the solar space for some time and I just had to write something before others do.

**Background - The reason behind SolarEdge and Enphase's meteoric rise.**

As   you can see in the charts below, ENPH and SEDG have rallied like crazy   the last couple of years. ENPH especially... it went from under $1 to   $208 as of today. Although ENPH was sort of a turnaround story, the  real  reason behind their rise was due to regulation (NEC 2017) that  required  rapid shutdown devices on solar systems in the US. This  basically  killed chinese and other inverter manufacturers in the US  that didn't  have module level hardware. Long story short, it created a  beautiful  duopoly in the residential solar market in the US during a  rapid growth  in the industry.

**Current Valuations of SEDG & ENPH**

I'm   not going to get into the financials etc, but SEDGs P/E is 99 and   ENPH's is 163. Enough said. Of course the whole sector has rallied with   DEM win and recently with the senate upset. Fine. But this rise, like   EV's, is frothy as hell.

Having  said that, I wouldn't typically recommend anyone short or buy puts on any of the  solar names (RUN, JKS, CSIQ, DQ, SEDG, ENPH, TAN, ICLN, etc etc).   They were overvalued 3 months ago. They can keep going up up and up. As  a  lot of people have been posting here recently, the clean energy ETFs   have done incredibly well. HOWEVER with ENPH & SEDG's.....

**Besides like Apple or Amazon, what's the WORST company to suddenly become your competitor...?**

TESLA obviously. Elon Musk is the only guy that keeps bald nerd-turned-into Vin diesel looking mfer Bezos awake at night.

With   big dog Tesla entering the space, and becoming a DIRECT COMPETITOR out   of nowhere to ENPH and SEDG, this changes things. For those invested  in  any of the solar names, it's time to hedge by buying some ENPH/SEDG   puts. For any degenerates looking for a quick buck, ENPH and SEDG will   most certainly start coming down to reasonable valuations. You heard it   here first, this is the END OF THE DUOPOLY. Once chinese manufacturers   get back into this space, then it'll get commodified like the solar   panel guys (hello <10 P/Es).

**PS: TAN and ICLN's biggest holdings are SEDG & ENPH...**

Happy   Hunting Retards. For ENPH Longs... Please don't give me shit about  ""but enphase has micro-inverters, they are better than central inverter  blah  blah blah"". Don't be like the sleazy solar sales guys that knock  doors  in Long Island every week. Customers don't care if its micro vs.   string inverters. They care about price and brand recognition. From   Electrek *""Finally, the greatest   advantage (although it’s uncertain) is potentially the cost. Tesla could   potentially be able to achieve a better cost than the competition by   leveraging its already large power electronic production capacity for   its electric vehicles and charging stations.""* Price will certainly  be lower than ENPH or SEDG. You think anyone knows wtf enphase or  solaredge is? They all know what Tesla is, they have one parked in your  mom's house."
kxlyih,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxlyih/dont_overlook_affirm_afrm/,Don’t overlook Affirm (AFRM),49,40,2021-01-15 11:28:23,"IPOed yesterday at $90 after pre-ipo price of $49. Went as high as $130, finished after hours at $118. 

They essentially offer payments over time, many times with 0% interest and varying lengths up to the consumer. It’s up to the company to buy down interest rates from affirm if they want to incentivize consumers. Affirm gets revenue share from company, and then collects payments from consumer. Affirm drives huger average price of sale with payment over time capability so companies are jumping on board. 

They’re small right now and are taking flak for being smaller than an Australian equivalent, but who cares about that in early stages mate? They are also getting talked down as their last quarter results included 30% of revenue from their biggest partner-to-date at that time, Peloton. 

That would all be valid, and lots of ipo prices make my face hurt(poshmark, the Goodwill/Craigslist startup @$102), but these guys are going to scream with the background acceleration to online sales as they move this product that has long been needed into the market. Apple started offering affirm on its products in the last 6 months. Think about a future where all big ticket items(whether it’s your iPhone or your Tesla) are processed this way. 

You like square in the past year. You like Shopify. You like ARKF. 

Affirm has and *exclusive* payment processing agreement signed with Shopify. It cost them an 8% stake. If you think shop is going to dominate small and medium-sized commerce in the coming years, you have to see the exponential growth Affirm will undergo. 65% of purchases on affirm are repeat buyers. At early stage this means they are still growing merchant base, and they are successful with the ones they have launched in.

Moon 🌙 
Squeeze 🙏🏼


We are so dumb, we’re right about this.  If you’ve read anything on this sub, you know we can be irrational.  


If you know anything about investing, you know the markets can be irrational longer than investors can remain solvent.  


Well guys, we’re the most irrational I’ve ever seen.  And we’re friggin good at it.  
*Ain’t no way anyone can out solvent our irrationality*


But if you don’t believe me, here’s some actually talking points:  


GME is Not dipping.  The math just isn’t there.  This is not a normal rally/hype.  It was a momentum thing.  It’s now becoming a squeeze within the next week.  


This doubling in under 48hrs has made all shorts unprofitable.  It doesn’t matter where they entered.  


Short seller’s peak profit happens if a stock goes to $0.  No one expects GME to be at $0 even in the next few years.  But assuming it could a month from now, let’s do the maths. 


Most shorts got in around $15 or less.  That means the most they can make is $15, **IF** GME goes to $0 (it won’t). 


Now any time you borrow anything, you have to pay interest on it, this includes shares.  The current interest rate is 45% (or higher).  The interest is on the price of the current shares, not the price they bought in at.  


This means on a share price of $40, they are paying nearly $0.06 a day to short it.  Doesn’t sound too expensive right? Until you realize that in less than 28 days (if they allow it compound), they will have paid more in interest than they could ever gain, even if GME went to $0 in February. 


Keep in mind, once a short seller realizes it is literally impossible to make money, they just need to time their exit.  Since this is a stampede of short sellers, the best time to exit is right away.  They literally can’t wait 3 weeks, or else they might as well quite a few more dollars a share (from the interest they’re going to accrue).  


Keep in mind, this is all voluntary covering.  There are also tons of accounts out there that will now have to cover due to margin calls and such.  


Keep in mind that 71 million shares are shorted.  That’s more than are technically available.  


Keep in mind that 20% of shares are locked up by Cohen &amp; such, who cannot sell for a few more months.  So that leaves even less shares for the shorts.  


Once most of the shorts cover (within 3 weeks), the price won’t drop overnight.  They have to buy more shares than available and anyone left holding shorts will still be buying.  And by that time, a new base &amp; support level should have been established.  


*****
Thinking of FOMOing? You should be fine with shares.  Still could see upside of 50%+ 
*****
I recommend buying shares, cause IV is crazy high and if MM somehow finds a way to eff with people, they will.  Sometimes they are smarter than me (but hey, that’s their job, I’m just an idiot). 
*****


Positions: 

104 shares @ $20.15
Sold $22 call (much regret, didn’t know squeeze would happen so soon, I’m an idiot)
Bought $38c 1/15exp 
Hope to add shares tomorrow morning &amp; maybe a call for next Friday.  But ... I have a high risk tolerance and have made a nice chunk, so if my calls go tits up, don’t care. 


*****
Shameless plug for the next huge move: 
Cash out half next week &amp; dump it in Apple calls (1/29 or 03/21) any strike, can’t go wrong.  I have $200c, $160c, $135c, 75 shares.  
*****


TL;DR: 
50% upside for GME


Shorts have to cover in less than 25 days or they literally will lose more than they could ever gain from shorting.  


45% interest payments on current share price hurts shorts.  


20% of shares are tied up &amp; not able to be sold. 


Shorters need to buy almost 200% of available shares in the next 3 weeks (assuming they want to cap their losses at 100%). 


Not too late to jump in with shares. 


Don’t wait for a dip.


Edit: interest maths - principle still holds"

Evidence to suggest Apple just had a good quarter

&#x200B;

As far as I can tell as long as you don’t buy short term expiry calls it literally cannot go tits up. Although there is evidence to suggest Apple just had an outstanding quarter lets assume that they only see a share value increase of about 5% (a little below average) by Feb 5. With a 2/19 $130.00 c position you would still net about 25% in gains. With AAPL shares being down recently there’s more room for growth.

Position:

kxfgsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxfgsa/why_amd_will_easily_break_100/,Why AMD will easily break 100 🚀🚀,242,76,2021-01-15 05:40:03,"I don't know much, but I know tech and AMD has A LOT going for it right now.

[*Obligatory do your own research and draw your own conclusions statement.*]

**POSITIVES**

- Both Sony and Microsoft are using custom AMD APUs in their latest consoles. (APU = CPU + GPU combined into one.) In case you've been living under a rock for the past 8 weeks, both the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X have been selling like hotcakes, with fresh inventory being depleted within minutes. 

- AMD has been the underdog vs Intel in the consumer desktop CPU space for as long as I can remember. But for the first time in 15 years, [AMD is winning in terms of market share](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-overtakes-intel-in-desktop-cpu-market-share-for-the-first-time-in-15-years). Intel has been able to stay competitive with their latest generation of CPUs by offering significant discounts. Despite this, AMD's CPUs still remain in higher demand and sell out almost instantly (at MSRP). 

- AMD owns Radeon, which is their brand of Graphics Cards. These compete directly with Nvidia's RTX GPUs. Performance wise, they're up there with NVDA, but still lagging a bit in the ray tracing department which most will agree is the future. Key word being future, it's not a big deal *yet*. And thanks to the pandemic these too also sell out super quick. 

- AMD's next generation of mobile CPUs will be launching soon. Just like their desktop lineup, you can expect these to outperform their Intel counterparts as well. AMD's previous mobile generation of 4000 series chips crushed Intel - the biggest problem was availability. People wanted the AMD chips but for whatever reason, they were found mostly in the mid-range and lower end gaming laptops. I expect the availability issue to improve greatly this year. As we can see, certain manufacturer's like Asus are already featuring the AMD SKUs in their [top of the line gaming laptops](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-ROG-Strix-Scar-17-ditches-Comet-Lake-H-for-an-unlocked-Ryzen-9-5900HX-with-liquid-metal-and-RTX-3080-Mobile.514702.0.html). 

**RISK FACTORS**

- While speaking purely from a monetary standpoint, overall I think the pandemic has been a net positive for tech companies like AMD. However, AMD's own fearless leader Lisa Su recently said: [""...the COVID environment has increased shipping and freight costs, which are hard to avoid. As we get into a more normal environment, this should improve. This also matters for our planned graphics updates through the first half of the year, as we have a lot of product coming to market.""](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16409/amd-ceo-dr-lisa-su-interview-on-2021-demand-supply-tariffs-xilinx-and-epyc)

- Unable to keep up with demand: [AMD and NVIDIA confirm that GPU stock levels will remain non-existent for the foreseeable future](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-and-NVIDIA-confirm-that-GPU-stock-levels-will-remain-non-existent-for-the-foreseeable-future.514957.0.html).
[Microsoft has asked AMD for help in combating Xbox Series X stock shortages](https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-has-asked-amd-for-help-in-combating-xbox-series-x-stock-shortages)

- Apple has already started producing their own in house ARM processors for both their laptops and desktops. This doesn't really affect AMD (yet) because [Apple has been using Intel chips in their laptops and desktops for the past 15 years.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/why-apple-is-breaking-a-15-year-partnership-with-intel-on-its-macs-.html#:~:text=Menu-,Apple%20is%20breaking%20a%2015%2Dyear%20partnership%20with,on%20its%20Macs%20%E2%80%94%20here's%20why&text=Apple's%20new%20laptops%20and%20desktop,can%20improve%20laptop%20battery%20life.) And despite being a massive company, Apple only makes up about [13% of the PC market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/576473/united-states-quarterly-pc-shipment-shareapple/#:~:text=In%20the%20fourth%20quarter%20of,the%20fourth%20quarter%20of%202020.). AMD is still Apple's partner for discrete graphics, but that could change soon. This is definitely something you'll want to keep your eye on though because other titans like [Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/article/microsoft-processors-int/microsoft-working-on-in-house-chips-for-its-servers-pcs-idUSKBN28S2Y1), [Google](https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2020/04/google-is-making-its-own-chips.html), and Amazon are all either working on, or producing their own in house chips. In my opinion, this is not nearly as bad as it sounds. Let's break it down by company.

 - [Microsoft currently uses Intel-based processors for the majority of its Azure cloud services, and most of the company’s Surface lineup run on Intel chips, too.](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189450/microsoft-arm-processors-chips-servers-surface-report#:~:text=Microsoft%20has%20worked%20with%20AMD,move%20away%20from%20just%20Intel.&text=Microsoft%20co%2Dengineered%20an%20ARM,a%20couple%20of%20months%20ago.) Only some of Microsoft's laptops run on AMD hardware. 

 - [Google is readying its own in-house processors for use in future Pixel devices, including both phones and eventually Chromebooks, too.](https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/google-said-to-be-preparing-its-own-chips-for-use-in-pixel-phones-and-chromebooks/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADHPvna5MKFbSAnwNIPsW4kMhD7zhe-7IJtk0AzQP1Rrer78Olm_S_019orsNcQA9Ezk_sCz0z8My1nHGdTap_0-SYZtHKs1U9v9ni-AGkuJzp3cOHYUDSEu7b90qMQIDsc-PC8tFFceJElhUcPhJ3ctKtatuQcLkrIF1VotSBz1#:~:text=The%20Axios%20report%20says%20that,machine%20learning%20and%20Google%20Assistant.) Again, because Google currently relies more on Intel CPUs this is not a big blow to AMD's bottom line. A quick check of BestBuy's inventory shows [47](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?_dyncharset=UTF-8&id=pcat17071&iht=y&keys=keys&ks=960&list=n&qp=parent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Celeron%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i3%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i5%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i7%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20m3%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20m7%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Pentium&sc=Global&st=chromebook&type=page&usc=All%20Categories) Chromebooks with Intel SKUs and only [7 with AMD parts](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?_dyncharset=UTF-8&id=pcat17071&iht=y&keys=keys&ks=960&list=n&qp=parent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20A4%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20A6%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20Ryzen%203&sc=Global&st=chromebook&type=page&usc=All%20Categories).
 - The chips that Amazon is producing are for their [cloud computing business](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/amazon-apple-chips-intel-arm.html). These were also replaced by Intel.

AMD has earnings coming up on the 26th which I think they're going to shatter. I probably would not recommend trying to play off of that though as ERs can be quite unpredictable, especially if the news is positive. Personally, I think AMD is going to 🚀🚀 after ER, but I'm not betting on that. Which is why my current position (30% of my portfolio) is LEAPS: (x2) Jan 2022 90c.

My conservative 6 month PT for AMD is 110. Also open to hearing any other potential risks I may have overlooked. To be on the safe side I'm only including 6 rockets.

Profit taking and volatile swings brought the shares down to a modest close of ""only"" up 57% at $31.40. u/DeepFuckingValue, who has titanium alloy diamond hands (now known as DFV hands) posted an update and to the surprise of no one, is still holding his 1,000 contracts of Jan 15 $20c on Wednesday afternoon. (Note: He took gains on the contracts today though I'm not sure at what point in the day while keeping his April $12c).

* The pump action resumed for GME this Thursday morning with premarket pushing the underlying back to $38 once again and commenced to another wild session of large movements. Initially trading around $34 to $36 in morning, GME started to rip once again when noon struck and ran as high as $43 for the day. GME closed the day up 27% to $40. If you're STILL not in GME, these back-to-back days have pushed IV to new highs and even OTM contracts months out will be commanding large premium (~160%+ IV for April and 140%+ for July). Proceed with caution (who am I kidding just go all in).

* Morning economic numbers: jobless claims continues its dismal trend, with first-time claims hitting 965k last week vs the consensus of 800k (oof). Last week's total was 784k. As with before, market did not react to the numbers cuz its PrIcEd iN. Import prices rose 0.9 in Dec vs 0.6 expected.

* Jpow spoke at 12:30 PM today in a Princeton Uni session and reaffirmed what everyone has largely expected: rates will continue to be low and while the Feds will raise rate eventually, Jpow says that its ""no time soon"" given economic situation.

* Are they big tech or big cuck? The market reversed course and big tech continues their sell off, with MSFT, AAPL, NFLX, and AMZN all retreating more than -1% as yet another sector rotation commenced. Payment providers got an extra dose of sell-off with V closing at -3.43% and MA closing at -5.25%, despite both having positive PT from Deutsche Bank today with V having a PT increase of $270 from $220 and MA PT increase of $420 from $383.

* Small caps performed strongly today as money flow throughout the day into ""value"" grabs. RUT/IWM closed the day up 2%. Notable underlyings beyond GME are BBBY (up 18.77%), MIK (up 9.6%), M (up 5%), WSM (up 4%), and KIRK (up 9.58%).

* In WSB meme stock land MT continues in its channel, gaining 2.95% today to close at $24.81 PLTR got hit with another downgrade, this time via Citi as the analysts believes the stock is vulnerable to a few upcoming catalyst, including lockup expiry and an deceleration in growth. PT for Citi is $15 (don't worry tho surely WSB is ""in control"" with this stock too). PLUG drilled more than -5.74% during intraday low as JPM initiated with a neutral rating and downgraded sector competitor FCEL. PLUG closed the day down -4.26% to $64.63 while FCEL closed the day down -8% to $17.60, fending off intraday low of more than -12%. ICLN, the clean tech ETF continues its range bound trading and will likely require a clear catalyst in terms of what the $2 tril stimulus actually entails to move further. Buckle up, loser.

* Despite being green most of the day, major indexes retreated to red as power hour neared. Indexes went red and lost all its morning gains as the sell-off accelerated into closing hours. DOW closed the day down -0.22% or -69 pts, IXIC closed down -0.12% or -16 pts, SPX closed -0.38% or -14 pts, and RUT closed up 2% or 43 pts. While the retreat was modest compare to yesterday's close, the intraday reversal was quite jarring esp if you're trading FDs (and let's face it, you definitely were loading up on those Jan 1/15 calls).

* Earning season will soon be upon us and the first wave are starting later this week. Tomorrow morning financials kick things off as WFC, JPM, and C are all reporting before market opens. If banks shat the bed, expect a pounding for the Dow given how large of a component they are still to the stupid index. Expectations are fairly high as JPM has had a flurry of upgrades in the past few days with PT of $150 from Piper Sandler, $152 from Jefferies, and an upgrade to buy from neutral at BofA.

* Biden will unveil his $2 tril stimulus package/plan in a speech later tonight at 7:15 PM ET. Please pump those green tech cuz I have an embarrassing amount in SPAC/EVs.

Hi everyone, thanks for coming back for Part 2. I’m excited to bring you more research and insights on Smartsheet (NYSE: SMAR). Let’s dive in.

**Can we 10X from here?**

For someone like me that is on the younger side and with a longer investment time horizon, and probably you if you are reading this, an important question to ask yourself is “Do I think this investment could 10x from here?”. In other words, could this investment one day be 10 times what it is worth today? To try to answer this question, I will work through a pre-determined framework that I believe gives us the best path to find out.

The framework includes:

Leadership – Desire, Purpose and Ownership

Risk Considerations

Price Considerations

Explosive Business Growth

**1. Leadership – Desire, Purpose, Ownership**

For a company to do something as spectacular as 10x, we are going to need to see really strong and talented leadership. In Chris Mayer’s excellent book “100 Baggers”, he dedicates a part of the book to talk about the importance of what he calls “Owner Operators”. By this he means that the CEO of the company owns a substantial amount of stock in the company themselves. Why is this important? If the CEO has their own personal wealth at stake in the company’s stock (just like we do as shareholders) their interests are more aligned with shareholders and maximizing returns for shareholders than they would be if that CEO had no skin in the game. It’s also better in my opinion if the CEO of the company was also the founder of the company. For these founder-CEO’s that have money invested in their own company, it really is like their baby. Would you rather have your money invested with someone who views the company as their baby or with someone who was just hired to watch this kid (the company)?

In the case of Smartsheet, we check all the boxes when it comes to leadership. Mark Mader is not only an Owner Operator, he is also a co-founder. I touched on this a little bit in part 1, but Mark co-founded Smartsheet along with Brent Frei in 2005. They both played football (American football) for Dartmouth College, an Ivy League School. They met in the fall of 1988 when Mark was a freshman on the team and Brent, who had graduated the prior year, was serving as a Graduate Assistant for the team.

After that season, Brent moved on to begin a career in computer engineering. Mark quit the football team after 1 year. In an interview with Forbes, he said that after his freshman season he thought it was too much to juggle Ivy League academics and being a NCAA Division 1 athlete. Mark started focusing solely on academics until a tragedy struck. One of his best friends from his high school football team got into an accident and was critically injured. His friend would never be able to play football again. This had a profound impact on Mark. He said in the interview that knowing one of his friends would never be able to play again made him realize that if he still has the ability to play football, he needs to go do it. He went to his old coach, told him the story about his friend and asked for his spot on the team back. The coach accepted and Mark went on to finish his career in the fall of 1991 as a 6’4”, 245lb offensive lineman.

Mark said that this experience with his friend and re-joining the football team taught him not to take anything for granted. He said ever since then he tries to do his best with everything and make the most out of every opportunity. That mindset has served him well as he now sits as a CEO of a $8.5 billion company. But he’s really just getting started. That mindset lives on today. The day that he took Smartsheet public, April 27, 2018, he was asked if he plans on celebrating the achievement, he said “We have 74,000 customers that don’t want us to party, they want us to work on the product.” How did Mark get to the point where he was CEO of a tech company with 74,000 customers that raised $150 million during their IPO? I’ll share with you a little more history behind the company.

After Brent Frei left Dartmouth, he started his career in computer engineering as I mentioned before. His career started with Motorola in 1989, then he went to Microsoft in 1991, and then he founded his first company, Onyx Software in 1994. It didn’t take long before his buddy from college, Mark Mader, would come join him at the start-up. Mark joined in 1995 and eventually worked his way up to an Executive role within the firm.

The focus of Onyx was Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. Brent was the CEO and Mark became the SVP of Global Services. Brent led the company through an IPO in 1999 right before the tech bubble burst. It was really unfortunate timing because a lot of their customers were dotcoms that went out of business. Brent was still able to lead them through stiff competition with Salesforce in the early 2000’s until he hit a plateau in 2004. He decided to step down from the company he had founded 10 years earlier. On his last call with investors, he was quoted as saying “I believe it’s the right time for me to turn over the reins to a new CEO who can take Onyx to new heights over the next decade,”. All the while, Mark was there in the background learning and observing. He saw what went right – they built a large publicly traded company from scratch. And he saw what went wrong – their growth stalled as they lost market share to Salesforce.

Only a year after resigning from Onyx, Brent was on to his next big move and he again recruited his friend Mark to help. They were going to found Smartsheet, a company to help improve the way people work. This time, Mark was a Co-Founder along with Brent and had a much bigger influence on the company. His influence got even larger in 2017, 12 years after the founding, when Brent left to found his 3rd company, TerraClear. Brent left to go back to his roots in Idaho where he grew up on the family farm. His new start-up TerraClear seeks to solve one of the largest unsolved problems in farming today – clearing rocks from farming land. As crazy as that sounds, apparently it’s a big issue. Hence the name, TerraClear. Brent is still on the Board of Directors of Smartsheet.

Going back to the IPO date (April 27, 2018), which was only 4 months after Brent had left, Mark was asked by the press what he had learned from being at Onyx when they went public. Mark was very clear in his response and said that one of the main lessons from Onyx was to “not get too enamored with your product”. With Smartsheet, he wants to make sure they’re always improving the product and the user experience. He also said that investors don’t buy a stock based on what you’ve done in the past, but what you plan to do. “If you are always looking at the rear view mirror, then you are not running the business” he said. This is exactly how I want the leaders of companies I invest in to be thinking. He is very forward thinking, customer focused, and humble. There is a lot of evidence to corroborate that he has followed through on the statements he made that day.

One of the first pieces of evidence I found that supports my thesis of Mark being very focused on the product and user experience is the incredible ratings that the product has received from its customers. I use a tool called Net Promoter Score (NPS) which is one of the most reliable and unbiased ways to find out what a customers true experience with a business is and how likely they would be to recommend it to a friend. For Smartsheet, their NPS is extremely high. It’s on a scale of -100 to 100 so anything above 0 is considered to be good. If the rating is above 0, it essentially more people would recommend the product to a friend than they would tell them not to use it. Smartsheet has an NPS of 80, which is honestly one of the highest I have ever seen.

Further evidence to support Mark and the rest of management’s commitment to product quality and user experience is the exceptional ratings the product has on the Apple App Store. This is just for the mobile version of the product, the app that you can download on your phone just like you would download the mobile version of Outlook. The rating in the App Store is 4.8/5. That’s very impressive as well.

Based on how customers are responding to the product, I think it’s fair to say that Mark was not [B.S.ing](https://b.s.ing/) his way through that interview on IPO day. He and his management team really have been focused on creating a stellar product and the results are showing. When I say that “Desire and Purpose” are important traits of a leader of a company it means that I want to see a leader who has a real desire to do what he/she is doing as the CEO of the company, believes in their product(s) and services, and has a real purpose for why they want to do that. I can tell that Mark is committed to the mission of improving the way people work. Being one of the founders, and having written an E-Book on the “Productivity Paradox” that I mentioned in Part 1, I think this mission is very near and dear to his heart and that he has a desire to see the impact and scale of his company grow well into the future. As shareholders, that’s what we want.

Another way to see if the leader of the company has “Desire and Purpose” is to see how his/her employees perceive them. Do the employees look up to this person? Do they feel motivated to work hard because they know what they’re doing is meaningful and can make a positive difference in people’s lives? One way I have of gaining insight into this is to look at the company’s Glassdoor ratings and specifically the rating of the CEO. In the case of Smartsheet, the positive story continues. The company has a 4.1/5 rating on Glassdoor and Mark has a 90% approval rate from his employees which is well above average. To me this shows he’s communicating the company’s purpose to the employees very well and is motivating them to actualize that purpose.

There’s one other piece of evidence I stumbled upon that gives good insight into the culture that Mark and his management team are building at Smartsheet. They were recently (12/17/20) awarded “Best Company Culture” and “Best Companies for Women” by Comparably. Below you can see a screenshot of the headline from a Business Wire article about this. It’s one thing to be awarded for “Best Company Culture” but to also be a “Best Companies for Women” when you’re in a heavily male dominated industry such as computer software, that really says something. It speaks to the culture of diversity and inclusiveness that Mark is building there which goes a long way in the year 2021 when social issues are at the forefront of people’s minds more than ever. The modern enterprise has to build a culture of diversity and inclusiveness if they want to retain the most talented employees and keep them motivated. Smartsheet is doing a good job of this.

Source – Smartsheet making headlines for their outstanding company culture.

I think we’ve found a lot of evidence to support that this leadership team has a strong desire to fulfil their purpose. It’s evident that they want to help improve the way people work and that they’ve invested heavily into making this happen while keeping employees motivated and focused on the goal. The last piece I look at for leadership is ownership. Does the CEO have a personal financial stake in the company? This is such a key thing to look for because as I mentioned earlier in the article, if leadership themselves owns a substantial amount of shares, then their interests and motivations will align with us, the shareholders. They essentially are a shareholder too, just like us. On top of the desire and purpose that we’ve established is present, there’s also a financial incentive for Mark and the team to lead the company to success, and ultimately, a higher share price.

Currently, Mark holds 490,267 shares which comes out to a value of $34 million as of this writing (1/14/21). I’d consider that substantial for an individual person. Even more noteworthy is that Brent owns 3.2 million shares which comes out to a value of $218 million. Brent owns that much of the company still and he’s not even involved beyond being on the Board of Directors. I think that’s a testament to how much confidence he has in Mark to lead Smartsheet to new heights. Also, it’s important to keep in mind that he left Smartsheet to help with his family business. He saw his 80 year old Dad picking up rocks on the farm with his bare hands and realized he wanted to help solve this problem in the farming industry. Leaving Smartsheet was not like when he left Onyx because the business was plateauing. As a matter of fact, Smartsheet was rapidly growing at that time and was about to go public. The fact that he still has $218 million worth of shares in the company shows he still believes in the company and what Mark can do with it now and in the future.

This concludes Part 2 of my Smartsheet deep dive. Hope you enjoyed and be sure to subscribe so you can stay tuned for Part 3, our next pick, and news &amp; updates about existing picks.

Shitty DD inside,28,34,2021-01-15 02:20:44,"VIAC is on a fucking tear. Up from a $12 COVID low, VIAC is poised to become the next shinning star of WSB. Two big catalysts:

1. Acquisition is imminent. VIAC and it’s networks is the perfect target in the race for streaming dominance. They have more hours content than Netflix, Apple and Amazon combined. The Redstone family has waived off takeover discussions while the stock traded at all time lows, but now that we are at reasonable levels, it only makes sense for the talks to become more serious. I think we see an acquisition from a FANG stock in 2021. 

2. News Networks Advertising- how many times have you turned on the news this month? Viewership is at an all time high and advertisers are spending their money where people’s eyes are the most. We will see a beat on earnings and increase in forecast during the next Earnings call. 

Larger company at $25 billion, but options are cheap and this stock has a long way to run. I’m in at $30 and waiting for tomorrow’s pull back for some fat options contracts. I’m riding this short bus to $75 a share.

Edit: to get some excitement going. What if there was a merger with FUBO??? 🚀🚀🚀"

So I’m scrolling through fb at 5am bored, waiting for the market to open. The Robinhood group is talking about fubo tv. I’m half awake and look at the chart and notice it hit ATH at $60 Tuesday. I’m expecting a mini rally before it goes to shit. Based on the analyze tool, the trade was a guaranteed winner as long as the stock didn’t close below $20 a share at exp (td has never forced me out a trade), it was at $40, and ipoed around $15ish but traded around $25ish.

One of my accounts with TD had Apple call spreads worth $50 for earnings and $0.70 buying power yet the system allowed the trade to go in premarket yesterday. I’m confused as hell why this is going in but assume it will autocorrect at 8-9am. I forget about it.

9:30am, I sell my nflx 500/505c exp fri for $150, too early 🤦🏾‍♂️ it shoots up to $400 15 minutes later
I sell my amzn 3080/3085c for $320 too early

I notice fubo executes and shit is it volatile. I have no idea what to do. The mid point was $19.50 premarket, I put in $17ish thinking no way it executes. It drops to $14.50, comes back positive for a few seconds before staying around 14-15 mark. TD for the first time ever forces me out the position. I have to eat a $335 loss. Thank god I didn’t add leverage. TD rep has no idea why the system allowed the order to go through. 

Fast forward now, the system is still accepting covered call orders for Fubo with no cash required upfront! It’s letting me buy multiple contracts despite my account not being able to afford it. It’s allowing me to place an order to short 100 calls and buy the stock which would cost about $300k. 

This only seems to work for fubo stock. I tried Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Airbnb, and even cheaper prices and it didn’t work. 

I’ll post a screenshot on imgurl in an hour. I forgot my account number was on my last pic

We’re in the second week of January, and **Magna International** (TSE:MG)(NYSE:MGA) has already added 8.8% of value. Magna stock has been on a fine run the past year; it’s up 175% since March 2020. 

This stellar performance isn’t speculative like the tech sector but backed by solid fundamentals. The old guard in the auto-parts supply business has positioned itself to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the electric cars spectacle.

## Magna’s edge

Magna is a diversified automotive parts supplier. The company boasts a broad range of products and services that affirm its strengthening in its industry status and long-term prospects. The recent acquisition of Hongli is poised to strengthen its competitiveness further.

The recent spike in Magna stock price stems from the company positioning itself as a preferred third-party manufacturer of choice for companies looking to make electric cars. Likewise, Magna has enhanced its prospect on self-driving efforts. It is currently working with **Fisker** to develop an advanced driver-assist system for the electric Ocean SUV.

Perhaps more exciting is the prospect of Magna working alongside **Apple** to create its first electric car. Industry experts believe that Apple could break into this lucrative industry by working with the company’s Magna Steyr division, a contract manufacturer of cars. 

If this potential partnership materializes, Magna stock could surge much higher. 

## Low risk

By virtue of its business model, Magna could be the least-risky investment opportunity in the transition to electric self-driving vehicles. Instead of deploying billions of capital in production and research, the company partners with established manufacturers and signs long-term supply contracts. 

Effectively, Magna locks in cash flow and recurring revenue, while the manufacturers battle it out for dominance in an increasingly competitive sector. That could make it the ultimate winner over the next decade. Just like Foxconn ultimately won the smartphone battle over the previous decade. 

## Magna stock valuation

This impressive run looks set to continue as the stock is relatively cheap compared to industry standards. Magna stock is currently trading with a P/E of 12.9. The stock is relatively cheap for a profitable, well-run company with tremendous prospects in electric and self-driving cars.

For income-focused investors, Magna would be an ideal pick given that the company offers a dividend yield of 2.1%. The company’s cash hoard of $1.5 billion and free cash flow of $3.45 billion makes this a reliable dividend payout. 

Overall, a company trading a price-to-sales ratio of 0.92 while it offers exposure to an exciting tech sector is rare. The 2.1% dividend payout and robust profitability is icing on the cake. Magna stock should certainly be on your radar. 

## Bottom line

Electric cars and self-driving vehicles are clearly the future. However, investors have focused too much on the flashy manufacturers and tech giants in this space. That means suppliers and technology providers like Magna have been overlooked. 

Now that the market is recognizing the company’s true potential, Magna stock is surging. It’s up a whopping 175% from March 2020. If the company manages to strike a deal with the ultimate tech titan Apple this year, the stock could unleash a further windfall for early investors. 

For conservative growth investors, this one is impossible to miss. "

Suppose I buy 12 AAPL leaps: 21st Jan 2022 at $165

Breakeven at expiry is $174\~

9.13 x 100 x 12 = $11,000\~ total cost for 12 OTM AAPL Leaps.

Now suppose I use those 12 Leaps to sell weekly AAPL calls, I can easily make $100+ per call by selling at a strike price $6-$7 above it's current price.

That means in 10 weeks, I make $12,000 off call premiums alone.

What's the worst case scenario here? My short call which I sell expire ITM somewhere down the line? That wouldn't even be so bad, I'd still be up overall and I could just wait for a dip to go in on leaps again?

Realistically, what is the worst case scenario here?

I know I have to be retarded and missing something here, but it seems solid as long as AAPL doesn't go bankrupt."

The above is over a year old. So what is Fitbit, and why am I posting this now, then?


Fitbit is an American electronics and fitness company which focuses on health-related metrics, tracking, and data analysis. For you, what you need to know is that it sells smartwatches. 

Anyone who cares about watches or fashion at all, you might have heard of Fitbit. As someone who used to be big on high fashion about 2-3 years ago, Moncler was a suave yet not over-the-top brand that a lot of rich Asians and Khabib Nurmagomedov wore. https://i.imgur.com/tiONi3I.jpg. Personally for me, Fitbit has a lot of resemblance - popular enough for the cool kids wear and know, and still good for the boomers due to the functionality. 


Fitbit is ranked 5th worldwide in shipments for watches, behind notably Apple, Samsung, and Xiaomi. https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS46122120


Back in 2019, some of you boomers here might recall an announcement by Google, with plans to acquire Fitbit at a 2.1 Billion dollar USD transaction, which was halted by various legislative and activist communities due to the ongoing battle vs. FAANG+M (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, GOOG(Alphabet) + Microsoft). See: Facebook vs. US of A currently. Let me give you the spoilers on this stuff for the upcoming Biden Administration and the near future: it doesn't matter. 

https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22158271/googles-fitbit-deal-eu-regulator-approval


Big techs rule the world, that's why they are boomer stocks at this point, that's why they are blue chips. Stonks only go up? None of this exists to today without the big tech companies starting the trend and movement into this digital era, into this technological boom. Your teachers use Google to find their sources despite telling to you keep your nose in the books. Your very own senators representatives and law-makers, voting about the 25th Amendment, revisit the constitution thru Google, while actively voting against big-techs taking over the world, using... Google. 


The very same Google is bent on acquiring Fitbit, and has received a conditional-yet-final approval from the EU commission, and will be soon to follow in the USA, I presume not long after the transition of power on the 20th. Google will acquire Fitbit due to their previous failure to breach into the smartwatches market, which exploded some ~4-5 years ago. Apple currently dominates the market, and Google wants a piece. Do you think Google will sit by idly and watch one of their prime competitors claim the throne without contest?


Google recently filed a patent for a smartwatch-design which includes a heartrate tracker. It's very unlikely that after their past attempts at breaking into the watches market, that they will go ahead and just, ""TrY aGaIn"" without the proper measures taken. Fitbit is that proper measure, it's the acquisition which will get them the entry footing they need, to grow. https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-fitness-band-design-revealed-uspto/


But the biggest reason why I'm in Fitbit right now, is because it's a tech-involved product maker coming out of the COVID pandemic, consistently beating earnings expectations for the last 2 quarters of the pandemic, about to report yet another earnings in... ~3 weeks, speculated 1st/2nd week of February. Premiums are beyond dirt cheap also, the stock's been sideways for a year since Google's acquisition announcement over a year ago. Get in before the holiday earnings in early February.


**TL;DR**
- $FIT is a watch company being acquired by Google, after long halts from various legislators and committees.

- Earnings are coming up, have consistently been beat during the pandemic, smart watch market grew ~80% YOY in 2019 and Fitbit's revenues grew during pandemic.

- Premiums are dirt cheap, stock has long to run. If $PTON can grow into 2021, $FIT will certainly rise from the ashes.

**EDIT**

POSITIONS:

Down on all, been in for over a month on all of them, some longer. Will be burnt for January calls. Time your calls to the ides of February or after - earnings are definitely not priced in.

1.Iphone's""- Every credible news source is saying that Iphone 12 is a huge success. First of all, analyst predict that Iphone shipments will grow more than 30 percent year over year and  are expecting the biggest sales numbers in the company's history. In this quarter it is expected Iphone 12 sales to be nearly 40 % percent better than those of its predecessor and recent reports support this claim. In the first 24 hours when preorders were availiable,  it is reported thant Iphone 12 sold approximately 2 milion units, compared to Iphone 11 1 milion and that was despite the fact that Iphone Pro Max and Mini were still not launched. Also U.S carriers report that of the 10 most activated phones in the U.S during holidays 9 models were Iphone's. Furthermore, yesterday a chinese research agency said that Iphone sales in China crushed all expectations. On top of that, it seems that most the units sold are the high-end Iphones which is unprecedented and will lead to bigger margins

Mac's- Analyst are saying that Mac's sales increased over 40 percent in this quarter, thanks to the new, powerful inhouse made M1 chips, That is the biggest growth registered by a PC brand  since 2010.

Services : Apple announced amazing holiday earnings from its app store in the region of 1.8 billion, compared to 1.42 billion in the previous year. Apple also said that users of their subscription services like Apple Tv, Fitness, Books, Music etc are growing rapidly. 

PS: We also expect a big announcement today from Tim Apple

TL;DR Apple are selling more phones and computers than ever and their services business is growing rapidly. That probably means that they are also selling more Ipads, watches etc.

kwblhm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwblhm/roundup_goevhyundaiapple/,Roundup: GOEV-Hyundai-Apple 🚀,122,35,2021-01-13 15:25:29,"Alright guys, newbie here, but I'ma take a swing at this DD stuff.... with $GOEV popping in AH, I thought I'd sum up why it makes sense that Canoo is likely to be profiting bigly off this Apple-Hyundai tie-up, despite the fact that [The Verge is reporting talks fell through on an acquisition.](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev)

I had predicted (among friends only), that Canoo's skateboard and designs lent themselves perfectly to $AAPL, so I (at least purport to) have some legitimacy on this.

**Some of this has already been covered,** but I wanted to take the bajillions of threads on this thing and distill them into one with most of the info. **Sorry if you have $GOEV fatigue, and I don't blame you...**

Here goes.

1. Tim Apple [reportedly met with the BMW i3 team in 2015](https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/31/9081425/apple-bmw-i3-meeting-rumor) to learn about vehicle manufacturing. The report stated Apple ""may be eyeing the i3 as the foundation for its own, heavily rumored electric car."" Who used to work on the i3? Stefan Krause, Ulrich Kranz, and Richard Kim -- i.e. the team behind the i3 and i8 birthed Canoo into existence.
2. Canoo's philosophy is much the same as Apple's. They mention several times in their press materials and in their appearance on JLG that they sought to [""rethink"" the car from the ground up](https://twitter.com/canoo/status/1229937399637139456?s=20).
3. Canoo moved extremely fast compared to most EV players. They took 19 months to reach beta phase, have completed 50+ crash tests, have 32 beta vehicles, and 13 driving prototypes. Apple would like to see this kind of competence -- heck, any partner would.
4. One of the few things that Canoo has not improved upon at all in their skateboard is battery tech, which Apple reportedly has in spades with their [reported ""breakthrough"" EV battery technology](https://www.engadget.com/apple-car-2024-233505759.html). What else has Apple been working on non-stop? Another of Canoo's weaknesses -- [autonomous tech with their fleet of Lexus SUVs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-project-titan-to-start-electric-vehicle-production-in-2024-says-reuters/).
5. Hyundai and Canoo have [an existing engineering partnership to design a skateboard](https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/2982) that will underpin ""small, 'cost-competitive' electric vehicles"" for Hyundai. Hyundai believes in Canoo enough to also invest directly in the company.
6. Apple [is definitely working with Hyundai on securing a manufacturing deal by the end of Q1](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/10/apple-hyundai-apple-car-deal/), according to reports from South Korean media.
7. Apple [reportedly wants the Apple Car to be ""a personal vehicle for the mass market,""](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/21/apple-targets-car-production-by-2024.html) which fits perfectly with what Canoo is engineering for Hyundai... or a variation thereof. Apple has also [long been rumored](https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/02/21/apple-project-titan-vehicle-could-turn-out-to-be-an-electric-van) to want to make something akin to an ""electric van"" for commuting.
8. With the news report from The Verge surfacing, in which it's revealed Apple wanted to acquire Canoo, one can pretty easily see what is happening:
   1. Apple approaches Canoo about an acquisition in January 2020
   2. Canoo execs/engineers believe in their product too much to sell it. But -- and this is key -- there is no way you say ""no"" to Apple when you're in that bad of a financial situation (as reported in the same article). Maybe they said ""you can invest"", maybe they said ""let's partner,"" but I guaran-damn-tee you they did not tell the most prestigious company in the world to pound sand.
   3. Backroom dealings happen in secret.... Then Hyundai announces their tie-up with Canoo in February. Did Apple approach Hyundai about approaching Canoo? Did Canoo and Apple jointly come to an agreement to bring a manufacturer in? Did Canoo-Hyundai happen organically to Apple's good fortune? Who knows...
   4. Whatever happened, now it's reported that Apple hopes to reach a deal with Hyundai by end of March. Why? Because they want Canoo's skateboard tech, of course. They simply found a workaround.
   5. Canoo-Hyundai-Apple allows each company to bring their incredible strengths to Apple Car. Canoo execs/engineers have 30+ years experience in automotive and the i3 and i8 under their belt; Hyundai have manufacturing at scale down; Apple have design/UX/software/battery tech/autonomous. This is the best possible outcome for Apple. In other words, Apple would probably want Canoo's experience.
9. If Canoo knows their skateboard is valuable enough for Apple to want it, they surely are going to demand a profit from Hyundai in some way, likely through licensing their patents/tech out. No way they have a strictly engineering and investment agreement. There must be royalties or other fees at play here. Of course, we don't know at the moment because the details are being held close to the chest.
10. Canoo has stated [in a slide deck](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022607/ea125677ex99-2_hennessy.htm) that their platform is ""fully autonomous compatible."" \*wink\* \*wink\*
11. Canoo stated [in a slide deck](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_270955872.png) that they have interest from a ""Tech Strategic... player in smart car and autonomous vehicle that has identified Canoo as a base platform to integrate systems."" Sounds a lot like Apple or Uber or something of that ilk.
12. Canoo has mentioned several times that they have a partnership announcement in Q1 2021. They recently posted ""🏗️🔋🤝📍📲"" as a tease [on their social accounts](https://twitter.com/canoo/status/1345145017975726080?s=20).
13. The [reported timeline](https://www.autoblog.com/2021/01/10/apple-car-built-by-hyundai-america/) for Apple car is 2022 (prototype), 2024 (integrate Apple's battery tech). Whose timeline is similar to that? Canoo's. Canoo hopes to launch the Lifestyle Vehicle in 2022 and their MPDV in 2023, with future models in 2024 and beyond.
14. ADDED: Canoo has designed their Lifestyle Vehicle and MPDV to [be completely screen-free except for your phone or tablet](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-unveils-worlds-first-subscription-only-electric-vehicle).
15. ADDED: Canoo are currently [advertising 100+ jobs](https://canoo.breezy.hr/) between their Breezy jobs page and LinkedIn.

All signs point to Apple wanting to acquire Canoo for their technology and Canoo turning down an outright acquisition, so Apple went after Hyundai to back-door access the tech they wanted.

Canoo has (in bold and large lettering) on some investor decks that they ""OWN PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY"" -- probably because they realized how valuable this was after the Apple overture.

With all that said, even if the Apple tie-up is completely unrelated to Canoo (which seems like a stretch at this point, it's more likely Canoo is involved in some way, imo), it's clear that $GOEV is legit, has valuable, protectable IP, and a team that believes in the product.

I am here not to talk about the Tesla bubble. But the Netflix bubble that no one is talking about and when popped, autists will be getting fucked to the equivalent of Asa Akira on an episode of Brazzers.  Netflix is a great company, good product but very soon will be outpaced and future earnings reports will begin to show investors how **growth is dying due to competition, life going back to normal from covid, the lack of ability to funnel customers to it's streaming services, and loss of quality content** that is equal to a shitty re-run of the Maury show where a guy finds that is his girlfriend is both his aunt and sister. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hgio2xbcy0b61.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cd79dce1be8173671dcaac08329288d00f0d449

Netflix who has been the background noise hook ups around the world is in a period where they can become the next blockbuster video in 7 years. Market share is being gobbled up by competitors such as Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO Max, Disney plus, Youtube, Apple TV, and direct tv on the go. 

**Growth dying to competition:** The biggest competitive threat to Netflix is probably Amazon. As of the fourth quarter of 2019, Amazon Prime Video had about 150 million subscribers—a number that's been growing at a fast pace over the past two years as the company has increased production of its original content. 

Netflix and Disney had an exclusive relationship, at least until the studio decided to jump into the streaming war. When Disney announced it was going to launch its own service, it ended the deal it had with Netflix. Netflix offered a number of titles from the studio but agreed to cut them all from its lineup in 2019. **Disney owns every Disney movie including every Marvel and Star wars movie that's pretty much every quality movie for fucks sake.** 

Netflix basic package for one person to stream only is $8.99. As of May 2020, package subscriptions to Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ cost $12.99 per month. Subscriptions to just Disney+ cost $6.99 per month or $69.99 per year. Which is way cheaper then a Brazzers subscription. 

The big news for Hulu came in May 2019 with the announcement of a deal between Comcast and Disney which had Disney purchasing Comcast's stake in Hulu for a reported $5.8 billion. This puts Disney in full control of Hulu and consolidates the competition as Disney makes a big push into the streaming services field. 

Netflix investors should be equally worried about AT&T’s new streaming service that launches in 2020. It’ll cost slightly more than Netflix at $16–17 month.

AT&T is best known as a cell phone company. But its purchase of WarnerMedia in 2018 turned it into a media powerhouse. It owns HBO, the most successful premium TV network ever. HBO continues to pump out all-time hits like *The Sopranos, Game of Thrones,* and *Sex in the City.*

**The lack of ability to funnel customers to it's streaming services:** Do you know why the Amazon Echo dot was dirt cheap? Because Amazon wants every household in the United States and the world to have a fucking Alexa in their living room. From that every time you go to order something whether it be a fridge, butt plug, or sweater for your wife's boyfriend you're going to buy it from amazon now. this leads to Amazon prime Throw in the fact that google nest and apple homepod are a thing that are working towards this as well will lead to Netflix becoming a non S&P 500 stock and leave call holders in shambles.

Netflix relies off other companies platforms whether it be Google's search engine to find their website, Ipads with their app, amazon fire stick....its only a matter of time before Netflix is overridden by competitors and left in the dust I believe. 

**Loss of Quality Content:** Netflix's two most watched shows are Friends the The Office which are both now off the streaming service. Family guy isn't on there. Other then Queens Gambit, and a couple other shows its pretty much shit selection and Broke Back mountain that I know you guys like to watch with your boyfriends. Netflix is going to shit and there are rarely blockbuster movies from theaters on there. You cannot tell me the content is getting better....it isn't and the competitors are growing and their content is more entertaining. I know boomer Amazon prime members who canceled Netflix for Amazon prime video. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Look how the stock is flat and has lost momentum while other FANG Stocks are fucking balls to the walls in Retard Strength Momentum](https://preview.redd.it/3de98ecab1b61.png?width=635&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca0cfad8d0924543f2eb6d81bc1164618dcaa57c)

Netflix was revolutionary when it came out. It was the first in streaming and it is getting left in the dust as competitors fight to get their market share in streaming. Even the CEO has admitted the company is trouble. 

Going forward it will succeed or fail on the popularity of the TV shows it produces.  

Over the past year Netflix's debt has shot up 58% to $10.3 billion. For perspective, Netflix earned $1.2 billion in profits last year. 

Netflix’s market cap is about $165 billion—making it the 30th-biggest publicly traded US company. The PE ratio is around 80, meaning every $80 spent is for one dollar of profit.....but **everyday Amazon prime video members, Disney Plus members are cancelling their subscriptions as Netflix tries to raise their prices on their customers and the company is losing quality content every month. Company is overvalued and will struggle to grow.**

Netflix will survive. But it will shrink. Even in the most generous scenario, within three years I can’t see it being worth more than $100 billion. That would put its stock price at about $225/share—or about 40% below its current price. 

Next earnings I am buying a FD Put. 

The Netflix bubble is gonna pop. 

Cannot go tits up.

I heard my calls will not go through. I’ll cancel them but how do I make money off of this right now or is too late?"
kw8xmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kw8xmn/serious_dd_tsmc_a_hidden_gem_offering_free_money/,[Serious DD] TSMC - A Hidden Gem Offering Free Money,56,49,2021-01-13 12:27:02,"# While there are many more companies that are discussed much more than TSMC (NYSE:TSM) on here, such as Apple, AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, etc, TSMC is a hidden gem that is getting ready to take off over the next few years. Here's why:

TSMC was founded in 1987 with the intent of bringing Taiwan into the global tech market. Morris Chang, who previously worked at Texas Instruments for over 30 years, is the founder and former CEO of TSMC and widely regarded as the ""godfather of computer chips"". TSMC is currently the world's largest semiconductor producer, with over half of semiconductor revenue from TSMC. Other notable competitors include GlobalFoundries (AMD used them for Zen and Zen+, switching to TSMC for Zen 2 and Zen 3), Intel, and Samsung. TSMC is a pioneer in the pure-play foundry business, meaning that they do not produce any chips for their own products. Instead, they manufacture and sell chips to companies, meaning that those who choose to source chips from TSMC do not have to build expensive silicon fabrication plants to manufacture their own chips. TSMC currently operates 10 different silicon fabs, manufacturing over 10,000 different products using over 250 distinct technologies to cater to 499 different customers in 2019.

Not only is TSMC the largest semiconductor foundry, it is also a pioneer in advancing semiconductor production and performance. Currently, TSMC has 7 customers for its new 5nm chips, including Apple, for A14/X chips and ARM-based chips for Mac products, Qualcomm and MediaTek for 5G smartphone chips, AMD, for next-generation Zen 4 CPUs, Bitmain, Intel, and NVIDIA. TSMC is also currently engineering its N4 chips, built on a 4nm process node, its 3nm chips, and its 2nm chips, which will use new GAAFET (Gate All Around Field Effect Transistor) technology instead of the traditional FinFET technology.

**So who are some of TSMC's biggest and most notable customers?**

# Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Apple is the world's largest company in terms of market capitalization (2.17 Trillion), and has become widely popular due to its heavy and cohesive integration between its products and widespread use by many prominent figures. Currently, it offers many products such as laptops, phones, smart watches, smart TV products, fitness products, and more. It also offers many services and software products, which all integrate with each other via iCloud, continuity software such as Handoff, and more. Recently, Apple has confirmed that they are cutting support for Intel CPUs on their Mac products in a few years, meaning they will shift to using entirely Apple Silicon chips for all of their Mac products. This is in addition to Apple using their own chips for all other products that they currently produce - iPhones, iPads, smart watches, etc.

Apple is one of TSMC's largest customers, and that is only expected to grow as they ramp up production for their M1 and next generation ARM chips for Macs. Apple's M1 chips are a strong competitor to AMD and Intel CPUs, especially if they can scale well up to 32 and 64 cores. They are extremely efficient and consume drastically less power than x86-based CPUs (Intel and AMD CPUs), meaning that thermal requirements are much lower. Macs have typically been targeted by PC enthusiasts as an overpriced, underperforming lineup, but we may see that change as Apple's new chips perform extremely well.

Apple reported a yearly revenue of 274.5 billion US Dollars in 2020, roughly a 5% increase from 2019. Since Apple relies on TSMC for their chips, and Apple's Mac lineup is likely to become more popular, I would expect that TSMC's revenue from Apple will increase more than we've seen in previous years.

# Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)

AMD has certainly made a huge return since Lisa Su became CEO in 2014 and the production of Ryzen, which was widely popular due to its high core counts and high price to performance compared to Intel. Now, Ryzen has developed into a strong all-around player, sporting high core counts and great single thread performance. Currently, AMD Ryzen 5000 desktop CPUs outperform Intel's current generation Comet Lake CPUs in games, which is the first time that AMD has surpassed Intel in gaming performance.

AMD has slowly been regaining market share, both in the PC enthusiast side and the server side. In the past two years, AMD has doubled their server market share from 4.5% to 8%. This may not seem like much, but considering that server upgrades are not frequent and those who buy Intel server CPUs are more likely to stick with Intel, that is a massive increase. On the PC enthusiast side, AMD CPUs have accounted for 84% of CPUs sold on mindfactory.de, a German PC Retailer. This is a massive increase considering that in 2016, before the release of Ryzen, Intel accounted for roughly 75% of CPU sales on mindfactory.de.

AMD launched their Zen 3 chips in 2020, which was followed by huge demand and a shortage of these CPUs. This was in part due to demand at TSMC not being able to keep up with AMD's orders. Zen 3 CPUs perform extremely well, and next-generation Zen 4 CPUs, which will be on TSMC's 5nm process, point to a shortage of fab space at TSMC.

# Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)

Qualcomm is a semiconductor company that creates wireless technology chips, CPUs, software, and services related to wireless technology. Their most prominent products include their Snapdragon CPUs, used in phones from some of the largest smartphone companies such as Samsung, LG, OnePlus, Xiaomi, Motorola, and more. They also produce application specific processors for things like cameras, IoT devices, kiosks, robots, and a lot more. Additionally, Qualcomm offers desktop CPUs, such as their Snapdragon 8cx. Qualcomm also produces various connectivity chips for things such as WiFi (onboard chips in laptops, desktop Wifi cards, routers, modems, etc), Bluetooth, and internet connectivity chips on smartphones.

Currently, Qualcomm relies on TSMC for the production of its Snapdragon chips. Although Samsung beat out TSMC for the production of Qualcomm's upcoming 5G chips, mobile chips accounted for 44.8% of Qualcomm's total revenue in 2020, while RF Front End chips (smartphone internet connectivity chips) accounted for just 9.8% of Qualcomm's total revenue.

# NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)

NVIDIA has been a long time customer of TSMC, dating all the way back to 1998 when NVIDIA switched over to TSMC's 350nm process for the Riva TNT. Since then, TSMC has manufactured nearly every NVIDIA chip up until RTX 3000 series, also known as Ampere. NVIDIA decided to switch to Samsung's 8N 8nm process node, likely due to financial reasons or fab capacity reasons.

However, NVIDIA is allegedly moving back to TSMC to manufacture more Ampere GPUs using their 7nm process. There could be a few reasons for this - TSMC might have offered NVIDIA a deal, or capacity for 7nm fabs may have opened up due to large customers such as Apple and AMD shifting more focus towards TSMC's 5nm process.

NVIDIA's RTX 3000 series GPUs, also known as Ampere, are a massive improvement in the GPU space compared to previous generations and just for performance in general. The RTX 3070 performs similarly to an RTX 2080ti, where the former has an MSRP of 499 USD and the latter has an MSRP of 999 USD. In addition to much greater price/performance, Ampere GPUs also heavily increase ray tracing performance so games that can take advantage of ray tracing hardware are actually playable. They are extremely popular, and currently Ampere GPUs are selling anywhere from 200 to upwards of 1500 dollars of their MSRP. NVIDIA is also huge in the AI/Computing space, teaming up with NIO for AI-based self-driving computation, Photoshop, for neural filters, and also  powers some of the fastest supercomputers in the world. In regards to AMD, NVIDIA blows the new RX 6000 series GPUs out of the water for things like streaming performance and workstation performance.

# Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)

While Intel has traditionally manufactured most of their products (Internet connectivity products, processors, chipsets, etc), Intel is reportedly shifting a fair amount of their chips to TSMC. Recently, Intel announced they would use TSMC for 7nm Xe graphics chips on their CPUs. In October of 2020, Intel CEO Bob Swan said Intel would decide by January whether it was going to expand its 7nm production, outsource it to a foundry, or both. Intel has severely underperformed in the CPU space compared to AMD, but if they decide to shift some production to TSMC, this could mean that Intel will make a strong return into the CPU space and strong entry into the GPU space.

# Cool, but what does this mean?

Again, TSMC is the largest foundry, outclassing the likes of Samsung, GlobalFoundries, and other similar companies. There is an insane amount of demand for TSMC's chips, and they are extremely competitive compared to other manufacturers. TSMC has customers such as Apple, AMD, and Qualcomm, which all have great products and are only expected to grow with the release of new technology such as CPUs or 5G networking. Many of its customers are expected to have massive growth over the coming years, meaning that TSMC will reap some of those profits.

# Ok, but why should I buy now?

I mean, TSMC is already up over 100% over the past year, isn't it too late to buy in?

When you consider its most important clients, all of them are going to use TSMC for future products that are important to their respective segments. Apple has just begun their venture into producing their own CPUs for Mac products, the release of DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 is right around the corner with AMD's Zen 4 processors, set to release late 2021 or 2022, Qualcomm producing next generation Snapdragon CPUs (and we may see 5G production shifted to TSMC), Intel actually producing competitive CPUs once again (which might be with TSMC), and NVIDIA continuing to dominate in the computing space and the GPU space. Considering that all of these things are happening in the next few years, TSMC is getting ready to take off.  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀

TL;DR: TSMC has a lot of very large customers (Apple, AMD, QualComm to name a few) which are all producing technology that looks very promising. All of these things are coming up in the future, which mean that TSMC is going to the moon. BUY CALLS AND LEAPS LET'S GOOOOOO

Well I'm here to do some diligent DD for you autists to YOLO your life savings into and upgrade the depressing life you live in.

**The company is Sony $SNE**. 

Some important things to know:

* Sony dominates in 3 major markets; Consumer electronics, entertainment, and telecommunications
* Recently, Sony raised its future earnings outlook on [record-breaking earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/28/sonys-second-quarter-profit-jumps-13point9percent-on-strong-gaming-demand.html)
* Current P/E ratio sits at around 14, with a historic high of 127 (peaking in PS2 release and averaging 80+ shortly after subsequent PS releases) industry average and competitors is currently at about 25.
* Sony also has [many predictable sources of revenue including](https://sonyreconsidered.com/sony-q1-2020-earnings-overview-revenue-2-profits-1-f467dafe5609) a ""Financial Services"" branch that advises anti-yolo boomer's assets.

Assuming you autists even read this far, lets get into what the future metrics for this might mean.

Lets start with the **Consumer Electronics or the cash guzzling brrrrr machine Playstation** segment. Currently if I want to buy a PS5 and throw my money at our King and money god Kenichiro Yoshida (CEO of Sony) I would have to go through 3rd party. When PS5's hit the market they sell faster than you retards can lose money. In fact, on average [PS5 is outselling Xbox 2-1](https://screenrant.com/ps5-outselling-xbox-series-x-reseller-website/) right now, in addition to that, the Brrrr-virus will cause the game console market to near [$55+ Billion next year](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/multi-billion-dollar-console-gaming-market/). Also, without getting into politics, its also important to know that approximately 10-20% of Stimmy checks will go to buying electronics based on polls. This segment is Sony's cash cow and makes up 30% of their revenue. This number is expected to grow significantly as more consoles are expected to hit the sales floor and is likely to [**exceed the PS2 RECORD 157m**](https://screenrant.com/ps5-order-sales-playstation-ps2-holiday-2020-preorder) **total consoles sold. 200 Million consoles = $90 Billion in sales!!** 🚀🚀🚀

Next is the **steady telecommunications segment; hey Boomers, this tendie stonks only go up segment is for you!** This is your home entertainment stuff like T.V.'s, speakers, solutions segments and mobile phone. They have a ton of patents on imaging and sensing products that they license out to keep revenues boring and flat here. This has been their worst performing segment during Covid and in a relatively fast response, they built the ""sony electronics corporation"", [rebranding their Ericsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Mobile) brand with the goal of significantly decreasing operation costs and bandwagon onto the tech YOLO train.

Finally **the entertainment branch where you autists can laugh, cry, and most importantly tickle your tendies endlessly.** Not including the mad dash to get many licensed PS5 games, Sony's entertainment industry (Columbia pictures) is expected to release a new James Bond No Time to Die and Spiderman 3 in the coming year. Given the shutdown for the last year, the sales in entertainment decreased only 6% thanks to retards like Apple TV+ buying up licensing agreements for Sony's movies and shows. With upcoming hits, and a continued partnership with Apple TV+, revenues are going to quickly recover and even better than before.

**Tldr;** With the growth potential of PS5 alone, Sony should easily be trading at double its P/E of 14 to be closer to its competitors putting the PT at $200+. This does not include the massive shifts that they will be implementing across the org to increase net profits.

 - [And the comments on the Apple subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/kvukih/cbs_apple_has_a_big_announcement_tomorrow_that/)

Summarized for you autists:

 - Gayle King went to an Apple store to conduct her (remote) interview with Tim Cook. She could have done the interview from anywhere.
 - Suggests whatever it is, it's at the apple store (not a product)
 - A morning show interview implies Apple's announcement will come out pretty early in the day (if not later today).
 - Also implies Apple thinks its non-product news will have impact / relevancy with the mass market.
 - Also, Gayle King is a big hitter for CBS. Doubtful this will be a ""we now offer Apple Card Monthly Installments for Apple Watch bands"" type of thing.
 - An ""Apple Stores as vaccination sites"" announcement makes sense to me.
 - Other people think it could be related to privacy (/u/XtremePhotoDesign: ""CES is taking place this week. Apple has used CES week to tout iOS privacy in the past. This is certainly an announcement related to iOS 14 privacy controls."")

From the Reddit post comments (/u/jturp-sc):

 - They're going to use Apple stores for vaccine distribution.
 - They're announcing some industry partnership (e.g. automotive joint venture) that will lead to future product(s). (my note: why would they have to do this at the store? Still my favorite idea)
 - The search engine is launching and somehow they don't consider it a ""product"" because it's free to use.
 - Donating an eye-watering amount of hardware to educational institutions to help with virtual school.

Now, in true autist fashion I haven't been following this stock for shit. Personally I'd just throw everything into AAPL or GOEV weeklikes, or, for the weak people, GOEVW"

They have a phenominal new CEO with some Lisa Su level turn around potential.  He is doing everything right.  Cutting garbage unprofitable brands, doing the hype videos and apple/tesla style car releases.  They're focused more on high quality, high margin hype cars than ""lets just produce a bunch of shit"". 

 They're aiming for a GLOBAL profit margin of 8%.  Sure, they plan on taking a revenue hit, but so far the profits have been growing exponentially and the revenue hasn't been hit very hard.  

Remember, Ford consistently hits 140-150 BILLION in revenue a year.  Currently, they have a 1-2% or abour 3-4 billion in profit a year.  Even if they take a massive hit in revenue, like 25 billion, thats still a minimum of 10 billion dollars profit, and thats only if they don't exceed that.  

They did something similar after the 2008 crash, and their stock price went 1.80$ a share to nearly 20$ a share.  Remember, just prior to this, they also took a hit from the dotcom bubble crash, when they hit 90$ a share.  As well, in the following 3 years of the 2008 crash, they paid off nearly 70 billion dollars in debt.  Going from 150 Billion, to nearly 80 billion in debt in a very short time. 

Personally, I could easily see this stock hitting a minimum or 15$ by 2022 and 20-30$ by 2023. Getting some WSB momentum behind it could easily raise that number quite a bit.  If it picks up some steam, and their CEO keeps doing everything right, then we could easily see 20$ by 2022.  

Also, no its not a boomer stock anymore.  They got rid of the dividend for now, which means bigger profits and stock gains, they're producing tons of EV cars, apple style hype car releases, and Lisa Su level CEO comeback story.

However, others have argued that there should be more stocks included in such a hypothetical.

I hereby propose an alternative BECKY index that includes more companies, and I would like to request WSB to comment on this proposal. Here are the considerations:

1. It assumes the normal consumption habits of a Becky in 2019 and before, and that COVID could not wipe out gyms and malls.
2. It assumes that these items are less likely to be purchased by Chads, Zhangs, or Robots (see ([u/Su-Bae-Bae's research](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b8d5uy/bcky_index_chad_index_zhng_index_rbot_index/) and [u/elons\_cybertruck's research](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/edazey/introducing_the_official_tonks_and_becky_trackers/) for reference).
3. If anyone is willing to step up and propose other indices, please do not hesitate and discuss them with us.

**$AAPL**: Cloud computing and SaaS are for nerds. Chinese ppl luv ifone, therefor Tim Apple go brrrrrr

**$AMD**: You picture SuBae during sex. Cathie who??

**$AMZN**: “You never actually own $AMZN, you merely look after it for the next generation.” If you know, you know, if not you probably can't afford $AMZN.

**$BA**: Boeing pleas fly. Literally.

**$BABA**: WHERE IS JACK MA??!!?!?!!

**$BB:** It’s 2012, and you’ve just discovered how to connect your Curve to your car with bluetooth.

**$BRK.B:** “Scared money never makes money.” Scared, as in scared to tell your friends your account still hasn’t fully recovered from the COVID crash.

**$DASH**: You have a list handy at all times explaining why we are not in a repeat of the dot com bubble.

**$DIS:** Who knew betraying your childhood memories could be so profitable?

**$F:** F

**$FB**: You are just happy you don’t own $TWTR… right?

**$GME**: You believe in the Squeeze like Seventh Day Adventists believe in the Second Coming. RC is God and DFV is His prophet, blessed be his tendies.

**$GOOG**: You have a pet chameleon, or python, or some other cool but slow-moving animal.

**$MSFT:** You are a boomer, but want to hang with the youths so you bought some LEAPS. No one thinks you’re cool.

**$MT:** You are patient and still care a bit about fundamentals. You would honestly make a good “investor” if gambling wasn’t so much fun.

**$MRNA:** $PFE HOLDERS HATE HIM! for making a better vaccine with this ONE WEIRD TRICK!!!

**$NKLA:** You are retarded, and have the clinical records to prove it.

**$PLUG:** Something something gold rush, selling shovels, etc. etc.

**$PTON:** For the fiftieth time, No, you did not mean Palantir. You wish it were summer 2020.

**$PSTH:** You don’t like to take no for an answer, like when the co-founder of Stripe told you no, there is no deal with Bill SPACman.

**$SPCE:** You’re really just waiting for the SpaceX IPO.

**$TSLA:** At this point, you are either buying your third Lambo or selling your 2004 Corolla for a margin call. There is no in between. Remember, Elon giveth, and Elon taketh away.

kvif4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kvif4m/further_discussion_on_the_dollar_and_a_stock/,Further discussion on the dollar and a stock market correction,48,45,2021-01-12 10:38:55,"You can say the dollar isn’t going to bounce because of Biden’s stimmy and the money printer but if you actually took the time to look at a chart once in your life you’d see a bounce is pretty much already underway. Nothing in the stock market goes in just one direction without bouncing. Even a giant piece of shit scam company like Nikola will bounce on its way to the depths of hell. 

Now that we’ve got that out of the way, let’s talk about what happens after the bounce in the dollar. I’d post a chart to show you but you monkeys would just fling poo at it anyways. If you’d stop jerking each other off over Tesla for 5 minutes maybe you’d find some value in what I am about to say. 

First of all I don’t disagree with you assholes that the Biden crew is gonna keep printing and make the dollar drop. But as we’ve already discussed, bounces in the dollar are going to happen whether you fucks like it or not. If you pay attention, this next bounce/correction in the market could be a massive opportunity for those of you smart enough not to blow your accounts trying to yolo weekly expiration calls into a correction. 

If the dollar bounce fails - and I think it probably will, then the next area it’s likely to head is another 5% lower. Just for reference, during the last  5% drop in the dollar, the SP500 rallied almost 19%. 

Thats a huge fucking gain across the whole market.

Gains you won’t be able to take advantage of because your account will be a flaming pile of dog shit. 

Here’s some other numbers for you from today - 

Dollar up .41% 

SP500 down .67% 

Tesla Down 7.82 % 

Apple down 2.33% 

Are you fuckers getting the picture yet?"

Hyundai then backed away from those statements saying it wasn’t true.

Now they’re confirming that there is a partnership and plan on inking a deal in March. Now connect the dots.

Canoo is licensing their design to Hyundai, Apple is partnering with Hyundai as a production partner for Apple car. Therefore. Canoo is indirectly linked to the Apple Car.

I wish everyone would just think about core competencies here:

* Hyundai's manufacturing
* Canoo'sEV design
* Apple's Titan project was always about autonomous driving

Does Hyundai have an autonomous-ready platform without Canoo? Not that I'm aware of.

Besides, Canoo looks like a typical company, which Apple is probably going to buy one day. Just check their [insta](https://www.instagram.com/canoo/?hl=en). It's like looking at www.apple.com .

An agriculture manufacturer for those who don’t know, completely underrated stock, been buying and selling this since 130$.

Deere will be on display at CES 2021 and won an award for their X-Series combine. In the the most compulsory sector of the world: farming. Deere tractors are synonymous with quality in the US. Last September Ford’s Farley said he wants Ford to “Run like a Deere”. Farmers rely on their equipment for their livelihood, and the rest of us rely on them to farm shit and send it to us.

If you look at the chart for DE you’ll notice it’s always green. John Deere tractors are green. Coincidence? Doubt it.

Reuters Stock Reports Plus gives DE a 9/10 which on par with Apple and other good shit. One of ARK’s portfolios has been buying it recently (ARKQ?) and I’ve personally just doubled down and bought more. P/E is a relatively modest 33.8 and cash flow per share at 15.54, and a Reuters risk score of 10. Literally can’t go tits up. 

Earnings was beaten every quarter last year and Morgan Stanley have them at Overweight with a price target of 341 doll hairs. It’s actually a profitable company producing slabs of cash so it’s not in the radar for these 800 year old analysts to attack instead of retiring. SPEAKING OF it’s could be seen as a bit of a boomer stock since it’s been around forever and gives a little dividend (3.04$ PA) which doesn’t hurt either. The IV is lower than Trump’s IQ so it’s pretty unlikely that’s it’s going to be subject to major swings, the thing barely even moves premarket.

With the move to autonomous vehicles we can expect that at some point the agriculture industry is going to follow suit, with numerous extensions available for their equipment, the Deere’s are pretty close to driving themselves and last year a fully autonomous tractor concept was unveiled. This will save farmers zillions of hours of work.

The United States is the world’s single largest economy (at market exchange rates), accounting for almost 22 percent of global output and over a third of stock market capitalization. It is prominent in virtually every global market, accounting for about one-tenth of global trade flows, one-fifth of global FDI stock, close to one-fifth of remittances, and one-fifth of global energy demand. Since the U.S. dollar is the most widely used currency in global trade and financial transactions, changes in U.S. monetary policy and investor sentiment play a major role in driving global financing conditions.

It did a big try beforce christmas but came back down. They haven't released the christmas sales informations, what they usually do. My guess is they will either do it soon or keep them for earnings.

Chrismas must have been absolut gigantic for Papa Bezos. Last Q4 they had a 62% earnings surprise and rose 8,11% after earnings.

&#x200B;

Now Corona hit us and we all know people spend a lot more time online shopping then usual! Appstore sales (Apple) were off the roof and Amazon will have the same for sure.

&#x200B;

**2020 v 2019 (Coronabonus for online sales and AWS)**

&#x200B;

||2019|2020|Growth YoY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Q4|6.47|||
|Q3|4.23|12.37|192.43%|
|Q2|5.22|10.3|97.32%|
|Q1|7.09|5.01|\-29.34%|

Now in Q1 2020 Amazon invested a lot in safety for their emploees and in last mile delivery. As you can see these investements made huge gains YoY and I wouldnt be surprised if the make more than 200% YoY in Q4! Chrismas was stay at home and let it deliver. 600$ Stimulus went straight in Amazon.

&#x200B;

The EPS estimate for Q4 2020 is 6.97. If we take the 6.47 (Q4 2019 and apply the growth we guess you can see the real estimate here:

&#x200B;

|0%|50%|100%|200%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|6.47|9.70|12.94|19.41|

So if the only grow about 20% they will have the estimate. Would you guess they grow earnings for 20% YoY? I would make a wild guess for 150-200%

If that is true we could see an epic 10-15% move of the stock after earnings. Q4 2019 disrupted the stock and pushed it 8% higher and the surprice was only 60%. If you take the 200% Growth YoY Q4 it would surprise by 300% which could lead to absolute new ATHs.

My estimate: 150% YoY Q4, which bringt earnings to **16,175 EPS and a surprise of 232%**(!!!!)

&#x200B;

**TL;DR: BUY AMAZON! Amazon 3.800-4.000 MAY CONFIRMED** **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**

Positon: 150 Stock and will buy 3800 weelies before the earnings (2/4/21)

Had a near $2,000 bull run from March 2020 at a price of $1,600 to $3,550 in September. Huge symmetrical triangle on the weekly chart signaling another move of the same kind.

If we can get a similar move, that'd put Amazon over $5,000 by around August. I'm INSANELY bullish on AMZN. I'm currently swinging options expiring in 2 weeks, but I'd like to sell to buy an expiration much further out. Bought yesterday on the dip to $3,140. In addition, I'm hearing rumors of a potential stock split in the coming months. Literally ALL rumors tho so I'm not counting on it, but imagine the impact it'd have. As we've seen with Apple and Tesla, it will make Amazon go crazy

&#x200B;

EDIT: Just to be clear, I'm not buying $5,000 calls and I don't imagine that price will come any time real soon... lol

But I do think 5K by end of the year"

Over the last two weeks a few reports and FinNews articles have come out expecting strong iPhone sales for Q4 earnings. A strong quarter is expected with the first 5G iPhones and pent up consumer discretionary spending. Anyone could have predicted that but I believe that analyst estimates are low and more importantly is not priced in at $129-133.

A few articles from shills and morons below

[Bezinga: IPHONE 12 SALES ARE 21% BETTER THAN THE IPHONE 11](https://www.gizchina.com/2020/12/29/iphone-12-sales-are-21-better-than-the-iphone-11/)

[Bloomberg: Supply Chain Sends Bullish Signal on 5g After Tepid Start](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-05/iphone-supply-chain-sends-bullish-signal-on-5g-after-tepid-start)

I did my own due diligence in November and December to figure out how many iPhones they were actually selling. Apple's suppliers posted Q4 [record earnings](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/08/tsmc-sees-record-breaking-earnings-from-iphone-12-demand) signaling higher production levels than past cycles and analysts report Apple produced 79 million 5g units in Q4 and another 210 million units for FY2021.

Analysts expect a [38% increase](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/22/apples-iphone-12-shipments-set-for-38-annual-growth-in-q1-2021) in units shipped for Q1 2021 and a similar increase for Q4 sales. Additionally the average price of each iPhone sold is expected to be higher than past years (typically around $750.) The model lineup this year is more expensive on average and analysts speculate flagship models iPhone 12, 12 Pro and Max make up the majority of increased sales.

Additionally sales in Chinese markets are expected to rise Apple market share past the 20% threshold they've been stuck at.

Using availability data from the Apple website, I found that base iPhone 12 models in any color were sold out (unavailable for in-store pickup) in 80% of Apple stores by the end of December after holiday sales. This isn't an exact count but does suggest that inventories of iPhone 12 models are low even for the commonly purchased base storage models.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p7q5pohtp2q71.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=927b11be38e74768546a25a863b40433dcea5895

Analyst estimates are almost surely correct and may be on the low side if inventories are as low as they look. Additionally the stock has priced in expected lower sales numbers due to a delayed launch date and production holdups. AAPL is still trading below ATH from September when reports came out regarding delayed launches. I believe that Q4 sales will beat significantly  and  since the launch was delayed, demand in Q1 will be greater and guidance for the quarter will be increased during the earnings call.

**Positions**

\\We've been sitting at $128-132 for the last two weeks but I have a target price of $142 for post earnings through early March. AAPL is $2.22 trillion behemoth so significant price changes are difficult but the IV on options is low enough (42%) to be worthwhile.

I have already committed the remainder of my options account to this play. I picked up $132c 2/5 on Wednesdays dip but any calls $130+ exp after earnings are a very viable and potentially lucrative play.

If you buy puts fuck you.

On top of that I just have that little feeling about this play. Felt that way about longing TVIX in February 2018 which was a 10 bagger and Palantir at $9. I'm not so good with words but I like my numbers and they check out. And lets face it, you've yolo'ed on worse DD before.

Hey retards, I am bringing you here the latest rocket that’s going to go to the moon and give us infinite tendies. Magna international (MGA). I put 7 rockets in the title because you can multiple your money by 7 (source: my DD and my dreams) 

Magna International Inc. designs, engineers, and manufactures components, assemblies, systems, subsystems, and modules for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of vehicles and light trucks worldwide. The company operates through four segments: Body Exteriors & Structures, Power & Vision, Seating Systems, and Complete Vehicles. 

Notable Clients: Aston Martin, BMW, Ford, Daimler, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubish, Peugeot, Citroen, Renault, Nissan, Toyota, Volkswagen, Volvo…
As you can see every big company is their client

An example of a complete vehicle made is the Jaguar I-Pace. This is one of the keys. We have got a lot of IPO money going into EV’s companies that don’t have any manufacture capability. Here is when Magna is gonna enter the scene and go to the moon and beyond 

They are present in 27 countries,+165.000 employees, 13.000 engineers and nearly 40B in sales. 

Revenue is growing in the last 10 years, went from  28B to 40B 

EBITDA is growing too, 2B to 4B 

EV/Ebitda is 12x 

Debt/Ebitda is less than 2x 

CFO went from 1,2B to 3,9B in the past 10 years. 

Steady Capex 

Shares Outstanding, good job with buybacks, went from 471M to 306M 

Free cash flow per share went form 0,15$ to almost 8$  

The average free cash flow yield the last tean years is nearly 10% 
 

They just signed an agreement last month with LG that made the stock rise 10% 

And the most important thing, they’re the frontrunners to build the Apple EV car. If/When this happens and is official ... Can you imagine the jump we'll see?? 

As they say, buy with the rumors and sell with the news. But even without this, Magna is the frontrunner to be one of the most important companies of the next 10 years, since the car companies want to externalize as much as possible to continue competing. 

When Apple and other EV companies begin to announce big big deals with MGA, it would be too late. 

Position: 104 boomer shares at 45$ but planning to YOLO my life savings as soon as possible.

TL;DR: Great fundamentals, good growth, great management, potential EV super winner (AppleEV). MGA to the moon
Forecast: 100$ EOY + 30% upside the day Apple announces the deal.

ktjfsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ktjfsq/why_market_moveslong/,Why market moves(long),156,62,2021-01-09 12:01:50,"To understand how stocks move, first, you gotta understand the interaction between buyers and sellers. Basically, it's Econ-101 supply and demand. Too much demand? Buyers will have to raise their prices so that sellers sell.

Second, the types of market participants. Active and passive participants.

Passive participants are like, buy buy sell buy sell buy sell buy buy buy sell buy sell sell buy. This is almost completely automated and determined by the weighting of the stock versus the index or the methodology that it is following.

The bots of VOO, for example, don't give a damn if an accounting scandal has happened or if a new breakthrough has been reached. Every day, it will buy and sell stocks indiscriminately, following the algos.

And increasingly, newer assets under management are coming mostly under those passive investment vehicles such as passive ETFs, passive mutual funds etc leading to them having a larger and larger share of the market. (I am coming to active participants later)

Thirdly, you gotta understand hedging. Which is basically an investment position to offset losses. Example, you sell a naked call. You see the stock moving closer to the strike price. You immediately buy shares to ensure that you don't take a loss.

# Ok, now why do individual stocks move?

They move based on events (plain old news, market-related movements etc). Now, let's go back to active participants such as retail investors, hedge funds, fund managers etc.

Suppose, there's a quarterly earnings report coming out for ASML. Almost all active participants have somehow figured from various news reports that the earnings report will be good because of the huge demand for ASML's product.

As a result, an active fund manager takes a big position on that stock. The stock moves a bit. Hedge funds and other firms also take their positions.

A retard post about the company's upcoming good earnings on the internet and all early retard investors quickly get in.

The stock moves up. In the meantime, the passive funds are adjusting their position in the stock, realtime. If it's going up. They are buying more to adjust their position.

Now, don't forget. Those passive ETFs or funds have other semiconductor stocks in their ETFs and shits. Which means, even if only ASMLs quarterly earnings were supposed to be good, other stocks of the same sector will benefit. As there are tons of both active and passive algos that don't trade individual stocks but ETFs and similar stuff due to liquidity reasons or other reasons.

Edit: for clarification, this is not the only type of passive investment ETFs. In fact, some will sell if the stock rises.

This gets even better. Suppose, lots of retail investors are also buying call options of this stock. If the underlying continues to go up, the delta could keep on rising. Suppose it went from 5% to 10% to 20%. This would force the option sellers to keep on buying more and more shares and could lead to gamma explosion where the market makers create a violent feedback loop due to hedging.

It gets more fun than that. Remember the various HFT firms and scalper bots? Well, they know it all too well that some firms are busy at hedging frenzy. They also join in on the feeding frenzy that is this stock.

After said earnings release(or most likely, just before it), most of the active participants like retail traders and hedge funds may well start taking profits. And the stock generally runs up more than the expected in the first place.

This leads to the violent unwinding of the positions that we generally see after the earnings release. Because everything happens in the exact reverse order I just described here. That's why it's a terrible gamble to buy options in hope of a good earnings release or similar news.

It feels euphoric if you are on the right side of the tide and equally depressing if you are on the wrong side of the tide.

The same thing can happen in the opposite direction if a piece of bad news is expected or happens.

Here, earnings release is just one of the events that I described. It could be any event like index inclusion, regulatory shifts, stock splits, analyst upgrade-downgrades, some fund manager or hedge funds buying the stock etc.

Also, don't forget that all this is also affecting other stocks in the same sector/region etc due to them being connected through passive investments and active participants exploiting the passive participants.

A very recent example of this happening would be the stock PLTR. Remember, they signed a contract with FDA for $44M but the stock moved almost $10B or more(I haven't calculated) or about 20%. Two weeks ago maybe, Citron declared short attack and a violent unwinding of positions happened and the stock went down about 15-20% after climbing 10-12% that day. Or the day before that when it climbed 20%+.

Now I have sold calls on PLTR (yeah, I like it that your 12/04, 12/11, 12/18 expired or will expire worthless).

**This is not how all stocks move.**

But a large portion of the stocks that are mentioned here in the sub move this way. This is why it sometimes feels like to you folks as KINDA pump and dump. But whether you retards accept it or not I know you guys are the cream of the crop. While most of you act as if you know nothing, I know very well most of you probably make money.

You guys are like people who watch tech reviews to buy a smartphone.

Ok, I completely went out of topic. Sorry.

**This is not how all stocks move.**

Some boomer stocks like MMM, JBT etc may have low retail interest. In those cases, the stocks are almost absolutely up to the mercy of other active participants, who or which may as well not care that much leaving those stocks to the hands of the algos of passive participants.

But in those whole processes, there's almost no price discovery that's actually working. Passive algos are buying and selling (but mostly creating buying pressure) completely arbitrarily, HFT bots buying and selling because, reasons.

The participants who are using traditional valuation metrics, analyzing the good and bad of stocks are getting outnumbered by all the other participants and generally speaking, the volume of their trades are also declining in the overall market. Think of big participants like Berkshire(which is undoubtedly the most powerful active participant in the market), pension funds, sovereign funds etc, they barely buy or sell any stocks they have if they have entered on the right price.

Sure, I am kinda underselling the influence of big institutional investors, but it is not completely without any merit.

**So you are saying there's no price discovery in the various stocks?**

Absolutely not. Even in the greatly flawed system I described being used by most market participants there's plenty of it happening by newsflashes, sell-side analyst recommendations, retail fomoers etc.

Only the stocks that have heavy institutional ownerships, with a healthy retail interest seems to me to be less volatile(this is my intuition speaking really, so this statement is probably false in the first place) such as MSFT etc and they probably have better price discovery.

**What about those stocks doubling the day they IPO?**

The reason behind that is very simple. Tons of retail investors place Market Orders. This means they are ready to pay whatever the price this thing will go for. In those scenarios, investment banks can hardly control the price of the stock as there's just too much demand to satisfy. In short, it's a feeding frenzy. And this is one of the things that's primarily driven by retail interest.

**What about those SPACs and low-float stocks?**

Well, this again needs no explaining. Too low float, too much interest. Various whales also know this and use this for their benefit. After the merger is complete(or slightly before it) retail investors and whales leave for the next thing in the line. So the stock tanks and the stock price never recovers.

If the company that's being pumped is actually any good, the stock would likely later get the attention it deserves after the sell-off.

I hope all those points are good enough to explain most of the funky behaviour an individual stock would make. I know my explanations are not exhaustive and there are many angles I haven't covered, but it is what it is.

Now, to the MORE IMPORTANT STUFF. Individual stocks also move due to numerous macro reasons. When the entire market is in a euphoric phase, you can throw a dart and that stock would move up. The opposite and the stock would go down.

# Why and how does the market move?

Liquidity. This is probably the most important thing that drives the market as a whole.

Excess liquidity that's circling around will inevitably try to enter into the economy in one way or another. Either through purchasing more assets or any other way.

Now, we all know it pretty well that this trend is being exaggerated by the low-interest-rate environment that's present in the current developed markets. People are being forced to participate in the market in the hunt for return.

Also, almost every investor from every country seems to be more interested to participate in the US stock market, even more than their home markets. And the recent trend of commission-free brokerage services and easy flow of capital has helped to provide even more participation in the stock market than usual.

Options trading is also at historic highs and probably most of you buy call options and put options is probably mostly bought by institutional investors(like it always were). As a whole, this frenzy can move the market very quickly.

Remember, SoftBank bought billions in options on very concentrated tech names? That along with retail call options purchasing mania lead the market to a euphoric state. The S&P 500 has become so heavily influenced by those tech names that if they move, the entire market moves. If they fall, the entire market falls.

But we haven't probably addressed a big elephant in the room. Volatility suppression.

Futures traders, algos, our central bank etc all are participating in the dangerous game of volatility suppression. 

This all can unwind though. And it can unwind fairly quickly.

If we take the case of February or March. If you remember, Mr Ackman was screaming fire, fire, fire(he have had his intentions) but the market was barely paying attention.

But with the lockdowns and everything, suddenly everyone seems to have gotten caught with their pants down.

And you know how quick all the things were. Active investors, retail investors everyone suddenly flocked for put options, VIX etc. A Minsky moment has suddenly come.

Margin calls, longs are burnt left and right, market makers have completely turned their positions etc, you know the usual deal but exactly in the opposite direction.

Suddenly gold, treasuries, cryptos etc whatever are being sold to cover their positions. Institutional investors are suddenly visited by their risk managements and they suddenly become net sellers.

Passive investments vehicles also sell stocks that are being kicked heavily.

Literally, everyone's a seller. No one wants to buy. And the situation doesn't change until the Fed comes in and says, ""Brrrr"".

Liquidity suddenly becomes available in the debt market. Retail investors jump. Buy the dip, they said. Money keeps flowing in from everywhere.

There are many other things that I probably needed to say to complete the story. But it is what it is.

Also, interest rate trumps over everything. Every valuation metrics, pricing schemes are dependent on it. So that's super important.

Let's say suddenly interest rates rise the market will immediately collapse along with your meme stock. Because of two main reasons. Every company is loaded with debt and the risk free return has just increased resulting in more money chasing treasury bonds and other instruments.

# These pieces of information any useful?

Yes and no. As they say, hindsight is always 20/20.

Let me tell you my short story navigating the market this year.

February. News of the virus and everything. I see VIX, S&P, bond market, foreign markets etc and I keep sucking my thumb thinking nothing's going to happen. Being burnt by two trades and market starting to freefall almost. I realize my mistake and change my strategy.

Fed says, ""Brrr"". I fail to change my strategy. Something even worse could be coming. Lol. After almost a week passing I realise my f\*\*\*ing mistake. Again. At least I can say it's not just me.

The information is almost always there. Problem is we(not everyone of course, some of you are much more flexible) fail to act upon it. 

Ok, one more story about an individual stock.

Remember AAPL's third-quarter earnings result? I sold calls before earnings thinking the stock will go down after earnings report.

There was overwhelming evidence that this is not going to be true. And I read almost all of it (WFH and everything). Yet my monkey brain somehow decided to trust the analyst estimates and the overall news cycle surrounding the economy.

AAPL then reported a literal blow away quarterly earnings report.

For me 2020 was a year of reckoning and I learned to remove my directional assumption from the market and to just go with the flow. But I am pretty sure it wouldn't matter, cause when it's time, I just wouldn't remember.

I posted this one before but it got removed by votebots."

A transparent company wouldnt be able to sell 50 dollars worth of parts as a 1000 dollar iPhone. Apple vendors live in fear of being booted if they mention Apple's name on even internal company presentations - Cupertino Fruit company is the closest anybody gets. Hyundai gave a PR saying they are going to work on the Apple car. TC is going to move heaven and earth to get an alternate vendor which sucks because KONA is the best non TSLA EV on the market.

I would look at Magna as being the contract manufacturer

Puts on Hyundai

Puts on AAPL (this will delay the project by a year at least)

#[Today's Top Headlines for Friday, January 8th, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-8-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Wall Street set to continue its record run

> U.S. stock futures rose Friday, one day after the Nasdaq closed at a record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 also closed Thursday at records. Both benchmarks were tracking for weekly gains despite Monday’s sharp drops, the first negative starts to a new year since 2016. The Nasdaq was also solidly higher for the week as Wall Street powered higher over the past two days despite Wednesday’s deadly siege at the U.S. Capitol and its fallout.

> Bitcoin, which topped $40,000 on Thursday for the first time ever, passed $41,000 on Friday. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has been up more than 30% in the first days of 2021 and 400% over the past 12 months. The value of the entire crypto market, which is made up of bitcoin and other digital coins, topped $1 trillion Thursday for the first time.

> Tesla shares marched higher in Friday’s premarket after rising 10 sessions in a row, surpassing Facebook in market value, and making CEO Elon Musk the world’s richest person. Thursday’s increase in Tesla’s share price pushed Musk past Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, who had been the richest person since 2017.

*****

> # 2. December jobs report could be weaker than forecast

> The pace of job growth likely slowed dramatically and could even be negative in December, as the coronavirus spread rapidly across the U.S. Economists expect to see a gain of 50,000 jobs, down from 245,000 nonfarm payrolls additions in November. The Labor Department’s monthly employment report is out at 8:30 a.m. ET, and the stock market could react more to a positive surprise than a negative one. The 10-year Treasury yield remained above 1% early Friday ahead of that report.

*****

> # 3. Trump finally concedes Biden will become president

> President Donald Trump late Thursday admitted — for the first time in his own words, despite vowing never to concede — that a “new administration will be inaugurated” on Jan. 20. In a nearly three-minute video, posted after his Twitter lockout ended, Trump did not mention President-elect Joe Biden by name. It came a day after the outgoing president sparked the riot that saw a mob breach the U.S. Capitol in protest of the election.

*****

> # 4. Pelosi, Schumer call for Trump removal from office

> Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are calling for Trump’s removal, accusing him of inciting “insurrection.” Schumer said that if Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet do not move to invoke the 25th Amendment, Congress should reconvene to impeach Trump.

> Pelosi said Congress “may be prepared” to impeach Trump if executive branch officials do not act.

> Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were among the Cabinet secretaries who discussed the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump, three sources told CNBC. They determined the process of elevating Pence to the presidency could take more than a week, diluting its effects.

*****

> # 5. Single-day Covid deaths top 4,000 for first time

> The U.S. had its first day of over 4,000 deaths from Covid-19. In the single worst day of the pandemic Thursday, 4,085 people died from the virus. The latest coronavirus surge iaw record seven-day averages of new daily infections and deaths running at 228,497 and 2,764, respectively. As of Thursday, the number of people hospitalized with Covid fell slightly from Wednesday’s record high levels.

> A coronavirus vaccine developed by U.S.-based Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech appears to be effective against a key mutation in the more infectious variants of the coronavirus discovered in the U.K. and South Africa. The research by Pfizer has not been peer reviewed. The World Health Organization said last month that health authorities were “urgently investigating” whether the virus mutation affects vaccine performance.

We eatin fresh warm tendies with elon after yesterday?  Or are we fomo'ing in and out of palantir putting bulletholes in our portfolios?

Regardless, i dont think i saw enough appreciation for the fact that the richest individual currently living priced one of his EV models for ***exactly*** $69,420.  What a time to be alive.  The torch has been fucking PASSED!  And to who, but our leader?  C'mon boys, we can pump it a little more for celebratory purposes and get Elon to 200B for a day.

Let's get down to business; it's time to get stupid wasted off twea's and truly's like our wives to cope with our losses.  Instead of buying that FD for Tesla next week, get one on Apple instead & spend the rest on a few cases of booze to drink while apple fucks you and then goes up 10 points.

The viral video of loser white guy getting fatality'd with a can of tea sent shockwaves through the meme community.  Saw a string of videos on tiktok of people dramatically opening a briefcase and pulling out a twisted tea like they're boutta air out the scene with a glizzy.  And that was just **ONE** of the chain of free advertising videos, made sometimes and reposted often by kids who *didn't/can't/don't* even drink TT or alcohol.  That girl on Twitter has posted multiple times about how this event already is and will continue to affect her work schedule for the coming month.

Alllll kinds of search trends exploded for ""Twisted Tea"" and ""Sam Adams"".  Someone posted a week or so ago with screenshots of different explosive search trends, tried finding that post and their account but failed at both (like most things in life).  EDIT—u/Altruistic_report105 posted it 3 days ago, fuckin go nuts n look at the good data he posted.

Not to mention the fact that Sam Adams is a high volume stock, trading healthily at almost exactly a grand a share, and they **fucking murdered** their last two earnings.  They crushed 2019 in sales & are currently set up by meme power and alcoholics normalizing their problems to kill another earnings report, coming 2/17 after hours.  

Why is the meme power so important?  Why is this sudden late boost in sales so important?

**Because the dusty old millionaire shareholders aren't on social media and have no clue about the true potential because they play sudoku on paper and thus aren't pricing in the coming action.**

I'm not saying that Sam Adam's doing good is gonna be news to them; but every single time the big dollars are aware of a catalyst and possible positive price action change backed by a strong financial quarter, they price that in for options and then our lottery calls are too expensive and risky to play.

Enough bullshit, lets get down to it.  Before i open my positions, im gonna try and grab some extra money quick trading NIO calls as NIO Day is saturday and should give a small run up friday.

Here are my positions; starting off by selling a short spread, taking the credit, and doubling it down into 2 poor mans calls.  If your primary language is retard i can translate---Me sell shit position and buy 2 good ones!

\-1 $SAM 2/19 1050p, +1 $SAM 2/19 1040p

\-1 $SAM 2/19 1050c,  +1 $SAM 2/19 1040c    x2

Gonna be in it for about a grand, and out for 2 in profits for a total of 3.

5% over the next 5 weeks with a strong catalyst backing it should be an easy task for the big dog to pull off & it will be just in time to make my annual car payment on the 21st ;) wish a fellow retard some luck and drink some tea's for me!"

ksvs7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ksvs7p/serious_dd_canoogoev_and_the_potential/,[Serious DD] Canoo/$GOEV and the potential Apple/Hyundai partnership,288,151,2021-01-08 13:11:58,"Tl;dr If Apple partners with Hyundai, it will most likely be based on the Canoo base platform. This is purely speculation, but grounded in real facts based on looking at the primary area of collaboration for Hyundai's EV partners, Canoo's founders' history with Apple and Canoo's investor presentation.

Let's dive into the FACTS:
Hyundai is in early talks to develop self-driving electric vehicles with Apple [Link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/hyundai-motor-says-it-is-in-early-talks-with-apple.html). Hyundai also has a couple partnerships to co-develop EVs with Rimac, Arrival and Canoo

First take note that in Apple's initial press release, they announced they would be focused on a ""personal, mass-market vehicle rather than a robotaxi or commercial vehicle"" [Link](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35036439/apple-car-2024/)

For this reason, Canoo is the most likely partner. I'll illustrate using a quote from a press release where it mentions the focus of the Canoo partnership is on small, cost-competitive EVs + PBVs (in other words, mass market vehicles), which is the market Apple is focused on. [Link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia)
""Canoo and Hyundai Motor Group, Hyundai and Kia’s parent company, will develop a new electric vehicle platform that’s based on the one that powers Canoo’s own vehicle, which was unveiled last year. This EV platform will power small, “cost-competitive” electric vehicles, as well as “purpose built vehicles,” which would more closely resemble shuttles or even autonomous people-movers.""

The reason it is much less likely to be with Arrival or Rimac is based on reading their partnership announcements with Hyundai as well.

From Arrival article [Link](https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/company/newsroom/hyundai-and-kia-make-strategic-investment-in-arrival-to-co-develop-electric-commercial-vehicles-0000016387) : ""€100 million investment enables co-development of eco-friendly vans and other products for logistics, on-demand ride-hailing, and shuttle service companies."" 
The target area of the Arrival partnership is on commercial vehicles (delivery vans, shuttles) as opposed to consumer vehicles that Apple will likely target.

From Rimac article [Link]( https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/2772): ""Hyundai Motor Group and Rimac Automobili (Rimac) have announced a strategic partnership aimed to strengthen the Group’s efforts to lead the high-performance electrified vehicle market and enhance its status as a game changer in Clean Mobility.""
The target area of the Rimac partnership is high performance, sports concept vehicles also unlikely to be Apple's target market. 

Another piece of potential evidence is from Canoo's investor presentation [Link](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_270955872.png). The picture mentions a project in progress with a Tech Strategic who is ""a player in smart car and autonomous vehicle that has identified Canoo as a base platform to integrate systems.""

There is also plenty of history behind Apple and the Canoo founders to explain why this speculation is actually fairly reasonable thinking. In 2015, Apple was very close to using the BMW i3 as the basis for its Apple Car [Link](https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-innovation/apple-bmw-i3-electric-car-173344/amp). This deal fell apart, but it shows that Apple was impressed by the BMW i team's EV platform. Fast forward 2 years and Canoo is the creation of those same former BMW i-Execs including Ulrich Kranz (former Head of BMW i) and Richard Kim (former Principal Exterior Designer of i3 production vehicle and i3 and i8 concepts at BMW)."

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

Below is a series of **linear** chain of reasoning with known facts that lead to an outcome that is guaranteed but not priced in. The market isn't carrying the implications of known-trends to their logical conclusion (the material provider--Prysmian) and is currently undervaluing Prysmian Group. Imagine this as a chain of dominos. I will lay each one down consecutively, showing a near-future reality in which a company is set to quintuple if not 10x it's revenue over the next 10 years. 

&#x200B;

1. **EVs are going to see mass adoption**. Every automaker + Apple is trying to get in on this. BEV advantages are simply too great. It is highly likely that by 2025, 25-35% or more of new car sales will be electric. This will only continue to 2030. The average car life is [12 years](https://www.aarp.org/auto/trends-lifestyle/info-2018/how-long-do-cars-last.html#:~:text=A%20typical%20passenger%20car%20should,Lyman%2C%20chief%20analyst%20at%20TrueCar). It is likely that by 2033-2035, a majority of U.S cars are electric. 
2. **This will cause big increases in demand on the grid**. [This](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2019/12/f69/GITT%20ISATT%20EVs%20at%20Scale%20Grid%20Summary%20Report%20FINAL%20Nov2019.pdf) **is a fantastic read--the ""high"" (EV adoption) scenario doesn't show 90% EVs till 2040...which smaller than what is currently happening with new EV models / State/Country bans on ICE vehicles**. The average American home uses \~33 kWh of energy per day. I own a model 3 (75kWh battery), BARELY drive (no commute) and still charge 6-7 times a month (from 20% to 80%), averaging around 13 kWh per day.  A commuter may use around 30-35 kWh per day just to drive, especially when heating the car. **For a non-commuter thats a 30-40% increase, for a daily commuter that's almost a 100% increase.** By 2025, if \~30% of the U.S. fleet is electric, that'll cause a significant increase in grid demand. More important, though, is that energy generation planning, permitting, and construction takes a long time. They have to front run this big time because generation facilities (wind/solar) take time to plan, permit, build, and hook-in (HVDC). We're already seeing an absolute renaissance in wind and its only going to keep accelerating along with the EV adoption curve. 
   1. (2B) Additionally, there are other factors behind growing grid demand: California is considering banning gas heating in new homes (Electric heating and anti-gas legislation will increase electric demand for thermal units), an increased interest in hydrogen (via electrosis, for aviation / industry)
   2. (2C) Some people think that added capacity will be curtailed because everyone will charge at night where there is bandwidth for capacity boosts from existing generation facilities. **These people are wrong**. While night-charging will *assuage* total added generation capacity requirements, there isn't enough current night (natural gas) generation capacity to meet the demand of 40-50% EVs, and (see below) its unlikely Natural Gas is gonna keep as fast as it has been, for political reasons. Additionally (1) Not everyone is going to have home charging (apartment buildings, street parking rowhomes) and thus will supercharge at work/while commuting, (2) many people aren't that disciplined to save $3-4 on a charge, (3) people will live their lives normally--charging when they need, often during the day. **A ton of added capacity is needed.** 
3. **Added capacity is likely to be green**. As of yesterday, /r/Energy had an [article](https://renewablesnow.com/news/renewables-make-71-of-new-us-power-capacity-in-11-mo-2020-727014/) showing how 71% of the added energy (8000mW wind, 6500mW solar) capacity in 2020 was renewables. This phenomenon has two causes. **(1)** Finance: Coal isn't cost competitive with solar and wind anymore. Solar is getting very, very cheap and more and more efficient. Offshore wind is having a renaissance. Nuclear is greener, but more expensive (\~$4,200 per kW), and NIMBYism will prevail. Solar/wind is FAR cheaper than $4,200 per kW right now. Banks are scared of liberals: Alaskan oil can't even get bank financing now (Just this week, Trump opened up those Alaskan areas for bidding and nobody bidded, literally), and Coal isn't expanding. People see the end of oil (and, honestly, nuclear) is near. **(2)** Politics. Dem administration for the next 4 years, and green energy isn't the political football it was 10 years ago. Fighting renewables isn't the focus of the right anymore. Additionally, Democrats resist natural gas expansion (as noted above). Natural gas isn't that green (big methane problems) and while it's cheap af, its not everywhere (pipeline limits), and I deem it unlikely that population centers (NE Corridor, Cali, Chicago, etc etc), which are ALL liberal, are going to be OK with more and more natural gas plants. I deem it unlikely that we're gonna be a 50%+ natural gas country. Don't believe me? Go read up on California banning natural gas. Yea, Cali can be crazy, but it is almost ALWAYS the harbinger of progressive thinking. Expect that to carry forward. 
4. **Biden will do an infrastructure bill**. This will happen. Its popular, its needed, and its perfect for his huge desire to be seen as a bipartisan president. Its an amazing kick off to his first year in office. He needs to find a way to boost employment before 2022 in order to have a growth-narrative for the midterms. 2022 midterms don't look good for democrats, and if he doesn't have a strong 2021 year (or at least, optically) he'll get lame ducked in 2023-2024. He's not running in 2024, he's too fucking old. So, how does he go into the twilight of his career with the narrative of a 'Unifier'? He does something everyone can get behind: infrastructure. With the recent Trump supporter capital storming, Biden has some great political bandwidth to hit the ground running. 
5. **Biden will try and include moderate green elements in this bill because he knows he won't get green policies otherwise**. Even with the two blue Georgia seats, there is \*\*ZERO\*\* chance the Dems blow the filibuster. You have (1) a president that won by a narrow margin, that (2) isn't that popular, (3) who has a bad-looking 2022 midterm, that (4) won't run in 2024 cause he's ancient, with (5) a not-too-popular VP, can't afford to run roughshod over norms and weaken their 2022 prospects. No-filibuster 50-50 plus Kamala casting the deciding vote? Please. Not happening. Yet, Biden does need to cater to his liberal supporters and fire up the DNC base in 2022. A great way to get people onboard is to blend an infrastructure bill with elements of the Green New Deal. He has to do this. Its the only way to sneak green policies into implementation to cater to the Left. Standalone 'Green New Deal' isn't happening and McConnell isn't going to let something named that pass, but may let green elements be sluffed into a general infrastructure bill. All this aside, infrastructure is *NEEDED.* Everyone and their mother knows this. It's pushing on an open door, at precisely the right time. 
6. **Green elements in an infrastructure bill will have to benefit Red states** in order to get passed. We're not gonna get a carbon tax / cap and trade system. We're not gonna get massive oil taxes. Yeah, he'll help EV adoption, but that's pretty limited to subsidies (the $7,500 subsidy expansion for Tesla and GM just failed as a line item) and research subsidies. Not good enough for the Left. 
7. **A lot of Red states are RICH in renewables**. Look at the maps below for for U.S. solar and Wind geographic advantages. What do you notice? For the most part, there are huge wind opportunities in the Midwest, Great Lakes, and NE Offshore region. There is huge solar potential across Texas and the South. Outside of California and Northeast Corridor/Great Lakes offshore wind, renewables are concentrated in the Midwest and South. **If you want to do a Green Energy bill that also serves as a bipartisan stimulus, there are geographic comparative advantages that give you a compelling reason to create green energy in Red states.**

&#x200B;

**However, the Grid currently isn't configured to transport the level of green energy needed to meet the heightened demand environment in 2030-2040. Guess what links huge solar fields and onshore/offshore wind to population centers? HVDC does. The HVDC network to pipe ""local"" (regional) renewable hotspots to population centers doesn't exist. See the below map of the U.S. HVDC Grid, and compare it to Europe and China's:**

&#x200B;

[Note all the Offshore Wind to the North Sea, and the connections between Renewable hot spots \(Iceland, etc\) to population centers](https://i.redd.it/hmijqzkxh0a61.gif)

[This won't be surprising. The Chinese do big infrastructure, and half the Party back in the 90s were hydrologic engineers. ](https://preview.redd.it/9ycsi1d5i0a61.jpg?width=1240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fafd25e782fbd27964d1b1f958e80ea46fc855d6)

In addition to these maps, look at the [**global list of HVDC projects Wikipedia page**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HVDC_projects)**. Observe how many are in Asia/Euro vs the U.S.** It's not our fault, in the past grid owners could easily locate generation facilities near enough to minimize high voltage lines. However, things are changing--wind and solar take space, aren't as location-independent as gas/coal/nuclear. 

&#x200B;

* (8) **Microgrids won't solve the issue.** Obviously Tesla city-level distributed powerpacks will happen, but this isn't an either-or situation. **The speed of EV adoption and the heightened demand environment are going to vastly outpace the adoption of rooftop solar (what many microgrid proponents suggest can fully-deal with grid demand)**. Grid-level wind/solar is still needed, and those sources need to be connected in, so again, a regionalized HVDC connection system from renewable --> population center is still needed. 
* (9) **The more HVDC connections that are installed, the more compelling it will be to form longer-linkages (more HVDC) between population centers (and therefore, storage).** Connected regional grids (think--Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania connected mutually via Great Lakes Wind farms that are, in turn, connected to the NE Corridor) marginally decrease the amount of total net storage needed in the system, as ""the wind is always blowing/sun is always shining somewhere"". This process will continue until we eventually have a 'Supergrid'--but NOT one by original purpose--which is what people usually argue against when people mention that word, but convenience--alongside thousands of microgrids. 
   * If this seems extreme to you, sit back, consider the 2nd point of this post, then imagine 80% of Cars are EVs within 15 years. A vast majority of Semi-trucks are electric. Advances in batteries mean that Planes, shipping, and tons of military applications now all use huge amounts of power. Grid demand is way, WAY higher than it was when the biggest demand source were light bulbs and your shitty AC unit. 
* (10) **The way to play this is by going to the manufacturer / installer**. **Prysmian Group ($PRYMY, an ADR) is the largest HVDC provider in the world. It's also a pure play.** It is based in Milan, but its a union of 3 companies--one of which is General Cable (American), which produces HVDC domestically. See the below image, which is from Prysmian's 2019 annual report. The green dots are energy cable (HVDC) manufacturing facilities. See a trend? They're almost all in Red states (again--renewables largely in Red States, HVDC manufacturing in Red states...)

https://preview.redd.it/m5vyb46so0a61.png?width=601&format=png&auto=webp&s=202e61a596fcac6e73c1584e3a5eeec9059dec58

* (11) **45% of Prysmian's revenue is Grid work. It has a P/E of 44. What happens when Prysmian's revenue goes up by 3x over the next 5 years, and 10x by 2030?** There is SO much work to be done modernizing the U.S. grid, but then on to the rest of the world. The realities I am describing--EVs--> heightened demand --> green is cheap --> it needs to be hooked in --> regional grid connections lower net amount of storage needed in aggregate, etc etc etc, aren't unique to the first world. Other countries will follow suit. 

# Conclusion

I do not believe this reality is baked into the price. Although everyone knows grid upgrades are coming (hence 44 P/E), I don't think that people are taking these large-phenomenon down to their lower level logical-conclusions. The gradual, inadvertent development of the Supergrid is inevitable, necessary, and politically convenient for a guy so desperate to bridge the political divide. Prysmian is well suited to take full advantage of American infrastructure as well as the rest of the world. 

\------------------

TL/DR:

**EVs adoption curves are getting faster and faster, and are going to drive higher electrical demands from the Grid, which will be met with Green Energy. This will require a huge increase in HVDC installations. This is occurring at exactly the time Biden needs a big infrastructure plan for political-economic reasons, and the realities of Green energy in the U.S. actually benefit Red States pretty bigly. Gradually, HVDC networks will reach a point where a macro-regional 'Supergrids' become a reality (in order to lower aggregate storage requirements and add more safety/redundancy). $PRYMY (Prysmian Group) is the worlds largest HVDC provider and they manufacture HVDC in the U.S. They are primed to benefit from this trend, and it is currently vastly undervalued.** 

Sorry no rockets. Also, there aren't options available, so you'll have to slow boat this."

* Dems clinched the GA Senate run-off election as Warnock defeats Loeffler while Ossoff defeats Perdue (the first millennial Senator). As the results became more clear last night, futures took a deep dive particularly for NQ, while conversely small caps enjoys a favorable bump. The market opened deeply red for QQQ as big tech retreated with renew fear on antitrust probes  and overall an unfriendly corporate environment as Democrats will control WH and both chambers of Congress. 

* By early morning, the sell-off quickly reversed and big tech recovered most of their red, with big tech such as AAPL going from -3% to just shy of yesterday's close during day's high. In contrast to big tech, clean tech and weed soared on Dems securing the Senate. ICLN was up almost 4% during pre-market and as high as 9% during intraday high and HASI was up 10% during intraday high. Weed stock such as TLRY was up as high as 21%, ACB as high as 11%+, and APHA as high as 14%.

* Things quickly pulled back and tech started fading in earnest at 2:15 PM ET when protestors [cosplaying as revolutionaries](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106820104-1609961746992-gettyimages-1230453313-AFP_8YA6MW.jpg) stormed the capitol and Congress had to quickly pause their certifying of the Electoral College votes. Shit got real when a lady got shot as these protestors attempt to storm the [barricaded House chamber](https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1600/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F210106150417-03-house-chamber-0106.jpg) while Reps were still in the building.

* The sell-off accelerated for AAPL, AMZN, FB, MSFT, and NFLX as most drilled back to opening lows by EOD. AAPL closed the day -3.37% to $126.60, AMZN -2.49% to $3,138, FB -2.83% to $263, MSFT -2.59% to $212, and NFLX -3.9% to $500.49. Thanks to overall negative sentiment of all things tech, QQQ closed the day red at -1.39% to $307 (retreating quite a bit more than IXIC given the weigh of big tech in QQQ).

* Morning economic numbers had ADP reporting payrolls dropping to 123k in Dec, slightly below consensus of 130k. PMI was at 54.8 while consensus was 55.3, while factory order was up 1.0% MoM. Thankfully, none of these number fucking matters as the Dow, SPY, and IWM proceed to sky rocket with the market looking forward to stronger spending and stimulus from a Dem controlled govt.

* Beyond weed, clean tech, and infrastructure - financial sector killed it today in particular mid-cap banks such as ZION (up 11.24%), CNC (up 9.81%), and KEY (up 9.73%). You'll find a similar story for large-cap bank stock with JPM closing up 4.70%, BAC up 6.25%, C up 5.75%, and WFC up 7.08%. It's a good thing I've already dumped my reopening [WFC leaps play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kftjzt/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/ggarcbi/) of $25c and $30c which are now fucking ITM by $3~$8 and still have a year left to go on them. Nice.

* In yet another confusing about-face and showing a real Karen spunk, the NYSE is *really* delisting the three Chinese telecoms this time. The real kicker though came in at 2:25 PM ET when news broke that US officials are considering *more* Chinese stock delisting, adding Chinese big tech Alibaba, Tencent, et al. to the potential list. A sea of red soon followed to compound the sell-off as BABA crater to the Earth's core and closed down -5.32%. Following suit, PDD closed down -5.58%, JD down -7.66%, and the same goes for Chinese EV NIO at -5% and XPEV at -2.62%. LI escapes semi-unscathed and closed the day up 2.48% thanks to a new BofA coverage with a Buy rating and a PT of $42.

* In WSB meme stock land, GME was on track for a solid 8-9% day until the storming of the capitol occurred, PLTR's fade accelerated further while MT stays modestly flat, bouncing back from the overall market sell off. GME closed up 5.70% to $18.36, PLTR closed down -4.31% to $23.54, and MT closed up 0.32% to $24.70. ICLN, a new WSB favorite due to new balance of power in Congress might be added to future roundup if it continues to pump. Imagine that, a clean energy boomer ETF becoming a meme stock. The iShares fund managers are probably wondering why their alerts going tits up with social media mentions and sentiment brewing.

* Random trade ideas (these are not financial advice and if it goes wrong that's your own gdamn fault):

    1) FSLY leaps Jan 2022 90c or 100c+ for eventual TikTok climbing back fully onto the service as ByteDance pointedly makes a political jab at outgoing administration. Headwind on this retarded play: cloud/stay-at-home stock continues to take a beating as rona gets under control as vaccine roll out picks up. 

    2) Sell AAPL cash secured puts Jan 15 120p to 122p if the big tech fade continues rest of the week. These ~0.18 to 0.24 delta strikes are likely safe enough and if assigned, you'll have an upcoming ER on Jan 26 to sell IV pumped covered calls to get out of the trade intact. Feb 19 puts are likely okay to sell as well given you'll receive much more premium from the ~43 dte chains. Headwinds on this retarded play: its CSP and CC. As boomer as it gets. 

    3) BABA leaps and/or March debit call spread for another bounce in a wild trading week for BABA. March 230c/250c is probably a sufficient spread while baking in a bit of IV via ER which is on Feb 11. Jan 230c to 250c if you're not poor. Headwind on this retarded play: Jack Ma really is missing and the US govt really will delist a 600 bil market cap Chinese ADR, forcing out all major US institution holders. Yeah, right.

* The DOW closed up 1.44% or 437 pts, Nasdaq down -0.61% or -78 pts, S&P up 0.57% or 21 pts, and RUT closed up 3.98% (!!) or 78 pts. Stay in school kids and avoid storming federal buildings or Twitter will start banning your fucking account. (TWTR locks POTUS account for 12 hrs and is down -1.99% AH).

# Intro/Disclaimer

yeah its long as fuck, but read for tendies. If its too long suck a bear dick and move on. This is real analysis of the business model, not just a bunch of emojis. It is so long because of the niche field it is operating in and how a lot of key points are not understood well by the WSB community. This company really is a diamond in the rough and a great way to play future trends with less risk as you're not picking winners. Its the ""picks and shovels"" play of electrification and renewable energies. I'll explain the realistic case for how this company is soon going to be running the best tendie mine for decades to come.

This is my second DD post on now $MP, formerly $FVAC, and i'm back to discuss the developments of the company since my pre-merger post and add some further analysis about the valuation of the company and its future. **There has been too much really shitty DD** from both bulls and bears **on this company**where very few people on here have a real understanding of this company, their business model, and the future.

First - read my original DD post in order to have a decent understanding of the backstory cause I'm not about to type out all that shit again or explain what I've already written. Read that first then come back:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jgvarn/fvac\_dd\_evchina\_tension\_play/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jgvarn/fvac_dd_evchina_tension_play/)

That post discusses mainly international tensions and the role REE's but this one i'll speak more on the business case of this company and how even without geopolitical tensions it is a true tendie mine.

Second - no I'm not a bag holder Ive been in since it was a pre-merged SPAC my average on my shares is about $14 and my LEAP is far far ITM and no I'm not selling any of them. Also, as i referenced in the post I work in a very similar field and interned in college at a mineral mine in the refining aspect as a chemical engineer, so while I'm not an expert at this I have more insight than the average retard and I am trying to give out tendies before the boomers take them from us. I will try my best to explain the business model of a mining company and why this company is the most unique and interesting way to get tech company level growth with the associated free cash flow while not having to be anywhere near as innovative. Ill discuss a lot of the bear arguments for this company as well and try to de-bunk them as most don't really hold water once you look into them the slightest bit.

# Background of NdPr

While the company produces as basket of Rare Earth, the plant is aiming to focus on NdPr and other permanent magnet materials in order to play the trend of EV's and electrification. These magnets are extremely important for so many technologies due to how Electric motors work. To put it simply, at current technology the only way to convert electricity to motion or the only way to convert motion to electricity relies on permanent magnets. Im not gonna try to explain more than that because I too am retarded but if you don't believe me or want to learn how watch this  [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWulQ1ZSE3c):

yeah i know you didn't watch that video, but just imagine you did and now believe me.

However, because it works both ways BOTH electric motors AND electric generators rely on this technology. This is key for understanding how NdPr is the best way to play both the trends of electrification AND renewables. First, electrification is most embodied by the rise in EV's in the future, and while that is predicted to be the fastest growing segment of NdPr demand it is foolish to not to account for other evolving technologies reliant on electric motors as well. Robotics will be a huge growth market and electrification of other industries will rely on NdPr permanent magnets. The other massive growth opportunity for permanent magnets is through renewable energies. Wind energy (and possible future motion based energy harvesting tech like tidal energy) work through harvesting mechanical motion and turning a generator to create electricity. Wind power doesn't work without electric generators which don't work without magnets. In addition, wind tech is advancing down a path to require even more magnets due to improvements is Permanent Magnet Direct-Drive (PMDD) technology from the current Gearbox doubly-fed induction Generator (DFIG). Essentially what that means is the new technology will take out the gearbox currently used in wind mills and replacing them with more efficient direct driving technology allowing more mechanical motion into electricity. These new generators require stronger magnets, thus more magnetic material. Read more about that [here](https://www.goldwindamericas.com/pmdd):

**TLDR**: They mine mainly permanent magnet materials that at current scientific understanding CANNOT be replaced due to their unique electromagnetic properties.

**TLDR on the TLDR**: Special Rocks no replacing. Need special rocks.

# $MP's expansion plans

A lot of bears like to bring up the fact that $MP is still reliant on China to do their refining and they're correct... for now. Currently they mine on site and refine to REE concentrates which they then send to china to refine into Rare Earth Oxides (REO's), which then get send to become metal alloys and then finally to magnets. Currently is the only location in the world to refine past concentrate material so $MP is forced to send their material there, but that is why the went public. The intent of them going public was to raise funds in order build an on-site REO facitility, which is scheduled for completion in 2022 and is already started. They already have enough cash on hand to furnish this upgrade as they had over $500M on hand at the end of Q3, and they also are a cash flow positive company already before even moving downstream. There are EV infrastructure plays with much worse valuations and years away from breaking even on cash flow, yes I'm talking to you $QS bagholders... that tech is unproven and there are so many battery competitors in a field where there WILL be a winner

Why would they want to move downstream when they're already profitable??? Because the further downstream they go the higher margins they earn and the more tendies they can mine for us. Refining raw materials to useful materials is a value adding process and thus creates more value for the company that does it. Once they complete this expansion they plan on going to stage 3 of their business model, the ability to build magnets and other final products of REE's in America. They have not decided/disclosed their plans for this, whether it is through construction of an onsite facility, an acquisition, or a joint venture, but it is in the plans. This is expected to come online around 2025 and when the insane cash flow can begin for the company. I don't have any reason to doubt the validity of their intention as its just a continuation of the business model they are currently implementing and the majority of the corporate rhetoric is related to ""mine-to-magnet"" and ""restoring the REE supply chain to America.""

What does this mean for the company? as they move further and further downstream they will increase their margins from this action alone, but it gets even better. This can be shown in their in-house calculations of their 2023 adj. EBITDA target of $252M

&amp;amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/s25.q4cdn.com\/570172628\/files\/doc\_financials\/2020\/q3\/MP-3Q20-Earnings-Deck-FINAL-11.23.2020.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/7eiobfp84f961.png?width=1258&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a41e24edbdadb0b1e55ec53ae92f7c4109f19b8d)

it is important to note that those numbers are from the current step they are taking right now in building the REO refining facility. Adding further downstream capabilities will only cause that EBITDA value to grow as margins improve, but next I'll discuss where their margins will improve from EVEN MORE.

**TLDR**: downstream expansion is a way to increase margins and therefore free cash flow for the company.

**TLDR of TLDR**: Special rock get more special. Get more tendies for special rock.

# Business model of mining companies and why $MP has insane growth potential

*\*\*\*This is the most important part of this long ass post, if you read one section, then read this\*\**

A big disconnect on a lot of DD in this sub and analysis elsewhere is the economics of how a mining company works. A mine is by definition a COMMODITY PLAY, which I know is not as exciting as a tech company, BUT it will experience tech sector growth for a period of time and then experience a period of time in which develop into a cash cow business reaping huge dividends for shareholders.

What i mean by a commodity play is through the economics of how a mine operates. Given a mine at a fixed production volume, the costs on a year in year out basis are relatively similar. What i mean by this is the cost $MP to mine and refine into concentrate will be the same no matter the price of their product. However, the revenue they receive is dependent on the market price of their product, which is what varies the most. An easy way to describe this is through taking a look at their Q3 2020 financial results presentation:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/s25.q4cdn.com\/570172628\/files\/doc\_financials\/2020\/q3\/MP-3Q20-Earnings-Deck-FINAL-11.23.2020.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/ijzcpgmc4f961.png?width=760&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d8bbfb1ba67f429886dc4abb6b6f1a9ef5862db1)

That value of Production cost (at the current stage of just creating REE concentrates) will realistically stay the same as that value is from the cost of labor, energy for machinery, administrative costs, etc. While these numbers will vary from quarter to quarter these are costs not predicted to experience rapid growth and this is what is important to realize. It costs roughly the same amount of money to pay someone to blast ore, dig it into dump trucks, pay operators to refine into ore, etc. Don't trust me, look into how steel companies operate, like this sub's favorite $MT. The revenue they receive is dependent on the price of REE's, which is NOT PREDICTED TO BE FLAT. Here is the historic graph of Neodymium from 2011-current:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/tradingeconomics.com\/commodity\/neodymium](https://preview.redd.it/q1ytv5ch4f961.png?width=1502&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6b5ddfa993ccb75cdf3638d13cbdf2748ccb7c9c)

\*\*If you are an investor in $MP (which you should be) this is an important website to pay attention to because understanding the market dynamics of their product is important to understanding the valuation of this company. \*\*

Allow me to disect that graph a little bit:

1st Peak: From the aftermath of the supply shock from 2010/2011 from the Japanese Navy and Chinese fisherman story i discusses in my previous $FVAC post i linked above. China lowered exports by 40% and the price shot up drastically as industries across the world tried to gobble up as much NdPr as fast as possible in order to ensure their production lines. That was then followed by china flooding the market and selling back that backlog. that caused prices to fall off a cliff and ended up taking molyorp out of business. I'll discuss the Molycorp saga later more in depth and the differences of them and $MP.

2nd Peak: This peak (late 2017) is from the Trade war trump caused with china and is another good explanation of the correlation between REE's and geopolitics i discussed in my last DD post. The middle 2019 peak is again the trade war heating up again.

3rd peak: where we are now. This is from the increased tailwind of EV adoption, more from asia and Europe than the US **and** because china has been threatening to use REE's as a political tool again, which again i referenced more in my last DD post.

However going forward if you want to predict the amount of revenue MP will earn its important to understand the market dynamic and I'd like to discuss why the price is geopolitics aside predicted to steadily increase at a very fast rate. MP, like any other commodity play, relies on the supply-demand dynamic of the sector, and REE demand growth is on track to far outstrip the supply growth. This will result increased prices per ton, but MP's costs stay the same. This is the beauty of the company, as the price goes up their margins go up too! MP and market analysts predicted over a 100% growth in NdPr magnets in the next 10 years:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/s25.q4cdn.com\/570172628\/files\/doc\_financials\/2020\/q3\/MP-3Q20-Earnings-Deck-FINAL-11.23.2020.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/v0ta2r1l4f961.png?width=872&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6281317204c497d54b7024e5208e7f04b8254db7)

Don't believe that metric? check this more in depth one:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.arultd.com\/products\/supply-and-demand.html](https://preview.redd.it/7kjnncgn4f961.jpg?width=6279&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=97e90f92aa1b996a80b0dacc02fb2ecc09086815)

This graph shows most important metric as it shows that the world at current rate is not scaling up to meet demand. THIS GRAPH INCLUDES CURRENT PLANNED EXPANSIONS INCLUDING INCREASED RECYCLING. What does this mean?? There is a huge mismatch in projected demand and supply and if you don't know what that will mean then ask your wife's boyfriend about supply-demand graphs from their economics class. The result will be massively increased prices of permanent magnet materials because the world will not be able to mine and refine enough to satisfy demand, so they will be able to increase their prices. BUT AS I SAID EARLIER, MP'S COSTS PER TON WILL REMAIN THE SAME. So what is the gist of this coupled with MP moving toward downstream expansion? MP's margins will increase incredibly from a double whammy of moving downstream AND supply-demand imbalance. Now what does that mean for you?? that means $MP has a very realistic and conservative path toward becoming a company with RIDICULOUS free cash flow.

What does that mean for MP? That means that the company will be raking in cash and will be extremely flexible due to their balance sheet. They will be able to expand operations or acquire competitors in order to increase their market share and production volumes OR they will be able to transition into a boomer dividend company that will pay you tendies each year. They could do either of those very easily because the company HAS NO DEBT. In fact, $MP ended Q3 2020 with $507M CASH on hand to finance their future expansions. Okay, i know dividends are boring but the market will begin to price in that future dividend potential and give your calls many tendies along the path to pricing in their dividend power.

**TLDR**: Supply demand imbalance (with geopolitical tensions as a wild card) will result in insane free cash flow in the future for this company.

**TLDR of the TLDR**: People want more special rock more than can make special rock. People give you more tendies for special rocks.

# Why Supply won't be able to scale up as fast

A very important assumption in my analysis is the inability for supply to scale up as fast as demand and I'd like to explain this more in depth as it is the crux of this DD. This is where my experience in mineral refining is valuable as I can weigh in on this aspect. Over time there will be more suppliers that come into the business and we are seeing that already, however this is where the timetables of that come into play. Simply put supply can't go up because companies will be slowed greatly due to the time it will take to get up and running and the incredible amount of upfront capital needed before even starting up the mine. If a company is interested in getting into the field there isn't a fast path in because the companies can't just decide to go into the business and then go to the ""REE refining machinery store"" and buy the equipment and have them get set up. All the machinery in chemical manufacturing plants (REE refining counts as chemical engineering so hear me out) has a long path in order to reach the optimum design. Ill outline the gist of this here:

1. Lab Scale Testing: This is laboratory scale testing in which very small batches are prepared testing different procedures and methods in order to find the optimum refining process for the goals of the operation. This is when the deciding of the catalysts, solvents, additive chemicals, etc is done in order to decide **what to do** to the ore to get the best product.
2. Pilot Plant Design and Testing: This step in the design process is designing and building a small scale model of machinery to run the process decided upon in lab scale testing in order to determine different operating conditions, determine control points, etc. This is when different tests and procedures are determined and also a proof of concept to begin economic calculations for designing the next step.
3. Full scale design and building: This is when the full size, real-deal machinery is designed and constructed. But again, there is not ""REE refining manufacturing store"" to get much of this machinery. Refining plants are custom designed (minus certain machinery like pumps and basic ass shit like that) and custom built. These are custom designed, custom fabricated large scale machinery designed in every aspect from material, area, volume, and depth in order to lower manufacturing costs while also allowing for 24/7 continuous operation. The 24/7 operation aspect is important because it is why the machinery is designed so meticulously. The most economic operations are ones that require little down time and little maintenance and a lot of work is put in to optimize this aspect. That means it takes even more time to produce.
4. Permitting and Certification: Now at this point the company is years into the development of REE refining, but they still can't start operating despite the entire operation up and running. In the US, now the lovely and very fast government gets to come in. Mining and refining operations don't operate under OSHA rules and procedures, they get to operate under OSHA's much meaner, expensive, and safety prone brother, the Mining Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). Government inspectors have to come in and permit and certify EVERY PIECE OF MACHINERY, inspect every single moving part and permit them, and do a shit ton of other stuff for the government to allow you to begin operations. Now due to the stimulus bill's provisions toward stimulating REE capabilities in the United states I assume that MSHA will be (or already has been) told to prioritize REE companies and they will probably be fast tracked, but even fast tracking them will take a lot of time. In addition EPA has to come in and sign off on the environmental plans of the company and probably even more government entities will have to come in to sign off on stuff that was past my exposure when I interned in the field.

Now you've seen how long it would take to get up and running, but another constraint worth mentioning is who does these? Larger Chemical or mining companies (Dow, DuPont, Chemours, BASF, etc) looking to enter the field probably have their own design teams that would be able to do it in house. Smaller, non-conglomerate entities would have to hire a chemical engineering design/consulting firm to come in and do the designing, write the procedures, and train the production engineers and operators. That means there is some decent intellectual constraints as to how many people have the know-how to design at the rate needed to scale up.

**Here is what is important,** any entity trying to enter the sector will have enormous upfront costs in buying the land, designing the plant, buying the machinery like excavators, dump trucks, pipelines, pay employees well before starting due to training on the machinery. Im not sure the exact amounts of money needed but it would easily be in the 100s of millions at least. Then once all that upfront capital is sourced, plant designed, people trained, etc the operation would take YEARS to get out of all that debt and achieve meaningful positive cash flow. It is only a matter of time for $MP to have significant domestic competition, but by the time these operations could begin operating $MP will be so far ahead in production and have a significantly stronger balance sheet than these companies could have. **$MP will remain years ahead of any other domestic competitors**, even though competition will come.

**TLDR**: At current outlook supply growth won't match demand growth and even if more competitors pop up to compete it'll take years to start operating and even more years to match $MP's ability.

**TLDR on the TLDR**: Not enough people finding special rock. More people want special rock than can get special rock. They pay more for special rock.

# $MP's competitors, both domestic and international

A large argument that bears like to make is that competition is coming in the US, and they are 100% correct.... but it won't matter because AGAIN this is a commodity play, not a tech company. They make magnets, their revenue will depend on the price of their product. Buyers from this are not looking at $MP like you would look at $TSLA vs. $NIO or apple vs android where you could argue one is better than the other or consumers will adopt one over the other. There isn't brand recognition, increased utility, or consumer favorites in magnets, they're fucking magnets. Think about it like another commodity, lumber. If you go to $HD to buy some wood you aren't staring at two different planks of the same type of tree and picking one because of which timber company felled it or which milling company milled it. You just buy lumber and go home because it is wood. A timber company isn't outright threatened by another timber company popping up, as long as the demand-supply dynamic in the market stays the same the first timber company is unaffected. That is why it won't matter WHEN more domestic and international competitors pop up. As long as demand outstrips supply then commodity companies will make more and more money. Now I am not trying to bullshit people so I'll discuss the international and domestic competition, but Ill explain more in depth why i don't give a shit about them.

Domestic: The ticker that cannot be named due to it being banned. If you take a look at that company it is a Uranium producer that is going to re-purpose machinery onsite from uranium production to REE production and they have successfully done pilot plant level processing. However if you analyze their production numbers you'll see that the scale they plan on producing is not quite at the level $MP will. They plan on refining 15,000 tons of ore per year with an estimated 55% REE concentration, which leaves an estimated 8,250 tons of REE per year, of which 22% is NdP (all their numbers not mine), which leaves annual production of 1,815 tons/yr. These numbers are pretty good and I do own a stake in this company because I like the potential, but its scale is not quite the scale of $MP. $MP is predicting a run rate of 6,075 tons/yr of NdPr, so yes the banned ticker is a decent competitor but its only predicting to be 1/3 the size of $MP annual production volume. A downside of the banned ticker is that they still are focusing on Uranium production so its not a pure REE play, but Uranium has a pretty decent bull case for the future so i don't want to slander that ticker too much. However, again, these are commodity plays, $MP having competition, even domestic, doest really affect their business plans or bull case. Additionally, the banned ticker is sourcing its ore rom Chemours' location in GA, but getting milled in Utah, so this is a long term inefficiency to consider as well that $MP won't have to worry about once their stage 2 REO mill is complete. the banned tickers financial health is pretty decent, but its market cap is $516M at close 1/4 which is just slightly above amount of cash on hand $MP had at the end of Q3 2020, $502M. That company is more of an investment opportunity than a competitor, if its even worth investing in.

Other emerging domestic competitors: [link to article explaining them all](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-rareearths-projects-factbox/factbox-rare-earths-projects-under-development-in-u-s-idUSKCN2241L6) Im not going to go deep into each one but you can see that many are slowed down to the process I explained above about how expensive and time consuming it is to reach operational status. These companies will be coming online, but won't be profitable for a while and won't be able to provide the same returns to investors for even longer.

International competitors: Lynas Corp. This is an Australian mining company that has also received pentagon funds to improve the non-China production capacity. They trade over the counter and are a real deal competitor and also worth investing in but their growth potential isn't as clear or easy as in the US. They have pentagon funding more so out of desperation by the pentagon to get more production in the western world than loving to invest in an Australian company. In the future I would imagine a lot of this government support will go toward US based companies.

International competitors: all the china ones. yes they produce the largest amount of material in the world and do it the cheapest but this is the result of none to very little environmental protection. Once the supply chain can go ""mine to magnet"" many companies will look to diminish their exposure to chinese companies to ensure their supply chains are not at the whims of the Chinese government. In addition, $MP is the cleanest REE mine in the world and a lot of environmentally conscious companies will want to support clean mined REE's and once domestic production is high enough there could be regulations passed to further incentivize purchasing domestically produced REE's.

**All these companies were included in the forecast of supply in 2030. Even with these companies coming online $MP is still positioned for incredible returns.**

**TLDR**: Yes competition is coming, but there is already competition. Its also a commodity play so its not facing replacement or redundancy like many other growth markets

**TLDR on the TLDR**: Others find special rock. Your special rock still worth many tendies. You still get many tendies.

# Why this is NOT molycorp 2.0

The most common point of argument against this company is that people bring up the fact that the mine $MP operates used to be run by Molycorp, which went bankrupt. However if you read into that transaction it really isn't that scary. Molycorp did go under but this was in a period of price instability and they were not running as good of an operation. Molycorp operated during the 2010-2011 peak of REE's when china restricted supply. Molycorp stock went up a ton in addition to their revenue and thus they decided to invest in milling capabilities to create REO's (I know this is $MP's plan but don't get scared yet). Because of US EPA restrictions it was wildly expensive and at bankruptcy they had $1.7B in investments into capital projects to improve their refining capability, but the subsequent REE price collapse when china ""turned the taps back on"" to the world supply caused them to not afford operation. The site then changed hands back and forth until it was [bought by $MP's current management for $40M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molycorp). They then invested in it after literally buying for less than pennies on the dollar and got it up and running more efficiently than before. Last quarter Q3 2020 they ran 3.2x the REE concentrate production volume than Molycorp ever did:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/s25.q4cdn.com\/570172628\/files\/doc\_financials\/2020\/q3\/MP-3Q20-Earnings-Deck-FINAL-11.23.2020.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/c53c5a8w4f961.png?width=704&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5a5d9f65cad202807588fe516b399ca954cef08a)

They got to buy over $1.7B worth of investments for $40M and have proven they have turned those investments into operating profit. In addition, previous operations prioritized Cerium production for FCC catalysts. $MP has transitioned the goal product to be NdPr as it has much better growth potential to give it long term possibility. In addition, the market climate Molycorp operated under was not as forgiving as now. Back then there wasn't the tailwind of increasing EV adoption, or the rise of other high tech growth sector reliant on REE's. Molycorp was too early and inefficient to win in the market and didn't have anywhere close to the amount of governmental support for the industry. There is bipartisan support on all levels, i mentioned this a bit in my last DD post, but since then - and this is big and shows the scale of gov support- [THE LAST STIMULUS BILL HAD $800M IN SUPPORT OF INCREASING DOMESTIC REE PRODUCTION](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/miners-laud-800m-rare-earth-fund-in-omnibus-bill-61939620)! Molycorp didn't have anywhere close to this level of government support. And again, the pentagon invested $9M into $MP to help fund their REO mill because the pentagon views the ability to refine REO's as a matter of national security.

# Discussing Concerns about Biden Presidency

People who say this shit clearly have no idea what they are talking about. Biden (or his puppet masters but who cares money is all green) has said he supports REE mining multiple times [source](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-mining/exclusive-biden-campaign-tells-miners-it-supports-domestic-production-of-ev-metals-idUSKBN27808B). His team knows their big environmental initiatives rely on REE production and that domestic production is important to keep American industry at the whims of China. Yeah Trump was more hawkish with china but lets not act like a democratic presidency is going to let china walk all over the US or that Biden and other democrats will stop their push for EV's and clean energy. REE's are a cornerstone piece to so many of Biden's plans there is no way he turns his back on this company.

# Discussion of Shenghe Resources and China and their relationships with $MP

The one real concern that people have is their partnership with Shenghe Resources where Shenghe has agreed to buy all $MP concentrate through 2021 and shenghe is a stakeholder in $MP. Many view this as a negative, but i think it should be seen as a good way to ensure survival in the gap between now and the final magnet production. A big issue would be if China chose to stop importing the MP concentrate, which would give MP no customers. Since this would adversely affect Shenge it makes it less likely and also the fact that MP produces 15% of the world's REE concentrate it would hurt the supply in china, which is huge. In fact, China removed their 25% tariff on importing REE material, read this [source](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2104418-china-to-remove-import-tariff-on-us-rare-earth-ores) as it also shows how china is buying up all the concentrate they can. Japan has the capability to go from REO to NdPr magnet as well so if china ends up fucking MP, starting in 2022 when their REO site is in operation then they will be able to sell their REO to Japanese companies to bridge the gap before they have their own magnet making capability.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/s25.q4cdn.com\/570172628\/files\/doc\_financials\/2020\/q3\/MP-3Q20-Earnings-Deck-FINAL-11.23.2020.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/fnvxv8415f961.png?width=2494&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=67a5db04a13d3e1c32d0f20de57b0f291e5b841a)

China is not likely to fuck MP and stop buying their concentrate as it will hurt china's wallet and ability to produce goods while only increasing the US government support for going mine to magnet domestically. China realistically views their dominance as ending at some point now, but they know they will still be able to control the market because of their scale regardless of whether they buy MP concentrates or not.

Also, if Shenghe doesn't buy their concentrates then they forfeit their stake in MP. they wouldn't be allowed to sell them on the market, the shares would just disappear, so it would effectively be a massive stock buyback and as long as the REO mill is complete then they just sell to Japanese magnet makers.

# Mine Life discussion

Their S-1 states that at current proven reserves they have about 47 years of mine life left. That can be grown from drilling and exploration of more mineable material, which they stated they plan on doing. in addition, if they for some reason don't find more mineable ore on their land and don't buy more land with ore, then they could simply refine ore from other mines as the real cost barrier isn't the digging out of the ground, it is the milling.

# TLDR

$MP will to the moon over the next few years.

Postions: shares for virgins and LEAPs for chads.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Edit: addressing $QS collapse today (1/4 after a -40% on $QS) and the associated EV infrastructure. I think $QS hitting the shitter, well, predictable. People flooded to it as a result of attempting to find a parallel way to play the rise of EV's without understanding the company. $QS is a solid state battery technology, but I have never held a stake in it because, well, all it is is an idea or concept. It fell today as a result of a report criticizing the basis of its technology and I have to agree, the tech is not proven and even if it works as advertised there is a question of whether it could ever solidify its valuation, even after its collapse today. Solid state batteries MAY be the future, but for now their real place is in university and R&amp;amp;D laboratories as the tech is not proven to work as advertised. They are in the same situation as liquid metal batteries, cool ideas without the proof they will be successful in the market. HOWEVER, $MP is a way to play EV's &amp;amp; Renewable energy without the risk because $MP is not relying on scientific breakthroughs, it is a commodity producer. They don't care who wins the EV race, the battery tech or company that wins the battery race, or the wind energy companies that win contracts, all they care about is the mass adoption fo those technologies. It is a unique way to play these trends without having to bet on winners or losers in the field as you're betting solely on the industry. The company is positioned to benefit greatly regardless of who wins and lets be real, the market is incredibly saturated with companies that won't win. Look at all the different EV makers big and small, the different battery companies, etc. I have a tough believing that all the small EV makers will have a shot when the large auto companies get more involved. I believe the best way to see profit without that risk is through symmetrical bets with no breakthroughs needed, just the market to develop

EDIT 2: Further DD/ another take. Yeah maybe 1 person will actually read it but it’s a lot shorter than mine, really won’t take long to read the thread. It is not my DD but rather an obscure Twitter account I have no connection to but they bring up further interesting bull arguments and address current valuation better than I can. I have no finance background so I didn’t try to pin a price or movement. https://twitter.com/dawn_capital/status/1346134740659818496?s=21

Edit 3: Research report from brand essence research estimates that REE market size is expected to reach $20.6 Billion by 2025, significantly higher the the 11 billion size from 2019 with a CAGR of 8.2%. MP currently produces 15% of the ore in the world and in 2022 is expected to be milling REO. Let’s say global production does increase and $MP doesn’t expand out and falls to 10% of global supply. That’s still about $2 Billion in revenue with higher margins than they operate on right now because of REO production.... it’s a tendie mine🚀🚀🚀

kqmzgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqmzgu/romeo_power_january_4_2021_stock_analysis/,Romeo Power - January 4 2021 stock analysis,63,16,2021-01-05 09:13:48,"Update 23 February 2021: The fundamentals of RMO have, in my view, deteriorated significantly since the below post. This includes (1) BoggWarner, a JV Partner of Romeo having invested in a competitor to Romeo, (2) recent news that USPS has not selected Workhorse as its supplier (Workhorse is a customer of Romeo and which forms part of the contracted revenue previously publicised by Romeo) and (3) Romeo having partnered with a battery technology developer (which indicates to me that Romeo sees its current product as not meeting current or future demand and that Romeo does not have the capability to develop this tech in house, despite having raised over $200m in its SPAC offering recently. That is extremely concerning to me).

This is my personal view and is not investment advice. 

I am not put off by today's stock price drop as the fundamentals of Romeo have improved compared to yesterday and the cheaper stock is a good buying opportunity for anyone who wants to get in below $20 per share. DD below. 

Today's price drop was driven by a conflation of macro economic factors unrelated to Romeo, namely: 


1. There was a broad market sell off today. 80% of S&P 500 companies lost value. This was due to more restrictive COVID restrictions in North America and Europe. 


2. On negative market news (above), investors take their money out of riskier stocks first, less risky stocks last. Romeo is a riskier stock because its a relatively new company (founded in 2016) and a small company (less than $1bn market cap), so naturally more investors will flee Romeo versus say, Apple or Tesla. 


3. The EV sector (and SPACs generally) exploded in q4 2020. It's natural for air to come out of a balloon that's been inflated so dramatically and rapidly as investors will be taking their profits. 


4. A report came out today casting doubt on the promise of QuantumScape's solid state technology. This caused QS stock to drop dramatically. Since QS is the poster child of the EV/SPAC bubble, short term investors get scared off of the sector as a whole and flee other EV stocks (not just QS). 


5. The conflation of factors above results in significant selling pressure, causing the stock price to dip significantly. After this initial (2%) price fall, day traders who are overleveraged face margin calls and are forced to sell. This causes the price to drop even more dramatically. This price drop - margin call pattern is a self reinforcing cycle which results in a large price drop on the day.

Despite the above, I am confident Romeo Power is currently undervalued at $20 per share, because:

6. Romeo is one of the only EV sector players with a product - and it even has revenue already. Prior to today the company had over $500 million in committed revenue (2021 to 2025). 

7. Today Romeo signed a supply contract with Heritage Power, which is additional committed revenue on top of the $500 million.

8. On 31 December 2020, Lion Electric disclosed that Amazon agreed to purchase from Lion Electric up to 2,500 electric busses. Romeo is the battery supplier for Lion Electric, so this Amazon deal de-risks the committed revenue Romeo has from Lion Electric. Lion Electric has also found a SPAC partner which will provide the necessary funding to manufacture the busses.

9. Even better, Amazon's contract with Lion Electric includes an option for Amazon to purchase up to a 20 per cent stake in Lion Power. If Amazon exercises this option, Lion Electric will be a force to be reckoned with in the electric Class 8 commercial vehicle market - in which Romeo is the market leader - which bodes incredibly well for Romeo long term.

Therefore, I am not put off by today's stock price drop as the fundamentals of Romeo have improved compared to yesterday and the cheaper stock is a good buying opportunity for anyone who wants to get in below $20 per share. BTIG analysts have set a price target of $40 for Romeo (not factoring in the latest positive developments set out above).

kqm99s,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqm99s/shorting_intel_dd/,Shorting Intel (DD),55,77,2021-01-05 08:35:34,"I'm in tech and I have good news if you like money. Shorting Intel is too obvious. It's like banging an instagram model for free.

**Why Intel is doomed**

Intel have missed their own deadlines for delivering newer manufacturing methods and their CPUs are falling behind AMD in terms of cost and performance for a while. That is not the news. The stock is already hit by AMD performance. Intel is doomed because our industry is moving to Arm. Arm processors are performing way better at a fraction of cost. See [this report](https://www.anandtech.com/show/15578/cloud-clash-amazon-graviton2-arm-against-intel-and-amd/9) if you're not convinced. What I'm seeing in the industry is that a lot of cloud computing customers are finding it super easy to switch to Arm. Developer computers are mostly Macs and the M1 Macs are just the tip of the iceberg on what's going to happen. Once developers can easily develop on Arm machines, they most likely will deploy their code to an Arm cloud server. Amazon's AWS Graviton is performing well enough to switch.

**Microsoft will kill Intel**

Apple is doing their part with M1 and Amazon is balls deep with their Arm chips but what makes a huge difference is Microsoft's energy for fucking intel in the ass by making Windows Arm friendly and pulling a fast one on Intel by developing their own chips.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**

Amazon, Apple and Microsoft are going to gang bang Intel's wife. Short this stock if you like free money

The goal of this analysis is to see if the 'smart money' is worth following or if they are just as good or maybe even worse than retail.

The criteria for this analysis is option purchases where the total premium is over $100,000. This helps me filter out the noise created by some of the larger retail traders. Additionally, I removed contracts where the expiration was last week as I think it will be more interesting to follow contracts that have a future expiration. This left me with a total of 735 positions entered between 12/23 - 12/30 where the premium was over $100,000. My data is collected over multiple sources and I do my best to make sure there is no redundant or false information.

The Columns to pay attention too:

* EXP: Expiration of the contracts
* Strike: Strike Price where the contract can be bought if it is exercised
* Option Price: How much premium paid per contract
* Premium Paid: Total amount spent (option price x quantity)

# Call Flow

[Call Flow](https://preview.redd.it/asn0bkz3de961.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=3365d254c4a27fe89e48f04324a8f46666459e5f)

To start I looked at call option flow. To simplify things I looked at the top 25 option call flows based on premium. Its worth noticing how many times TESLA is on the above list (8/25). Beside TSLA none of the call flow is really so reaching and for the most part pretty safe. The tickers in the above list are 'XPEV', 'CRM', 'TSLA', 'NKE', 'BABA', 'GM', 'PINS', 'BIDU', 'ZM', 'EEM', 'PLNT', 'MSFT', 'EBAY', 'SPX', 'MA', and 'DIS'.

# Put Flow

[Put Flow](https://preview.redd.it/ncsrdwq6de961.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=012a637965c0b17d98d990119d052ec22933efeb)

Some worth paying attention to on the above list are the SPY 2/19/21 354 Puts, QS 2/19/2021 80 Puts, CDLX 4/16/2021 PUTS as these expire relatively soon and would require a decent pull back to end In The Money. The tickers in the above list are 'PLUG', 'AAPL', 'SPY', 'ARKK', 'IWM', 'UAL', 'QS',  'LMND', 'CDLX', 'OLLI', 'GLD', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'QQQ', 'TAN'.

# Target Flow

The targeted option flow is calculated based on specific criteria I have used to trade over the last year. I call it Targeted Flow because this is typically where I find the best results. Essentially it is a mixture of volume, open interest, premium, expiration date and % move required. Interestingly out of all the options flow my algorithm picked up between 12/23 and 12/31 all of the ""Targeted Flow"" was Calls. As you can see all of the EXP below are for 1/15/2021 meaning the option flow buyers expect a big upwards move quickly.

&#x200B;

[Targeted Flow](https://preview.redd.it/040n3avbde961.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7b98cbe2929d39c27a068f58ed8a5f6a73feeb7)

Once again 8/25 Targeted Flows are TSLA. This really shouldn't be surprising, but I am amazed at how truly bullish TSLA is. Contracts on this list that I think are worth investigating are CSIQ, GSX, IQ, TSM and FDX, but do what you wish with this information. One thing that stands out to me in this Target Flow is that 69/69 of the option flow my algo picked up were all calls (as I said above). Typically when the market is leaning so far in one direction the opposite happens so it will be real interesting to see how the next two weeks play out. Based on how today is going I think we see lower over the next two weeks into the 1/15/21 exp.

Just for fun here is the TSLA call flow with over $100,000,000 in premium.... CRAZY

Once the narrative stuck that it’s a “tech” company, BAM, valuation goes up $550B. And please don’t be an autist and say something retarded like “if Tesla is a car company then Apple is a phone company”. Yes, over 50% of apples revenue is from phones, but they also have huge revenue segments in Mac, IPad, Audio, Services, etc. So, if Apples revenue was 90% phones then yes that statement would be true, buts it’s not so please don’t try and justify it with that stupid brainwashing comment (which I know someone will post in the comments and get 1k upvotes). 

Now, Tesla is a phenomenal company with a visionary leader, don’t get me wrong - but they are being priced like the next Amazon. One slip up and they will tumble - or if they can’t find that one thing that will essentially print money for them (Apple iPhone, Google ads, Microsoft Azure, Amazon web services), then valuation will get cut in half. The first 6x months will be about value stocks, and I predict Tesla hits $500 before it hits $900. I think this year makes millionaires first from Tesla puts, then calls in the second half of the year. 

The only thing I can think of that makes this not happen is the amount of cash they have on hand from selling more shares. That amount of money is dangerous in the hands of Elon. But let’s see what happens - I think puts are the way to go early on, could net some new millionaires."

Some of you might be afraid because the stock is overvalued and the lockup period is coming and this and that. **I'm just going to point out something ABSOLUTELY critical:**

&#x200B;

**Snowflake** (NYSE:SNOW)

PS Ratio: 162

**IPO**

**C3.AI** (NYSE:AI)

PS Ratio: 81.96

**IPO**

**U** (NYSE:U)

PS Ratio: 81.96

**IPO**

&#x200B;

And our dear Palantir has:

PS ratio: 44.23

Launched into the market as a: **DPO**

And what is everybody saying about PLTR? No, the stock is extremely overvalued, shorted by citron and bla bla bla. You wanna know why the first two are not being shorted? Their price targets not lowered? Yeah, because they were launched as IPO by the big banks. Almost nobody is saying shit about SNOW, even though the company is astronomically overvalued. That stock is covered in ointment made from JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and every other major bank. Because well, they don't like getting a cold shoulder and have it IN for PLTR.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**: You are betting on a company that will be worth at least X30 times what is worth now.  Give it time, stop being a crybaby or a paper hand MF.

&#x200B;

PS. Remmember papa Karp will be giving a talk on Jan 7.

# **Politics will be front and center as a catalyst in the first week of the new year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/politics-will-be-front-and-center-as-a-catalyst-in-the-first-week-of-the-new-year-.html)**
*****
> Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind, but already in the dawn of the new year, the market could face its first big challenge.
*****
> The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday, when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.
*****
> With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.
*****
> The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.
*****
> “Georgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,” said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. “It’s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.”
*****
> Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.
*****
> “It’s a binary event,” said Mills, adding it’s of growing interest to markets. “The general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us … The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.”
*****
> Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.
*****
> “The market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.
*****
> “That totally dominates [trading] because it’s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,” Boockvar said. “I think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending” by Democrats.
*****
> # By the numbers
> A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.
*****
> Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.
*****
> There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.
*****
> The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.
*****
> Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump’s task force.
*****
> In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. “We suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,” RBC strategists wrote.
*****
> They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.
*****
> “This suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,” the strategists noted.
*****
> Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden’s presidency.
*****
> However, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says he will challenge the certification, and several House Republicans have already vowed to contest the election at that time. If one House member and a senator jointly object to a state’s slate of electors, the two houses of Congress must separately debate and vote on the objection.
*****
> Strategists see little chance of any impact on the election outcome, but there could be fireworks. Trump has been claiming since the election that there was fraud but multiple courts failed to find any truth to the claims.
*****
> Rupkey said investors are not taking into account enough potential for political risk from the deep animosity between the two political parties.
*****
> “I think the additional stimulus and hopes for additional stimulus, and infrastructure spending in 2021, I don’t know that that is such a slam dunk, because of the issue of political instability,” he said.

> # Why A Year-End Rally Bodes Well For 2021

> Welcome to the last day of 2020! It has been a devastating year in so many ways, yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.

> A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. “Turns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.

> # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days

> In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**

> The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.

> # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology

> With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!

> In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**

> Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.

> On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.

> # Growth Dragging on Small Caps

> In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocks—proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)—are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**

> As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**

> As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**

> Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market. While there was a bit of a turn lower in recent days, it has been nowhere close to as dramatic of a move as growth stocks.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large4.png))**

> In the charts below, we show average performance over the past week of Russell 2000 stocks broken into deciles based on their price to sales and price to book ratios. As shown, the most aggressively valued deciles have averaged the worst performance in the past week. Stocks with low P/S and P/B ratios have not been immune from the weakness, but they have held up significantly better.

koonr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/koonr3/i_think_wsb_is_sleeping_on_a_huge_opportunity_in/,I think WSB is sleeping on a huge opportunity in Apple this month. Here’s why.,760,287,2021-01-02 10:17:47,"**TLDR:** Due to a confluence of factors (none of which are technical analysis), I believe a perfect storm is likely forming for a monster, historic ER occurring sometime in late January. The initial main factor for this was that COVID issues were causing a delay in the iPhone 12 launch, pushing it into to this quarter, but that led me to discover numerous other factors now making up my thesis. I believe not only will earnings grow, but the multiple could even expand. How to play it: calls dated end of Jan or mid Feb.    
    
# Analysis:    
Happy hangover day, fellow autists. I believe opportunities are rare to know when an ER is going to blow it out of the water by enough to overcome IV crush based on more than just a hunch, and when they occur once or twice per year you should swing big. When I play earnings releases, I’m almost always just a seller of spreads so that I can profit off of theta/IV crush surrounding the ER (theta gang always wins). This time however, I’ve bought outright calls. Here is what I’m seeing with Apple: 
    
## The iPhone 12 delay could mean huge YoY comparisons.    
What kicked all this off was that two months ago I realized we could be heading for huge numbers this quarter due to an atypical delay in the launch of the newest iPhone. Typically new iPhones are announced in mid-September with preorders beginning immediately and shipments beginning before the end of the month. However this year because of COIVD delays the launch date got pushed into October. The iPhone 12 preorders began mid-October with shipments a week later, and the iPhone 12 mini and Max began preorders November 6. And that means no sales of the new models counted in the quarter ended Sept. 30 (Apple’s fiscal fourth quarter)as they usually do. This year all of those opening day sales have fallen into the upcoming fiscal Q1, setting up a potentially huge quarter in sales and making for easy YoY comparisons right out of the gate.  [Here’s a Fortune article on the delay of the launch.](https://fortune.com/2020/10/29/apple-q4-2020-earnings-delayed-iphone-12-sales/)    
    
## The “super cycle” rumors appear to be true.    
As a lover of new tech, I always have to remind myself that the average person doesn’t care about incremental new features as much as I do. So when I heard rumors earlier this year that Apple could be facing a “super cycle” of upgrades due to 5G, I was skeptical. How much does the average person really care about spotty 5G service enough to jump on a new iPhone? But based on reports starting to come out, those rumors appear to be correct. I’ve seen a few articles suggesting a super cycle not seen since the iPhone 6.     
    
[Here’s a Yahoo Finance article on Wedbush’s analysis](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wedbush-apple-aapl-iphone-12-141113883.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACvsQ8XuWl-EktMyc_0BOQkervx-N2812THmBzr26X8EZIBpNv2lmQ5FSlcToQD1EVRPC0q6byIRBL57FjX5kL4yCvJbv0rwaj4D16cz9J0QrnLFX9fVib7fRoDktDyMAWwBKhfTL_JRqy04wsJCzfTUD7Aw9ce6SkM21ZQOqbYO).   
    
Here are some notable quotes from that article since I know we don’t read around here.    
>""Based on our recent Asia checks we believe the supply chain is anticipating low to mid 90 million iPhone unit builds … **a roughly 35% increase from our original and Street forecasts**,"" says Ives, who covers AAPL stock for Wedbush.    
    
>Compare that to the firm's expectations for iPhone 12 unit sales over time. Three months ago, Wedbush expected 65 million to 70 million unit builds for the December quarter; it raised its outlook to 75 million units in late October; and in mid-December, it set a ""stretch goal"" in the mid-80 million range.    
    
>Wall Street broadly sees AAPL selling 217 million iPhones in the company's fiscal 2021, but Wedbush's bull case is ""north of 240 million units (250 million could be in the cards – an eye popping figure)"" that would easily surpass the 231 million units the company sold in its fiscal 2015.    
    
>**""We have not seen a launch uptrend such as this in a number of years for Apple and the only iPhone trajectory similar would be the iPhone 6 in 2014 based on our analysis.""**.   
    
[Here is an AppleInsider article, although it quotes the same research at Wedbush](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/15/apple-iphone-production-reports-corroborate-supercycle-thesis-analyst-says).   
Notable quote:    
> That bump in production would represent a 30% year-over-year increase in smartphone models produced, **and is also well ahead of current Wall Street expectations**, Ives wrote.    
    
    
It’s anecdotal, but I personally skipped the iPhone 11 upgrade because I was perfectly content with my XS Max, however I did buy the 12 Pro Max.    
    
## The iPhone 12 sales mix:   
It’s not just that phone sales will be up on the iphone 12 launch, it’s the mix within those sales. Typically when Apple launches phones they sell more of the of the entry level new phones than they do the premium, because the total addressable market is bigger. That doesn’t appear to be the case this time. As early as September people were reporting that [Apple was making more higher end iPhone 12 models than entry-level handsets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-gets-price-target-hike-iphone-12-sales-mix) anticipating a shift in demand, and they appear to have been correct. Last year the entry level iPhone 11s outsold the premium iPhone 11s by a three to one margin. This year almost immediately after launch [people were reporting that the premium iPhone 12s were selling as much as the entry models.](https://investorplace.com/2020/10/greater-than-expected-iphone-12-demand-apple-aapl-stock-buy/) Since then, there have been reports trickling out that the premium iPhone 12s appear to actually be outselling the entry level versions.   
    
## Apple sold out of nearly everything they make for Christmas.
See further below for one of the reasons this may have happened, in both my “macro” and “risks” sections.    
    
    

Apple introduced a slough of new products from iMacs to watches this year, and they sold out of all of them. **The list of sold-out products at Christmas included the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max; iPad, iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad Mini; MacBook Air and Pro; iMac and iMac Pro; HomePod mini, and AirPods Max.** [Here’s a Barron’s article mentioning the sell outs](https://www.barrons.com/articles/barrons-10-best-stocks-for-2021-51608337138).    

    
    
Apple wearables, I would argue, are now what economists call Veblen goods. These are unique products where the demand curve actually increases as the price increases. This can happen in goods such as wine, where the consumer lacks the knowledge in how to evaluate the product so they take pricing as a signal of quality. But another reason you can get that skewed demand curve is if the product conveys status. One example of this is sports cars. You can buy cars with 90% of the performance of the ultra top end cars for 30% of the price, but that’s not the point of owning them, is it? How often are you really out at the track? Lambo isn’t in competition with $50k sports cars. They could raise the price $50k per car and people who can afford them would just want them more. Louis Vuitton bags and $50,000 Birkin purses are more examples. In fact with Birkin they not only constantly raise prices, they forbid people from buying them. You have to spend a lot of money on other lower tier products before you’re “allowed” to even buy a Birkin bag. This just makes new money women want them even more. 
   

Those are dramatic examples of course and Apple isn’t behaving that way, but Apple just introduced very overpriced, new over-the-ear headphones which cost almost twice as much as the leading competitor, and yet...Apple sold out of every single color in the first two weeks and hit a three month waiting list by Christmas on a product that I would assume due to its high pricing has very fat margins. Apple charging twice as much makes them more appealing, not less, because wearables are worn and thus seen by your peers (and the opposite sex).   
    
## The Twitter rumor mill is reporting parts moving at a brisk pace
I can’t track down the things I’ve read here and there on Twitter and I’m starting to run out of steam here, so you may have to do some searching on your own, but people who usually track movement of parts through the companies forming Apple’s supply chain and normally have a good track record with their reports have reported that parts are moving through the chain at a very brisk pace. This is addressed some in the reports on the iPhone supply chain in my earlier links.    
    
## App sales are crushing it.   
Thanks probably in part to quarantine, app sales have been crushing it and [grew ~35% this December compared to ~17%](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-alphabet-strong-christmas-sales) the prior year, meaning sales have grown at twice the pace.     

## Reoccurring revenue bundle numbers will be announced     
The biggest thing I’ve learned from 2020 is that nothing matters more to the market than the narrative surrounding the reoccurring revenue bundle...aka subscriptions. A company announces its cutting its dividend, but then tells you that’s because its going to pour all that money into boosting its subscriptions? The stock skyrockets. Look at Disney. ATT may be able to pull this off as well if it can convince people of that narrative with Warner/HBO max and cut its dividend to pour it into content, but that’s a big “if” for them.    
    
Apple launched their new reoccurring revenue bundle this year. I personally signed up for the premium tier and now owe Apple $30 per month for the rest of my life. I was already paying them to backup my phone to the cloud, and now their bundle has thrown me into Apple Music, Apple TV+, etc. I am firmly entrenched in the Apple universe whether I like it or not.     
    
It is these reoccurring revenue numbers that offer the possibility of earnings multiple expansion.
    
# RISKS
**Are sellouts due to high demand, or due to COVID-related production problems?**    
I don’t know.  Based on the reports I’ve read, some of which have been linked earlier in my post, it sounds like everything is running full speed in China and the supply chain is running at near or above a record clip. One possible risk is that this was not the case earlier this year and thus Apple sold out of things because they hadn’t produced enough heading into Christmas. I personally believe that production may have taken a huge hit early in the calendar year, but by mid to late 2020 this was no longer a significant issue. I also believe that even if sales have taken a slight hit due to production, the market wouldn’t really care. Markets are forward looking. They know COVID has impacted things globally, and even if Apple reports sales difficulties **they will be paired with significantly increased guidance for Q2**. [New reports have suggested that Apple has had to increase its iPhone production plans for 2021 by 20-30% because of strong demand](https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/15/strong-iphone-12-demand/) An announcement like that is not a recipe for a stock crash.     
    
    

**Macro factors causing a crash**.    
A lot of people around here appear to be scared of an impending crash. This seems to be based on the simple idea that stocks have run up a lot and therefore must crash. A reversion to the mean is imminent. I don’t see it that way and I think the economy is more complex than that. Just because something has gone up a lot does not mean it’s going to crash. People have been warning of a California real estate crash for 70 years.    
    

I’m a little bit older than you guys (by probably about 10-15 years) and I can remember the market frenzy of the dot.com boom. A lot of people were saying the same thing then, and while they were ultimately proven right, they were very early. I remember seeing another year to year and a half of enormous gains after hearing all those warnings. Of course the problem with musical chairs is that we never know when the music will stop, but I would argue if anything stocks are roughly fairly valued, not dangerously overvalued.    
    
As we go into 2021, we face the following conditions: a vaccine roll out that sometime between now and late ‘21 will lead us into a v-shaped recovery. [The Krugman argument for this vision](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/opinion/joe-biden-economy.html), and [The Bloomberg argument for this vision](https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/opinion/articles/2020-12-01/get-ready-for-a-supercharged-economy). We also just had the Fed reaffirm 0% interest rates and the continuation of QE. Add to all of that very easy YoY earnings comps for the first two quarters of this year and this is not a recipe for a crash, it’s a recipe for a steady market melt up. Where are the rich supposed to put all their money in a 0% interest rate environment? 0% pushes up the value of all asset classes, and this is especially true of real estate and stonks. Generally speaking, predicting macro economic movements is a losing game, but all of those things combined with the easy YoY comps means I don’t feel the need to be concerned of an impending correction for at least the next two quarters. 
    
A much smaller factor but still a factor, I have seen it suggested that Apple will be among the larger beneficiaries of the stimulus checks going out, although those have not started rolling out until just now so that may have an impact on Q2 if any.

**Bad subscription numbers**    

If subscriptions to Apple One flopped, this could significantly overshadow sales and earnings numbers. I personally feel Apple isn’t likely to seriously miscalculate predictions on a subscription bundle because they have their market dialed in, but I don’t know that for sure. 

**Sales could have cratered in October**    

Sales often drop a little in the weeks preceding a phone launch. What if phone sales tanked during the delays waiting for an iPhone 12? That could be bad. I’m encouraged by the fact that iPhone 11 models appeared to still be having good sales numbers when the iPhone 12 was launched (see links earlier in this post), but I don’t really know what October sales look like.

**COVID could have tanked all phone sales.**    

[This report says all phone activations generally tanked 23% on Christmas Day.](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-iphones-dominate-christmas-day-activations) Two thoughts I have on that, that number is for all phone activations, not just iPhones. And two, that’s just for Christmas Day itself. There could be a wide array of reasons activations were down on that one day. To counter that, [this report says the iPhone was the best selling 5G phone](https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/21/best-selling-5g-phone/), even in October despite the phone not launching until the second half of that month. Additionally that article mentions pent up demand for 5G apple phones that sales are likely to be strong going forward.

##  Technical Analysis   
I don’t believe in technical analysis. Charts don’t know any of the things I just explained, and are therefore, in my opinion, useless to me. Maybe somebody has figured out a system for charts to predict the future, but I am not that person.      
     
## Price Target    
I don’t pretend to know things like that.     
    


## Fun rumors    
I’m not big on speculative rumors and momentum type plays, but if that’s your thing there are certainly rumors in the air. The most famous of which is the rumor that Apple is back to working seriously on an EV Car. Another is reports are just coming out in the last day or two that [Apple is seeing new successes in developing foldable tech.](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/31/two-foldable-iphones-reportedly-pass-tests/) Whether these things will impact the stock price isn’t really my cup of tea, but if it’s yours those are two things to consider. 

## Is my post an attempt at a WSB pump and dump?    
I’m under no allusions that my own WSB post is going to alter the trajectory of a $2.25 trillion company in any meaningful way.  That sort of thing may work on a post-IPO company that hasn’t had its lockup expiration yet and thus has a tiny float (aka PLTR or numerous other recent “to the moon” meme stocks) with limited float. (That’s not to say those aren’t great companies or great trades. I’m just sayin’).


## My positions: 
I’m more conservative than most of WSB.  While I love this place with all my heart and love you guys for it, I believe risking it all to chase screenshot-worthy gains is moronic and not the path to building real, long-term wealth. Thus my positions are probably more conservative than you’d expect.    
    
I have 20% of my net worth tied up in Apple via LEAPs. 9/16/2022 AAPL $87.50 calls. I consider this to be essentially stock I hold for the long term. Delta is approaching 1 anyway so they practically are stock. Sometime in the depths of March I loaded up on FAANG LEAPs with the intention of actually holding them for years and then converting to shares. Those LEAPs were a little OTM at the time I bought them. I have no interest in day trading my significant LEAP positions so that’s going to sit there for the next two years.

But I also have put an additional 15% of my net worth into short term calls on Apple to play the ER. I have Feb 19 $130 calls which were about 10-15% OTM at the time I bought them. They are currently ITM. I also have 1/29 $135s and 1/29 $141s.     
    
This puts 35% of my net worth into Apple.

## How to get rich
I intend to cash out my short term calls after the ER, and I don’t intend to reinvest or roll them out because I suspect Apple will be fully valued by then and there are better plays out there. I intend to keep my LEAPS because I bought those for the very long term and because at the very least I should hold them until March to hit the long term capital gains tax rate.    
    
I intend to take my profits from the calls and push them into shorting NNOX and XPEV, both of which have significant lockup expirations coming in mid to late February which I believe will significantly impact the stock prices in the short term. I have no interest in shorting XPEV right now, because you guys are crazy as fuck and for all I know EV stonks could all run up another 50% in the next month. Right about the time the Apple ER hits should be perfect.

## Criticism

Unfortunately, I left my TA crayons at home, so I'll try to indent and tab over my walls of text as much as possible so that you Zoomers can pay attention to at least 1/4 of it.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*I do want to clarify that some of the timing of iOS 14 changes could get changed and Facebook could push back against certain parts of the change. I did my best to explain the basics of what I think is going on, but it is possible that I miscommunicated or misunderstood some parts of the iOS 14 update, so digital marketers, feel free to let me know in the comments and I'll edit accordingly\*\*\*

\-------------------------------

# TL;DR - Apple's iOS 14 - ""Get Zucked, Zuckerberg,"" Said Tim Cook

For reasons that will be explained below, it is possible that Google and Facebook will begin seeing their duopoly slowly diminish over the next several years (probably >7 years, based on how ""fast"" Turtle Mitch is able to get anything done). I do believe that Google and Facebook will continue to be the top two players in the game for the foreseeable future **(SO I AM NOT RECOMMENDING SHORTING THESE AT ALL YOU 🌈 NOOBS).**

The core problems that these companies will soon face, especially Facebook, is [anti-trust law suits from the FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization), more distrust of their platform due to the most recent election, censorship across both platforms, a complete failure of Facebook to properly address the negative side effects of social media on the youth and actually do something about it, and, most importantly, **Apple upgrading to iOS 14 (explained more later).**

* [The Anti-Trust Law Suit from the FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization) talks about Facebook becoming a monopoly and buying all the competition such as Instagram and WhatsApp, instead of competing against them.
* [iOS 14](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2020/08/30/ios-14-facebooks-apple-nightmare-keeps-getting-worse/?sh=3029be574cfe) update will roll out early 2021. This will hinder the collection of iPhone identifiers for advertisers ([IDFA](https://www.appsflyer.com/mobile-attribution-glossary/idfa/)), one of the primary things used to track users online.

\-------------------------------

Primary Issues For Facebook From The iOS 14 Update

1. **Bidding Issues:** As I stated above, Facebook is going to lose more and more data points as  time goes on, making it so that they aren't able to bid appropriately on someone like Johnny Bravo when he is scrolling through his insta feed. What does this mean? Insta may look at Johnny Bravo as a Joe Schmo and decide that he's not worth bidding up on, so Johnny Bravo will never see those ads of Playboy and Whey Protein that he would have bought if he got an ad for it. (Example for this: with the iOS14 update, Facebook loses its data points to Johnny Bravo's workout apps, so they had no way of knowing he would have been more likely to convert.
2. **Creating Audiences:** Facebook is going to lose thousands of data points on its users, effectively making it harder to match these audiences into their appropriate buckets. Before, if someone had several golf apps on their phone, you could assume they were a golf lover more easily. Without being able to use that app data sharing, it will be much harder to know they like golf unless they follow several golfing pros / shows in Facebook.

\-------------------------------

With the expectation that Facebook will become less efficient as time goes on and that certain lawsuits could negatively affect the company, many advertisers are looking for other viable options to put their ad dollars. There have been several social media competitors working to monetize their app and become the third wheel of digital marketing. Some of these companies include:

* PINS - Pinterest 🚀🚀🚀
* SNAP - Snapchat 🚀
* TWTR - Twitter 🚀
* Twitch - (Owned by Amazon aka AMZN) 🚀🚀
* LNKD - LinkedIn (Owned by Microsoft aka MSFT) 🚀
* Hulu Ads - (Owned by Disney aka DIS) 🚀🚀
* TikTok - Not sure if correct, but you may be able to get shares [here](https://www.ig.com/en/shares/ipos/bytedance-tiktok-ipo) (ticker tbd, but pretty sure it will be ZOOMR 🚀

The name of the game is trying figuring out which of these new channels will be the next to gain 5-10% more market share of ad spend from clients and which will be nothing more than moneyless pits since they do a terrible job at monetizing their app and creating engaging ads that lead to conversions for clients (looking at you SNAP and TikTok).

\-------------------------------

MY RECENT BACKGROUND (aka why should you even bother listening to this autist):

* **Worked in digital marketing and finance for the last 5 years**, also took on several side jobs doing digital marketing for companies
   * **I managed >$10 million in ad spend across various digital marketing channels (Google/Bing/Facebook/Shopping) over the last 30 days** and over >$40 million in ad spend over the last year
   * I work with a team of Managers and Directors at my agency to help talk about new opportunities and keep up with digital marketing trends across all channels
   * Using our >300 clients data, our company is able to look at macro trends at a faster rate, so we can quickly identify which new channels to focus our efforts in (Pinterest/TikTok/Snap/Twitch/etc.)
      * This was highlighted over the last year or year and a half when we noticed a huge spike in companies using Pinterest as a primary channel for digital marketing. Only more and more companies are going to join into the race, this is just the beginning.

\-------------------------------

# Any of these stocks or multiple could improve throughout the following years, but my money is on PINS 🚀🚀🚀

* Even with PINS recent run up in stock price, I think there is still plenty of time to buy this stock now.
   * Our clients are continuing to spend more and more on the Pinterest ad platform and it is returning better performance metrics (ROAS/ROI) than most of the other mentioned channels.
* Pinterest also relies on on targeting people based on boards they visit/follow/create, combined with using a search query method for ads, somewhat similar to Google's. **This means they don't have to rely as much on pixel data, like Facebook does, to create their audience targeting.**

&#x200B;

# I think the safest way to make money on PINS is to buy stocks for the long term, but I know that doesn't get some of your little schlongs hard enough.

* Their next earnings are on 2/4/21(after hours) and ***I fully expect them to smash expectations just like McConnell's dad smashed that turtle to give birth to Mitch.***
   * Look at PINS options that make sense to you for a little after earnings, preferably not 2/5, literally the day after earnings. But you do you boo.

**TLDR:**

Tesla enters 2021 with huge tailwinds. Bullish for the first half of the year. More caution in the second half as competing EV products start entering the market at an accelerating pace. Biggest risk is the market discounting the effect of strong EV competition starting in 2021. Avoid shorting TSLA.

# The 2021 TSLA trade plan

## What moves the stock?

Knowing that TSLA is decoupled from its business metrics, an inquisitive investor will wonder what drives the stock's price. The answer is partially uncovered by understanding who owns the stock. According to Macroaxis.com, as of December 30th, Institutions own 42.52% of Tesla's stock, the Public (i.e. Retail Investors) owns 37.46%, and Insiders own 20.02%.

>Institutional investors aren't selling

TSLA's institutional investor base consists of large passive funds such as funds tracking the S&P500 (which recently added TSLA) to more active hedge funds specializing in innovation and growth. Passive funds increase the buying pressure of TSLA while adding minimal selling pressure. Today, the majority of the workforce regularly contributes their salary to passive funds for retirement and said funds are unlikely to trim their holdings of a stock unless during an infrequent rebalancing event. The active funds that remain invested in TSLA tend to have celestial expectations for the company and are also unlikely to sell at this valuation. For example, billionaire fund manager Ron Baron believes that Tesla, currently at a $659 billion market cap, should be a $2 trillion dollar company. Another major fund manager, Cathie Wood, gives TSLA a 2024 price target of $7,000. Assuming minimal changes in total float, that equates to almost a $7 trillion dollar market cap!

So TSLA's institutional investor base are hardly sellers of TSLA and still believe there is significant room for the stock to run despite its incredible 2020 performance.

>Retail investors aren't selling

What about TSLA's retail investor base? This question is easily answered. Over the years, TSLA has built a diehard fanbase that has equally high, if not higher, expectations of the company than some of the institutional investors. Some people believe the company's CEO, Elon Musk, has developed a cult-of-personality. Tesla's cult-like fanbase manifests online as a large number of YouTube channels and online forums dedicated to the company, and in a broader sense, Elon Musk. For example, the main Tesla subreddit, r/ teslamotors, has more than 901,000 subscribers at the time of writing.

>Insiders aren't selling

Of the remaining 20% of TSLA stock, the majority is held by Elon Musk and he's certainly not eager to sell noticeable quantities of his holdings given the ensuing bad PR.

So if investors are hesitant to sell TSLA, TSLA is bound to appreciate aggressively every time there's good news and appreciate slowly in the absence of news as passive funds and its ardent fanbase continue to buy in. In other words, TSLA is a heavily news-driven stock with a heavy bias for upside.

This is exactly what we saw in 2020. TSLA entered the year having solved its Model 3 production problems while managing to maintain solvent. This act alone unceremoniously discarded a dark cloud over the company on whether it'll manage to produce cars at scale before its heavy debt-burden catches up with the company's treasury. With that, the path was clear for a string of good news to catapult the stock to grandiose heights. They included the opening of the Shanghai factory, the 5-for-1 stock split, the S&P500 inclusion, and record sales and deliveries in the third quarter. Even good news from the tangentially-related company SpaceX, who Elon Musk is also the CEO of, has been positive for TSLA.

# The Plan and Headwinds

Tesla will enter 2021 with boosted by tailwinds from its 2020 success. If Tesla maintains its current pace of execution, ceteris paribus (fancy business major speak for ""all other things being equal""), its stock price is expected to continue to appreciate and befuddle its critics. Tesla is finally able to produce Model 3's at scale, has a foothold in the Chinese market, and is readying to launch the Cybertruck to a red-hot North American pickup truck market. In addition, like Pavlov's dogs, 2020 has conditioned investors to not bet against TSLA with the stock shrugging off multiple negative news events like the COVID-19 pandemic, the expected post-S&P500 inclusion sell-off (which never happened), and the Apple EV announcement.

**In 2021, it's recommended to continue to avoid shorting Tesla, no matter how tempting.**

With that said, there are significant headwinds facing Tesla that any long positions should be aware of. Tesla currently has an 81.66% market share of the US EV market. The biggest risk going into 2021 and beyond is the significant ramp up in EV and battery technology competition from legacy auto manufacturers. Tesla's stock price has only emboldened the executive teams of these companies to pour significant resources into their EV businesses. GM, Volkswagen, and Ford are leading the pack. GM has invested $27 billion into its EV business and is planning to launch 30 EVs by 2025. Two EVs have already been announced: the Cadillac Lyriq and the Hummer EV, with both receiving an overwhelmingly positive public response. GM has also developed an in-house battery technology called Ultium that's the central pillar for its 2025 plan. A step above GM, Volkswagen is investing $41 billion into its EV business and plans to launch 70 EVs by 2030. It's also aggressively investing in battery technology. For example, Volkswagen has a large stake in QuantumScape, a company that claims to be developing a revolutionary solid-state battery technology. Last but not least, Ford is investing $11 billion into its EV business and plans to launch 40 EVs by 2022. Deliveries of its flagship EV, the well-received Mustang Mach-E, is already underway. An honorable mention goes to Apple, which plans to start production of its own EV in 2024.

If TSLA is a news-driven stock, a growing string of negative news about the company's shrinking North American and European market share should apply downward pressure on price. The worry is that investors are so exuberant about the stock's stellar 2020 performance that the effects of emergent, serious competition from legacy auto manufacturers are heavily discounted.

**In 2021, although it remains very bullish for TSLA going into the first half of the year, it's recommended to avoid aggressively starting or adding more to an existing position in the latter half of the year. This is when the rate of competing EV products entering the North American and European markets is expected to accelerate. Prudent investors should watch how the public reacts to this large structural EV market change before making any moves.**

You must be new to WSB. Well here’s your source of tendies for 2021 if you’re not a complete idiot and you can afford modest leaps. 

Some proper DD. I’m not citing sources, y’all can Google shit.

- They have around $200B cash on hand
- They had 34% increase in sales just on Xmas (278M)
- With the M1 processor, they’ve increased interest in their hardware again. Winning back jaded fanboys and killing the hackintosh community almost overnight.
- Their iPhone 12 sales are rumored to be strongest mobile sales to date.
- The stock is up over 80% in 2020 despite a pandemic

Now for bias and my own opinions:

I’ve been following Apple most of my life. I worked on some of the first hackintosh distros (iatkos) as a broke college student. I can tell you definitively that a massive majority of Apple users are in the digital media and production space. With their prioritization on services the last few years, they’ve really slacked in staying competitive in hardware. They’ve also made some weird plays at being different without actually innovating. That’s changed entirely this year. Their next earnings is going to reflect that. The M1 is a game changer. Almost everyone I know (which is hundreds of people in the digital agency space) have already or are planning on grabbing up Mac mini’s or Airs because of the chip and price point. Apple is also pretty much recession proof. 

My predictions:

- 10% price increase leading up to Q1 earnings just off anticipation.
- 20% price increase post Q1 (probably within a week or two) and pre Q2
- An easy 100% increase by year end.

My play:

Get calls on discount now. Near ITM for next earnings call. OTM leaps."
