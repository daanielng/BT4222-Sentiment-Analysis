1. The founder of Bridgewater Dalio: the Fed may raise interest rates 4-5 times next year, which will be a sensitive issue

Rui Dalio, founder of the world's largest hedge fund Bridgewater, said in an exclusive interview that the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates 4-5 times next year until it negatively affects the stock market.

Regarding the current inflationary pressure, Dalio pointed out that the U.S. now has two types of inflation: a cyclical inflation that occurs when demand for goods and services exceeds production capacity, and a monetary inflation caused by the over-issuance of money and credit.

For the second type of inflation, he warned that if cash and bond holders were to sell these assets in a big way, the central bank would have to raise interest rates at a faster pace or keep them low by printing money and buying financial assets, and this would exacerbate inflation. This adds difficulty to the Fed's policy making.

Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Software Inc., ($U), first announced and released in June 2005 at Apple Inc.'s ($AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference as a Mac OS X-exclusive game engine. The engine has since been gradually extended to support a variety of desktop, mobile, console, and virtual reality platforms. It is particularly popular for iOS and Android mobile game development and used for games such as Pok√©mon Go, Monument Valley, Call of Duty: Mobile, Beat Saber, and Cuphead. It is considered easy to use for beginner developers and is popular for indie game development. The engine can be used to create three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) games, as well as interactive simulations and other experiences.

I can give you insight as a VR/AR engineer who uses Meta's Oculus to $MSFT's Holo lense to develop games in 3D. Unity is much easier and has fewer bugs compared to the Unreal engine. Unity provides a free trial of their pro version to students making them a choice among future VR engineers.

The goal of Unity is not to generate profits but to exile their competition to make them a SOLE PROVIDER of the software tools for Metaverse.

To make the Metaverse more realistic, the recent acquisition of Weta (I know, Meta with a W) might suggest improvement of some ART or NFT in Metaverse.

The stock has just seen MACD bullish crossover and RSI is in the mid-buy range. The stock has a good 1D moving average as support and is kinda right time to buy. With 150, 160, and 174.5$ as current substantial resistances while 128$ as a reliable support.

Current Position: Just 5 Shares at 148.30$ want to add more but looking at market's sentiment."

Meta has the largest social media userbase, and the Facebook Marketplace reported just over $26 billion in revenue, an increase of 48 percent from last year.  Meta can make the Facebook Marketplace accept cryptocurrency payments at the flip of a switch.  Facebook is currently the leading company for the metaverse development with unrivaled resources and userbase.  No other companies are better positioned to implement the innovations.  The upcoming earning is expected to be very optimistic with the wide expansion of innovative product lines and high growth to existing products such as the Facebook Marketplace. 

For the aforementioned reason I believe Meta is the best and the safest play both for Web3 category, and the strong growth category.  

The Santa Clause Rally should support this thesis."

As we all use the platform and are most likely going to trade it, one way or the other, I see it prudent to open source this back of the napkin valuation to see what you autists think. 

**The Metrics**

Reddit, like all of the other social media platforms, primarily generates its revenue from ads. Thus, the KPIs we want to look at here are the MAUs and the average visit duration. Since, theoretically, the money from advertisers is going to flow to the company that has the most people coming to the platform and staying for the most amount of time. 

\*\*Since Snapchat doesn't give the MAU data, only the DAU, I just took the DAU and multiplied it by 2 lol. 

\*\*For any data that was missing, I normalized it by utilizing the respective company's MAU CAGR. 

MAU CAGR:

[I thought only moms used Pinterest](https://preview.redd.it/ba1o597f2q681.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=124bc03ae65ef95207544d62029d7ff7b0756a90)

MAU:

[Normalized by not including Facebook](https://preview.redd.it/szr9xkhsrp681.png?width=441&format=png&auto=webp&s=4258944ef27b8736c9c3db14798c2844c2150074)

Average Visit Duration:

[SNAP is assumed at 30 minutes](https://preview.redd.it/g7571g5wsp681.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9727504d3c00a71b60c0f12ee9ec880f84db9706)

Now, if we look at the 2026 MAUs, by using their MAU CAGR, and multiple the current average visit duration of each platform, we get the 2026 monthly average viewership. This metric is what ad sellers would most likely want to see.

2026 Monthly Average Viewership:

[In Minutes](https://preview.redd.it/ogxwigrovp681.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f4e0516518d532445067faec4ca43d4c9b62d38)

Here, we see Facebook as the clear platform winner, however, Reddit has continued to grow and has usurped Snapchat and Pinterest to become the #2 platform in monthly viewership. 

Now, with this \*information\* taken into consideration, the market is currently pricing these platforms at the following valuations:

**FB**: 903B

**TWTR**: 34B

**SNAP**: 72B

**PINS**: 23B

And I assign a value multiple comparing each platform's 2026 av. monthly viewership to Reddit's and then use that multiple to find the comparative market cap of Reddit. 

**FB**: -2.09 => 432B

**TWTR**: 1.86 => 63B

**SNAP**: 1.07 => 76B

**PINS**: 1.52 => 35B

Now, we have a range of Reddit comp valuations that I take the median of and slap a 40% safety of margin to because I know I am wrong. This returns a market valuation for Reddit of 50B. If we exclude Facebook from the list, we get a median return of 45B. For some reason, though, I think this is far too much and the likely range of valuation would be closer to 30B-45B.

All in all, Reddit is currently priced at $10B via its last series funding round. As we close in on the IPO date I suspect Reddit will begin to rapidly gain in valuation. Maybe we'll see it trade up to or even more than 45B. Who knows? I certainly do not have a clue. But as more info comes out I would like to see how off this valuation is. 

This sub has really shit on Reddit's IPO because you all think it'll follow with heavy censorship and/or monetization. If Reddit fucks with anything in that way it essentially destroys its platform. -that's all I'll say on that."

2013  Yahoo bought Tumblr for $1.1 billion

Tumblr went down the path of banning explicit content, smut, bascially everything that was driving user growth. NSFW for everything bad, is a huge catalyst for users, activity and every single metric that matters.

Look at the fear that happened when Onlyfans decided they aren't a porn/sexworker place and wanted to go in another direction? Massive backlash and now they may not be able to go public.

source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/25/onlyfans-says-it-will-no-longer-ban-porn-after-backlash-from-users.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/25/onlyfans-says-it-will-no-longer-ban-porn-after-backlash-from-users.html)

Reddit has a huge base of NSFW activity, subreddits that discuss things that wouldn't fly anywhere else. While the CEO has said previously they aren't willing to ban porn and other objectionable content. That was before reddit goes public and suddenly becomes worth suing.

Imagine someone posts some revenge porn, or copy righted material, or someone follows DD and loses all their life savings investing in Silver derivatives. Sure reddit can say they police but that argument isn't helping instagram, facebook, pornhub. 

Reddit was too small to sue before. If reddit goes public I guarantee they will be worth suing there's going to be a ton of crack downs.

Snapchat, its an app all of us (atleast i hope) have herd about or used before ... you know to send nudes and get sneaky links and shit like that . Well  right now at a very strong level of support which is around the 45 dollar mark . Also its about had enough downside as it really cant stay below 45 for much long before rallying from 44-45 back to around 54 bucks where it has strong resistance . Furthermore it has a gap to fill from 77 bucks . It fell due to a miss on its revenue by ... 3 million dollars . WTF instead of making 1.10 billion dollars they made 1.07 billion dollars which is a miss but for it to drop instantly 22% after that is kind of retarded to be honest .

 Revenue increased 57% to $1,067 million in Q3 2021, compared to the prior year.

* Net loss improved 64% to $(72) million in Q3 2021, compared to the prior year.
* Adjusted EBITDA improved 209% to $174 million in Q3 2021, compared to the prior year.
* Operating cash flow was $72 million in Q3 2021, compared to $(55) million in the prior year.
* Free Cash Flow was $52 million in Q3 2021, compared to $(70) million in the prior year.

Its about 44% from its all time high of 80 bucks so its in a good buy zone . Earnings were good just a loss of 3 million from expected revenue is what set it down and with apples privacy updates. But i think it will make up for that apple privacy bs with the meta verse as the years go on , dont forget yall all those snap chat filters and etc are essentially  augmented reality and snap is still investing heavily in  augmented reality .

TLDR-  Snap is primed to the tits , its 44%ish off its ath, apples privacy changes fucked it but metaverse and new users make up for it, it has a gap to fill from 58 to 77 bucks .

Disclaimer- I do own a few calls on snap , its had a lot of nice swings both to the upside and downside

I understand the vision though and believe they can deliver as long as they have the right team. It seems like GME really is considering the fact that people like the stonk.

I think FedEx‚Äôs earnings are going to tank because of their inability to control costs related to the labor shortages compared to their competition and that you can make tendies on puts or shorts, but this probably won‚Äôt be the next DOCU play

**Preface:**

All over the world logistics companies are facing labor shortages and increased shipping loads, on top of the ports being backed up especially a bad thing for courier companies for this quarter since Christmas shopping is in full swing and shopping for tendies online is at an all-time high thanks to covid.

**FedEx‚Äôs shipping rate hikes but why I think they mean nothing:**

Last earnings, FedEx announced an increase in rates but it would only take effect on Jan. 3, 2022, these will apply to all US domestic, US export and US import services. FedEx Ground, which delivers to businesses, and FedEx home delivery will increase by an average of 5.9%. FedEx Freight customers could see an increase of up to 7.9%.

Earlier this month starting Nov.1, FedEx also announced that a fuel surcharge will be added to certain FedEx shipments, including FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight shipments. Effective Nov. 15, 2021, Item 525 Over Length and Item 530 Extreme Length surcharges will also increase.

This rise in rates are always expected due to the build-up of the end of year shipping rush, but I think these rate hikes have come too late as it will only partially offset their fuel costs.

**Labour shortages and increased hiring cost problems:**

Taking data from this news report from Convey a few weeks back:

We can see that FedEx has all along been pretty fucked in terms of their labor problems as this has making them consistently fail in their on-time deliveries. I will explain more on why I think this is relevant below.

Besides the chaos, we still have headlines of FedEx employees dumping packages probably thanks to the insane pile up of packages at this time of the year.

Boomer shipmatrix.com disagrees with Convey‚Äôs reporting matrix and is instead reporting much better on-time deliveries because they use the total time in transit rather than accounting for when each individual courier receives, processes and then delivers each package.

I wont be going into the specifics here but I personally think ShipMatrix is more retarded than the average WSB autist here.

I don‚Äôt know anyone who can even agree with these bullshit numbers that they are pulling out of their ass.

A quick sub-reddit research seems that there‚Äôs more chaos over in /r/Fedexers/ vs that of UPS /r/UPSers

**Why do any of these numbers matter?**

Not being able to deliver on time had already led to them losing contracts with time sensitive meal-kit businesses, as noted during its last earnings it lost customers such as Clean Eatz Kitchen Inc. due to delays that cost the company thousands of dollars‚Äô worth of shipments of ready-to-eat frozen meals that ended up spoiled in transit.

Next up on some meal-kit business that will lose or have already lost their contract with Fedex:

1. Home Chef - Users grumbling on facebook & reddit
2. Sun Basket ‚Äì users are reporting that they have already switched away from Fedex to Courier Express (not a listed company so who cares)

A quick look into any of the meal kit subreddits or a quick google has angry customers complaining about long delays of even up to a week in receiving their meal kits. Can you imagine what happens if you let fresh foodstuff sit in a warehouse with no temperature controls for 3 days, what happens after 5? What happens if that week‚Äôs kit has seafood?

Take a look here and you can see nothing but disdain for FedEx in relation to meal kit deliveries.

How many of you personally ordered tendies but they came in late because of FedEx?

**Non food related delivery problems also extend into delays of delivery of sensitive documents**

Over at the UK side, FedEx is also fucking up on passport deliveries.

**Possibly higher Labor costs vs their peers:**

I remember reading FedEx is also paying more for labor acquisitions than their peers at DHL/UPS/USPS etc but I haven't gone and dug up more about it beyond this news report.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-04/labor-shortage-ups-union-drivers-give-delivery-service-edge-over-fedex-fdx](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-04/labor-shortage-ups-union-drivers-give-delivery-service-edge-over-fedex-fdx)

**Summary**

FedEx is reporting that they expect higher shipment volume but the increase in revenues wont be high enough to cover their rising costs since they can't even handle the current volume with the current labor shortage. They have also been lagging behind their peers in managing costs possibly leading into an earning's miss and tanking the share price further.

I will likely be picking up puts come market open after I get more allowance from cashing in my good boy points with Mommy.

\*edit\*

Fedex's share price when put against its peers UPS, DHL and Maersk also seems correlated to its poor ability to deliver.

**The Play**

Puts or shorts for potential earnings miss.

\*edit\*

IV pretty low currently so we won't be fucked on option plays

**Risk**

‚Äì Share price has already tumbled from its ATH levels of $314 earlier this year. (Currently $246)

‚Äì FedEx has other businesses under their arm and this discussion only covers the failings of FedEx Ground

‚Äì This may have already been priced into the analyst expected earnings estimates.

Hoping to hear more thoughts about FedEx and if all these are big enough to make FedEx miss its quarterly reports. Especially anyone working under FedEx who can tell me if I‚Äôm being retarded"

He's the son of Neil Armstrong (first man on the moon) and cousin to Billie Joe Armstrong (Green Day).  $COIN is the largest code currency exchange in the United States by trading volume.

**Who uses Coinbase?**

Coinbase is in 100+ countries, and they have over 73 million verified users. Last quarter, Retail Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs) was at 7.4M.  They have $255B of assets on the platform.  Compare to RH, 22.4M funded accounts and $95B of assets on the platform.

**How do they make money?**

Last quarter they had $1.235B in net revenue, including $1.1B from transactions and $145M in subscription & services revenue.  The transactions revenue is really driven by code currency volatility, but the services revenue is sticky and fast growing.

**What does the future have in store for Coinbase?**

* Coinbase will be a hodler of non-fiat currency.  In August, they announced plans to purchase $500 million in non-fiat currency and use 10% of their profits to purchase more non-fiat currency in the future.
* Coinbase NFT, a peer-to-peer marketplace that will make minting, purchasing, showcasing, and discovering NFTs easier than ever. They have over 1.8 million users on the waitlist to join.  [https://www.coinbase.com/nft/announce](https://www.coinbase.com/nft/announce)
* Coinbase issued $2B in debt at <4% APR for product development and potential M&A
* They announced a partnership with Facebook. They will be store non-fiat currency for Facebook's new digital wallet, Novi, which will enable users to send and receive money abroad instantly, securely and with no fees.

* Kevin Durant signed a deal to promote Coinbase
* And plenty of other innovation... browser extension, ledger integration, etc.

**So what?**

**Buy the stock! Sell puts!** 

* Oppenheimer‚Äôs Owen Lau rates Coinbase as an Outperform with a $444 price target.
* Lisa Ellis, MoffettNathanson Senior Equity Analyst, re-iterated her $600 PT on Coinbase.
* Josh Brown likes it.  Kevin O'Leary likes it.  Bryn Talkington likes it.

Why wouldn't they?  The company has massive YoY revenue growth, and they have actual earnings.

|$HOOD|$365M|\-2.06|
|$SQ|$80K|0|
|$TSLA|$1.62B|1.44|

&#x200B;

**I pity the fool that doesn't buy $COIN.** 

Concerns - The transactional revenue will eventually get commoditized. The partnerships/services/other revenue is fast growing and will need to remain so for Coinbase to be sustainable in the long-term. Think about Vanguard, Fidelity, E-Trade, Charlie Schwab - they all survived the race to zero. The ability to loan out non-fiat currency is key, and will take time to resolve."

Let me start off with, this company that connects people who want food, to people who will get it for them have a $54 BILLION MARKET CAP. Let that sink in for a minute....

**TLDR;**

DoorDash is highly overvalued. Has many issues. Not well baked company. Tech is poor. Their dasher churn is high. There is constant need for customer support for dashers when things should be automated. The only thing they have is market share. If someone develops something better, they will disappear. I'm currently not holding any positions but I'm about to place as many puts on $DASH as possible.  Will update when I do.

**UPDATE:**

**MAY 20, 2022 $100p. That is my position. Will roll it further out if need be.** 

**The DD:**

Now, when Wendys isn't making enough and the dumpster is out of clients, your next move is Uber or Doordash. Because I drive an old pile of shit cause my RH account is more up and down than a stripper, Doordash was my only option.

I decided to do DoorDash to make some extra cash (for more OTM calls), my RH account was recently blown up (cause I'm really smaert), and my clients are slow to pay.

I have a friend that does it as well and he makes good money with his main job but wanted an extra gig to pull in some cash so I learned all the tricks and tips from him since he did it for over a year now.

**My experience**

Alright so we got all that BS off the table now here is my experience as well as talking to other ""Dashers"" online and in person to make sure this isn't just me.

There are expected things like, poor GPS mapping to new developments, and glitches that come up and I write those off. Tech can only go so far. If you can't look at addresses in a neighborhood and figure it out or call the customer, you're just dumb.

My deliveries generally went okay. I even delivered to a strip club a couple times. So the perks to the job are there. Very perky and some not so much.

Here is what I saw when they didn't go well:

1. Orders picked up by the customer, the previous dasher didn't handle it properly, I get assigned. Or previous dasher picked up and delivered it but some how it didn't close out, so I got assigned. I drive there, only to find this out. I then have to spend 10-15 minutes contacting support to get the task cancelled, and I get half pay. This was so common it was happening almost nightly. Let's say it was a $10 task, I'd get $5. DoorDash eats that. I've probably made $50 or more in a week from this kind of stuff. Worse yet, I've talked to probably 100 others, and all have the same story. All over the US. I have no doubt DoorDash is bleeding cash. Cash that could easily not be lost. Not to mention the added customer service cost of handling these issues. If they pay me $5 for an order they messed up, plus I took customer services time of 10 minutes, multiply that x 1000 times a day and you get a lot of bleeding. 1000 times is probably a low number too.

The simple task of adding a button in DoorDash that would say, has this been picked up? Dasher hit's yes, the restaurant confirms with a popup on their screen, and no customer service needs to be involved. Dasher gets half pay and moves on to the next task. How simple.

Or maybe prevent the picking up issue or closing out issue in the first place. But ya know burning cash is fun.

2. Better task management. Say I get an order for Walgreens. I go there and pick stuff up, then I get an order for Taco Bell while I'm at Walgreens. Logic would say, pick up the Walgreens, then go to Taco Bell and pick that up. THEN deliver Taco bell first, then Walgreens. Why? Unless Walgreens has something like hot food, which they don't, then the food should take priority. This is why when you order DoorDash and you get cold food, there is a good chance the dasher sucks but also a good chance that an order from some place else took priority over yours. First come, first serve.

3. Rating customers. Dashers have a rating and if you want to stay a dasher, you need to perform. Problem is, some customers suck. Now, I expect people to suck, cause most people do. That doesn't bother me. What does is the same people like to order food with no tip. You'll say, ""just decline those orders."" True, you can. But the the problem is all the other dashers might not decline it and it keeps the delivery fee way lower than it should be but also allows customers to do whatever they want in a sense. There is no repercussions. Dashers cannot set a poor delivery rating of the customer. Or a big one, and this goes to the next point, difficult to deliver to houses. This could be resorts, large homes in the country, or special delivery requests not specified in the app but they have it when you get there. More on this in the #6 point.

4. The task assignment request window is truly designed to screw dashers. The window shows a small window where you're going. Best thing you can go off of is the mileage, which helps. But lets say you don't want to deliver to certain areas because you know they suck to deliver to, well you can't really see that. You an but it's tiny. In a perfect world, you'd see a large map of your traveling area, customer address, pickup location, and any special requests. The amount of times this screwed me is beyond me.

5. Walmart orders. Yeah, would recommend to say no to these. They generally suck and have the least amount of pay. Unless they bulk up the orders, so you pickup order for 10 customers. That's not terrible. Problem is, the app bulks them together and doesn't really give two shits if it makes sense distance wise or not. I did one the other night. Was supposedly 30 miles round trip. I probably did 40-50 miles. Minor. But the places it bulked the orders to was illogical. I was all over.

Also with Walmart orders, you have to scan the package when you get it. Then when you get to the customer, you have to scan the package, again. And send a text or call to the customer. And take a photo of the delivery location. And leave a note... cause why the f not? It's a lot of wasted time. I'm sure it was per Walmart requirements but it's such a hassle it's not even worth doing it. Takes an extra few minutes, multiply that times multiple orders and it's a massive time suck. Even if I write, ""package at door"" for the text and the message, I still lose at least a minute that would otherwise be in and out. Should just be, scan package at pickup, at drop off, and a photo of the delivery location. THAT'S IT.

6. Other BS. Special requests like, I get to a house, that is massive, with a stupid long driveway. First, they don't want delivery vehicles in their driveway, alright fine. It's not mentioned in the app though. They have a sign at their driveway. Then I get to the door. ""Please deliver to the back of the house."" The house is a cluster F of path ways and nothing at this place has a straight path way to the back of the house. I ended up delivering to their garage door as the Fedex guy did cause it's a bunch of bull to have all these request, no mention of it in the app and no additional tip to cover it. This was of course a Walmart order for $3.00! I could get a few FD's for that... am I right?

Sad part is, this is fairly common with Walmart orders. Not for just me but others. Which is another reason to stay away from Walmart orders. But even food orders, if you don't put in these special requests, dashers get screwed and then end up just putting your stuff where ever. Not a shock there is dasher churn, and I would bet its on issues like this. This goes back to a customer rating system. If Dashers saw this, they'd decline these orders, and the customer would have to pay more. Which is only fair. Shit Fedex/UPS/USPS should charge more for these places too if they could.

Houses in the country, with driveways that are longer than most city blocks... this more of a rant on this one. I live in the country. My house has a turn around in the driveway, it's not terribly long. Why, cause I have to plow that shit and I don't have all day to f around with that. Also why do I need a massively long driveway? The amount of country houses with driveways that zig zag that could just... I don't know... go straight to the friggin house, is beyond me. It's such a waste of everything. Sorry my logical brain breaks when I see this stuff. It's less of a $DASH issue but still an issue.

Resorts. How I hate them. Some let you go to the customers room. Some don't. Some won't let you past the gate. Customers complain, ""why can't you come to me?"" Cause security won't let me. If you want to waste a lot of time, resorts will be your best friend. I stay far away from them. This is a challenge but DoorDash needs to work with resorts to improve this. Either set it up to drop off at the lobbys by default or with security. Or charge more for specific spots with the additional wait time. I don't know for sure. It's a hell of a hassle though. 10/10 would not recommend resorts.

Why is the last two a DoorDash issue? The longer it takes for Dashers to handle deliveries, the longer it takes to get more out. With high dasher churn rates, there are only so many around to move the orders. If dashers don't get the additional pay to deal with the hassle, they won't deliver there or they will quit. Leading to more churn. Leading to increased delivery costs.

One last thing on the country stuff, Delivering outside the delivery area is bogus. Shouldn't even be possible. Yet it is some how.

7. App issues. Common. GPS breaks. Can't scan packages. Full out app being down (has happened recently.) For $54 billion market cap, I expect a lot more. I know even facebook (shit company as well but that's another story) has outages, though they are much less common. Support, is good, but it's kind of scattered. If you asked me at face value, this app looks and operates like a startup 2-3 years in. Not a publicly traded company with a $54 billon dollar market cap.

&#x200B;

**Now you'll say, ""but dude, this is pretty much your experience and other's you've talked to. This doesn't mean much.""**

I would normally agree. Here is the hang up. We know DoorDash is burning cash before I even started doing this. If you don't, go read the financials.

Some, if not many, would say at an unsustainable rate. 10Ks and all the financial data in the world is one thing, but as I learned from many great people in my life, you gotta get in the trenches to really know what is going on. I believe Jack Welch was big on this (CEO of GE when it was really good, for those of you who don't know.) I got in the trenches. DoorDash in my opinion isn't far from a shitshow. Which would be fine if it was a startup, not publicly traded, with only a few years under it's belt. But none of that is the case here. They should have these issues figured out by now. They should not be burning as much cash. Yet here we are.

I can post all the financial data in the world but all the Bulls will say, ""Nah, you're wrong."" So it's not worth it. I call myself a bull, I don't like betting against things cause you normally lose. This is long game, puts all day for me. LEAP puts. I do not see DoorDash sustaining this level of market share, cap, or anything long term. Their Dashpass is not a method to sustain things. Just a crutch that eventually customers will walk away from as their isn't enough incentive to keep giving them $9.99 a month unless you get food everyday. Amazon Prime makes sense for all the things you get. And I don't even have Amazon Prime or shares.

Arguments to them branching out and becoming more of an Ecommerce platform is just dumb. They barely have this area of things under control. It's like Shopify saying they are gonna branch out in to DoorDash's terrority. Shopify is great, but they have no business in the food delivery business. Or on-demand courier, however you see DoorDash.

Seriously, UberEats, hit me up, I'll build a team to dominate DoorDash in a year or less. It's not hard to see DoorDash's flaws here. And unless they fix them soon, competition can and will take their market share.

&#x200B;

**Best thing I can say to anyone ordering on Doordash. Unless you like cold food, then ignore this.**

1. Make sure your address is really easy to spot. House numbers can be seen day or night no issue. Put them on a mailbox (if you don't have those community boxes) and on the house. The bigger and more obvious the better.
2. If it's night time, turn on your outside light. Preferably one that lights up by your house numbers.
3. If it's an apartment, specify the name of the apartment complex in the address line 2 or in the order notes. Makes a world of a difference. Also if you're in an apartment complex that is multiple buildings but has the same address number, try to explain which building it is. I had one the other day, they said the building facing the woods, Boom, I got their way faster. Simple shit folks.
4. Answer your phone or texts when you place an order. The amount of times I needed to call a customer because their place was a pain to find or an order issue, but got no response was pretty high.
5. Tip. Common sense here. $2.50 to send your Taco Bell to your apartment on the 3rd floor and have to deal with security is not worth it. Even if we're less than a mile from Taco Bell.

&#x200B;

**Outro**

I'll probably stop doing DoorDash soon. It was a good experiment to see how it works and the flaws.  Cash wasn't terrible once I figured out what to avoid and be the most profitable possible.

Not to mention all the other things I learned, how badly short staffed everything is. How many companies say they are paying more but many of the franchise locations are not (no wonder you can't get anyone at Mcdonald's for $11/hr when the place across the street is paying $15 for the same job.) Still plenty of places paying more but can't find the workers.

How the food is made... ya I won't ever eat fast food again.

Talking to the people and understanding their lives and issues. Whether it was other DoorDashers in the field or online, or those making the food. Best question I got from a manager at one of the restaurants, **""Dude, is what you're doing even profitable?""** I answered reasonably but afterwards I was thinking... nah I do this for charity. It is profitable, but it is hit or miss. Some nights are awesome. Some are terrible. Many of the issue nights were related to the app being trash. Overall it's not the worst. There again though, at $54 billion market cap, I shouldn't have these app issues.

Seeing the common customers, there tends to be a demographic that are the main users of DoorDash, at least in all the discussions I've had with others on it and from what I've seen.

The most interesting to me is the nightly switch between the top places to pick up. One night Taco bell, then Mcdonalds, then KFC. Was like everyone was programmed to order from one place or the other. I'm sure incentives played into it from DoorDash or some ad campaign.

I haven't made my positions yet in DoorDash ($DASH) but I will this week. Planning on Leaps. Nothing but a PUTs position. Will update at the top what my positions are when the time comes.

&#x200B;

Last... I'm not an investment advisor. Just some guy that did DoorDash for awhile and doesn't believe the company is worth what it is. Do your own research. This isn't advice."

For all you ‚ÄúiT‚Äôs PriCed In!‚Äù turds, it‚Äôs not. The details and magnitude of patent sales this size are rare and unknown. There are no wallstreet/hedgefund models to price it in. Can it surprise to the downside? Of course. But that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre all playing this fun game aren‚Äôt we. 

Another catalyst- January 5th to the 8th 2022 is the CES Tech Conference in which BB is participating (along with MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, FB and more) to showcase their IVY tech and upcoming projects. This is a serious catalyst to start 2022.

&#x200B;

I think Matterport is going to be huge in the coming months‚Ä¶ and here's why:

&#x200B;

To reach as many people as possible, every e-commerce company wants to distribute their fulfillment network as much as possible. The downside of this distribution is that the engineering and construction teams must travel to get accurate site measurements (as-designed - NEVER - matches the as-built... or the building just doesn't have blueprints/CAD available). This type of situation makes Matterport an indispensable tool; reducing engineer travel and speeding up the whole design process. Matterport has a network of contractors with their 3D scanning equipment across the country, and can easily get an accurate 3D and 2D model of the site built. As more e-commerce startups happen, and formerly closed business spaces begin to re-open, Matterport will be the go-to for accurate space information.

&#x200B;

Facebook already has a contract with Matterport for AI research. As Meta continues to grow and tries to get ""digitized"" workplaces, I'm sure Matterport will be the company scanning every corporate facility for ingestion.  Apple, Google, Microsoft, and many others are also trying to compete with Meta in the digital workspace realm, and they will also need 3D scans of workplaces, so this will be ripe for opportunity. The possibilities here are limitless.

&#x200B;

I've been keeping an eye on the housing market, and I would estimate that around 30% of houses I'm seeing have an accompanying Matterport. As foreclosures start to happen and the technology continues to gain popularity, this will only drive more adoption."

BlackBerry is set to have a parabolic run over the next few weeks/months with many upcoming catalysts! Below is my analysis of why I think the stock is going higher.

Buying BlackBerry now is similar to buying $AMD at $2.00 in 2014 when SU BAE stepped in as CEO and took the stock to the moon! I believe this is a very similar opportunity right now! ü§´

**My fellow APES** üêµ **just remember that DIAMONDS** üíé **are made under PRESSURE** üñê

Good Luck and let's hope that PAPA CHEN makes it rain TENDIES!  üêî üí¶

\-------------------------

**Background - The turn around story of the SLEEPING GIANT**  üí™

Under the leadership of CEO John Chen, BlackBerry has spent the past 8 years pivoting from hardware smartphones to the future: (1) IoT Internet of Things (2) Automotive/EV and (3) Cyber Security.

All three of these areas are growth opportunities and BlackBerry has strategically partnered with many large tech companies including: Amazon, Microsoft and Qualcomm.

The market value of **BlackBerry is CRIMINALLY UNDERVALUED** **at \~$6 Billion** compared to their competitors such as $CRWD at $53 Billion, $PANW at $54 Billion and $ZS at $48 Billion to name a few.

The transformation of the business can be summarized in the slide below. Mickensy Consulting has estimated that the pool of reoccurring revenue from the IoT and connected car will grow exponentially over the next 10 years, which is VERY GOOD for BlackBerry's new business model!

**Patent Sale/Settlement/Partnership Announcement**  üí∞

There is been lots of speculation and rumors over the past few month from various sources, ranging from Facebook $FB being the sole purchaser for cash up front and/or a partnership deal, to a group of parties. The range of the deal is said to be worth $1 Billion to $2 Billion.

On the last conference call, CEO John Chen said that there is about an ""80% probability that the deal closes by Q4"". This date is November 2021, which is next week. However, they could also be waiting to release it during their next earnings call on December 21st, 2021.

**QNX, IoT (Internet of Things), Amazon IVY and the connected car ecosystem**  üëç

QNX real-time OS is installed in 195M cars today, out of 1.4B cars in total on the road worldwide. QNX enables many different software pieces to run in a car, so acts as a kind of central control unit. QNX is becoming the predominant OS for connected cars, since it¬¥s installed in so many cars. Whilst today $BB licenses QNX to OEMs on a per-unit royalty basis, QNX is effectively set up (through Blackberry Ivy, in partnership with $AMZN) to be the foundation of the data value chain for the auto industry, which McKinsey estimates will be quite big, specially for a company ($BB) with a market cap of $6 Billion today. I think this will extend to other verticals over the next decade.

In addition to the North American and Japanese automakers, BlackBerry QNX also have partnerships with Chinese EV's such as $XPEV and $BIDU (who plans to make EV's in the future).

BlackBerry has started testing their BETA version of IVY with Amazon this fall and are looking to showcase more features and capabilities with key partners at the CES in early 2022.

**BlackBerry continues to win Awards and is issued/granted new patents every month**  üòé

Most recently, SE Labs  independently-owned and run testing company that assesses security products and services ranked BlackBerry as #1 in New Endpoint system security.

Most of you apes know Qualcomm as a company that supplies chips for smartphones, but in the latest Earnings call and investors Day, Qualcomm has shown the results of its diversification plans. With roughly **40%** of the QCT **earnings being from non-handset domain.** This has clearly pleased the wall street and the stock jumped more than 40% over the last few weeks!

The main reason why I am supper bullish on Qualcomm is that they mentioned with all their diversification plans coming into fruition their total addressable market has jumped from **100B to 700B!** That is insane for company of this size.

# A brief overview of Qualcomm‚Äôs New & Existing Markets

**The Metaverse:** 

https://preview.redd.it/g0klgm7und181.png?width=2195&format=png&auto=webp&s=9079349fa0732c10fcbd45a33ead96f768932138

https://preview.redd.it/c2eu4dyund181.png?width=2045&format=png&auto=webp&s=b71e8aca0fb97bbb8742cb1dd88e3df8cc60d1a0

Qualcomm has been in the metaverse game before it was hip. More than **10M** Meta Oculus have been shipped containing the SnapDragon XR2 chips. They already have a strong presence in this area, and it‚Äôs likely to be more popular. They have acquired multiple AR related companies over the last decade and have a well-established Snapdragon Spaces Developer platform. The CEO is expecting demand for these devices to be just as big as phone market which means another market space for Qualcomm to dominate in.

**The PC market:**

Let‚Äôs be honest, Qualcomm‚Äôs current presence is the PC space is almost negligible. But Last year Qualcomm did a very interesting acquisition of **Nuvia for 1.4B** dollars. Nuvia was a startup focused on developing ARM based high performing CPUs which was **founded by chief architect of Apple SOC**, responsible for CPUs like iphone A14 Bionic chips and also the M1 & M1 pro Macbook chips! Qualcomm already has the best modem expertise in the world, and teaming up theoretically with the best CPU team is definitely gonna take a good bite out of the PC chip market share soon. Qualcomm is planning to launch its first CPU by late 2022. 

**Automotive tech:**

https://preview.redd.it/86j6smdynd181.png?width=2340&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfe6050350390e98ba595f49af4aceb6ac91ab59

Qualcomm is serious about being the technology provider for most of the auto industry. It recently acquired the ADAS (advanced driver assistance system) unit of Veoneer for **4.5B** dollars. GM and BMW are one of the first companies that has agreed to power their digital cockpit with Qualcomm tech. Revenues from auto sector have already doubled since last year with **13B design wins in the pipeline** over the next few years. 

**5G Dominance:**

https://preview.redd.it/8t3u5khznd181.png?width=1890&format=png&auto=webp&s=70f171e5d260f2b7f00d477f8f11d62f3eb81dc7

Qualcomm has decades of expertise in Communication technology, which is significantly more than any other companies. With the transition from 4G to 5G just starting, Qualcomm is set to continue dominance in the smartphone world. The big concern that investors had with Qualcomm was with Apple planning to make its own modem chips in the next few years. But QCOM is projecting that the revenues from Apple will be less than 5% within a couple of years. **Even though Apple and Samsung are making in-house chips, they cannot escape the royalties that they have to pay to Qualcomm for using their 5G patents.** So virtually every smartphone is using Qualcomm tech directly or indirectly!

**IoT Projection looks Insane and currently on track:**

https://preview.redd.it/1rxoh0l0od181.png?width=2637&format=png&auto=webp&s=80b766d721b0252482385b544cd787a7abfd4ffc

TLDR: Qualcomm is a severely undervalued at the moment, especially if you compare to Nvidia, which has less earnings than Qualcomm and still roughly 4X the market cap of $QCOM. With all the diversification plans showing results every quarter, $QCOM It is ready to launch into stratosphere. I believe Qualcomm has the potential to be one of the best tech stock over the next few years.

My Position: 250 shares and few 185c jan calls for some tendies.

**Valuation** 

Many have used the \~145M follower count of his Twitter, Facebook and Instagram followers combined to reach the high number that they have. But any rational person understands that following someone on social media does not mean you will create an account and use a social media site just because of them. Also the same person, might follow him on multiple sites. Plus, a lot of his followers are Russian bots. 

Trump tried creating a blog website previously and it was shut down after 1 month because no one visited it or shared it. Other similar attempts for conservative / anti ""woke"" platforms have only been able to get to 2.3 million (Parler) mau.

According to the data, on Oct. 25, Parler was downloaded about 16,000 times. Downloads peaked in mid-November, when it was downloaded nearly 340,000 times in a single day. On Monday, it was downloaded nearly 20,000 times. Daily active users on Parler shot up from about 500,000 on Oct. 25 to a peak of about 2.9 million in late November and have since fallen to 2.3 million.

Let's just say best case DWAC or Trump Media group can get to 10 million active users. 

Here are the ARPU's for the major social media portals:

Facebook - $30.75

Twitter - $9.39

Snap - $1.73

Pinterest - $3.69

The feature set is very similar to Twitter. So based on Twitter's revenue per user and 10 million users. Lets just say they can make $90 million a year in revenue. (Unlikely, but best case). 

Here are the market cap numbers per active user for all the social media platforms:

Twitter: $81/user

Facebook: $151/user

Pinterest: $157/user

Snap: $181/user 

At a Twitter like valuation, assuming DWAC/Truth Social can get to the following users here is the corresponding market cap:

5 million MAU - $400million

10 million MAU - $800 million

20 milion MAU - $1.6 billion 

At the current price, the SPAC shareholders will be left with an estimated $1.5 billion interest in the combined company. Investors in 15 million warrants tied to the SPAC will be sitting on another $300 million. 

Trump‚Äôs company will receive a 86 million shares as part of the deal, worth $3.9 billion. And, assuming shares consistently stay above $30 over the course of about a month and a half after the merger, the owners of Trump‚Äôs group will receive an additional 40 million shares, worth $1.6 billion at today‚Äôs prices. In total, that all adds up to $7.3 billion.

At a 10 million MAU the Company is overvalued by 10x at a 20 million MAU the Company is overvalued by 5x. 

**Dilution**  

The Company most likely will have to raise a PIPE to fund the launch of the network or social media platform because it only has $275 million in the bank. This PIPE will most likely be priced at $10 or $15 which will significantly dilute the SPAC shareholders and create downward pressure on the stock.

**Current Progress** 

Hackers gained access to a private¬†version of former President Donald Trump‚Äôs recently announced [social media platform](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/10/21/truth-social-platform-goes-viral-social-media/6115565001/)¬†and posted images of defecating pigs, expletives and more, [according to](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/21/technology/trump-truth-social-hackers.html) [multiple reports¬†](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/21/trump-truth-social-fake-accounts/)

The hackers, affiliated with the hacking collective Anonymous, [told The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/21/technology/trump-truth-social-hackers.html) that the move was part of their ‚Äúonline war against hate.‚Äù ¬†

Using a false account dubbed ‚Äúdonaldjtrump,‚Äù the hackers posted the photos of the pigs, wrote profane rants against¬†Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and¬†made a fake¬†account¬†for former Trump adviser Steve¬†Bannon, according to multiple reports. The hackers also posted memes from fake accounts for Trump, former Vice President Mike Pence and others. ¬†¬†

The initial beta was supposed to be launched in November but was delayed. The issue might be that it won't abide by the terms laid out by the people who wrote its source code. Mastodon, the open-source platform that TRUTH Social is using. Mastodon says it sent a formal letter on Oct. 26 to TRUTH Social's chief legal officer requesting compliance.

For a entire social media site, they have zero job openings. An email sent to the career email on the website seems to be unmanaged. 

Finally, on November 18th  Sen. Elizabeth Warren asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate a planned SPAC deal involving the new social media company of former President Donald Trump.Warren noted recent news reports that Digital World Acquisition Corp ‚Äúmay have committed securities violations by holding private and undisclosed discussions about the merger as early as May 2021.‚Äù

**SNAP ‚Äì Ruling the Meta-World : An Alpha Call**

*Disclaimer: Not a financial advice; just my view and interpretations.* 

**Brief Synopsis:** 

SNAP the self-proclaimed camera company is the de-facto founder and ruler of the Meta-world. The technologies developed by SNAP over the years have been game changer in almost all aspects and have been shamelessly copied by the major social media players. Snapchat launched the filters, stories, spotlight, in app games, social maps and many more paving the way for Snapchat being arguably the most preferred social media in the 13-24 year (90%) and 13-34 year (75%) population.

SNAP has also been well received by the product companies. Their AR (Augmented Reality) technology is far superior than any of the competition that is around. The AR helps the users to try the products (apparel and accessories) and gives them more confidence about product fit and quality. This also reduces returns to a great extent and is preferred by the manufacturers.

**The current issue pulling the stock price down:**

Apple‚Äôs new privacy feature that allows the user to turn off tracking has affected the targeted advertising. This has increased the cost of acquiring sale through ads in Snap and all other mobile based advertising platforms. This move has adversely affected the earnings of SNAP and it missed their own lower end of the guidance in Q3 by $3 Mn. In the words of the CEO/Founder, Evan Spiegel, ‚ÄúWhile we anticipated some degree of business disruption, the new Apple provided measurement solution did not scale as we had expected, making it more difficult for our advertising partners to measure and manage their ad campaigns for iOS‚Äù. 

**How will SNAP tackle this?**

But the important part here is what Evan Spiegel later said during the Q&A of the earning‚Äôs call, ‚ÄúThis has definitely been a frustrating setback for us, but I think over the long term these privacy changes and protecting privacy for users is really important for the long-term health of the ecosystem and something that we fully support‚Äù. In the current environment it is really meaningful of a CEO to recognize this and find a way to monetize with these limitations. 

Also, when the supply chain issues start to resolve, maybe post the holiday period, advertisement revenue will pick up once again, mainly in SNAP (among social media); why? because of SNAP‚Äôs incredible AR technology, its metaverse model and the user group that values its privacy and which fully utilizes the AR world. Recent brands that have started using SNAP‚Äôs AR technology to target user groups include Samsung (for their wearable), Hollister, American Eagle, Ralph Lauren, HBO Max (through co-watching experience).

**Financial Performance:**

SNAP has been proving itself to investors consistently. Just looking at their numbers will prove how incredible they have been. **Heads UP:** They have not yet made a profit. But they are on the way to being mighty profitable. **Take a look at their key numbers and make a decision for yourself.** This is a long term play.

**Introduction:**

**Don't sell MU now, it outperformed most of it's peers**
*‚ÄùMICRON TECHNOLOGY INC was among the best performers on Friday. It returned +7.8% to close at 83.03. On a day when the overall market breadth was 44%, it closed higher than 68% of the market. In comparison, the benchmark SP500 index closed today at -0.0014%.‚Äù*

**This is going to be a DD focused on the value of the products (Micron and Crucial memory, data center presence, and consumer use), as well as the value of the company. MU is definitely a long term play, though there is a lot of short term interest at the moment that may cause a run.**

**It is worth noting that MU is a cyclical stock, dependant upon memory demand, hence why I have focused on future memory demand in my DD.**

Latest news: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/22/micron-stock-has-best-day-in-18-months-traders-see-bigger-breakout.html

Micron climbed a lot on Friday. This was due to an analyst at Evercore ISI adding the memory chip maker to his list of top stock picks. [He anticipates a return to earnings growth next year.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-stock-price-earnings-chip-shortage-51632864045?mod=article_inline).

MU was up 8.4% to $83.52 during Friday afternoon trading. It was the second best performer of the day for the S&P 500 (shortly before 3PM). Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse noted that though shares of memory chip makers such as Micron have lagged behind the [PHLX Semiconductor index since early June](https://www.barrons.com/quote/index/us/xnas/sox?mod=article_inline), he believes tides are shifting.

*‚ÄúWe believe negative sentiment was due to investor concerns over the sustainability of PC, handsets, and cloud demand, which was also compounded by DRAM spot pricing that began to flatten out in May/June 2021,‚Äù wrote Muse.*

Muse noted that WSt expectations for Micron‚Äôs Feb/May quarter earnings have been cut by 33%/31% respectively, since August. While there could be further downside, weakness is now priced in. He believes either Feb or May quarter will be a bottom for Micron‚Äôs earnings. Micron shares tend to outperform one or two quarters before a bottom in earnings, hence he believes the stock could begin a run soon.

*‚ÄúAnd once they do‚Äîwe think the stock action could be fast,‚Äù Muse wrote. ‚ÄúWe also note most investors expected the memory trade to begin to work in 1Q22 based on our investor survey last month and would not be surprised to start seeing investors look to get positioned in the name ahead of January 1st, 2022.‚Äù*
*Other reasons for the climb:*
* Citi analyst Christopher Danely said in a research note that recent channel checks show there has been increased demand for DRAM memory among PC makers, and that a pricing correction in the DRAM market is ‚Äúdrawing to a close‚Äù.
* Danely also said the outlook for enterprise server sales in Q1 22 is better than expected. The server market is improving ‚Äúdue to recent increases in spending from cloud companies such as Meta and Google‚Äù. Danely maintained his buy rating and a $120/share price target.
* Earlier this week hedge fund Appaloosa Management said it recently sold off almost 3 million shares of MU, to leave the fund with 2.75 million shares.

**Higher future DRAM demand and how this affects Micron:**

Micron is a market leader in DRAM and NAND memory, with a market share of 20%/11% respectively. In 2021, DRAM revenues accounted for 72% of MU‚Äôs total revenues, and grew by 38% YoY.  [The company is improving its 1-alpha DRAM](https://www.micron.com/1alpha-dram-technology) to compete with Samsung/SK Hynix.
The DRAM market is expected to grow over the long term, due to rising DRAM use in smartphones, PC‚Äôs, consumer electronics, automotive and industrials. 

*Smartphones:* 
[Since 2016 the average DRAM capacity has risen from 2.4GB to 4.75GB (average of iOS and Android).](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/smartphones-dram-trends-2019-2020/) Micron has stated that 5G phones feature 50% more DRAM than 4G phones. It also expects that 5G and AI will drive new applications such as optimised video capture and editing, which will further fuel DRAM requirements. Phones are very much powerful PC‚Äôs living in our pockets now, and as software advances we can expect that DRAM requirements will increase. For example, think about how old iPhones struggle to run new versions of iOS, partially due to insufficient DRAM in older models.

[""Micron LPDDR5X DRAM to Feature in MediaTek Dimensity 9000""](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/micron-lpddr5x-dram-to-feature-in-mediatek-dimensity-9000)

*Data Center:*
DRAM is integral in servers, notably in data centre applications, it is rapidly evolving to support growing workloads for AI, big data and machine learning. Micron is working on DDR5 to support data center transitions to DDR5 platforms this year.
Data creation is projected to grow at a rate of around 23% in the next 5 years. This would require larger cloud infrastructure in order to handle this. Data centres are generally backed up by an SSD storage array, Micron remains committed to this through it‚Äôs NVMe SSD portfolio, and is introducing PCIe 4.0 data centre SSDs. As demand for cloud storage rises, Micron could see increased demand for these products. 

*PC/Gaming:*
Faster RAM leads to faster processing speeds. Intensive use of PCs such as gaming, video editing and streaming require better and more efficient RAM.
From Statista, the chart below shows increasing PC DRAM memory density, with the share of memory >[4GB increasing to 82% in 2020](https://imgur.com/w9w0xPq) 
(https://www.statista.com/statistics/781438/worldwide-computer-dram-shipment-market-share-by-density/)

*Automotive DRAM:*
Automotive DRAM only accounts for 1.8% of the DRAM market currently. However, advances in automotive tech such as autonomous driving and vehicle connectivity will drive an increase in this. The Tesla Model 3 has 14GB of DRAM, and next-generation models will use GDDR5 and are expected to have a minimum of 20GB. Although, the average vehicle is estimated to have only 4GB of DRAM in 2021. I expect newer/next-gen vehicles will continue to use even more computing power/DRAM, therefore increasing the market share of Automotive DRAM. Note that Micron are specialists in GDDR5 and 6 memory. Auto NAND accounts for 7% of the NAND market, [it is also expected to see rapid growth due to the rise of ADAS](https://www.eetasia.com/another-nand-flash-for-automotive-ota-ai-and-more/) and clusters of vehicle instruments added to infotainment (requiring greater storage capabilities).

*Industrials & Consumer Electronics:*
DRAM is used in systems/equipment in manufacturing processes. Industrial type DRAM is more focused on providing a stable solution for reliability. Automation and IoT (Internet of Things) is likely to increase demand for memory/increased memory. In consumer electronics, DRAM is used in tablets, wearables, games consoles, etc. This is the least significant growth factor but still important to note. 
Another important note is that the PS5 and Xbox use Micron GDDR6 RAM. Samsung and Micron both started producing GDDR6 RAM 3 years ago, while SK Hynix is still ramping up production. The PS5 actually uses Micron RAM (16GB GDDR6 SDRAM), while 512MB of SK Hynix DDR4 RAM is used for background tasks. THe Xbox Series X also uses 16GB of Micron GDDR6 SGRAM. 

**My Nvidia thesis:**

**I worked as a qualified IT Hardware, Networking and Software Engineer for 5 or 6 years, and am now an Engineering student at college. I‚Äôm a computer geek, especially for hardware. So I‚Äôm going to enjoy writing this part. I hope my knowledge lends to it.**


Although you won‚Äôt find much correlation in the [charts](https://imgur.com/o3EaSAV), apart from the recent semi-boom. Nvidia and Micron are very strongly linked. 


*Increasing penetration of GPU‚Äôs in data centres*


Recently, data centres have developed into the fields of AI and Machine Learning for functions where a solution is required via rapid iterations. This works well with GPU‚Äôs. GPU‚Äôs lend themselves perfectly towards [Machine Learning (ML-OLD) functions in data centres](https://www.eetimes.com/ai-chip-menu-expands-for-data-centers/).

Now remember that GPU‚Äôs are highly memory intensive. 
This is corroborated from the data specs of Nvidia‚Äôs newest chip, the A100 GPU just released, [designed for AI in data centers](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258419/nvidia-ampere-gpu-ai-data-centers-specs-a100-dgx-supercomputer).
[You can also read more here.](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/ampere-architecture/)

‚ÄúThe first GPU to use Ampere will be Nvidia‚Äôs new (as of 2020) A100, built for scientific computing, cloud graphics, and data analytics. Nvidia new A100 GPU will also include 19.5 teraflops of performance, 6,912 CUDA cores, *40GB of memory*, and *1.6TB/s of memory bandwidth.‚Äù* *There‚Äôs also a version using 80GB!*

‚Äú*Smarter and Faster Memory*
A100 brings massive amounts of compute to data centers. To keep those compute engines fully utilized, it has a class-leading 2 terabytes per second (TB/sec) of memory bandwidth, more than double the previous generation. In addition, A100 has significantly more on-chip memory, including a 40 megabyte (MB) level 2 cache‚Äî7X larger than the previous generation‚Äîto maximize compute performance.*‚Äù

I cannot find any sources (after half an hour of searching) that specify the exact manufacturer of the A100‚Äôs memory. However based on my experience, Nvidia consumer GPU‚Äôs use either Micron, Samsung or SK Hynix memory. Micron *does* manufacture the [HBM2E memory used in the A100](https://www.micron.com/products/ultra-bandwidth-solutions/hbm2e#:~:text=HBM2E%20%7C%20Micron%20Technologies%2C%20Inc), hence I suspect Micron is one of their memory vendors for their data centre GPU‚Äôs. 

I found that the Nvidia DGXA100 system (the world‚Äôs first AI system built on the A100 Tensor Core GPU, using 8 A100 GPU‚Äôs with up to 640GB of GPU memory), actually happens to use [Micron NVME drives](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/pdf/dgxa100-service-manual.pdf). See below:

*GDDR6X and GDDR5X memory in Nvidia high-end graphic cards:*
The GTX1080, 1080Ti, and Pascal Nvidia TitanX all used GDDR5X memory.
The RTX 3080 and 3090 GPUs use GDDR6X memory.
Who is the world's only manufacturer of GDDR5X and GDDR6X memory? Micron. 
*‚ÄúMicron has created the world‚Äôs fastest discrete graphics memory solution, GDDR6X. GDDR6X was launched with NVIDIA on the GeForce¬Æ RTX‚Ñ¢ 3090 and GeForce¬Æ RTX‚Ñ¢ 3080 GPUs (including Ti) to take graphics beyond gaming into true AI. Watch to learn how Micron was able to achieve incredible speeds up to 1 TB/s system memory bandwidth.‚Äú*

[Comparison between GDDR5X, GDDR6 and GDDR6X](https://imgur.com/fl8FY68)

This means Nvidia is dependant on Micron to deliver/manufacture their higher end GPU‚Äôs (as Micron are the only manufacturer of GDDR6X memory). Furthermore, Micron GDDR6 memory is commonly found in RTX3050, 3060, 3070 (including Ti) GPU‚Äôs. They are not the only manufacturer for this, but are frequently used, for example my RTX 3060 laptop has Micron memory, and my RTX 2070 Super has Micron memory. I use them for crapto mining, and the memory overclocks well. 

**Overall I would conclude as long as Nvidia remains strong/bullish, you can be bullish on Micron as Nvidia are dependent on them for their products, particularly in the high-end.**


**The AMD link:**

Although not as dependent on Micron as Nvidia. AMD [are using Micron GDDR6 memory in their RX6000 series graphics cards:](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-delivers-high-performance-gddr6-memory-amd-radeon-rx-6000)

‚ÄúMicron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU), today (November 1st) announced that its high-performance 16Gb/16Gbps GDDR6 memory solution is now available with AMD Radeon‚Ñ¢ RX 6000 Series graphics cards built on the AMD RDNA‚Ñ¢ 2 gaming architecture. Using Micron‚Äôs advanced 1z process technology, this latest version of GDDR6 enables up to 512GB/s system performance for demanding applications like gaming and graphics. Today‚Äôs announcement continues Micron‚Äôs rich history of innovation and collaboration with industry leaders to deliver breakthrough performance that enables the most advanced gaming solutions.

‚ÄúRadeon RX 6000 Series graphics cards were built to deliver high-performance, no-compromises gaming experiences, and the addition of Micron memory to the product line will help us meet that objective,‚Äù said Scott Herkelman, corporate vice president and general manager of the Graphics Business Unit at AMD. ‚ÄúMicron has a strong history of developing advanced memory products, and we worked closely with their engineering team to optimize GDDR6 for RDNA 2 architecture-based graphics cards, giving our board partners more choice and flexibility to produce additional designs for gamers.‚Äù

**Is Micron a buy right now?:**

For the past half year, Micron shares have been trending downwards, however this has changed in November. The shares trended downwards due to a difficult pricing environment for its PC memory products, and macro developments have had their part to play in the downtrend (‚Äòmostly the supply chain issues behind a lack of non-memory components which has led to some customers cutting back on memory and storage purchases‚Äô).

Micron has recently stated that over the next 10 years, it intends on spending $150 billion (combined) on Global Manufacturing and R&D. Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill believes this plan has brought questions of ‚Äúpotential over-capacity issues and whether a plan like this would be a large drag on free cash flow.‚Äù

Micron believes that ‚Äúsecular growth drivers‚Äù such as 5G and AI use cases should see increasing demand for DRAM and NAND. **I covered this in the ‚ÄòHigher future DRAM demand and how this affects Micron‚Äô section of my DD. Thus I think Micron is justified in this belief and spending plan.** Gill thinks it‚Äôs a good move, and worries are overblown.

*‚Äò‚ÄúThe current spending plan,‚Äù said the 5-star analyst, ‚ÄúWhen annualized and put into context, is nothing out of the ordinary and should neither cause significant increases in industry capacity (so there should be no resulting price wars from the competition) nor be a significant drag on free cash flow, which would continue to grow and reach historical highs as a % of sales.‚Äù‚Äô*

Gill agrees with Micron, in that continued demand for DRAM and NAND based on 5G/AI drivers is important to focus on.

‚ÄúIn fact, Gill thinks the company will have enough free cash flow to provide it with a ‚Äúhigh level of capital return flexibility,‚Äù which during cyclical sell-off periods, for example, could see the company repurchase shares. Additionally, should the need arise for ‚Äúcompetitive reasons,‚Äù it will also provide a ‚Äúsafety buffer‚Äù for more R&D or CapEx spending.‚Äù

Gill reiterated a Buy rating for MU stock with a $130 price target. 14 other analysts join Gil on the bull list, with another 6 holds and 1 sell, the stock has a moderate buy consensus rating (as of Oct 27 2021, I‚Äôll add more recent figures in the following section). 

[‚ÄúThe 47 rating InvestorsObserver gives to Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) stock puts it near the middle of the Semiconductors industry. In addition to scoring higher than 38 percent of stocks in the Semiconductors industry, MU‚Äôs 47 overall rating means the stock scores better than 47 percent of all stocks.‚Äù](https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/stock-update/does-micron-technology-inc-mu-have-what-it-takes-to-be-in-your-portfolio-friday)

**Has Micron Run Its Cyclical Course?:**

I will be heavily sourcing from [this great and recent Nasdaq article](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/has-micron-run-its-cyclical-course) for this section.

‚ÄòOn the face of it, year-to-date, Micron‚Äôs stock price is almost at the same level. However, its stock has been on a 2021 roller-coaster ride. It opened 2021 at $77.42, and hit $95.3 in the first week of April. Since then, the stock steadily fell until it hit $67-levels in October. It spent time consolidating in October before starting to rise again.‚Äô

This fall is due to Micron‚Äôs cyclical nature of business. The stock moves based on the demand/supply for memory. ‚ÄòWhen the world needed semiconductors, the stock moved up. Now, as the world is slowly opening up, there was a fall in its stock price. However, Micron stock seems to have bottomed out.‚Äô

The company has beaten earnings expectations in the last four quarters (each of), the company has delivered profits and has not disappointed investors. 

‚ÄòMicron Technology president and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said that the demand outlook for 2022 was strong, and Micron would continue to deliver innovative solutions. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the company‚Äôs guidance is $7.65 billion in revenue, with a gross margin of 46%.‚Äô

A June report by Global Market Insights states that semiconductor memory market revenue will cross $180 billion by 2027. It said, ‚ÄúThe growing uptake of Dynamic Random-access Memory (DRAM) in gaming consoles, PC hardware, and high-performance computing devices will support the industry growth.‚Äù

Micron has stated that memory and storage are a growing portion of this industry, representing approximately 30% of the semi market. The company also stated that government support would be crucial for its expansion plans, as memory manufacturing in the US costs around 35%-45% more compared to lower cost markets. ‚ÄòFunding to support new semiconductor manufacturing capacity is a must, said EVP of Global Operations Manish Bhatia. He added, ‚ÄúSustained government support is essential for Micron to ensure a resilient supply chain and reinforce technology leadership for the long term.‚Äù‚Äô

‚ÄòThe top three companies in the sector invest billions of dollars every year to manufacture chips. These chips are increasingly getting more complicated and expensive with every passing generation. It is very unlikely that price wars will break out over market share. The game will be played on quality.‚Äô **Refer to my section about GDDR6X memory, Micron is delivering TOP quality.**

Investors (regards) will have to accept that the company stock price is generally going to be volatile, due to its cyclical nature. However you can take comfort in the fact that the lows/highs for the stock will generally move up. ‚ÄòThe company has realized this and has purchased 15.6 million shares of its common stock for $1.2 billion during the fiscal year of 2021.‚Äô
[Here is a useful article explaining the volatility of MU this past month.](https://investchronicle.com/2021/11/16/here-is-why-micron-technology-inc-mu-stock-volatility-recorded-over-the-last-month-was-2-30/)

‚ÄòTipranks‚Äô Stock Forecast Tool indicates 15 out of 22 analysts have given MU a Buy rating, while six analysts have a Hold rating on the stock and just one has a Sell rating on the stock.

The average Micron price target is $96.09, which indicates 24.2% upside potential.‚Äô
‚ÄòA number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Barclays decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $110.00 to $87.00 and set an ""overweight"" rating for the company in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. JPMorgan Chase & Co. decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $140.00 to $100.00 and set an ""overweight"" rating for the company in a report on Friday, September 24th. UBS Group decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $95.00 to $90.00 and set a ""buy"" rating for the company in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. Morgan Stanley restated a ""hold"" rating and set a $75.00 target price on shares of Micron Technology in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. Finally, The Goldman Sachs Group decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $104.00 to $88.00 and set a ""buy"" rating for the company in a report on Thursday, October 14th. One equities research analyst has rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have assigned a hold rating, twenty-three have assigned a buy rating and two have assigned a strong buy rating to the company's stock. Based on data from MarketBeat.com, the stock has an average rating of ""Buy"" and an average target price of $103.31.‚Äô

**Upcoming Quarterly Sales/Next Earnings:**

[Analysts expect that Micron will report $7.66 billion in sales for the current quarter](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-mu-consensus-analyst-rating-2021-11-2-3/), according to Zacks Investment Research. The highest sales estimate of 6 is $7.67 billion, and the lowest is $7.65 billion. Micron posted sales of $5.77 billion during the same quarter last year, indicating YoY growth of 32.8%. Next earnings date is Monday, December 20th. 
On average, analysts expect full-year sales of $31.34 billion (for the current financial year). For the next fiscal year, analysts forecast reported sales of $35.60 billion on average. 
Micron last issued its earnings results on Monday, September 27th. ‚Äú The semiconductor manufacturer reported $2.42 earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, topping the Thomson Reuters' consensus estimate of $2.33 by $0.09. The business had revenue of $8.27 billion during the quarter, compared to analyst estimates of $8.21 billion. Micron Technology had a return on equity of 15.98% and a net margin of 21.16%. Micron Technology's revenue for the quarter was up 36.6% on a year-over-year basis. During the same quarter in the prior year, the firm earned $1.00 earnings per share.‚Äù

‚Äúvery nice rally after a downtrend breakout here on MU ! today we are approaching a big resistance zones on the RSI and chart.

We can break resistance and continue a rally to all time high next week, but I think we will most likely see a few more weeks of consolidation first so the RSI can cool off.
‚Äú

**[MU Long setup](https://imgur.com/ShnyQn8) - Nov 18:**
‚ÄúMU after correction, going for final push for W-1 of W-5‚Äù

**[MU TRADE IDEA](https://imgur.com/z3mjHUK) - Nov 16:**
‚ÄúUpside looks limited from here. Expecting us to pullback into a corrective wave 2 into a very buyable dip around $70. Be patient on this one, it's only getting started‚Äù My gut says this guy is incorrect tbh, given the recent push. 


**[After 200 days we can see a breakout](https://imgur.com/Vmhx9Al) - Nov 12, very in-depth:**
‚ÄúToday we will take a look at Micron Technology , a company that engages in the provision of innovative memory and storage solutions. Time to check the Technical elements on the chart:

1) From 2018 until November 2020 the price was inside a massive range until we saw the breakout of it and a 50% bullish movement from that situation towards the top of the bullish impulse

2) From April until today the price has been consolidating on a clear corrective pattern where we can define both top and bottom edges

3) How can we know that the structure is finished? Two reasons here: first we have clear edges (previous item) and second the structure has made contact with a key level, in this case, the ascending trendline.

4) Now we have a breakout of the corrective pattern. Remember that Technical Analysis is a statistical discipline, which means that we are never gonna have certainty about a situation. However, we know that if we engage in quality situations over certain periods, we will be able to observe consistent results.

5) We are not taking setup on this stock, (we already have exposure on other assets). However, it's an interesting situation to wait for a throwback (retest of a broken structure). IF that happens, we have defined an activation level as you can see on the chart (ALWAYS ABOVE THE TRENDLINE)

6) Depending on how aggressive is the setup you are taking, the invalidation level can be: FIRST below the whole structure 65.00 / SECOND below the throwback (this setup provides a massive risk to reward ratio, however, is prone to a quick stop loss)

7) Targets: IF I would be executing a setup here, I would protect my setup once the price reaches the previous top, which shares a major resistance zone that you can see on the weekly chart (2% below that, I want to be risk-free) / Now, the places to close setups on profit can be the first or 2nd Fibonacci extension . The expected duration of a movement like this may be between 200 to 300 days.

8)RISK: This is the formula I use to trade: I never have more than 5 setups at the same time NEVER EVER. And the maximum % of risk I take on any setup is 3% (ONLY with a STRATEGY THAT YOU HAVE a lot of EXPERIENCE WITH). Let's understand this better, most of my setups happen on the daily chart , which means that time resolutions are between 2 weeks to 3 months. Another rule I use is that my setups must happen on uncorrelated assets example: NFLX / BTCUSD / XAUUSD / FCX / AMZN . So my worst-case scenario is losing all at the same time which means a -10% to -15%. That's more than acceptable for me. And the most probable thing is that I would be able to open 4 to 5 new setups 1 to 2 months later. That's why this type of trading style is so secure. Even in apocalyptic scenarios, you would face a manageable loss, and it will take you time to develop new setups (you avoid impulsive trading)‚Äù

**‚ÄôI‚Äôm a regard that wants to YOLO options, what do I do?:**

*Disclaimer: I have a good history with options, but I only trade (for the most part) 1 month, or 6 month options, or 1 year or 2 year LEAPS. I would advise to go for LEAPS and shares for this stock - either ITM or slightly OTM. If it becomes ITM, you can always roll to a higher strike if you wish.*

*High-risk:*
Be regarded and YOLO to play earnings on December 20th. I would suggest either buying ITM 80c or slightly OTM 85c for December 23 or December 31st. 90c if you like crayons. 

* [December 2021 options chain](https://imgur.com/QD3ROzy)

*Medium risk:*
Buy 80c, 82.5c, 85c for April, June, July or September. Or if you‚Äôre regarded 87.50 and 90c.Play on the thesis that MU has a lot of value, will do well in December earnings (maybe), has great products, and that the downtrend is beginning to turn into an uptrend as I believe. I would suggest buying shares also.

Medium/low risk:
Buy 80c or 82.5c for 2022 and LEAPS for 2023/2024. Maybe warrants, if that is possible for you. Also buy shares. 

*My position:*
I'm a Europoor with a small account. I got up to $8000 from $1500 (largely AMD and NVDA gains) this year but I had to spend it on life shit. So I've started agan from $336, up to $551 now from NVDA and FB calls, as well as some daytrading.

$134.33 of 12.21 86c warrant calls
$69 of 03.22 90c warrant calls
$69 of 06.22 96c warrant calls
As of 14:47
(account value has increased to $620)
edit: Bought $40 more of 06.22 at 15:07, other positions have increased in value.

Yes I'm regarded.


I hope my small position assures you this is not a P&D (I hate them), I simply love writing DDs and am trying improve my skill at them (and share my in-depth research).



**Where should I enter? (options or shares):**

Look out for a mini-dip on Monday or sometime next week. Enter there. Consider using DCA to get a better average cost over multiple dips.

**Conclusion:**

I think this DD speaks for itself. Micron has great drivers/catalysts to drive the price upwards. It is investing heavily in itself. Nvidia is dependent on them. I am very bullish on MU after doing this research. I will try to open a position of LEAPS and shares as soon as I have the funds. 

**TL;DR:**

* MU bounced on Friday, perhaps this is the sign that its downtrend is reversing.

* Higher future DRAM demand will push up Micron. DRAM is used in Smartphones, Data centres, PC/Gaming, Automotive, Industrials and Consumer Electronics. Increased demand in these sectors will drive up Micron‚Äôs value. 

* Nvidia uses Micron memory in it‚Äôs data centre GPU‚Äôs.

* Nvidia‚Äôs ONLY supplier of GDDR6X memory used in higher-end gaming GPU‚Äôs is Micron. Nvidia is dependent on them for this high-performance memory.

* AMD are using Micron GDDR6(not X) memory in their RX 6000 series GPU‚Äôs.

* Micron‚Äôs downtrend has changed in November. 

* Micron intends to spend $150 billion combined on Global Manufacturing and R&D.

* $130 price target from Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill.

* Micron moves based on the supply/demand for memory.

* Micron may have bottomed out now, and is due to go up.

* ‚ÄòTipranks‚Äô Stock Forecast Tool indicates 15 out of 22 analysts have given MU a Buy rating, while six analysts have a Hold rating on the stock and just one has a Sell rating on the stock.
The average Micron price target is $96.09, which indicates 24.2% upside potential.

* [Analysts expect that Micron will report $7.66 billion in sales for the current quarter](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-mu-consensus-analyst-rating-2021-11-2-3/), according to Zacks Investment Research. The highest sales estimate of 6 is $7.67 billion, and the lowest is $7.65 billion. Micron posted sales of $5.77 billion during the same quarter last year, indicating YoY growth of 32.8%. Next earnings date is Monday, December 20th. 

* On average, analysts expect full-year sales of $31.34 billion (for the current financial year). For the next fiscal year, analysts forecast reported sales of $35.60 billion on average.

This in my opinion is a great chance to do just that.

*Centrefold aka Dream.

1. I trade for a living by picking stocks which look primed to breakout with a hold time of 2-5 days.

2. I also buy stocks whose business is on the cusp of a pivot point. A point in time where the business is likely to accelerate to new heights.

When this happens you can see a big run for weeks or months depending on how big the pivot is for the business.

$PLBY is on a pivot point and it‚Äôs Fucking huge. It‚Äôs hard for me to express how big of a opportunity this is.

Now I‚Äôm not going to bore you with a heavy DD as I know one was posted here yesterday so let‚Äôs just talk centrefold. Playboys competitor to Only Fans.

Only Fans:

Currently has 120,000,000 member accounts and 1,000,000 creator accounts.

It brought in over $2.3b in revenue last year with a growth rate of over 500%

They earn money by taking a 20% cut of users profits.

How much do you think a company producing those revenues should be worth?

Incase you‚Äôre unaware that‚Äôs 10x the revenue of discord for 2020.

And it‚Äôs 4x $DKNG just as another comparison.

Those numbers and potential are not something to be slept on.

$PLBY -

Current valuation: $1.56
Share float: 17.63m
Revenue: 200m (approx)

If centre fold (Dream) is a success then those numbers are about to 5-10x

The issue competing with a mammoth like Only Fans is getting your initial 1-2m member accounts and having content ready. You need the website to feel busy and you need content that people actually want to watch.

This is where 99% of social media start ups fail, nobody wants to join or be part of a dead site. Everybody wants to be where the noise and party is it. 

Can you seriously think of a better company to do this than Playboy? They have a reach of over 300,000,000 followers.

Incase you‚Äôre unaware this number is fucking ridiculous. It‚Äôs around 30% of the total accounts on Instagram. Which means that can reach 1 out of 3 people across the entirety of social media platforms.

We‚Äôre talking Amazon, Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat.

What‚Äôs more is those influencers, most of whom are taking part in centrefold have a reason to fucking promote it. The have a reason to get their loyal following to sign up.

Moneyüí∞- everybody involved stands to make a considerable amount of money.

Playboy has announced that they‚Äôve had overwhelming demand from creators and we know they have a reach of over 300,000,000 for consumers so have no issues there.

I‚Äôve also dig deeper into these influencers and checked their engagement on posts. This took hours upon hours of trawling through playboy bunnies and celebs. I know no need to thank me it‚Äôs all for the greater good. 

The engagement is outrageously high, their engagement ratio varies but came out around 20%

Baring in mind a lot of people will see but not like their posts so their wife doesn‚Äôt throw them down the stairs.

In my opinion the second this hits the App Store it will storm to top of the ranks and start trending.

Which means everybody is going to see it. EVERYBODY.

The press releases will hit and FOMO will get real.

Price target upgrades will come through as it try‚Äôs to revalue a company that‚Äôs just pivoted its business model. 

For the first time ever PLBY is actually making a move to compete in the 21st century and they have everything they need to do so.

If they are successful with centrefold and reach the same numbers or more of Only Fans their revenue and profit is expected to jump 1,000% +

They‚Äôll also be valued as a tech company rather than a licensing and clothing company.

I feel a $10b valuation with $2-3b in revenue is cheap but nonetheless good value.

If this is the case the share price would likely exceed $230/share"
qxc212,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qxc212/i_saw_a_rat_in_my_wet_dreams_dis/,I saw a rat in my wet dreams (DIS),43,22,2021-11-19 16:46:45,"Fellow companions, after my successful history of not that interesting, not that rewarding, not that safe, not that reliable trades, I‚Äôve come to you with a new one. This is a sleeping beast, one which will take us to the promised land, or hard rip our buttholes like my wife when she went through her midlife crisis at 20. This is it. I‚Äôm talking about the rat we‚Äôve all seen in our wet dreams when they do not take place inside Chuck E. Cheese. I‚Äôm taking about Mickey. And it‚Äôs time for Disney to revisit the moon.

The DD

As you may know, Disney shat its pants last earnings. The mouse and its bag holders, got satan‚Äôs dongus down their throats. Disney stock is sitting at the 150s and it has developed into an opportunity for all of us who saw the bad earnings coming to get into the Rocket.

Disney has existed for a while now and, though many of us have mixed feelings about the company, money and Disney have come to be synonymous. The company has acquired brands as ESPN, Star Wars, Marvel, and many other names which are recognized all across the globe. This is to Disney‚Äôs advantage as it has many catalysts coming before next year to explode.

The Streaming side, Disney+, Hulu and Spidey

Guess what? There‚Äôs a new Star Wars series coming out. Star Wars fans love to jack off to new lore and as a Disney investor, we‚Äôre here for it. Remember baby Yoda? Well, probably new merchandise and cute characters to buy which means I‚Äôll get to sit in the sofa again with my wife and her boyfriend. Also the new Star Wars Starcruiser looks super cool and probably will attract lots of people who can‚Äôt afford the vacation but go anyways. If this isn‚Äôt bullish I don‚Äôt know what is.

Also Disney+ subscribers are up and continuing an uptrend way ahead of schedule, in spite of post pandemic slowdown. New shows and movies came just after earnings including Entrelazados, Shang-Chi, the muppets and many nice shorts. But the best is yet to come with Hawkeye, The Beatle, Home Alone and of course, the Spidey movie, which will be a banger. Disney also owns Spidey merch which will blow up on Christmas.

Hulu is also up in subscribers by some millions and new series are coming and have banged like Only Murders in the Building. fuck Hulu though.

ESPN and sports

The mens NBA season is up (cause WNBA is irrelevant) and this is a constant winner for ESPN, with ratings soaring from last season‚Äôs and December being one of the months with the most viewership for basketball. Last year Christmas saw the highest number of viewers since 2012 and the uptrend is present at the start of this season. December 19 will see the G League winter Showcase and the Showcase Cup and December 27 will see the start of the regular season, with many sports journalists already calling out the rebound of TV viewership for the NBA, this is a great catalyst for Disney.

Another big catalyst comes next week, with NFL and thanksgiving coming up. The NFL is also seeing a rebound in viewership, up 9% from last year, and the thanksgiving event may attract investors as ESPN will be making a lot of cash from this date only. 

The online platform ESPN+ is also growing exponentially with 75% increase in subscribers year over year. Though some analysts do see ESPN as a liability for Disney, the sheer presence of the company in the sports platforms and current and future incentives may make it so cross platform growth is accelerated among all three Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. 

I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs other sports stuff going on and news that will further grow Disney‚Äùs dominance in the sector but I don‚Äôt usually play with balls and sports are BORING hence why this section was BORING. But for you jocks and Chads‚Ä¶ please stop contacting my wife she‚Äôs happily married and in a serious relationship.

Lastly, the real catalyst: The Meta

Everyone should‚Äôve heard of these little JPEGs making millions, the new form of art, zoomers‚Äô salary magnets. Non Familiar Toddlers (can‚Äôt say it cause I get cockblocked but read the initials). Disney and many other companies have embraced the concept of virtual art. Disney released its first official Disney collection on November 6th.  Of course they sold out. According to my estimations, in the past 4 months Disney has made over $20 million in the sales of Non Familiar Toddlers, exploring this sector with Marvel first and now with other Disney and Pixar characters. The number is closer to $22 million if we count virtual unique comic sales. Disney made $7 million just last week when their ‚ÄúGolden Moments‚Äù collection debuted on Veve. Not only this, but they will be making recurring 6% in licensing fees each time the Non Familiar Toddler is sold. As you can expect there are already sales worth $10K, of which Disney will earn $600 each, on an open market where there are more than 100 thousand Non Familiar Toddlers just in this last collection. In total Disney published over 585 thousand Non Familiar Toddlers which are constantly sold in the secondary market and Disney gets a portion of each sale.

Before November, Disney had only published collections from their Marvel products. This Golden Moments collection is just a glance of some Disney figures. This is, undoubtedly, one of the companies largest roster of individual, recognizable, influential characters. With their ownership of many major franchises and characters which are pop culture icons, this is a billion dollar opportunity that the company will be exploding in the coming months, and investors will start to notice.

Finally, with Meta and their Metaverse proposal, we have seen companies as $RBLX run over 30 points for just saying they‚Äôll be involved in a meaningful way. It is just a matter of time for Disney to announce their participation in this new technology as well. With concepts from Virtual Parks to Virtual Sports arenas, Gaming, Apparel‚Ä¶ you get what I am saying. It is literally imposible for this company not to be involved in a major way.

Short TA

I was going to make TA as well but the post is very long already. just know seasonally the stock moves very well on these months, has a gap to fill ending at 173 and it‚Äôs sitting close to support at 155.58 after a small reversal yesterday. RSI on the daily says it is oversold at a tad lower than 30. The fast stoch is at 10. Literally screaming please buy me Sempai I‚Äôll make those tendies!

The End

Endgame is near fellow companions, Disney is low right now but for how long will it be? Most news sources are focused on the new Spider-Man movie or the new Star Wars hotel. There is more. Disney stock will enter parabolic territory after the news of Non Familiar Toddler sales catch on. Moreover sports are being relevant again and streaming services are pumping new shows and getting new customers at a very fast pace. Massive FOMO from both public and hedge funds when they see how much Disney can make with just images online. Fucking tendies for everyone after that.

Position
48 DIS 170c 12/31
2 DIS Shares

TL;DR: buy Disney when it‚Äôs low, numbers are nice, NFL and NBA are relevant again, pictures worth a lot of money and Mickey fucked your wife thank you. 

Not financial advice or whatever."

What I am trying to understand is the relationship between the brand names in the industry and the investor community for that industry in the market. For example, Apple, it has a strong following in the social media channels and usually positive sentiments on the social media channels about the stock results in a price increase. Today's chart - 

[Sentiment increase --\> Price Increase](https://preview.redd.it/p0vfs32wkg081.png?width=1002&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c6524b36b7ed90e313f4d50f3d38439e72c4bb4)

What you would notice in this chart is that at around 9 AM today the bullish sentiments for APPL started growing on the social channel and this was followed by a price increase a couple of hours later. I also noticed the news about them accelerating their autonomous car, so that contributed to the social chatter on these channels as well. I saw this trend usually in industries where there are established brand names, such as Automotive (TSLA, RIVN), Entertainment (AMC, GME) and Tech. Media (MSFT, FB etc.) 

But at the same time, industries such as Marijuana, Psychedelics etc. do not really follow this trend. As I try to understand why? one reason that I could think of is that these industries do not have a strong established incumbent and hence do not really have a strong social following. Which further leads me to think that these industries are just scratching the surface of their potential market cap. Another reason that comes to mind is the percentage of the shares that are held by institutions vs individuals. So, for companies and industries where we do not see a price movement following an uptick on social media, would it be safe to assume that most investors are institutions and not individuals. 

How do you all perceive the social media sentiments and their relation to the stock market for growing industry vs an establish industry? Sorry if the conclusions that I have drawn are very basic and not thorough, but I would appreciate a perspective or some direction to learn more."

Tables of stocks found below.  My diamond hands are so rough on my fleshy...forearms. I can't type anymore.

# Observations/Assumptions

Before  you jump down my throat, these are simplified observations/assumptions,  not internationally agreed upon mandates from heaven. Okay, now you can  jump down my throat.

* Companies  with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a  sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies  missing one or more of those attributes.
* For most people it is impossible to time the market
* Stock prices have all available information priced into them.
* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.
* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)
* [Index  fund returns, such as the S&P 500, are now predominately determined  by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)
* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).
* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 (yes, simplified)
* During times of volatility, companies that had poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.
* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.
* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:
   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp)  even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have had  losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing in  that same set of stocks in the same proportions.
   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don‚Äôt want to support.
   * Due  to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the  index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when Tesla  was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on 11/16/2020,  forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up the price,  which had already been driven up by people buying the stock knowing it  was then going to get added to the index forcing more people to buy the  stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular, that‚Äôs because it is.

# Hypothesis

Using  industry benchmarking against the best of the best of the best  companies in each industry in order to purchase only the best companies  in equal measure should provide a well-diversified portfolio that over  the long term should be able to beat the S&P 500.

# Experiment 2020

750  largest US stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry  (Industry details available further down the post). Stocks were given a  score based on their relative percentage compared to the industry index.  For example, each companies‚Äô average ROE of the last 4 years was  compared to this index value with the following type of breakdown:

* ROE < Index ROE = Poor = 1
* ROE > Index ROE = Moderate = 2
* ROE > 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3

For  example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was  10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,  they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they would  receive a moderate rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would receive a  great rating.

This was done for all of the metrics below:

* ROE
* Revenue Growth %
* EBITDA %
* FCF %

The  relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there  was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth  only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be  decreased to 125% for a better distribution.

Any stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.

[ROE Example](https://preview.redd.it/t7l27u9tu6081.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f904309edb170cc8679189ea62f7bbe057646a3d)

ROE Example

That left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.

This  left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the  company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently  in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them  being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire? Has  WSB said it's a buy? Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason  that I want to exclude them?

That left 26 across 7 sectors.

**2020 Industry Breakdown**

These  26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and  September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total  purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.

2020 Experiment Results July, August, and September 2020 purchases to 11/16/2021

* **S&P 500** total return reinvested dividends: **49.09%**
* **My 26 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **61.53%**

Can we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.

# Experiment 2021

2,850  tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.  The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:

* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company
* Profit Margin ‚Äì shows how effective the business is at making money
* Operating Margin ‚Äì shows how much money the company earns on its revenue
* FCF Margin ‚Äì shows how efficient a company is with their cash
* EBITDA Margin ‚Äì shows a companies‚Äô operating profitability
* ROE ‚Äì shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money
* ROA ‚Äì shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits
* ROIC ‚Äì shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns
* Debt/Equity Ratio ‚Äì shows the financial stability of a company

More  metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to  determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to  median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of  the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:

¬∑  3 stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over  the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry is  then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that benchmark.

Each  stock was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the  metrics and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite  score out of 27, from 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the  metrics. The scores are based on how much better they are then the  average. I measured them against the benchmark using the same  methodology as previously performed: Poor < 100%, Good < 150%,  Great > 150%. Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the  particular metric to find a useful distribution.

I  also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst TICKER THAT SHALL NOT BE NAMED (evidently a stock that cannot be named because I was banned the first time I posted this) with a score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9 categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn‚Äôt match the original  input (congratulations on your reading comprehension), this is primarily  due to mergers/acquisitions or the stock being taken private. Another  stock was acquired during the analysis, changing the max number yet  again.

Here is an example showing Aerospace & Defense scoring:

Here is an example of the visualizations for the data:

I  applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at  the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock  that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a  high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.

Next,  I read the description of \~300 stocks and looked through their  financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off  their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly  leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that  Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns  Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them (how could you not?), no  there are not great synergies between the sectors of the business, yes,  they are aware of this. I also eliminated industries I wasn‚Äôt interested  in reviewing, such as REITS due to the need to look at different  metrics like FFO, Oil and Gas because it‚Äôs oil and gas, etc. These  activities eliminated \~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I‚Äôd  need to build a separate model.

I  then looked at each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made  the cut. Are all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are  the profit margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt  situation, did WSB say it's a buy, etc. Who deserves to be on this list?  This eliminated \~75.

We were down  to 84 stocks at this point. I then looked at each company's investor  presentation, annual report, etc. to better understand what the company  does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was not nearly as thorough on  this portion this year compared to last year just due to the substantial  increase in companies, 26 vs 84. My hourly wage at McDonald was going  to be better than my returns from the analysis if I took too long. I  only eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83  companies across 31 industries. Breakdown below:

I then purchased all of these in equal proportion in April, May, and July of 2021.

2021 Experiment Results April, May, and July 2021 purchases to 11/16/2021:

* **S&P 500** total return including reinvested dividends: **11.93%**
* **My 2021 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **14.26%**

# Industry Classification

* For Experiment 2020, the Sector was used to determine how companies should be compared.
   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.
   * This  seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each other  that aren‚Äôt really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE below.
* For Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.
   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.
   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).
   * I  ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further. Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less than 10  stocks. I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical issues dealing  with averages/medians that were negative. There were also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they could be combined such  as biotech and pharmaceutical.

# Notes

I  partnered up for both the 2020 and 2021 experiments. This was critical  for both expanding my initial idea, brainstorming methods to build the  model, and reviewing the work done for errors. This was a team effort,  and I by no means deserve all the credit or hate.

All returns are showing reinvested dividends in the total return.

Most people will say they are losing revenu and market. 1) No Recent Tech IPO is profitable, they need money to grow and the IPO provide that money those high growth company needs. 2) Wish lost market share, howerver they are implementing a lot of correction before squeezing the ads for the whole entreprise to be profitable. Still, 90 millions users on a stock that is pretty much woth 1 Year of sale is insane, My Target is 30+ in 2022. 

Here is few takeaways after last earning call :

1) 5$ is truly the historical bottom

2) Wish will grow to be a much better profitable company, with better retentention

3) We will see significant quality upgrades on the products in 2022

4) Wish is making deals like there is no tomorrow with a lot of company

5) Ceo and founder stepped down without any fight ‚Ä¶

 All the steps are in place for a turnover within a year. This is ridiculously undervalued. Top that with a ceo replacement and 243 jobs posting within a month, I would say things are moving in place and someone has a clear plan with this company. You dont hire so much people if you are not planning on growing üßê. Why is the replacement of the CEO important, because it means changes are coming :   ‚Äúif you believe that your company is planning to merge, or has secretly already agreed to merge, and the announcement might not be for several months, then the resignation of key employees can be seen as bullish.‚Äù  To me is very strange to see $WISH CEO steps down so easily, he seems someone that would fight until the end and we saw that on the past.. For that reason I think that we would have a buyout coming.. 
So let‚Äôs put pieces together. Wish has been posting a lot of executives positions on linked recently. A lot of the management team comes from tech and google. Now the new cfo Vivian managed buyout for two previous companies. Seems like wish will follow the track of a potentail buyout opportunity or a great future growth.

WM Holdings DD,114,69,2021-11-13 08:06:22,"WM Holdings is in my opinion is misunderstood and undervalued. I have been following the company since February 2021 a few months before it went public via SPAC financing on 06/10/21. Until recently the stock had a solid level of resistance around $12 and fell to roughly $9. Why is the stock being beaten down? Is this indicative of the company‚Äôs performance or overly pessimistic sentiment? ¬†I will dive into my take on this, and why the recent price movement and price trends are not concerning from my perspective.

¬†
I see the current price as a tremendous opportunity to buy and hold and take advantage of the cannabis industry without any direct exposure to regulations that companies handling the product face, and risk of product oversaturation in markets that growers will face post-legalization or decriminalization on the Federal level. I will speak to federal legalization, but what I mean is any material movement on the federal level, be it decriminalization or delisting as a sch. 1 substance.


Please note, this is not a get rich overnight stock, however, this is a solid stock to get in early on and hold through any movement on the federal side. Hear me out on this, because at the very least you should be watching this company.
¬†

It is not my intent to discuss the company‚Äôs generic background. I am not discussing their history of profitability and YOY growth since 2008. I find given their business resets in the US and Canada, historical sales and earnings are irrelevant outside of the fact that they are an early-market leader and have experience via early establishment in the industry. I am also not diving into the newer management and their autobiographies, as this is all basic qualitative information that is nice to know, but I find it mostly irrelevant, and you can easily find this in the analyst presentations linked at the bottom.

¬†
Personal Disclosure:

This isn‚Äôt financial advice or persuasion. All data provided is presented for discussion and educational purposes only, and most of all is my limited and subjective opinion. This is my personal take on what I believe to be an undervalued company. I believe the company is undervalued due to the companies‚Äô strengths, the lack of understanding on how the company generates sales, and the unreasonable hesitation of investors due to being scared of weed stocks. MAPS is different than most weed stocks, and I‚Äôll explain why.

¬†
I have watched this stock daily since February 2021, and have kept up with news and analysts presentations. I am not an expert by any means. I personally do not use MAPS  App or website regularly, although I have years ago. I have friends/acquaintances that use the app in the Los Angeles area for personal consumption reasons. My post is in no way sponsored by WM or WM Holdings or of any outside interests. I come from a background in commercial banking and credit underwriting, which is not the same as securities analysis or investment banking, thus this is my unqualified opinion. 


I simply see value in SAAS side of the business, and the stickiness of their products in addition to the competitive advantages offered to the company due to its high liquidity in going public, it‚Äôs early entrance into the industry, and it‚Äôs placement as an industry leader spearheading legalization efforts. The fact this company had over a decade of consecutive profitability initially caught my attention due to no one else in the cannabis industry having any similar performance or experience.

¬†
There has been a lot of pessimism around this stock due to the current price movements. I feel like this is just short term, and I am not at all concerned. I have ridden from $29 down to $11.91 with about 4,900 shares in my IRA, and have about 1,200 shares at $13.30 in my brokerage. This is all based on my perceptions alone based on readily available information. Invest at your own risk.

¬†

I will link at the end of this post the actual documents/presentations that I have access to.

‚Ä¢ Average ‚Äì $18.75 (114% upside from 11/12/21 low of $8.75)

¬†
¬†
Let‚Äôs start by discussing the obvious cons and get into the pros later. The stock has seen declines in price, and they‚Äôre not pretty. I believe this is driven by overly pessimistic market sentiment which is in turn creating opportunities to be taken advantage of. I believe there is an overreaction on future guidance numbers vs the company‚Äôs actual strengths and understanding the business cycle. Why panic over a single quarter that hasn‚Äôt been realized? Nothings changed in my mind.

¬†
Why did the Stock Price decline after Q2 earnings release in August 2021?
Q2 was the companies first quarter under it‚Äôs belt as a publicly traded company. Q2 Revenues increased 21% to $47mln (55% adjusted YOY growth). Additionally, Adjusted EBITA of $8.5mln was down YOY, and Wall Street was not excited. 2021 Guidance was reaffirmed.
¬†

‚Ä¢ At face value, Q2 information didn‚Äôt seem all that exciting for a growth company. However, there are important adjustments to be made to understand the company‚Äôs normalized performance. Earnings were down YOY, but this was driven by one-time costs associated with the 06/10/21 merger in addition to prior year inflated earnings discussed below.

‚Ä¢ YOY revenue growth of 21% was driven by inflated prior year sales from non-licensed dispensaries. The company conducted a ‚Äúreset‚Äù in its Canadian markets and eliminated ties with all non-licensed dispensaries via delisting from the MAPS marketplace. The company similarly had a reset in US business around 2019. When adjusting YOY growth to account for eliminating prior year illicit sales, the company saw a 55% increase in legitimate growth centered in US markets. This is material since the US market upon any Federal level movement will be much bigger than the Canadian market.

‚Ä¢ It is important to note that the biggest difference between Adjusted EBITA and EBITA is that Adjusted EBITA subtracts the Change in fair value of warrant liabilities which was $38mln at 06/30/21. There are other offsetting line items however, this is biggest differentiator between EBITA and Adjusted EBITDA. The company doesn‚Äôt pay warrant liabilities until exercised. Until then the liability is based on outstanding warrants and stock price at the time of reporting. Adjusted EBIDTA in my opinion is for discussion purposes to demonstrate what earnings would be if the company paid warrants at that time.

¬†
Q2 Quick Highlights:

‚Ä¢ Revenue: $47mln (21% YOY increase; 55% adjusted)

‚Ä¢ Gross Profit Margin: 95.93% (95.21% in prior year)

‚Ä¢ Operating Income (loss): ($15mln)

‚Ä¢ Net Income: $16.8mln (78.72% YOY increase)

‚Ä¢ EBIDTA: $17mln (67.90% YOY increase)

¬†

Why did the Stock Price decline after Q3 earnings release in November 2021?

Q3 was the companies second quarter as a publicly traded company. Q3 Revenues met guidance and increased 9% YOY to $50.9mln (46% YOY adjusted growth). Additionally, Q3 adjusted EBITA of $10.4mln was down YOY, but exceeded Q3 guidance expectations. The stock fell primarily due to Q4 Guidance which was adjusted downward to $50mln-$52mln revenue expectation ($16mln down from annual FYE 21 guidance of $205mln), and $3mln-$5mln adjusted EBITDA expectations ($17mln down from annual FYE 21 guidance of $50mln).
¬†

‚Ä¢ Stock price fell due to Q4 Guidance adjustments largely based on the decline of Adjusted EBIDTA.

‚Ä¢ Legitimate Q3 Revenue grew 46% YOY when excluding sales associated with Canada-based operators who failed to provide a valid license. Gross Profit margin increased to 96%.

‚Ä¢ The company‚Äôs net income of $49.2mln reflected a 217% YOY increase up from $15.5mln in the prior year. This was primarily driven by $46mln which came from the change in FMV of warrant liabilities. It is important to note that the FMV of warrant liabilities is represented as both income/expense on the companies profit and loss statement, and as a liability and equity item on the balance sheet.

‚Ä¢ While guidance on sales and earnings was adjusted downwards, anticipations are still that cash flow will be positive. Additionally, the guidance was for Adjusted EBITDA which is materially impacted by FMV of warrant liabilities which may be dramatically different at 12/31/2021 depending on the factors at that time.

‚Ä¢ The company is still highly liquid post acquisition of Sprout, and the parent companies of Cannveya and CannCurrent. This is due to June 2021 SPAC financing, which is really the only funding they could reasonably obtain, given the listing as a Sch. 1 substance. The intention was to prepare for Federal movement early to obtain an advantage and head start via Mergers, Acquisitions, marketing campaigns, and growth to generate returns.

‚Ä¢ The company‚Äôs largest liability is centered in Warrant Liabilities which is determined as of the date of the information provided and is impacted by warrants outstanding and stock price at the timing that information is reported. The warrants have a strike of $11.50 and expire after 5-years or if the stock trades at/above $18 for 20/30 trading days.

¬†

Alright, now that we have discussed the last two quarters, why the price has fallen, adjustments that should be considered, it‚Äôs time I substantiate my opinion.
¬†

Services & Revenue Generation:

¬†
1. WM Holdings source of revenue and product offerings:

The market has been overly pessimistic about MAPS since the start. Initially when the company announced it‚Äôs intention to go public via Silver Spike, I recall reading articles that spoke to it simply being an overvalued listing service. I feel this is a gross misrepresentation of the company‚Äôs potential and a lack of understanding on how the company generates revenues. There are two sides to the company‚Äôs revenue generation. WM Holdings generates approximately 77% of sales from various advertising products (Maps Market place, app & website), and the remainder comes from selling subscriptions to SAAS solutions for businesses. It offers both B2B (Business to business) and B2C (Business to client) solutions.

¬†
‚Ä¢ Q1 2021 revenue = 55% featured listings, 23% SAAS subscriptions, 22% nearby listings, promoted deals.

¬†
‚Ä¢ Advertising Breakdown:

1. Futured Listings allows for clients to drive additional traffic to their site through prominent placement on the WM marketplace. Keywords are priced at $0.49 per click which is attractive relative to industry comparisons. This currently accounts for 55% of total MAPS revenue in Q1 of 2021.

2. Nearby listings allow retailers to increase presence in adjacent regions/markets.

3. Promoted deals allows for retailers to showcase discounts and promotions through the MAPS deals page

4. Display advertising allows banners throughout the WM website

¬†
‚Ä¢ SAAS Business Breakdown:

1. WM Marketplace is the product most are familiar with, which consists of the company‚Äôs website and Android/IOS apps.

2. WM Pages is a listing page with product menu where clients can also provide license information, hours of operation, contact info, discount policies, and other information.

3. WM Orders provides reservation of products for pickup or delivery which allows retailers to confirm availability of products, complete orders, and process payments. (The latter two occurring outside of WM listings marketplace)

4. WM Dispatch is logistics and fulfillment software that allow for real-time routing for legally compliant delivery and tracking of product.

5. WM Retail is a retail point-of-sale system providing inventory management and compliance reporting functionality. The POS system is integrated with WM Pages and WM Orders.

6. WM Dashboard provides data analytics. More specifically, it provides insight on user data and traffic trends on a client‚Äôs listing page.

7. WM Store is an orders and menu embed that allows retailers to import their listing menu or WM orders to their own white-labeled WM store website or external third party site. This allows retail businesses to manage their online presence, inventory, and compliance workflows on the WM website and separately branded sites. This does not include product availability confirmation, final order entry, order fulfillment, or payment processing solutions.

8. WM Exchange provides access to the online wholesale exchange allowing retailers to explore brand catalogs and identify wholesalers in order to obtain inventory and manage customer relationships and wholesale operations. ¬†Additionally, this solution offers compliance features such as invoice and transportation manifest generation and recordkeeping. WM Exchange is presently available in California, Oklahoma, Michigan, Maryland, Missouri, and Maine with future plans for expansion as allowed.

¬†
2. Competition:

Competition such as Leafly, Dutchie, and others only target specific products that WM Holdings offers. While Leafly enjoys the same amount of Monthly Active Users, MAPS appears to be monetizing at a higher rate with a targeted audience more weighted on the west coast.

¬†
Competition does not provide all of the same business solutions, but most importantly, do not offer a marketplace which differentiates WM. The company‚Äôs competitive advantage is quite simple in that it provides a wholistic and comprehensive approach for the cost, compared to any technology solution provider in the industry, which provides more value. Additionally, they provide retailers compliance tools which is a key competitive advantage.

¬†
The company‚Äôs time in the industry has positioned it well for post-legalization/decriminalization. They have been spearheading lobbying and legalization efforts which will benefit them.

¬†
JNP provided the following information from 5 customer relationships

‚Ä¢ 100% of WM customers indicated low odds of switching vendors

‚Ä¢ 100% of WM customers picked WM over the competition due to performance

‚Ä¢ 100% of WM customers also evaluated Leafly

‚Ä¢ 80% of WM customers indicated spending with WM would increase in the next 12 months

¬†
3. Legalization Trends:

People always talk about how this industry is highly regulated, which is pretty obvious, but also doesn‚Äôt mean much at the same time for a company that isn‚Äôt touching product directly. As a SAAS company, WM Holdings doesn‚Äôt directly touch product, thus they are not regulated in the same sense as a grower/retailer. (Does Square fall under food handling regulations and risks? Does Grubhub? No! They simply service the industry) 


Additionally, CEO Chris Beals has indicated the company will never ger involved with direct handling the product due to the headache of risk and compliance on city, county, and state, and federal levels. This insulates the company from the industry as a service company. It‚Äôs also the hurdles Amazon has to overcome if they want to ship the product.

¬†
It is important to note that the DOJ withdrew its prior subpoena and does not intend to pursue further investigation into the matter. In September 2019, WM Holdings received a grand-jury subpoena from the DOJ which was related to the company‚Äôs prior listing of unlicensed dispensaries. The company had conducted a business ‚Äúreset‚Äù to delist illicit or non-licensed retailers, similar to what it has done in Canada.

¬†
‚Ä¢ Present trends are favorable for the legal environment with the most recent development being a GOP sponsored bill for a way forward on the federal level. This is huge since this is the first time the GOP has been willing to discuss a path forward. For the last decade, the same bills have been proposed only to die in the senate. This has changed, and both sides are at least open to discussion.

‚Ä¢ Prior top justice officials from the DOJ (highest ranking law officials in the nation) have discussed the great potential of legalization, and their expectations of this occurring. This information is available online via news articles.

‚Ä¢ The supreme court, while it did not directly rule on legalization, Justice Thomas in his dissent in June 2021 questioned the listing as a sch. 1 substance while every attorney general over the last decade or so saying they would not enforce. He stated that this was inherently contradictory, and Justice Thomas questioned the point of even listing it as an illicit substance when enforcement was not followed through on.

‚Ä¢ Recent studies have shown that the majority of US adults now favor legalization for both medical and recreational use. Record breaking tax revenue and product usage was reported in 2020, with trends indicating increase in these areas. This has led states sitting on the sidelines to now become interested in their own way towards legalization.

‚Ä¢ While there is concern about Amazon or Google competing upon federal movement forward, this seems doubtful based on current proposed legislation, and management‚Äôs prior comments. The company isn‚Äôt getting into logistics due to the headache of compliance. Additionally, so far proposed legislations on both sides restrict advertising, which is in WM‚Äôs favor, and will prevent Google or Facebook from competing. Amazon has made political contributions for lobbying efforts, however given the size of Amazon and their historical donations, this doesn‚Äôt seem as serious as it could be.

¬†
4. Valuation Assumptions:

Many of the price target estimates are based on unrealistic conditions that penalize the stock.  This also includes the companies initial guidance projections which did not include recently legalized states. Many do not include 2020 election results or subsequent legalization that has taken place. Many also ignore any future legalization whatsoever for base case discussion and apply arbitrary industry discounts as high as 20%, because they claim that investors are too worried to invest in MAPS due to cannabis risk, thus investment supply is short. 


I find this laughable, considering I do not see any cannabis related risks to this company. They do not handle the product directly, the DOJ dropped its subpoena, and if there was any period to be concerned it was the company‚Äôs first 8-year from 2008-2016 when California had yet to even legalize with Prop 64. ¬†For MAPS to be in trouble, their dispensary or retail clients would have to go under. 
¬†

‚Ä¢ Piper Sandler Base Case scenario of a $50bln US market assumes no regulatory changes, and no further legalization is achieved through 2030.

‚Ä¢ Key Assumptions for some of the analysists assume no new states legalizing in 2021-2022, new states tricking in 2023 and onwards, and no federal legalization through 2030.

‚Ä¢ Arbitrary industry discounts such as 20% due to industry risks. Many of the analysts utilize 15%-16% discounts.

¬†
¬†
Conclusion:
¬†

I see this company as the leading SAAS for the cannabis industry. It has us consistent performance and has gained a lot of experience over the years, but it‚Äôs gross profit margins are insane. I have yet to see a cannabis related company achieve their same metrics (MAPS is quasi-cannabis in my mind since it is a service company). 


Acquisition of Sprout for its client relationship management functionality is a positive sign in my opinion. They‚Äôre positioning to take advantage of states that are legalizing ahead of the curve.


MAPS has no risk in terms of regulation. The DOJ dropped its subpoena, and there is no more risk on that front. They do not handle cannabis directly they simply provide software solutions and advertising solutions to the industry.


Cannabis product differentiation doesn‚Äôt really exist. It‚Äôs similar to produce, you don‚Äôt buy fruits and vegetables because of loyalty to the farm that grew them (unless you know some farmers personally), because there is no differentiation between end user products. As such, growers are price takers. This makes them reliant upon MAPS as consumers have no brand loyalty to cannabis products. Traffic to dispensaries tends to be by foot, and convenience. MAPS benefits here since consumers use their listing services to find what the hell is nearby. MAPS has dominated the fractured California market because of the lack of brand recognition, and I anticipate them doing the same elsewhere due to their favorable client ratings. Clients even admit even though they aren‚Äôt the cheapest they provide the most value, especially with their assistance with legal compliance.


Additionally, no one else can really compare to what MAPS is offering. No one is providing vertically integrated solutions on the same scale, and in a manner that communicates across products. MAPS products work with one another and provide a lot of data points to wholesale and retail operations. This will put maps ahead of the competition who compete on a smaller scale against specific products. With MAPS dominance, it‚Äôs hard for businesses to leave. Their products are sticky and the more a retailer has, the harder it is to leave. They aren‚Äôt even monitoring their database yet.


The company‚Äôs unique strengths combined with their profitability and growth are material to me. Their monthly average users, and average clients are increasing quarter over quarter. Sales continue to increase as well. 


Everyone recently panicked over expectations of a single quarter yet to be realized. FYE 22 is projected to still be profitable, and I think it‚Äôs ridiculous to freak out over a single quarter for a company with so much potential. This hasn‚Äôt made the company insolvent or illiquid, they are very much liquid and capable of further growth and M&A. As far as I‚Äôm concerned their prospects are unchanged. 


It is important however, from a stock price perspective to keep in mind warrant dilution. Once the stock is $18 for 20/30 days that could impact shares. I don‚Äôt know what the impact will be. I have heard rumors about the shares being in short supply based on the initial offering, and how many insiders own them. Although I cannot substantiate it, what I heard was that if there was a huge run in this stock the low float would drive up the price. I can‚Äôt speak to this, the YouTube video is no longer posted from what I can see. 


However, I do recall hearing about notable short interest on this stock. I‚Äôve seen a lot of large volume after hours purchases, especially around the $12-$14 range. This stock typically runs on low volume. It has done so with the exception of 11/12/21. 4K shares driving the price up/down a lot. $12 was the floor of resistance for a long time and anytime it fell below it would shoot back up. Seemed to bounce between $12-$15 range for a long time. No idea if this helps, just my personal observations. I believe any price under $15 is solid, anything under $12 is killer. Considering the current price is hovering above $9, and warrant strike price is $11.50, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a hell of a deal right now, just in time for Black Friday.

this little company that has followed most of us since our first steps into the vast network of Facebook and flash games world. 

While some of us were casually farming crops in FarmVille, others had their first experiences with gambling on Zynga Poker. All of us had one thing in common, for a shorter or longer duration of time we were completely HOOKED. 

Sadly, over time this hype had died down a little. We grew up, we finally got cash to play much better games, that were actually less mindless than trying to figure out how to make flour in the most effective way or how to break up enemy racketeering shops in Mafia wars, without wasting too much energy points. 

That's when one very interesting thing happened though: smartphones became mainstream. 

Now Zynga as a producer of low effort games, that arguably could've been made by anyone back then, had one benefit. They had a fuckton of IPs that were very easily remake-able into the smartphone versions. And that's exactly what they did! 

As every kid, mom, granny and bored wifey that just didn't want to fuck her boyfriend spent hours and hours grinding the next farm building in-game, the advertisement money was pouring in and boy has it kept being fucking gorgeous. 

Zynga revenue stream has steadily doubled every year since 2018 till now. Currently we're talking about $700 million per quarter. Now you might be thinking: ""hey, wasn't it because there was a global pandemic and everybody was just kind of bored as shit? Won't they just stop playing now that the pandemic seems to be getting better?"" To that I answer you: yes, you're correct!

HOWEVER, (and here is the main reason why Zynga is the only interesting mobile and F2P gaming company rn)
Zynga is releasing a peculiar game next year: Star Wars: Hunters¬Æ. Now this game in itself is nothing that much new. It's a classic MOBA game with the vibe of Paladins and Overwatch. The interesting part is this, once released it will be a cross platform game.
Yeah, like Fortnite, and Hearthstone for example. And it's a Star wars game! And what's maybe even more important, it's the first proper action game title of the company!

This game in itself holds a lot of promise! If successful, it will open a floodgate of revenue, which in my opinion could double what we currently have within the next year, easily. Also the soft launch begins sometime in the next month or so, so that  could be a decent stock catalyst.

Now, if that hasn't made your deep down nerd interested enough, there's another bombshell: Zynga has made a couple eye catching acquisitions this year.

 First, let's look at Echtra.

 That's the company that has made the wonderful games that are the first two Diablo's and the Torchlight series! This acquisition just shows how much they want to move from the mundane boring world of mobile gaming into the incredible and colourful (and most importantly actually good graphically looking) world of console and PC gaming, and if not that then at least improve their mobile games quality to keep up with the demand for more technologically advanced games! 

Now for the second curious acquisition this year, and arguably financially more interesting one: Chartboost.

This company offers their clients a platform for in-game monetisation and ad revenue streamlining. It was ranked 6th most effective platform for this type of activity on Android in 2019, and it's software and SDK (software development kit) is used in over 300k games and over 40 billion game sessions a month.

With this acquisition, Zynga is basically building a vertical monopoly on ad revenue in their games (and a bit of revenue stream from other games as well)!

Now of course with all of this beautiful information comes risk. The company hasn't really been very good to it's investors. Since the IPO it hasn't once reached it's IPO price and it has been using stock dilution as a means of financing quite often (the most recent case was the price  drop from 12$ to 10$. But at least we know that they have been putting the money to a very good use as the acquisition targets show. 

In my opinion the main problem of the stock right now, is that since it is now rather obscure in the gaming space, it doesn't have as much hype behind it. And the shorts are having a field day. Currently 30% of all dark pool trades on this stock is shorting (Fintel), because it is easy and most of the people just hold, because they can't do much against it, and it's scary to buy in a situation, when all your money gets swallowed up in the often used dillution schemes. This should hopefully change soon though, as the earnings in Q4 should prove to be good with the revenue from FarmVille 3 and Chartboost as a solid BOOSTER (hehe) shot! 

As to what the analysts think, the current analyst sentiment is fairly unanimous BUY with the avg price of $11, which is about 68% upside in near term. And the justification for this price is mostly their solid acquisitions and their growth potential, which seems pretty much limitless! 

Now we have come to the end of this DD. 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk. 

TL;DR 
Zynga is a majestic piece of 60 carat crude diamond, which just seems to be growing before our own very eyes. The potential is amazing, and it is very much worth holding. However, it's a pretty high risk play as the company is pretty badly dark pool shorted with low hype behind it.

Ticker: RELY

I‚Äôve   been meaning to write this DD for a while, and with Remitly‚Äôs first quarterly earnings meeting having just concluded and the ensuing  price drop I believe right now is one of the best times for entry in this  hidden gem. While I don‚Äôt believe this is going to explode on some  large catalyst, I believe there‚Äôs an opportunity here for a movement to   the $45-50 levels in the next few months. We're currently sitting at a  strong support around $30. This is a fairly short and simple DD because there isn't anything crazy going on here, just a stock I believe to be trading at a tasty discount.

**Who is Remitly?**

Remitly is a recently IPO‚Äôd company that handles international  remittances. Remittance refers to transfer of money by foreign migrants  to their   home countries. It consists of several channels such as banks,  money  transfer operators, mobile network operators, and others.  Remittance   has increased massively in recent years due to businesses  involved with  customers & clients working overseas. The opportunity here is huge, there are over 280 million immigrants and the global  remittance market exceeds $1.5T annually.

Main competitors include Western Union as well as MoneyGram.  However 90% of Remitly‚Äôs business is driven by digital methods,  compared to 20% at these dinosaurs. Remitly‚Äôs users absolutely love the  product ‚Äì their app on Google Play has 285,000 reviews with a 4.8/5  rating.

RELY is currently trading  close to 40% off it‚Äôs IPO highs. The only  news that has come out about   Remitly since the IPO has been the  announcement of a partnership with   Facebook on their NOVI wallet to  power cash pickup in Guatemala. I  consider this type of partnership  neutral/bullish but it seems to have  been taken negatively by the market  given all the negative sentiment around Meta. I still do not believe that this drop is in any way warranted‚Ä¶

Remitly announced their Q3 2021 earnings on November 10 after market close.

* Revenue totaled $121.2 million, compared to $71.8 million, up 69% (giggidy) year over year.
* Net  loss was $13.0 million, compared to $2.4 million net loss. The  increase in Remitly‚Äôs net loss was primarily due to the $6.9 million    non-cash donation of common stock in connection with their Pledge 1%  commitment, as well as incremental stock-based compensation expense.

Today, I decided to finally sell all of them, take my profit and equally YOLO it along with 4/5 of my savings. I randomly selected these three tech giants: Microsoft, Nvidia and Meta.

*****
> Disney shares fell more than 5% in premarket trading after the media giant missed on the top and bottom lines of its quarterly results. Disney+ subscribers also came in short of estimates.
*****
> The major averages dipped on Wednesday after a hot inflation report pushed up bond yields. The rise in yields especially pressured growth pockets of the market.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 240 points. The S&P 500 fell 0.8%. The Nasdaq Composite was the relative underperformer, dipping 1.7% as Facebook-parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet all closed lower.

I present to you a very diverse ticker (META). This is an ETF consisting of many high growth stocks such as FB, AMD and the daddy of them all - NVDA along with many others. Please see below for charting. 

I believe this stock will be trading around $18 by the end of the week. Momentum has increased around METAverse related stocks such as AMD and NVDA as well as FB. While the idea of creating a meta verse is not new; it will continue to gain momentum in the coming months and years.

Metaverse/Omniverses will not be created overnight; however, we can continue to see increase activity surrounding these ideas.

So why is this stock so exciting? Here‚Äôs a brief overview.

# WHAT DO THEY DO?

Virgin Galactic operate in commercial **sub-orbital tourism and scientific research,** and have successfully done so on numerous occasions, most notably the inaugural flight with Sir Richard Branson in July 2021 - becoming **the first company in history to take a private citizen into space.** The company is currently in the late stages of its test flight program and expects to commence commercial operations in 2022Q4, largely due to pandemic-induced delays and test program precautions.

The company uses a **unique method of flight into space,** with a plane-like spacecraft being attached to the underside of a twin-fuselage mothership. This allows for a familiar and comfortable takeoff before the spaceship is released at 50,000ft, ignites its engine and ascends into a vertical climb at three times the speed of sound (2,500mph, Mach 3). At apogee the spacecraft then raises its booms in order to orientate and stabilise it for the descent, much like a shuttlecock, before simply gliding back to the runway. In the case of a flight abortion, the unique hybrid rocket motor is able to be shut down and the craft simply glides back in the same manner - making it an extremely safe launch system when compared to the parachutes and irreversible ignitions of every other company.

The customer will be given a **multi-day experience**, with astronaut training, preparatory flights onboard the mothership, accommodation, exclusive astronaut attire by Under Armour amongst other undisclosed activities being briefly outlined, in addition to **the company‚Äôs announcement of the development of an Astronaut Campus** during 2021Q2‚Äôs ER to accommodate tourists and their friends/families. Furthermore, in February 2021 **announced the recruitment of legendary Disney imagineer Joe Rohde to oversee this** as the strategic advisor, designing the customer experience and drawing upon over four decades of experience. This follows the **recruitment of ex-President and Managing Director of Disney Michael Colglazier as CEO,** to oversee the transition to commercial operations, replacing ex-CEO of ten years **George Whitesides (formerly NASA chief of staff) who will now oversee high-speed mobility and orbital spaceflight programs.**Other management and board members include figures from **Lockheed Martin, Warner Bros., DARPA, Boeing, Facebook, Twitter, Virgin, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Air France, and KLM.**

Following the trend of other space companies, the company does not hold direct patents on its technology but instead an exclusive license from Mojave Aerospace Ventures *(formed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and Burt Rutan of Scaled Composites),* the winners of the 2004 Ansari X Prize. Virgin Group and Scaled Composites subsequently formed The Spaceship Company with 70/30% respective ownership, and this became wholly owned by Virgin Group after Scaled‚Äôs acquisition by Northrop Grumman in 2012. TheSpaceshipCompany was absorbed into Virgin Galactic in 2020, making the company **vertically integrated in the design, manufacturing and use of its vehicles and propulsion systems.**

In its seventeen-year history, the company has received more than its fair share of criticism due to a number of setbacks. In 2014 the venture was faced with the crash of the first craft, VSS Enterprise, during its fourth powered test flight - resulting in the death of its co-pilot. **The company was wrongly criticised at the time** for distancing themselves from the incident by referring to the pilots as Scaled Composites employees, but the resultant investigation concluded that the cause of the crash was due to said co-pilot unlocking the craft‚Äôs aforementioned boom section prematurely, causing it to break up in mid-air during rocket burn while travelling beyond the speed of sound. Furthermore, the FAA concluded that Scaled Composites/Northrop Grumman did not create an adequate fail-safe system in addition to citations of inadequate design safeguards, poor training of inexperienced pilots and oversight failures by the FAA. As a result, VSS Unity was rolled out in early 2016 and featured the relative fail-safe enhancements, though accompanied by a significant delay to the test programme.

VSS Unity itself has faced some minor setbacks in the last couple of years, such as an ignition abortion in late 2020 due to electromagnetic interference in the on-board computer systems, which has since been resolved. This **additional demonstration of safety was well received by investors, and the stock proceeded to climb to all-time highs** following the incident in anticipation of the following flight. VSS Unity has since gone on to essentially complete the test flight programme, culminating in Sir Richard Branson‚Äôs notable flight to demonstrate the private astronaut experience, and will be in regular commercial service after the ongoing planned maintenance period. The company had intended for its first full-revenue flight with Italian Air Force specialists to take place in October 2021, but this was rescheduled in favour of maintenance aimed at significantly decreasing flight turnaround times from 8 weeks in order to meet demand while also ensuring the relevant components of ¬†both the craft and the mothership remain well within the desired margins of safety. **The company have repeatedly stated that no detectable faults appear present on either VSS Unity or VMS Eve, and these improvements are simply diagnostic and precautionary; being geared towards longevity.** Despite being a full-revenue flight, the company is treating the Italian Air Force flight as part of the test programme and will consequently demonstrate the professional astronaut and private research experience publically. **While the flight has been moved from the beginning to the end of the maintenance cycle, the overall post-pandemic schedule is on track.**  
The company had also received significant and unjust criticism due to an FAA investigation into the inaugural flight due to a deviation in the flight path taking the ship out of its restricted airspace, totalling one and a half minutes during descent, which was safely corrected. There was also controversy from a news article in The New Yorker criticising the company's safety record after it was falsely reported that a warning light was ignored by the pilots. The same journalist also released a book, 'Test Gods' shortly prior to the article's publication, and both heavily rely on disgruntled ex-test pilot lead Mark Stucky - who was released for undisclosed reasons. **The resultant investigation subsequently increased the airspace afforded to the company, and the trajectory is deemed safe and viable flight profile.**

In March 2021 the **company also rolled out the successor to SpaceshipTwo, Spaceship III - VSS Imagine.** Commencement of manufacturing for at least one other SS3, VSS Inspire, has been disclosed *(with 85% of the components being fabricated),* and previous earnings calls outline a desire to **expand the fleet to five ships over the next three years.** However, the company has since released plans for a successor to Spaceship III, the Delta Class, alongside a new mothership; **providing increased cabin capacity and altitude.** This new design is aimed at **scalability and mass production in order to combat manufacturing and operational costs and timeframes** due to the current designs being largely hand fabricated, and they continue to seek further strategic partnerships to aid this transition. The company aims for a flight turnaround of one week for Delta Class ships, and is currently in the concept design phase - exploring tooling, supply chain and fabrication. To facilitate this, **the company is also investing in a new Design & Collaboration Centre as well as pursuing an undisclosed strategic partnership for the creation of next-generation motherships, in addition to exploring ship storage facilities in preparation for mass-production.**  
VSS Imagine is currently in ground testing with glide and powered testing to commence upon the fulfilment of the aforementioned maintenance period from mid-2022, before transitioning to commercial service in 2023Q1 for research payloads prior to pivoting to tourists in 2023Q2/3. The intent for VSS Inspire‚Äôs completion is to be confirmed, though the company has stated that the focus is on a timely transition to significant scale and resources may potentially be redirected.

There is perhaps **room for the adoption of satellite launches using the WhiteKnight aircraft,** as had been outlined in initial concepts for both Scaled Composites Tier programmes and Virgin‚Äôs original business plan, though ultimately operations were spun-off in 2017 to safeguard the company, and the new company, Virgin Orbit, is expected to IPO via reverse merger (NASDAQ:NGCA). Virgin Orbit instead utilise a modified Boeing 747 carrying the LauncherOne rocket rather than the White Knight airframe. While it is likely that Virgin Galactic will continue to focus on commercial human spaceflight, the door remains open.

In the long term, the company has outlined plans for **point-to-point hypersonic travel,**detailed further below.

# BACKERS AND CONSUMERS

Unsurprisingly, the largest backer of Virgin Galactic is Virgin Group. Other investors into the then private company include **Aabar Investments (the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi), whose investment secured regional rights to launch future Virgin flights from the UAE‚Äôs capital.** An significant indirect investment comes from **the government of New Mexico through the creation of Spaceport America**, of which Virgin Galactic is the anchor tenant, having also transferred 60% of their personnel there in 2019. In October 2019 the company went public via reverse merger through **ex-Facebook Senior Executive Chamath Palihapitiya‚Äôs Social Capital** and has since received strong institutional and retail backing.

As previously mentioned, the company seeks to form strategic partnerships and has done so with a number of companies. In late 2016 the company along with its parent announced its **collaboration with Boom Technology to aid in the design, manufacturing and testing of a new supersonic craft, ‚ÄòOverture‚Äô, a net-zero carbon emissions airframe** which would fly at around Mach 2 with vastly improved fuel economy, operating costs and aerodynamics than Concorde. Boom is currently entering the test phase of prototyping and both companies anticipate the craft to be **operational by 2029.**Virgin Galactic holds **purchase options on the first ten units, providing the first mover advantage,** and this precedes an order by United Airlines for 15 airframes and options for an additional 35 by some considerable timeframe. Overture is **expected to rollout in 2025**before test flights commence in 2026. Aviation analysts **Boyd Group International predict that if the production plane meets expectations the global demand will be at least 1,300 airframes** compared to just 14 Concordes which were ever in service. The precise structure of this agreement is unclear, but it presents an opportunity for a significant revenue boost from a portion of manufacturing sales and commercial use.

Further relating to Virgin Galactic‚Äôs hypersonic aspirations, **the company announced a memorandum of understanding in mid-2020 with Rolls Royce** relating to the creation of new propulsion methods for commercial aircraft, fostering relationships between the two companies. This accompanied the simultaneous announcement that **The Spaceship Company had completed its review of a hypersonic aircraft along with receiving FAA authorisation,** meaning both the company and the agency are currently designing an adequate testing/certification framework for the Mach 3+ aircraft.

Notable relationships include **Boeing, whose investment arm bought $20M of stock after the company went public**, reportedly to align and foster larger relationships between the companies in the future. **Under Armour also manufacture astronaut attire and the materials for the spaceship‚Äôs seating,** and the company also **collaborates with Land Rover on STEM programmes as well as providing vehicles for operational use.**The company has also fostered **relations with NASA for astronaut training and research payloads** as part of the Flight Opportunities programme.

The company targets high net worth individuals and aspires to expand into multiple spaceports around the world, each with unique customer experiences. **Present opportunities include the aforementioned deal with the United Arab Emirates, alongside the continuation of talks initiated in 2019 with the Italian government** and the opportunity for **potential future agreements at initial planned locations in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Japan.**

# FINANCIALS & VALUATION

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that **the commercial space sector will reach 5% of GDP by 2040, totalling around $1.5T**. Additionally, in 2018 Bain & Company show that **spending trends favour luxury experiences, outpacing the broader segment growth by 7% with a YOY compounding growth rate of 10%**. Using figures from the Credit Suisse Research Institute, Virgin Galactic estimated in 2019Q4 that they will initially serve 0.1% of individuals with a $10M+ net worth (a market of around 2.5M individuals compounding 6% YOY; a few thousand customers), making them an **elite luxury experience with significant room to expand - let alone repeat business.** The company has also demonstrated its **highly selective customer process** for funnelling its expressions of interest into its Future Astronaut cohort through the time-limited 'One Small Step' initiative, then again adopting paid-up members into its Spacefarer community. This ensures that demand remains strong and manageable, and the company expects tickets to be released in tranches of 1000.

The company has steadily held reservations from their spacefarer/future astronaut communities, **having confirmed at least 700 sales as of September 2021 with a view to close the first tranche of 1000 ticket sales by the holidays.** Currently tickets cost $450,000 *(up from an initial price of $250,000 pre-Branson flight),* and the company collects a $150K deposit, $25K of which is non-refundable. This is merely a fraction of the $28M Blue Origin recently charged for a single suborbital flight ticket, and they are presently the only competition - though a vastly different experience. Both SpaceshipTwo and Spaceship III have a capacity of six passengers, at an estimated launch cost of around $250,000 due to hybrid rocket motor replacement - **generating around $2.5M in profit per full-capacity flight.** After re-opening initial registrations for the second tranche of ticket sales, **the company received over 60,000 expressions of interest.**  
The company also functions in both **private and government research sectors**, with payloads costing $600,000 per seat-equivalent. **This would generate around $3.5M in profit per research-only flight.** Indeed, these margins are what initially drove Chamath Palihapitya to focus on the company and also invest an $100M in his own cash, citing that they were unheard of outside of the technology sector. The company aims to generate **$1B annually per spaceport** from roughly 400 spaceflights divided between around 10 ships.

The company is currently pre-commercial operations, and as such is virtually pre-revenue which makes traditional valuation methods problematic. However, the company has roughl**y $1B on hand in cash and equivalents in order to successfully transition to commercial operations and scale**, and also has yet to collect revenue from sales beyond deposits. This makes an accurate valuation particularly difficult from a revenue standpoint, but fundamentally the company is strong in its balance sheet and maintains a huge financial runway to transition into a global entity, while the outlook remains incredibly bright in its technology development, vertical integration, expansion plans and consumer demand.

In my opinion this stock has been wrongly beaten down over the last year, and given the scope of the company I believe it to be massively undervalued. It is is a first-mover with an entirely unique product and a proven brand identity in an industry they are creating essentially single-handedly, and therefore I believe that in the next decade and beyond the stock is poised to be the market‚Äôs biggest growth story. Furthermore, considering their assets alone in terms of cash/equivalents, IP, assets, personnel and outlook I believe bear-case this is $25-30 stock in the current market. **Current analyst average estimates place this stock at around $32, with $18 on the low side and $55 on the up for the near term. The stock currently trades at $19.**  
Once commercial operations begin, I believe that a reasonable multiple in current market conditions can place this stock comfortably into a new channel between $50-$75 within twelve months, and once the company can execute on its aspiration for operating a fully-fledged spaceport generating $1B annually this stock will be $300 by 2030 (a multiple of around 90), and possibly significantly higher depending on expansion into other locations, the development of hypersonic point-to-point flight operations, and the potential to license and leverage its IP into the broader aerospace sector. Also, given the scope of the ever unfolding commercial space industry I believe that beyond 2030 this stock could ascend essentially without limit as the company continues to grow and expand into new markets.

TL;DR: My 10-year-old daughter showed me Roblox and I'm all in.

**What is Roblox?**

A few weeks ago, my 10-year-old daughter was begging my wife and me to let her download Roblox. ""EVERYONE has it!"" she bemoaned. After some initial hesitation, we let her get it with a few limitations, but neither my wife nor I really knew much about it. Since then, she's been constantly on it with her friends. They chat on Facetime as they play together until bedtime. My daughter's friend has spent over $300 in the last few months on Robux. (Which is crazy to me.)

30 minutes ago I had my daughter sit down and show me the app. From what I can tell (and what I've read,) Roblox is like Minecraft met the app store. Developers can make all sorts of games (from a haunted pizzeria obstacle course to a cutsie animal adoption game). Users have hundreds (or maybe thousands?) of games to choose from, all rendered in a Minecraft-esque blocky style. There are Roblux, (the in-game money you pay for) and in-game currencies for many individual games.

&#x200B;

**Why I Like the Game**

First, I have to admit the whole thing seems very kid-centric (more on this later). I'm as a middle-aged non-gamer dad, I don't think I'll be downloading the app anytime soon. BUT the whole thing is a platform, not a game. It's like an ecosystem or platform for games. (All you gaming apes are undoubtedly mocking me right now.)

I see the business model here and I like it. By creating their own ecosystem and controlling the monetization, they and developers are both set up to win ,and history has proven app-store style businesses can be incredibly lucrative. Finally, it seems like every 10-year-old kid is talking about this game right now.

&#x200B;

**What about the Metaverse?**

The viral term ""metaverse"" is all over the news cycle right now. Whether the metaverse in the next new digital revolution is beyond the scope of this post. But another ape a few days ago compared Meta with Roblox and made a good point in favor of Meta: they have more money to invest in this technology. While that is certainly true, Roblox has a product to market, and Meta does not.

When you look at the beating that Meta received in the press over the last several months, whether it be the spread of misinformation or leaked documents to the Wall Street Journal, there is no doubt the company desperately wanted to change the narrative. What better way than changing their name (and thus remove all the negative associations) and promising us the future? So, they changed their name and make aspirational promises for the future. But it's all aspirational. Nothing is built.

Roblox, on the other hand, has a product built. While I concede that it is currently kid-centric, I would imagine the infrastructure and talent is there to pivot or expand to attract more adults. If nothing else, I imagine they will soon be a target for acquisition.

EDIT: I would also assume that Roblox can really milk this metaverse term during the earnings call this week to attract more investor interest.

**Disclaimer:**

I'm too smooth-brained to know any details on earnings, revenue, and charts. That's why I'm here with my people. Maybe someone can enlighten me.

Also, if someone can explain to me why this is a terrible idea and will cause me immense psychological, financial, and spiritual anguish, I'm all ears."

NRG - an energy company with good dividends, ever increasing earnings, becoming more profitable by the quarter, a really good P/E, and surging revenue... it has everything needed to give boomers a hard on despite their ED.

Their most recent quarterly earning is even beating the traction of tesla, facebook, google, palatir, ect.

And this causes it to drop 10% on open? Am I missing something? Did the CEO get caught tugging the hog to iCarly and it just hasn't hit the press? This makes no fucking sense.

What's strange is how the stock has acted during the past few weeks. It's almost as if large swaths of investors don't understand how their business works and how TTD's exposure to varying facets of the digital advertising market is different from that of other players.

So what I have seen is significant drops in the price of TTD shares following earnings reports from the likes of SNAP and FB, which I understand are largely driven by concerns about changes to the Apple iOS ecosystem that make it really difficult to target advertising on mobile. The changes are absolutely a concern; media reports conservatively place the revenue losses at nearly $10bn this quarter. However, these barely affect TTD, which disclosed earlier in 2021 that they expect no material impact from the iOS changes (they have spent much of the past couple of years developing workarounds).

Of course, Google's earnings report and guidance demonstrated that secular weakness in digital advertising isn't as great a threat as folks might have thought. And (frankly) TTD's business is more like Google's than it is like FB or SNAP's. Which brings me to today's developments. It's difficult to see why TTD is down by 5.5% today until you realize that ROKU reported earnings yesterday evening and tanked. ROKU is, of course, a HUGE player in the ads space- it's the real reason why it makes and sells TVs and dongles and such. But their placement of ads and thus their ad revenue is HEAVILY dependent upon two things: hardware sales and adding users. ROKU apparently added new users this quarter, but its hardware sales tanked because supply chain. ROKU is also seeing some of its hardware partners drop out and it is seeing increased competition from Amazon in this space as well. TTD faces none of these headwinds.

I am fairly confident TTD will beat and raise and that those who have spent the past couple of weeks selling TTD on bad news from other advertisers are correlating things badly. They report 11/8; I dropped $20k in call options for 11/12 at the $75 strike. I may add to this today or tomorrow."

**The Setup**

DWAC is a SPAC which recently made headlines for hitting $175/share on the news that it was slated to merge with Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG). Currently, it is trading at \~$60/share (6x NAV).

**The Merger Target**

TMTG presented an ambitious deck wherein they would position themselves as the non-PC equivalent to Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, CNN, and the digital payments industry. They do not technically have a product or business plan. Because they presented no projections (they have no dollar signs within their deck), financial analysis of their business plan is impossible. They are also under SEC investigation, as the deal was discussed months before the SPAC listing

**Donald Trump**

Love or hate the man, it has not been fun to be an investor in or creditor to Donald Trump. Few, if any banks on wall street lend to him, as he has a long history of paying him back. His entire goal in this SPAC is to maximize value to himself. He can screw his bagholders and enrich himself by leveraging the current share price to argue that, based on the share price, TMTG should be worth more than it is under the current deal. He can negotiate a new deal, and reduce the percentage of the company included in the final merger deal.

**Market dynamics**

It has now closed above $59 for 8 consecutive days, maintaining a sustained inflated value for a longer period at a higher level than any other SPAC. [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DWAC/history?p=DWAC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DWAC/history?p=DWAC)

Currently there are 5.2m shares short, on a float of 28.75 million shares of common stock and 14.375 millions warrants . Current daily volume sits \~10M down from a high of \~500M.

[https://www.ortex.com/symbol/Nasdaq/DWAC/short\_interest](https://www.ortex.com/symbol/Nasdaq/DWAC/short_interest)

Twice, after falling, disclosures by congressional representatives have buoyed theses shares up \~15%

I bought puts, as nothing about the security supports its price other than Trump's association. This isn't Gamespot or Worldline, where the book value alone means the stock is undervalued. This stock is supported by the Trump brand alone.

TLDR- Buy puts

Positions: 3x DWAC 11/19/2021 65.00 P @ 15.75

Edit: adding outcome. Realized P&L isn't updated till tomorrow, but here's the history

The guys who said I bought when theta was too high ended up being right. I still think the thesis is intact, and I'm considering buying more puts on Monday (cost dependent)"

qly6ze,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qly6ze/all_in_on_meta/,All in on Meta,0,66,2021-11-04 00:26:55,"I‚Äôll cut to the chase. I‚Äôm all in on meta. Here is why:

Firstly, Meta is outrageously undervalued in its current state. I don‚Äôt care if they use ‚Äúunethical‚Äù targeted ads. Use your data to sell me things. I watched the entire whistleblower hearing and it was silly. Not only was she unable to provide specific documents, but her strongest argument was ‚Äúfacebook bad because it makes people feel bad. Government help plz‚Äù. The government was like ‚Äúyes this is a grave matter indeed.‚Äù They won‚Äôt do anything. The public will stop caring. In a month this will blow over into the dustbin of facebook‚Äôs reputation and the stock will naturally ascend back to the p/e they deserve. If you give them a p/e of 30. The stock will sit right around $400 (current p/e 23).

But that‚Äôs the boring shit. I really don‚Äôt care about that. After all, I‚Äôm ALL IN on this company. The metaverse is not a silly sci-fi idea. It‚Äôs going to be real very soon, it will accelerate faster than you can imagine, and it will replace reality as you know it. I‚Äôm about to explain exactly where this is going in the near future and the distant future. This is going to sound very dystopian, which I agree with, but I‚Äôm not in the stock market to be moral.

**The VR explosion:** It‚Äôs already happening and it‚Äôs accelerating. 4 years ago, VR was a silly thing. Maybe you had one friend with a headset and they had like a few games or whatever. 2 years ago VR was a niche market. With the release of the Oculus quest 1, more people could afford and choose to purchase a headset. But with the quest 2 and the way things are playing out today, many of my friends have VR. And owning a VR headset is no longer a crazy thing and it‚Äôs starting to become the norm. In 2020 steam VR saw an increase in user base by 30% and an increase in revenue by 71%. The oculus quest 2 has sold 8 million destroying the sales of the quest 1 by a nearly 700% increase. If this trend is set to continue. The next VR release from Meta, Project Cambria, will sell 700% of 8 million which would be 56 million headsets by 2023.

**VR technology is growing exponentially:** VR and especially AR is predicated on the ability to fit powerful computers inside of small spaces. Applying Moore‚Äôs law to the computer chip. It‚Äôs been a well observed reality that computing power doubles every year. Meaning you can fit twice the amount of processing power within the same volume every year. Think about that- *All computing progress developed by humanity over the course if it‚Äôs lifetime is doubled YEARLY.* The development of face and eye tracking is set to be released on a consumer priced Meta VR headset in mid 2022. Visuals are approaching human eye resolution, and VR is still in its infancy.

Okay, enough about current data. Where is this really going? I‚Äôm not sold on it, it seems kinda dumb.

**The crazy shit:** The metaverse is not the successor to the internet, it‚Äôs the successor to reality. Within the decade we will see the metaverse really take shape, then you‚Äôll begin to see the vision of where this is going with your own eyes. But if you want a preview, I‚Äôll show you.

1. The metaverse will be an exponential self-sustaining economy that will surpass the GDP of the entire world. Think of transactions in the metaverse for gaming, like CSGO skins. The skins are represented as NFTs. And are traded on the market. Your skins aren‚Äôt just for your game though. The metaverse is all connected, and you can take your CSGO skin and use it as an item in another game. You can take your genji skin and go to a concert. At the concert the person might sell T-shirts specific to that event which are also represented as NFTs. Businesses will begin to pop up in the metaverse. I already have several ideas, but will not be disclosing them here. Once people realize how easy it is to make money in the metaverse, much like the internet, there will be a mass migration. A gold rush like you‚Äôve never seen. I could easily see another dot-com bubble level of excitement. The economy will rapidly grow. And as the metaverse becomes more and more real, it will only accelerate that growth. As more people join the metaverse, more major companies will need to change their business model to enter the metaverse in order to survive. Which will be a feedback loop that grows to unimaginable heights. If you want to get rich, be an early metaverse adopter and start a company that sells a service or product specifically useful for the metaverse. The real economy will transition more and more to the virtual and there will come a day before 2040 when the GDP of the metaverse surpasses that of the real world. And it won‚Äôt stop there. Whoever runs the metaverse will have an economy larger than the entire world under their thumb.
2. What Meta won‚Äôt tell you about the metaverse: By the time you‚Äôve normalized living in the metaverse, you better not care about privacy anymore. I believe the idea of privacy will ultimately be discarded as the price of living.  In your headset, Meta will track your eye movements, your facial expressions, the way your body physically responds to the sensory input of the virtual world. Whether you like it or not, you are a predictable genetic algorithm. And when billions of data points about your response to input are measured, Meta will be able to build an artificial model of your expected output and know what you want before you want it. You might think, wow that‚Äôs scary and really good for targeted advertising. And you‚Äôd be right. But that‚Äôs just the beginning.
   1. Further future- 2030-2050: Once your being is analyzed as a data model (By an AI like a more powerful version of youtube recommended). At this point in time, AI has reached unprecedented capabilities. AI will build entire worlds for you, filled with things it knows you will enjoy, things you‚Äôll want to buy, experiences you‚Äôll want to have. A world far more interesting and exciting than the real one, tailored specifically to you.
   2. But your data will construct something even more bizarre. AI NPCs. Your best friends won‚Äôt be homo sapiens. They‚Äôll be AI indistinguishable from real people. Perhaps even alive themselves. Generated based on the data of your predictable personality model. Your true love. Someone literally perfect for you, will be an AI. And it will be incredible. You might think, *that‚Äôs stupid this is stupid I‚Äôm never going to fall in love with an AI*. You are wrong. And when you‚Äôre there and the entity is in front of you in the virtual world. When you can touch them, and they can express emotion to you, you will understand. Your utopia is coming.
3. The metaverse will change what it means to be human. It will redefine our understanding of humanity and even gender. In the virtual world, there is no need to be a human. Your avatar can be an animal, a robot, an amoeba, an anime character, literally anything. People will soon feel better represented by your avatar than your real self. And as we cross that threshold the real world will seem more and more lack luster. The real world becomes a boring place where you have to live with this boring body that has to obey the laws of physics. This will further push the transition to the virtual world.
4. The transition from sedentary VR living to immortal consciousness. As people realize how incredible it is to live in the metaverse, the race for immortality will break out more powerfully than the space race. What is the race for immortality? It means to exist as pure data. To upload your consciousness into the metaverse directly, to abandon your feeble human body and live forever exploring the virtual world filled with real people and AI. The ever changing and evolving economy and ecosystem. To travel from universe as you please. If Meta is a part of this transition, then they will own the platform on which your mind exists. They will literally own your body in a sense. Privacy will be so far gone that it‚Äôs a wistful wish of the past, nor will you likely care. Meta will see everything, will know everything you are, everything you could ever want. And they will sell it to you.
5. The Fermi paradox: where are all the aliens? If there are so many worlds capable of supporting life, if there are quadrillions of planets in the galaxy. If they‚Äôve had billions of years to evolve, why don‚Äôt we see signs of intelligent life in the universe? Why are we alone out here? It‚Äôs not that intelligent life inherently drives itself to extinction. I highly doubt it‚Äôs that intelligent life is so absurdly rare that we are the only ones. The solution to the Fermi paradox is that there is no reason to ever travel beyond the solar system. A civilization capable of interstellar travel is capable of creating its own universe- unbound by the laws of physics and the vast distances between the stars. A civilization that can shape reality like gods through the virtual world. To exist as pure data consciousness in a network of supercomputers. Humanity will never travel beyond the solar system, not because we will go extinct, but because we will never need to.

Meta is a company paving the way to redefine the human species, to redefine existence, and to redefine our future. Meta will own the platform upon which our lives exist. This world is terrifying, strange, unbelievable, but also inevitable. And it will be beautiful. It may sound dystopian, but it is, in fact, the opposite. To exist as pure data in the metaverse is the end of death. It is the end of hunger. It is the end of humanity as we know it. On October 28th, 2021, Facebook changed its name to Meta and announced itself as a company fully dedicated to the metaverse. A day that will go in the history books as a turning point and the beginning of the new age. The world is changing, and it will only change more and more rapidly. The end is approaching, and so is the beginning. And I‚Äôm ready to be a part of it.

EDIT:

tl;dr: 

\-VR is exploding exponentially

\-Meta is fundamentally undervalued right now even just as FB with out VR

\-Computing power is progressing exponentially which will enable absurd VR potential

\-A separate metaverse economy will explode like the gold rush and snowball to overtake the GDP of the real world over the next several decades

\-VR headsets will take your data and render and AI that can sell you things you didn't know you wanted

\-You will fall in love with an AI generated from your data consciousness model

\-VR is the solution to the Fermi Paradox"

This is not a squeeze on the underlying but rather a squeeze on your portfolio balance. 

Alright, hear me out. I didn‚Äôt even know there were already HIMX posts until after this was written. Enjoy it anyway. 

Hopefully we haven‚Äôt forgotten that we want to own companies that are profitable as fuck. I believe this play presents an asymmetric risk. HIMX is trading at 8.6 PE while competitors are trading at 28.57 PE. Fair market value is $25 based on multiples alone. 174.3m free float. Decent amount of SI (26.6m shares sold short) and 99.4% utilization. CTB fee rising. They also are a healthy company that produces a dividend. If a dividend is too boomer for you it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre poor and I‚Äôm trying to help change that about you so pay attention.

What do they do: Himax Technologies, Inc., a fabless semiconductor company, provides display imaging processing technologies in China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Korea, Japan, Europe, and the United States. The company operates through two segments, Driver IC and Non-Driver Products. It offers display driver integrated circuits (ICs) and timing controllers that are used in televisions, laptops, monitors, mobile phones, tablets, automotive, digital cameras, car navigation, virtual reality devices, and other consumer electronic devices.

The opportunity for additional upside here is that Himax has their hands on the future with virtual reality devices. They have MetaVerse exposure. This is lagging hard compared to other tickers who have recently exploded, and those tickers aren‚Äôt even profitable. FB is expecting to spend in excess of $170bln over the next decade making the metaverse possible. 

Apple is producing its first headset as well - ‚Äúa mixed reality experience that can handle games in high quality virtual reality with snappy chips and high end displays.‚Äù

Think: Ready Player One

Big tech is investing big money into this space and whether we lack the vision for it or not, it‚Äôs happening. They‚Äôve already created new position titles at their respected companies to get ahead of this curve. Source: trust me bro. This space is going to create an even higher demand for semi conductor companies let alone those who produce micro displays. We are entering the next evolution of the internet.

But don‚Äôt just listen to me, Fintel claims HIMX to be undervalued and have a high ranking for the company. 90.04 score in their quality metric and 77.9 in value. Recent articles suggest it‚Äôs one of the few Taiwanese tickers to own, presenting value and growth. 


Financials:

‚ÄúFor the third quarter, the Company expects further revenue growth from the already high level of Q2 2021. Gross margin shall see another uptick and could reach another quarterly high. With the increases of both revenue and margin, Himax anticipates net profit shall increase substantially in the third quarter.‚Äù Massive flex, ok.

Third quarter projections: the company is expecting net revenues to increase 13-17%. 

Positions cost distribution: 
26% shareholders are profitable. Sitting on top of a volume shelf looking to move up. 12.3 and 13.94 are the next two largest areas of supply. 

Q2 Total Revenue: 365.26m up 95.43% YoY. 
Q2 Net Income: 108.89 an 7,773.54% increase YoY.
EPS: .62 which is 7,690.00% YoY. The median for its sector is .47. 
ROE: 18.68% which is 5,737.00% YoY. The Semiconductor sector median is 2.79%. 

Those numbers are so good you‚Äôd think I was tripping on acid. Fact check it. Me being high as balls right now has nothing to do with it. Fuckin seahorse sea hell.

Total debt: HIMX has $159.5m in debt, which is down from $222.4m reported a year ago. They also have $270.4m in cash to offset the debt. This leaves the company $110.9m in net cash. 

Cash flow: 89% of its EBIT 

Dividend: .262
Dividend Yield: 2.53%

Technicals: found hard support at $9.6 and is testing its daily resistance of $11.32. A daily close above this price would present a pivot point. Key areas of resistance past this point would be $14.61 and volume shelf where bag-holders lie waiting, although not many. Institutions are holding at higher prices. 

MACD has crossed, bands are squeezing - haven‚Äôt been this tight since your mom birthed you crotch goblins. We also have a 9EMA/21MA crossover signaling bullish trend reversal. 

Options: call activity has been bullish recently. Recent sweepers into the 11/19 12c. 

**TLDR: future proof conductor company prints hard as fuck right now and in the future. Jan 8c 2022 / 30c 2023 buys you lambo equipped with HIMX shit.**

ER Thursday before the bell. I don‚Äôt want you to get IV crushed but do your thing. I have shares, Jan 8c 2022 and Jan 30c 2023, with intentions of exercising. 

For transparency, this is 15% of the weight of my portfolio and I‚Äôm green 11%. I will not sell below fair market value. Godspeed retards."

Trying again with discussion. Let me know if there is another flair (or another subreddit) that would be more appropriate.]

I do not have a position because I do not know all the ins and outs on insider trading rules. So I am posting it here to make it not insider information. This is all thirdhand information from somebody that doesn't have a full view of the company. He probably doesn't know what he's talking about. That would mean I definitely don't know what I am talking about. You shouldn't trade on any of the following information. That would be silly.

The CEO and People & Culture (HR) bigwigs are going around middle management and pushing hard on vaccine status attestation. They will almost certainly be going hard on vaccines themselves soon. Things have come to a head and the bigwigs have put those unwilling to attest to vaccination status on leave-without-pay. It probably only affected a handful of the most artistic programmers.

They have done this without consulting the project managers. The affected project managers are going to have a hard time getting their projects done with some of their most artistic employees pulled from the team suddenly. My understanding is there was no planning for this. Upper management seems to assume programmers are a commodity. I suspect they are not. I am assuming antivaxxers skew artistic in the programming world. Just based on past experience, good programmers are not in-the-box-thinkers, they tend to think they are smarter than everybody else about everything, and are the most likely not to respond well to ""do this because I said so"" stuff. Viasat hasn't gotten to the get-vaxxed-or-get-out point. But it seems like that is likely going to be coming soon. And when it does, they will be sidelining many more of their most artistic programmers.

I know many think the company is going to eat it when Starlink comes out. I don't know about that. What Starlink is trying to do is hard. But I am saying that a handful of been-vaxxed-so-much-they-already-got-artism-so-bad-they-don't-even-want-to-say-if-they-drank-the-Fauci-juice-or-not programmers are locked out. I suspect Viasat is planning on locking out or repurposing other slightly-less-artistic-but-still-pretty-artistic programmers for not being vaxxed. And Viasat thinks this won't be such a big deal because they plan on rearranging the workforce because C-suite managers think that's no big deal with programming projects. I think that means Viasat is prolly going to eat some shit you weren't expecting. Because what Viasat does is hard and programmers are not commodities. And Viasat is pulling off something like a 1941 Red Army Purge right before the Starlink competition kicks off and the Viasat-3 launch.

They probably aren't going to zero or anything. But the bigwigs are playing chicken with artists who think they know more than Fauci and the bigwigs are fixing to find out. It seems project managers aren't being consulted regarding how big of a mess this is creating. It's an American Airlines/Southwest-type situation with upper management and the customers unaware that flights are going to be delayed."

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/58ln5iz341x71.png?width=655&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0ed3cc87eea6d3ec79f3dbd283c4451ca94e810

Of most interest to us is Revenue and Sales and Marketing.

What is Revenue? It is GMV of all stuff they sold through the marketplace + ProductBoost (aka ads) + Logistics revenue.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/om6s0wu741x71.png?width=765&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7a087ef4c770f0b8453334469698ba8cdfb7a58

Sales and marketing is mostly ads they buy, mostly on Facebook and is equal to $396M in Q2.

From what I see on the screenshot below, in July they've started to decrease ads spend and winded it down to \~400K installs per week.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kfcsd6f941x71.png?width=1166&format=png&auto=webp&s=83b22bf940141d070a20ccebd3c44047c1f51af4

Compared to average 2.5M installs/week in Q2 it is almost 6 times less in S&M expenses in Q3. So instead of $400M, S&M in Q3 should be around $70-80M.

The key question here is whether the overall Revenue will fall accordingly, and I don't remember them sharing any cohorts statistics or any details that will help us understand this, but I believe it shouldn't fall significantly less than $400M, as with the decreased spend they stopped buying ROI-negative customers and only getting those who are willing to spend.

Taking this into account, I don't understand why RH shows estimated earnings per share at negative $0.14. If Cost of Revenue will stay at 30%-40% of Revenue and no other surprises will emerge, their bottom line should be positive. Any ideas where I may be wrong?"

\- Traders weighed dismal results and bond-market gyrations amid fears about inflation and monetary tightening, and equities in the US rose.

\- After opening lower on disappointing results from Amazon.com and Apple, the S&P 500 climbed less than 0.2%. The advances sent the benchmark index up 6.9% in October, its highest monthly rise since November last year. Meanwhile, advances in Tesla and Meta platforms after its name change from facebook propelled the Nasdaq 100 up by 0.5%.

\- Inflationary pressures and the likelihood of interest-rate hikes shook bond markets around the world. The 10-year treasury rate has dropped to 1.56%. In Europe, bonds fell further after data on eurozone economic growth and inflation beat analysts' expectations, underscoring a growing belief that interest-rate hikes are on the way despite only a mild pushback from the ECB's leader.

\- A number of crosscurrents are having an effect on the markets. Positive corporate performance has aided in the support of global equities. However, supply-chain snarls and higher-cost raw materials are raising expectations for rate hikes and lowering the economic outlook.

\- The latest GDP data from the United States shows that growth slowed more than predicted in the third quarter, hurt by supply chains and an increase of COVID-19 infections. In addition, weekly unemployment claims fell to a pandemic low in September, but personal spending slowed in line with analysts' expectations.

\- Despite reversing losses, the Stoxx Europe 600 index gained for the fourth week in a row. The value of the US dollar increased. Crude oil gained.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 1st, 2021.

# **Markets could be challenged in the week ahead as the Fed prepares to reverse easy policy - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/29/markets-could-be-challenged-in-the-week-ahead-as-the-fed-prepares-to-reverse-easy-policy.html)**
*****
> The Federal Reserve is expected to take its first major step away from the easy policy it put in place to fight the pandemic, a milestone on the road back toward normal.
*****
> The Fed‚Äôs two-day meeting Tuesday and Wednesday is the big event for markets in the week ahead. The central bank is widely expected to announce that it will begin to unwind its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases and end the program entirely by the middle of next year.
*****
> Economic data will also be important, with the October jobs report on Friday. There are dozens of earnings expected, including pharmaceuticals like Pfizer and Moderna, as well as a host of travel, energy, insurance, and tech companies.
*****
> The Bank of England also meets Thursday, and it is expected to raise interest rates. The move comes after rate hikes by South Korea, Norway and others.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe Fed is part of a global move to remove accommodation, and the market drives right past that,‚Äù Bleakley Advisory Group CIO Peter Boockvar said. ‚ÄúIn a way, the stock market is playing a game of chicken, with this inflation move and interest rates and the response from central banks.‚Äù
*****
> Inflation has been running at a 30-year high. Core PCE inflation ‚Äî which is the Fed‚Äôs preferred gauge ‚Äîjumped 3.6% in September on a year-over-year basis, the same as in August.
*****
> Stocks were higher on the week, with the S&P 500 up about 1.1% as of Friday afternoon and up roughly 6.7% for the month of October. Both the Dow and S&P 500 notched new highs in the past week. The widely watched 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.53% Friday afternoon.
*****
> ‚ÄúThere is an incredible level of complacency out there in this environment,‚Äù Boockvar said.
*****
> Other events the markets are monitoring include the gathering of world leaders at the G-20 in Italy and the United Nations climate summit COP26, beginning Sunday in Scotland.
*****
> # ‚ÄòWild week‚Äô
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to have a wild week,‚Äù Wells Fargo‚Äôs Michael Schumacher said. He noted that the Fed‚Äôs action will dominate the week, and the jobs report will be secondary.
*****
> Wells Fargo economists expect 390,000 jobs were added in October and average hourly earnings grew by 0.4%, he noted. Payrolls were up just 194,000 in September. Schumacher said inflation is the biggest concern in the markets, so the wage data will be most closely watched.
*****
> Schumacher said the market is widely expecting the Fed to announce it will reduce its bond purchases by $15 billion a month, starting either in November or December. The central bank implemented its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program in early 2020, as it slashed rates and introduced programs to buy a range of assets to help keep the markets liquid.
*****
> Now, as the program is being wound down, it is what Fed Chairman Jerome Powell says about inflation that matters most because that will drive interest rate expectations.
*****
> Yet, Powell is expected to stress that the Fed is not automatically going to raise interest rates once the bond purchases end in the middle of next year. Traders are pricing in as many as three interest rate hikes next year, but in the latest Fed forecast, only half of central bank officials agreed there should be even one.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe inflation commentary is a lot more important,‚Äù Schumacher said. ‚ÄúPowell has sounded concerned about expectations getting baked in.‚Äù He noted that the 2-year yield, which most reflects the Fed, has risen more than 30 basis points since the last Fed meeting five weeks ago.
*****
> Schumacher said market expectations for rate hikes may be overdone, and that he does not expect a move until the beginning of 2023. ‚ÄúThe direction is right, but the speed is wrong,‚Äù he said.
*****
> Powell‚Äôs comments will be closely watched for any adjustment in his thinking on inflation. The Fed had described the surge in rates as ‚Äútransitory‚Äù or temporary. The consumer price index has been running above 5%, and core CPI was at 4% in September.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe general feeling among central bankers and the major central banks is this inflation rate will come back down,‚Äù TIAA Bank president of world markets Chris Gaffney said. ‚ÄúNobody is using ‚Äòtransitory‚Äô anymore, but they don‚Äôt feel like we‚Äôre going to have prolonged high inflation.‚Äù
*****
> Gaffney said the weaker-than-expected 2% growth in third-quarter gross domestic product could help the Fed convince the markets that it intends to keep rates lower for longer.
*****
> ‚ÄúAs long as they stay accommodative, I think the recovery continues,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fairly bullish for the markets going forward. We‚Äôll certainly see a lot more choppiness, but I still think the global economy, the U.S. economy particularly, is right now a great environment for corporations. We‚Äôre seeing fairly positive earnings reports, and more importantly expectations for future earnings.‚Äù
*****
> There have been some high-profile misses, including both Apple and Amazon this past week. Both their stocks fell, weighing on the Nasdaq down Friday.
*****
> ‚ÄúEarnings overall have been good, but there‚Äôs still a lot of profit margin challenges out there,‚Äù Boockvar said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no better example than Apple and Amazon.‚Äù

> # November‚Äôs First Trading Day: DJIA Up Over 1% Three Years in a Row

> Based upon data in the 2022 Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac on page 90, the first trading day of November is the fourth best of all monthly first trading days since September 1997 based upon total DJIA point gained. DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ have all advanced 13 times over the last 21 years. Average performance on the day ranges from a low of 0.17% by S&P 500 to 0.28% by NASDAQ over the 21-year time period.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0362ad93159683f932d60b790bfa9ac8/e57961a120ac1354-3a/s500x750/517dc1575ee1212443153f2b842289d3b9eda639.jpg))**

> # Here Comes One of the Best Days of the Year (and the Best Week and Month)

> The calendar is about to do a lot of favors for the bulls, as late October and early November historically are quite strong.

> October 28 was the best day of the year, until it fell more than 3% last year, but this day is still one of the strongest days historically for stocks. Not to be outdone though, October 29 and November 2 and 3 are also some of the better days of the year. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to think it has something to do with my birthday being on October 28, but the truth is bulls should be aware that the coming days are historically some of the best of the year,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.27.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the single best day to buy at the close and hold for the next five trading days is today, October 27. Yes, these 5 days were lower last year by 0.6%, but you have to go back to the late 1960s to see the last time they were down two years in a row.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.27.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Lastly, November has been quite strong historically. In fact, since 1950, and the past 10 years, it is the best month of the year, while it ranks second over the past 20 years and during a post-election year. ‚ÄúNovember is the best month of the year, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to get nearly as much love as you‚Äôd think,‚Äù added Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúWe all assume December is the best month, but November is actually better and gets very little fanfare. Maybe it should be a month for the bulls, not for turkeys.‚Äù

> # Year‚Äôs Best 3-Month Span About To Start

> November, December and January constitute the year‚Äôs seasonally strongest 3-month period for the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrials and the NASDAQ Composite. This seasonal strength is created by a combination of the annual, semiannual and quarterly operations of institutions and the habitual behavior of retail investors and consumers.

> The November-January 3-month span has produced a gain of 4.3% for the S&P 500 & DJIA since 1949. October-December runs a close second at 4.1% for S&P and 3.9% for DJIA. Since 1971 NASDAQ has gained a whopping 6.3% November-January with December-February in second at 5.0% and October-December in third at4.4%.

> These charts also highlight the Best and Worst Months of the year with the Best running from October/November to April/May/June and the Worst from May/June/July to September/October. Stocks have been firming up since we issued our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal to subscribers on October 8 and look poised for a solid yearend rally that continues into early 2022.

> # Short Term Breadth Takes Off

> One of the points noted about the recent moves for the S&P 500 over the past few days have been on the outsized impacts of big gains or losses in names like Tesla (TSLA) or Facebook (FB). In spite of the impacts of those single names, the S&P 500's return to record highs has happened on very strong breadth across sectors. Below, we show 10-day advance-decline line charts from our Sector Snapshot.

> The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average daily number of advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last ten trading days. It's a short-term breadth measure that traders use to measure how extended the market is at the moment. Very high readings suggest that the market might be overbought in the near term, and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low readings suggest the opposite -- that the market might be oversold in the near term, and upside mean reversion can be expected.

> For the broad S&P 500, the 10-day AD line has hit the highest level since February 12th. Going back to 1990, the current reading stands in the 97th percentile. Looking at each sector, most lines are also in the upper decile of readings since 1990 and only two are not currently overbought: Communication Services and Consumer Staples. Meanwhile, some like Technology and Real Estate are a full two standard deviations above the historical norm. In fact, the Tech sector's line is the most elevated relative to its respective history of any sector with the current reading in the 98th percentile of all periods. The last time that the line was as elevated as now was in November of last year. No other sector has as long of a gap in time in which it has seen levels similar to the current reading. Most other sectors have seen higher readings as recently as August or September, though current levels are nonetheless elevated. The market has had quite the run over the last two weeks, and we'd expect some sort of cool-off period soon.

> # High Number of Record Highs

> Major US equity indices have returned to all-time highs in the second half of October with the S&P 500 and Dow both hitting record levels today. Meanwhile, the NASDAQ Composite is roughly a quarter of one percent away and the closest to a new all-time high since the last one on September 7th. The Russell 2,000, on the other hand, is at the high end of the past several months' range, but it is still over 2% below its high from March 15th.

> With the S&P 500 having been at new highs over the past few days, it has made 57 new all-time highs year to date. As shown in the top-left chart below, there have only been three other years in the past that have seen more record highs during the full course of the year: 2017 (62), 1964 (67), and 1995 (78). For the other major indices, the pace of record highs is less impressive but still strong. The Dow has made 38 new highs in 2021 which is more than triple the historical average. This year is on pace to see the highest number of record highs for the index since 2017 when it tied 1991 for the record of 71 closes at an all-time high. The NASDAQ Composite has also seen a solid number of highs at 36 which is well above the historical average of 19 per year historically. Given the index has been rangebound essentially all year, the Russell 2,000, conversely, has only seen 13 closing record highs. That is the same number as last year and it is actually below the average of 20 per year historically.

> # Sentiment Steps Back

> The weekly sentiment survey from AAII saw a surge in optimism in recent weeks, but it took a step back this week even with the S&P 500 at new highs. Bullish sentiment fell from a recent high of 46.9% down to 39.8% this week. Outside of last week, that is still the highest level since the first week of September.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Bulls.png))**

> While bullish sentiment saw a significant 7.1 percentage point drop, a relatively small share of those losses turned to the bearish camp. Bearish sentiment only rose 1.6 percentage points to 29.4%. That is still below levels from two weeks ago and is in line with the average from throughout the summer.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Bears.png))**

> The corresponding moves in bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bull-bear spread to fall but bulls continue to outweigh bears by 10.4 percentage points.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Spread.png))**

> As previously mentioned, the largest share of losses to bulls did not go to bears, but instead were picked up by those reporting neutral sentiment. That reading moved back above 30% this week gaining 5.3 percentage points. Again, that does not mark any sort of new high or low but instead brings sentiment back to similar levels seen only a month or two ago.

Why I think you will see massive institutional volume this morning and how you can benefit (FB Oct 29 330 Calls),63,62,2021-10-29 20:40:01,"I made a post yesterday but forgot to post position and got deleted, so first and foremost

They currently sit at 50 cents premarket.

Wednesday morning you saw massive Bull volume entering Google, despite only being up 1% premarket off strong earnings. Initial volume trading institutions to jump in and pump Goog to new all time high. 

https://preview.redd.it/f6c0705wrdw71.png?width=507&format=png&auto=webp&s=674029e01b66d8bd8dc46e575cc3f44c67024193

Yesterday we saw SHOP down premarket off mediocre earnings, and when SHOP bulls jumped in buying the dip, that triggered institutions to pour volume in, pumping off **1328** low all the way up to  **1504** high in less than 90 minutes. Oct 29th calls went from .25 cents to **22.75**.

https://preview.redd.it/0dwp8nv8udw71.png?width=509&format=png&auto=webp&s=a614725507a3183bbd0b1695385937a3882956c4

I believe we are going to see the same today with FB, especially with Cathie Wood Jumping in. FB has been beaten up over the last 2 months and has dropped from and ATH of **382** and now sits at **320** premarket. Bull volume will be pilling in and will fill the quick drop from $**340**. If this happens, **OCT 29th 330** calls will go from **.50 to over $10. 20-1 risk to reward.** I am further convinced of this with AMZN and AAPL earnings misses, institutional money will flow into Greener pastures. 

I think longer term options are a great play as well, but I think todays calls is the best risk to reward based on previous patterns observed this week.

I am not a financial advisor, this is just my opinion, do you own DD and join me in the METAverse with the Zuckerbot."

qhwg36,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qhwg36/roblox_about_to_make_you_serious_robux/,Roblox about to make you serious ROBUX!,27,21,2021-10-29 04:58:13,"First, I want to state that this is conditional based on how the market acts tomorrow. At the moment, don't know what's going to happen because of how shitty those aapl and amzn earning reports were but I can share my opinion on how Roblox looks from this point in time.

From a technical standpoint, let's just say I haven't seen a better looking inverse head and shoulders since SNOW a couple weeks ago. Check it's chart and you will see it pretty clearly and also see how the stock cruised after breakout.  The chart below shows the current head and shoulders Roblox is in. It broke out of trend on big volume at the end of the day prior to the general market melt up indicating it may follow through with a larger scale breakout based on Technicals alone.

There are a couple other reasons why this may be the best time to get into this play. Facebooks rebranding to Meta says it all. Facebook is rebranding to Meta to highlight it's focus on the metaverse, a field that will be seeing huge growth in the coming years. There is no other player bigger than Roblox in the metaverse field at the moment. Roblox is already hosting virtual concerts by the likes of 21 pilots and other popular artists. They are also partnering with companies like Chipotle to bring advertisements to the users of it's platform, an interesting new revenue stream. All in all, Roblox is more than just a kids game; it represents the first real comprehensive metaverse project. This will likely continue to attract big partnerships, maybe Facebook some day.

Another thing to look forward to is the fact that their earnings report is right around the corner. I don't have a stance on how the stock may perform post earnings but I do know there is a strong chance it runs in anticipation of earnings as many other stocks do. This adds to draw of this play.

Tldr: great looking chart, good sympathy play for facebooks rebrand to Meta, and upcoming earnings make this a play that you should consider.

# [Dow futures edge higher a day after hitting another record](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/26/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock index futures nudged higher during early morning trading on Wednesday after the Dow and S&P closed at record highs as earnings season continues.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 33 points. S&P 500 futures were off flat while Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 20 points.
*****
> During regular trading Tuesday, the Dow advanced roughly 15 points to end the day at an all-time high. It was the 30-stock benchmark‚Äôs third straight day of gains and fifth positive session in the last six. Earlier in the session the Dow had jumped about 150 points to also hit a record intraday high.
*****
> The S&P gained 0.18% for its ninth positive session in the last ten, and also hit both a record intraday and closing high. It was the benchmark index‚Äôs 70th intraday high of 2021, and 57th record closing of the year.
*****
> The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.06% for its third positive session in four. Facebook weighed on the tech-heavy index, with shares of the social media company dipping 3.9%.
*****
> Microsoft and Alphabet were among the headline reports Tuesday after the market closed, with both topping revenue expectations. Microsoft shares rose 2.3% in premarket trading.
*****
> Texas Instruments shares tumbled 4% premarket after the company missed revenue estimates while Visa fell 2.5% despite beating on the top and bottom lines. Enphase Energy leaped 12.7% after reporting record revenue in face of supply chain headwinds.
*****
> Coca-Cola rose 2.6% premarket after the company posted a beat on the top and bottom lines and raised its outlook, saying the business was getting stronger particularly in areas where the Covid recovery has been the best.
*****
> ‚ÄúThis earnings season has been about pricing momentum and whether consumers are able to handle surging costs,‚Äù noted Ed Moya, senior analyst at Oanda. ‚ÄúSo far it seems the consumer can handle it,‚Äù he added.
*****
> So far roughly 30% of the S&P 500 has reported earnings. Of the names that have posted quarterly updates, 82% have topped earnings expectations, while 80% have exceeded revenue estimates. Strong results have been key to pushing the major averages to new highs.
*****
> ‚ÄúWe see signs that there could be more gains to come in the final two months of the year,‚Äù said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial. ‚ÄúSeasonal tailwinds, improving market internals, and clear signs of a peak in the Delta variant all provide potential fuel for equities heading into year-end, and we maintain our overweight equities recommendation as a result.‚Äù
*****
> Robinhood shares were getting slammed, down 11% the day after the trading app reported revenue well below expectations primarily due to weakness in trading.
*****
> A busy earnings week continues on Wednesday with Coca-Cola, McDonald‚Äôs, Bristol-Myers, Boeing, General Motors and Harley-Davidson among the names on deck before the market opens. Ford, eBay and Yum China will provide quarterly updates after the market closes.
*****
> On the economic front, U.S. durable goods order data will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET.

qfz9ss,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qfz9ss/due_diligence_the_bull_case_for_dwac_and_tmtg/,Due Diligence: The bull case for $DWAC and $TMTG,34,86,2021-10-26 13:13:41," 

**Introduction:**

For anyone that points out that DWAC/TMTG/future combined entity is pre-revenue, then you're absolutely right. But this stock obviously is not about revenue now, but downstream profit potential. Obviously, any projection of this sort into the future is subject to a great deal of uncertainty, but I will do my best to quantify future prospects.

As a bit of backdrop, the whole merger process with SPACs is a bit complicated, but roughly current stock prices imply a value of $8B. Warrant prices imply a value of a bit less than $4B.

**Overview of major business segments:**

First, let us look at some of the potential segments of DWAC as a business:

* Social media. The SEC filing announcing DWAC/TMTG merger specifically mentions Truth Social by name. Within Truth Social, we could see multiple elements.  

   * A broad based social network (as an alternative to Facebook, cap \~$1T)
   * A microblogging service (as an alternative to Twitter, cap \~$50B)
   * A video hosting service (as an alternative to YouTube, part of Alphabet/Google but reasonable estimate of $500B value added). (Some thought DWAC/TMTG may acquire Rumble and could be announced tomorrow, but could be some other announcement by Rumble.)
* Streaming media/video on demand service. The SEC filing mentions specifically mentions a product titled TMTG+.

**Social Media deep dive:**

Let's begin breaking down a few things. Facebook has \~260M monthly active users in the US and Canada and 2.9B worldwide. Many of the worldwide customers are significantly less valuable, and the US/Canada market was responsible for nearly half of 2020 revenue. Likely, the margins are slightly higher in the US because it is wealthier than most. As a rough estimate, FB's North American portion of the business is currently valued at around $600B (of it's total $1T market cap).

Twitter recently announced it had 206 million ""monetizable daily active users"" (not children) world wide. 25% of these, or 51 million are US based. The most recent data I have is Q1 2021, which shows about half of Twitter revenue is US based. In other words, Twitter's \~50M monetizable users in the US contribute to a company worth roughly $25B.

These numbers fall in line with Metcalfe's Law, which states the value of a network is roughly proportional to the square of the number of users. Because FB has roughly 5 times as many users in North America than Twitter, than it should be worth about 25 times as much. $600B/$25B = 24, so we are pretty close here.

So what's this all mean? Let's run some scenarios. Suppose Truth Social is a free to use platform. The US and Canada populations are, combined, around 370M. Let's suppose for now 10% of this population uses the platform on a regular basis. I think this is conservative, as about half lean conservative, so this would imply one fifth of the target market engaged. If we apply Metcalfe's Law, we get to a value of (37/50)\^2 \* $25B = $13.7B. If 20%, rather than 10%, the value goes up not two-fold, but four-fold to $54.8B. If 25% (half of right of center), this pops to $85.625B.

Keep in mind the above is values are ignoring conservative/populist movements in other countries which may provide additional revenues. Brazil (population > 200M) is a huge market with a populist Trump ally, and the CFO of DWAC is Brazilian. There exists a sizable populist segment in Europe, especially in eastern Europe as well.

Critique 1: ""They don't have that kind of userbase yet.""

Response: Absolutely true, and there is execution risk. However, current market values are significantly below long run potential. Personally, I think it is reasonable that 20% of America will be active, but discounting at 15% per year with 3 years to ramp, that is $54.8B/(1.15\^3) = $36B current value.

Critique 2: ""Advertisers will not want to advertise on the platform.""

Response: That may be true to some extent, but companies still mostly care about $$$. Even if some advertisers refuse to use the platform those who use the platform may be met with higher engagement from users, who see a company that possesses similar values to them.

One last thought on the social media front: a monthly subscription as an ad-free alternative may be possible.

**Streaming Media/On Demand deep dive:**

To begin, I think it is helpful to present some numbers of other streaming services.

* Netflix, the behemoth, has 214M paid monthly subscribers. As of Sep 2021, annualized revenue is $30B. That comes out to $12 per user per month worldwide. The US figure may be closer to $15/month average.
* Disney+ had 116M paid monthly users (and growing) as of July.
* Discovery+ bundle has 18 million paid monthly users.
* Peacock (NBC Universal) has 54 million users, with nearly 5 million using the premium (ad-free) version, with the other opting for the ad-filled version.

What is the point? People are becoming much more comfortable with paying for a bundle of content they care about. Let's run some hypotheticals:

* $15/month for streaming bundle
* 20 million subscribers (about 5% of US/Canada or 10% of conservatives)

The above results in $144/year \* 15 million = $3.60B of streaming revenue annually. Keep in mind, the type of content here is not likely to be extremely expensive to produce, like Netflix's huge investments. Suppose this can be produced at $1.5B. That's $2.1B in profit that that segment alone. A $2.1B profit. If it can expand at 3% per year from there with a cost of capital of 10%, that segment would be valued at $2.1B/(10%-3%) = $30B.

Obviously, we are not there yet. And risk to get there is large, but even discounting it by 15% per year for 3 years, we get $19.72B

**Total Value and Current Stock/Warrant Price:**

The above gives the two primary segments a present value of $36B and $19.72B, totaling $55.72B. Even if you think I am being exceptionally generous and you think the company is worth 5 times less today ($11.14B), then the stock right now (valuation of $8B) is still 39% undervalued. Even if you think I am overvaluing the company by 10 times, then a $5.572B valuation (compared to $4B warrant), then warrants are undervalued by 40%.

**The Trump Card:**

The final element here is to point out the obvious. There are 80 million Trump voters, over 100M Trump supporters, and tens of millions of other, who might not like Trump, but are tired of big tech censorship and monopolistic behaviors. Trump is a unique figure who has the capacity to funnel that energy and support to a particular business venture. His megaphone is unrivaled. Many of his supporters are supremely loyal and would subscribe, even while the product is unpolished, to show support to a movement.

**Tl;dr:**

There is a legitimate case that the long-run prospects of DWAC/TMTG is massively undervalued."

I have a somewhat crazy theory. Since Facebook is talking about changing their name to pivot the business focus and after SNAP‚Äôs woes with advertising thanks to Apple, I think this is FB‚Äôs way of putting the writing on the wall. They‚Äôre getting a contingency plan for if the ad space changes (which is 100% is).

Any yolo option plays before their earnings announcement? Could the stock lose 20% if they miss earnings because of ad revenue? They should miss on a much more significant level than SNAP did. 

Expected $3.17 per share on revenue of $29.59 billion. There‚Äôs no way they‚Äôre making those numbers."

*****
> U.S. stock futures were slightly in the green Monday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed its third positive week in a row at a record, driven by better-than-expected earnings reports.
*****
> Dow futures gained 19 points. S&P 500 futures were up about 0.1%.
*****
> Futures for the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 were the standout, trading up by 0.3% ahead of big earnings reports for major companies in the industry.
*****

*****
> Of the 117companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings to date, 84% posted numbers that beat expectations, according to Refinitiv. S&P 500 companies are expected to grow profit by about 35% in the third quarter.
*****
> ‚ÄúRising tide of earnings is lifting all the boats and adding fuel to the bull market fire,‚Äù said Anu Gaggar, global investment strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network. ‚ÄúThe 3Q earnings season is off to a strong start despite concerns about supply bottlenecks and labor shortages.‚Äù
*****

*****
Major averages have all registered solid gains for October. The Dow and the S&P 500 are both up more than 5%, while the Nasdaq Composite has climbed 4.4% month to date.

*****

What's poppin' bull gang, hope you‚Äôre all doing well! Our free money glitch remained unpatched for another update, allowing many of us to pull clean double baggers across the board. God bless $SNAP. With all of big tech set to report this week, it could prove to be more lucrative than the last. We‚Äôve got a large variety of trades we can make this week ranging from educated gambles, to good old fashioned theta plays. We‚Äôve even have a couple of opportunities to sprinkle in some collateral plays if we wish! Let‚Äôs get into it!

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Jetblue is inefficiently priced.** Historically Jetblue moves roughly **4%** post earnings (inline with all the other American airlines),  yet this quarter, the options are pricing in a move of roughly **10%**. If we sell straddles or strangles, we can collect this extremely inflated premium with very little risk on our end. I looked into the entire sector as a whole since I planned on trading it last week, and I came across nothing that would‚Äôve fundamentally caused this spike in volatility in airlines, or Jetblue specifically. The odds are awesome on this trade, and I plan or robbing some gamblers next week. For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)

&nbsp;

- **Twitter is inefficiently priced. Avoid it.** Historical move of **6.5%**, priced move of **11%** - on paper, this trade gives us insane edge, but I‚Äôm still not touching it, as we saw what happened with $SNAP on Thursday. Although Twitter dropped 5% as the market tried to price $AAPL‚Äôs privacy policy in, I don‚Äôt feel like taking on additional risk because the fundamentals have shifted right before its‚Äô earnings. Normally I would take this trade 10/10 times simply from a pure numbers standpoint, but I‚Äôm not as confident anymore because of the added volatility created by $SNAP. 

&nbsp;

- **Oil stocks tend to experience Post Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD).** PEAD is the phenomenon where a stocks price will drift in the direction of an earnings surprise for several weeks following an earnings announcement. If a stock beats, it will continue to grind up for weeks following the ER report, and vice versa if it misses. This is especially true among oil stocks - check the charts if you don‚Äôt believe me. The best way to play oil this quarter would be to capitalize on this effect, and do **monthly** call or put debit spreads based on the results that come out Friday. To those curious, standard weekly options provide no edge at the time of writing, so it‚Äôs best not to gamble this time round.

&nbsp;

- **Collateral Plays are your friend!** If you‚Äôre bullish on big tech, look to long $QQQ this week to alter your risk exposure and bag some safer gains. If you‚Äôre bearish on oil, look to short $XLE instead of any of the individual companies for an added safety net. If you think $AMD is gonna knock it out of the park, look to play $NVDA or $SOXL instead. There‚Äôs lot‚Äôs of opportunities for collateral plays this week, and I‚Äôve just barely scratched the surface.

#Summary and Conclusion

We've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly!

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 25th, 2021.

# **Big Tech earnings in the week ahead could test stocks‚Äô recent rally - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/22/earnings-alphabet-apple-results-could-test-stocks-recent-rally.html)**
*****
> An earnings avalanche is coming in the week ahead that could put the stock market‚Äôs recent gains to the test.
*****
> Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon ‚Äî the biggest of big cap tech ‚Äî are among the 30% of the S&P 500 companies reporting. A third of the Dow also releases results, including Caterpillar, Coca-Cola, Merck, Boeing and McDonald‚Äôs.
*****
> ‚ÄúNext week is the real test,‚Äù RBC head of U.S. equity strategy Lori Calvasina said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting a little bit in every sector.‚Äù
*****
> Of the companies that have already reported, nearly 84% beat estimates. Earnings are so far expected to be up 34.8% over last year, based on actual reports and estimates, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe tug-of-war in good versus bad earnings reports has landed in favor of the market with the S&P hitting an all-time high [Thursday]. That may run into difficulty next week,‚Äù National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said. ‚ÄúWe may finally be seeing some cracks in the earnings season.‚Äù
*****
> The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average notched fresh records this week, and the indexes have solid gains for the week. The S&P 500 gained 1.6% to 4,544, while the Dow ended the week up 1.1% at 35,677, the first record close since Aug. 16. Some strategists view the return to those highs as a signal the market is on track for a year-end rally.
*****
> The Nasdaq Composite was also 1.3% higher for the week, but it was down 0.8% on Friday as tech stocks declined.
*****
> ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre going to learn a lot from this reporting season,‚Äù Calvasina said. ‚ÄúSo far, so good. Better than feared, with no change to underlying demand. Companies are still managing through for the most part. Investors are punishing companies that aren‚Äôt, but they‚Äôre not punishing the whole market. The market seems very rational right now.‚Äù
*****
> For instance, Intel shares were pummeled, falling more than 11.6% on Friday, after the company‚Äôs sales missed expectations. Intel warned an industry-wide component shortage hurt its PC chip business. But other semiconductor stocks did not get pulled down in the decline. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF was down about 0.8%.
*****
> But Snap sent an industry-wide warning Thursday when its quarterly revenues missed expectations. The company reported that Apple‚Äôs privacy changes introduced earlier this year affected its advertising business. The company also said that advertisers were holding back due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages.
*****
> Facebook‚Äôs earnings on Monday will be closely watched for any similar comments, as will reports from Alphabet and Twitter Tuesday. The three stocks fell Friday as Snap plunged 26.6%. Facebook lost more than 5%.
*****
> ‚ÄúFacebook has been the more broken name. It had the Instagram problem. It had the kid problem. It‚Äôs had a hard time going up post-earnings. It will be interesting to see if all these problems are priced in or does it go even lower,‚Äù T3Live.com chief strategic officer Scott Redler said.
*****
> Redler said the Snap news was a big surprise, since traders viewed social media as immune to supply chain problems. Even though social media was under pressure as a whole Friday, he said stocks have been able to diverge within sectors recently.
*****
> ‚ÄúTesla was able to make a new high, and Netflix is at an all-time high. Every group has winners and losers, but overall the participation is better than it‚Äôs been in a while. Five stocks aren‚Äôt driving the S&P to the all-time highs,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bunch of stocks in every sector.‚Äù
*****
> Traders are now watching the Russell 2000, since a breakout in small caps would be a positive for the overall market, he said. Redler trades the the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) which closed slightly lower at $227.41 Friday. ‚ÄúIf the IWM gets above the $230 to $234 area, it could be a signal for more risk on at the end of the year,‚Äù he said.
*****
> Redler said the market could be challenged in the coming week. ‚ÄúYou just had a big 10-day move up. You would think there will be some digestion,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to chase the market here. It feels like we could rest a little bit next week. If it could digest here, and we could get some individual stock movement, that would be healthier than the pain trade, which is straight up.‚Äù
*****
> There are a few important economic reports in the week ahead, including durable goods Wednesday; third-quarter GDP Thursday and personal consumption expenditures Friday. Friday‚Äôs data includes the PCE deflator, the preferred inflation gauge watched by the Federal Reserve.
*****
> # Higher interest rates
> The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield continued to edge higher in the past week, touching 1.70% before falling to 1.64% Friday. Market pros are watching to see if the yield will reach 1.74%, the closing high from March, and whether it will begin to worry stock investors. The 10-year yield hit this year‚Äôs intraday high of 1.776% on March 30.
*****
> ‚ÄúI would say over the next week or two, it‚Äôs possible we test it, but I would be a little surprised at this stage if it sustainably breaks through,‚Äù NatWest Markets‚Äô John Briggs said. He noted that yields have been moving higher, as investors now anticipate the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates next year and as the market anticipates more inflation.
*****
> ‚ÄúI get a sense that people are more interested in buying here rather than selling,‚Äù he said. Bond yields move inversely to price. It could be a busy week in the market, as investors adjust for the end of the month
*****
> Briggs notes the front end, or the 2-year note yield, has moved faster than the longer end. He said that reflects the market‚Äôs increased expectation for rate hikes next year, with two hikes expected by the market in the second half of the year.

> # 9 Charts We Are Watching

> Here are a handful charts that caught our attention recently.

> Yesterday was the 34-year anniversary of the Crash of ‚Äô87. To this day market pundits still don‚Äôt quite agree on what caused the crash. As only Art Cashin can scribe, here were some of the worries at the time that lead to the more than 20% one-day crash on Black Monday: a historically overbought market (the S&P 500 Index was up more than 40% for the year in August); worries over a currency war with Germany; a historic storm in London that closed markets the Friday before the crash, concentrated selling on the New York Stock Exchange; First Lady Nancy Reagan possibly being admitted to the hospital with breast cancer; and even potential worries over engaging with Iran. At the end of the day, stocks up more than 40% for the year in August was likely much of the trigger, as that is a very stretched rubber band.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> The S&P 500 finally pulled back 5% a few weeks ago, after not doing so for nearly a year. But remember, the great majority of the stocks in the S&P 500 have already corrected at least 10%, with many down even more. This rolling correction has done a number on overall investor confidence though. According to the Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey, managers were the least bullish they‚Äôve been since October 2020 and cash levels hit the highest level in 12 months. ‚ÄúIt might be clich√© to say, but many managers moved to cash on the 5% pullback, leaving plenty of cash on the sidelines to eventually push stocks higher again,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, historically the S&P 500 forms a major low near the end of October and has a nice rally to end most years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Blog-chart-3-10.20.21.png?ssl=1))**

> Building on the late October period, remember that the last few days of October and first few of November are historically one of the most bullish periods of the year.

> A post-election year tends to see stocks bottom a tad earlier in late September. So far, this year is following this template nicely.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**

> November is quietly one of the best months of the year. In fact, it is the best month since 1950 and over the past decade. The past 20 years it is the second best month and in post-election years it ranks second as well. ‚ÄúNo matter how you slice it, November is known for turkeys, but maybe it should be known for bulls as well,‚Äù exclaimed Ryan Detrick.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-6.png?ssl=1))**

> The S&P 500 is less than half a percent away from its first new high since September 2. Remember, it has made a new high every single month so far this year. Should it make another new high in October it could remain on target to join 2014 as the only year to have a new high every single month.

> (Trivia stat ‚Äì The S&P 500 peaked on September 2 in 2020 before a near 10% correction over the following weeks. This year it also peaked on September 2, but it is looking like 5% may be the most we‚Äôll see to the downside this time.)

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.1.21-blog-chart-7.png?ssl=1))**

> Speaking of new all-time highs, the S&P 500 has made 54 so far this year, one of the most ever. The record of 78 appears to be safe, but with a late year rally this year could go down as the second most ever.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-7.png?ssl=1))**

> As we noted at the start of the month, stocks have historically done quite well in October during an odd numbered year‚Äîyears without an election around the corner and no pre-election jitters. Well, 2021 is following suit once again, as the S&P 500 is already up nearly 5% for the month, which would be the best month of October for the index since 2015.

> # An Impressive 2021 So Far, But Flows Are Slowing

> Yesterday the Investment Company Institute updated weekly fund flow numbers for the US mutual fund and ETF industry. As shown in the chart below, total mutual fund flows were positive this year but compared to the performance of ETFs, the inflows have been only modest at best. ETFs have logged more than $700bn in inflows, and while mutual funds avoided a fourth straight net outflow, their $66bn in inflows wasn‚Äôt that impressive. Across mutual funds and ETFs, bonds have been the massive winner this year, with more than $500bn in inflows. Equity funds record outflows over time as a mechanical result of equity retirements, but this year inflows have been the largest since 2014 with more than $210bn in buying across mutual funds and ETFs. About a quarter of total equity fund inflows so far this year have been dedicated to funds buying the domestic stock market. That‚Äôs the best year for domestic equity fund flows since 2014, and breaks a string of five consecutive years of outflows, though net flows have been stable for months now.

> # Late October Is the To Time Buy Stocks

> As it is written in the 2021 Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac on October 21 on page 97, late October is the time to buy depressed stocks, especially techs and small caps. In the chart here taken from page 112 of the 2021 Almanac we divide daily data for the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks by the Russell 1000 index of the largest stocks since July 1, 1979, and then compress into a one-year seasonal pattern from July to June. When the graph is descending large caps are outperforming small caps; when the graph is rising, small caps are moving up faster than large caps. This year has been rather typical.

> You will remember the November 2020 was a month for the record books for the Russell 2000. And then R2K topped out in March 2021 and has been lagging the big cap indexes since spring. Over the past couple of days the R2K appears to be perking up right on schedule. We just released a new small/mi-cap stock basket to subscribers in order to take advantage of the ‚ÄúBest Months‚Äù of the year (November through April/June) for stocks on the heels of our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal.

> # Road and Rail Soar Above Air Freight

> One major economic trend of the past several months has been supply chain constraints including logistics issues. Now in the throes of earnings season, earnings of companies related to supply chains and logistics (whether that be people or parcels) are beginning to roll in with four such names reporting in the past day alone: Kansas City Southern (KSU), United Airlines (UAL), Marten Transport (MRTN), and Knight-Swift Transportation (KNX). In the table below, we show all the S&P 1500 Transportation Industry stocks that have reported since late September. Most of these stocks have beaten estimates on the top and bottom line with a few exceptions. While it is the one furthest in the rearview now, FedEx (FDX) was perhaps the worst of these missing EPS estimates and lowering guidance. KNX, on the other hand, reported a triple play this morning; one of the first companies to do so thus far in earnings season.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102021-TRAN-Earn-1.png))**

> Two more transportation names, CSX (CSX) and Landstar System (LSTR), are also set to report earnings after the closing bell today, and over a dozen other names will follow up in the next week alone. These names could potentially be interesting areas to look for anecdotes regarding broader supply chain issues pressuring the economy, but turning to the stock price reactions, Saia (SAIA) has averaged the largest single-day gain on earnings averaging a 2.5% move across its 60 past earnings reports. Old Dominion (ODFL), Echo Global Logistics (ECHO), Hub Group (HUBG), and XPO Logistics (XPO) are the only others that have averaged greater than 1% gains in reaction to earnings. C.H. Robinson (CHRW) and Avis Budget (CAR), on the other hand, have historically averaged the worst reactions to earnings of this industry.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102021-TRAN-Earn.png))**

> While there are still plenty of companies within the industry left to report providing plenty of catalysts for moves, since the closing low on September 30th, the transports have seen solid performance with an 8.79% gain through today. That move has not only lifted the industry above its 50 and 200-DMAs but it has also broken the downtrend that has been in place since the spring. Currently, the group is still down 6.1% from its 52-week high.

> # 1-Year After 7-Month Winning Streak‚ÄìS&P 500 Gains 6.37%

> Going back to 1950, S&P 500 has enjoyed 15 streaks of consecutive monthly gains lasting 7 or months. The most recent streak came to an end with September‚Äôs full-month decline. The longest consecutive monthly winning streak lasted 11 months and occurred twice, from September 1953 to July 1954 and from March 1958 to January 1959. S&P 500‚Äôs average gain during these monthly winning streaks has been a solid 25.86%. The smallest gain was 9.09% ending March 1993 while the largest was a whopping 53.53% ending in April 1983. When past streaks ended, S&P 500 performance following tended to be mixed and rather tepid compared to its performance during the winning streak. The month after the streak ends, 3-month, 6-month and 1-year after performance appears in the table above.

> # Sentiment Surge

> Over the past couple of weeks, the S&P 500 has reversed higher, and the index is now only a few basis points away from the September 2nd closing high. With the rally, sentiment has taken a sharp turn towards optimism. The AAII reading on bullish sentiment rose for a second week in a row, climbing 9 percentage points to 46.9%. That is the highest reading on bullish sentiment since the week of July 1.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-Bull.png))**

> While this week's increase was large, it comes on top of a double-digit rise last week. In total, bullish sentiment has climbed 21.4 percentage points in the past two weeks alone. That is the first time since November of last year that bullish sentiment has risen by at least 20 percentage points in two weeks. Going through the history of the survey, there have only been 17 other periods in which there were similar moves without another occurrence in at least six months. Overall, these instances have consistently seen the S&P 500 move higher in the following weeks and months with larger than normal average and median gains. That is except for one year out in which performance has been slightly worse than the norm.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-20-pp-1.png))**

> With the big jump in bullish sentiment recently, bearish sentiment has pulled back to 27.8%. That is the lowest reading since September 9th and the third week in a row in which bearish sentiment has moved lower.

> With inverse moves to bullish and bearish sentiment, the bull-bear spread stayed in positive territory for the second week in a row as bulls outnumber bears by the widest margin since the first week of July.

> As for some other readings on sentiment, the NAAIM Exposure index measuring investment managers' exposure to US equities has also made a significant move higher this week. Readings in this index range from -200 to 200 where (-)200 would indicate responding managers are leveraged long (short), (-)100 would be fully invested long (short), and a reading of zero would be market neutral. At the end of last month, the reading fell to a low of 55 which was the weakest level since May. While the past two weeks only saw modest improvements, this week there was a surge all the way up to 98. The 33.6 point increase ranks as the fifth-largest week over week moves on record in the index dating back to 2006.

Since someone has been on publicity stunt detail like we give a flying fuck, do you think it's possible that.... 

Facebook CEO (cock enveloping orifice) zuck has been hyping up nonsense to downplay a forthcoming earnings miss?  By further extension, could he also be using his hypnotic charm and wit to overshadow an exodus of employees who have turned against the company, √† la that plump tartlette whatserface who appeared on 60mins?

qdlzhd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qdlzhd/actual_dd_for_dwac/,Actual DD for DWAC,352,546,2021-10-23 01:34:23,"I understand 90% of people are pouring into DWAC right now just to try and get some tendies before they dump their shares onto a bag holder. So maybe there will be a better entry point in a few weeks as the mania subsides. However, I believe that regardless of short and medium term volatility and price manipulation, DWAC is a long term hold. 

At a valuation of 3 billion, that's absolutely nothing for a social media platform. Facebook is worth 907 billion. Snap is worth 88 billion. Now you might ask yourself, ""Yea I get successful social media platforms are valued at crazy levels, but who on Earth is going to make a profile on Truth Social?"" well, for better or for worse depending on your political affiliation and beliefs:

 [Poll: Two-thirds of Republicans still think the 2020 election was rigged (yahoo.com)](https://news.yahoo.com/poll-two-thirds-of-republicans-still-think-the-2020-election-was-rigged-165934695.html) 

Approximately 240 million people are eligible to vote in this country. Of that 240 million, 40% identify as Republican. That's 96 million. Now of that 96 million, about 63.6 million believe that the election was rigged by Democrats and that Trump is the real President. That's who makes an account at Truth Social. 

In addition to this, a lot of people's favorite thing to do on the internet is get into insufferable political arguments. It will not only be MAGA Qanon people on this thing, people from the left will make accounts there to troll and argue. 

Furthermore, there are numerous talk show hosts, and media personalities who will follow suit and make accounts. Jordan Peterson, Charlie Kirk, Candace Owens and the rest of peanut gallery. Tucker Carlson, Thomas Sowell, there are a lot of political figures who will end up on there and bringing a strong follower base. Celebrities who like Trump, are indifferent to him, or who are exhausted by what they view as opaque rule enforcement from youtube and facebook would likely join, such as the Nelk Boys, gun youtubers like Garand Thumb, I would imagine the Paul brothers would make accounts just to kick the hornets nest and get attention. 

At that point, there would be millions of accounts already, which would start to attract non political personalities. People who are hungry for clout and aspiring content creators would see an app with millions of users and not that many creators crowding it and jump in. 

I believe there could be 250 million users in Truth Social in over the course of a few years and that's a conservative (pun intended) estimate. Depending then on ad revenue, whether or not the company decides to sell data (That would be a tough thing for them to navigate), I can't imagine this thing not having at least a 20 billion dollar market cap in the near future. And then there's also the streaming service and news broadcast which I haven't even mentioned.  

And let's not forget the Catalysts: 

Donald Trump running for President.

Donald Trump WINNING the Presidency in 2024. 

Anytime a major celebrity or personality joins. 

TL:DR:

May the God-Emperor, Donald Pump, first of his name, bringer of tendies and golden showers, take all holders to Mars on a Falcon X Rocket. 

Position: 10 shares at $98. (roughly 10% of my portfolio)"

Well, here we are.. and I say to you, ‚ÄúWhat is the Metaverse, anyway?‚Äù I'd like to argue ROBLOX ($RBLX) is going to be the leading force in this industry. Let me state some facts:

1. Roblox increased it's engagement FROM 2.1 billion hours in Q1 2018 TO 9.73 billion hours in Q2 2021. Are you fucking kidding me? This is more time than people spend on Youtube, Facebook, and Instagram.
2. Speaking of engagement, that's over 2.5 hours per day per user.
3. In Q1 of 2018 they rolled in 59.72M in revenue. Most recently in Q2 of 2021, their revenue is 454.1M. That's a 660% increase in 3 years.
4. There are over 40 million games on ROBLOX, created by over 9.5 million developers.
5. 83% of users on Roblox are under 25 years old. Most of which are still eatin tendies and being introduced into forums like WSB. Prime age demographic to evolve these chimps into apes.

IMO, the metaverse is going to be the breakthrough consumer technology we'll see in the next decade that bridges the gap to a new digital frontier.. The great ‚Äúwild west‚Äù much like the internet was pre-2k.

This shit gets me excited. I like this stock.

**Who uses Coinbase?**

Coinbase is in 100+ counties, and they have over 68 million verified users.  Last quarter, Retail Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs) grew to 8.8 million, up 44% from Q1 2021.

**How do they many money?**

Last quarter they had $2.0 billion in net revenue, including $1.9 billion from transactions and $100 million in subscription & services revenue. 

**What does the future have in store for Coinbase?**

Along with being an exchange, $COIN will be a hodler.  In August, they announced plans to purchase $500 million in non-fiat currency and use 10% of their profits to purchase more non-fiat currency in the future.  Think about that - the most popular non-fiat currency was priced under $50K in Aug/Sept and now it is $64K.  That's a massive return on investment.

They announced Coinbase NFT, a peer-to-peer marketplace that will make minting, purchasing, showcasing, and discovering NFTs easier than ever.  They have over 1.8 million users on the waitlist to join.

Today!  They announced a partnership with Facebook.  They will be store non-fiat currency for Facebook's new digital wallet, Novi, which will enable users to send and receive money abroad instantly, securely and with no fees.

Today!  Coinbase and NBA sign a multiyear partnership deal.  Specifics are not yet revealed.

**So what?**

**Buy the stock!**   Oppenheimer‚Äôs Owen Lau rates COIN an Outperform with a $444 price target.  That is 45% upside from here.  

This company has massive YoY revenue growth, and they have actual earnings.

&#x200B;

|Company|Q2 Net Income|Current Market Cap|
|:-|:-|:-|
|SQ|204.02M|117B|
|PYPL|1.18B|320B|
|TSLA|1.14B|856B|
|COIN|1.61B|64B|

&#x200B;

**I pity the fool that doesn't buy $COIN.**

Concerns - The transactional revenue will eventually get commoditized.  The partnerships/services/other revenue is fast growing and will need to remain so for Coinbase to be sustainable in the long-term.  Think about Vanguard, Fidelity, E-Trade, Charlie Schwab - they all survived the race to zero.  The ability to loan out non-fiat currency is key, and will take time to resolve."

 [ ] Wish has 2.5 billion in annual revenues,zero debt,1.7 billion in cash sells to over 100 countries,has more than 1 million merchants,sells over 300 million items,has over 500 million downloads,has over 100 million monthly active users,trades at 1 times sales and has a 3 billion dollar market capital valuation.

What company is most undervalued?

A) SHOP- 2.9B rev 175B mc
B) SNAP- 2.5B rev 120B mc
C) MELI- 3.9B rev 75B mc
D) ETSY- 1.7B rev 27B mc
E) WISH- 2.5B rev 3B mc
              Answer is WISH

     [ ] Amazon may be the e-commerce king in USA but the world is yet to be conquered and wish has a global reach already just need more time and a better worldwide economy to see wish on new heights totally undervalued many brands are now joining wish for reason the rocket is yet to lunch!

 [ ] On Facebook, Shopify has around 3.8 million likes.. while Wish has 39 million likes.. And Amazon has 29m likes. 

The word on the street  Etsy and Amazon are fighting to Aquire WISH. 

   [ ] To be in the top 10% of income world-wide a person needed to have only $68,800 in wealth. That means 90% of the world has less than $68,800. E-commerce is still in early stages and already by 2023 will be over 5 trillion market place bigger than the auto industry. Future growth is exponential as we shift from brick and mortar and even a small piece of this pie will be huge. 

 [ ] When wish starts to take off it‚Äôs going to move fast. Shorts you‚Äôre time is getting close. Inflation is happening all around us. Prices on some items are doubling or more. Wish will be the go to Xmas company  this year. 

Retail traders,institutions and hedge funds will chase Wish to new highs and sit back and enjoy the ride."

qar6j5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qar6j5/hedging_against_a_market_crash_2008_all_over_again/,"Hedging against a Market Crash, 2008' all over again",498,362,2021-10-19 01:14:17,"Hey everyone,

I did put a lot of research into the current situation for quite some time and finally build a portfolio I am 100% behind long-term. However, the more I learned, the more sure I am that we will experience a market crash rather soon, than late.

I am not here to debate whether or not you think this is true, but the situation for this thought game is that we might see a crash similar in numbers, **not principle** like 2008' all over again. In general, during times of high inflation, most businesses will not come out well. The earnings will go up, but they need to put more money into their own business to even stay in the same place. A hedge for this are companies that can easily scale their business without needing money flow. I am looking at you Facebook, who can place 10% more ads, Adobe who can increase their product price without fear of losing customers, Apple, Microsoft...

The theory behind this discussion would assume that GameStop is a good hedge, I even heard that from the high ups in a very big, German bank, which is incredibly weird since they were against it months ago and did not even want to talk about it in the first place. This assumes that the crash is happening because of said theory I explained below in short. It does not mean that a high percentage of the entire portfolio should persist of them, but a chunk just in case might be a very good idea. The market is more complex than many think.

Another hedge and long term hold can not be mentioned in this sub, but you might guess what it is. Sadly, we cant debate this here. Has to do with weird blocks and tokens, latter of which might change the whole gaming industry and I am thankfully in the position where I can take constant profits from it in percentages that sound absolutely insane.

So, in case of this **theoretical** scenario, I would like to get everyone's opinion on this. I want to be clear, I value every single opinion and would love the most input possible. In case of no crash, my investments should grow steadily, but in case of a crash due to named circumstance, they would skyrocket. Again, this is purely theoretical, I do not want to discuss whether or not it is happening, but what you would do in case it will happen in the near future.

&#x200B;

**TLDR: How would you hedge against a potential market crash ala 2008' (similar in numbers, not principle) due to Evergrande + GameStop and the overall market situation?**

*I will add the theory behind GameStop again, even though most of you might know this already.*

*The theory: Most part of the stock is traded in Dark Pools and some shorting Hedge Funds are telling us that they closed their position, which is mathematically impossible. Do the research yourself. What I think is happening, is that all the shorts are actually synthetic and not real shares. There is tons and tons of proof of it, too much to even deny at this point. They exercise and sell deep ITM calls in order to get the FTDs. So basically, they are passing them from one to another, to another.*  
***The endless cycle:***  
*Person 1: Exercise deep ITM calls > Person 2: Sells deep ITM calls > Person 3: Sells shares > Person 4: met his FTD > Person 5: Exercise deep ITM calls  > Person 6: Sells deep ITM calls > ‚Ä¶*

***Explanation for Golden Retriever:***  
*Think of it like this, a good analogy; You get a credit card with 10.000$ on it, max it out and have to repay the debt next month. However, you have endless credit cards, so you can get another credit card and ""pay"" the 10.000$ with that. The debt is still there, its just getting passed. You can do that forever. Now you need more money, so you do this all over again and keep digging the grave deeper and deeper. In this theory, multiple times the float and continuing. In order to stop that, you have to lock the float entirely, which is why everyone is currently directly registering their shares.* ***IF*** *this is true, I do not have to explain the potential outcome. There is simply too much proof.*

*Computershare confirmed this.*  
*Quote from their Twitter: ""Shares held directly on the books of US companies through a transfer agent are not held at DTCC. As such, shares are not available to be loaned for any means within the security markets. Computershare is a registered transfer agent, therefore does not lend shares in any capacity.""*

*Cheers, have a nice week everyone!*"

Lots of people love their product, checkout the Reddit 23&me group where every week many people post their results after the test. 

2. They‚Äôre working with big Pharma in developing and speeding drug testing phases. They‚Äôre almost like a Facebook but instead of collecting data for adds, it‚Äôs used to save lives and cure people while reducing side effects etc..

3. For some reason, they‚Äôve been getting hammered by firms/hedges. When I say hammered I mean for weeks short volume has been over 50%.
(Check fintel)

For those who don‚Äôt understand short volume. Say 1000 shares were traded, and 600 of them were shorted shares. This means 60% short volume. This also means, currently more people are borrowing and selling shares, then there are people selling shares that they own. 
Having short volume over 50% for a week straight is very very very unhealthy for shorts. They‚Äôre literally selling more then half the shares traded that day, that don‚Äôt even belong to them, and they have to return them‚Ä¶ 

23&me is poised to hit double digits soon, and fly. Right now for shorties to get out of this without big losses, they need lots of luck. 
‚ÄúThe house always wins‚Äù - right now bulls are the house and shorts are playing roulette

Now what?
There‚Äôs 0 shares left to borrow? How come?
Short volume has been above 50% up to 80% for weeks straight. This means shorts have been reducing their shorting pool every day. Time for them to pay up."

And most of you newbies have not ever traded in a bear market. You subconsciously believe 100% runups in 15 months is fairly normal.

Evergrande is not a fucking joke we should sit across the globe from and laugh about. Evergrande is the tip of the iceberg, and the housing market in China will collapse. In China, housing is 33% of GDP. In the U.S., it's 6.2%. You can't put 2 and 2 together? Tens, maybe hundreds of millions of workers in China will lose their jobs as the economy tries to adapt to the fact that housing is worth half of what they thought. Those with capital in the property market (90% of the pop) will realize their paper wealth is (again) worth half of what they thought, and stop spending as much on their iPhones and French designer apparel and Model S's, causing a global recession. Those who lent to certain Chinese corporations, probably aren't getting their money back, they are fucked too. Contagion is real.

Assuming they don't pay their offshore bond payment, Evergrande will be in default on October 23 (9 days). Probably mid-next week the media will finally start talking about it again. Fear will finally kick in in the markets and we will see more blood.

Why isn't the market pricing this in yet? Guess what, this same thing happened in the 2008 housing crash. Half of the smart money kept the price up while they slowly dumped their bags and even shorted the housing market. Just watch the Big Short again, there is a substantial period where swaps are not priced properly even as defaults skyrocket, as various investment banks try to get ahead of the crisis and ""head for the exit in a crowded theater.""

IMO, the people who are going to hurt the most are the thetards who have been selling naked puts and making bank for the past year and don't realize how exposed they really are. Are you fucking kidding me? Retail selling options in masse is a recipe for disaster. I hope they at least used spreads. Volatility is way undervalued given all the near-term concerns and it's entirely possible for some of the big ticker names out there to drop 50% over the next 3-12 months. Margin calls will fuel the downward spiral. This time, the public isn't going as supportive of JPOW's money printer because they'll be sick of inflation.

Let me put this in a way for you to understand.

**What is FASTLY?**

Fastly is a CDN (Content Delivery Network), kind of like Amazon, Google, and Facebook who sells connections to the internet to websites like Shopify, Reddit, Discord etc.

&#x200B;

**WHY FASTLY ISN'T SO POOPY**

June 8th Outage -  Fastly had a bug and the internet was shut off for a while. During this outage some customers of Fastly were revealed.

Known client list as of June 8th 2021 -  Reddit, Spotify, Twitch, Stack Overflow, GitHub, gov.uk, Hulu, HBO Max, Quora, PayPal, Vimeo, Shopify, Stripe, and news outlets CNN, The Guardian, The New York Times, BBC and Financial Times.

I don't know about you, but I use Reddit, Spotify, Twitch, Paypal. Seems like pretty big clients, so I think Fastly and the internet will be staying around for a while. This company cannot go tits up.

&#x200B;

**Cybersecurity and the Internet BIZ**

As of 2021 the Cybersecurity market is $180bn industry. Forecasts say these numbers will only go up over time as the web becomes more connected and security protocols, speed, delivery continues to improve.

BUG - Cyber security ETF, I'm surprised that FSLY is not part of this ETF (yet)

I believe sales will continue to grow. The internet is like the universe 2.0 and continues to expand over time, URLs might not be norm but apps and app connectivity are. Fastly is a CDN for apps too, for the popular app like TikTok.

&#x200B;

**FASTLY TEAM**

One word - DEDICATED.

You see people bounce from netflix to facebook to twitter to amazon to google to IBM very often. I see this on linkedin all the time, and the time they spend in the company 2-3 years to get a salary bump and a company under their belt to boast about.

At Fastly, look up the employees, they are dedicated, 6+years and counting. These employees who connect the internet can move to Amazon, Facebook, and Google, but they choose to stay at Fastly...

This only means one thing, the employees believe in the company, they like where they are, and they like what they do. Sounds like a recipe for success to me. (7% insider ownership) The founder is no longer the CEO but the CA and they continue to invest and develop ext-gen WAF and RASP to protect web applications, APIs and microservices.

&#x200B;

**SHORTS?! EXPOSED**

2021 is almost over, but the norm for this year was squeeze every short.

Fastly has a 16% short interest on a 100m float. Meaning 16m shares shorted.

The average vol of FSLY is 3.5m and the last time there was a short squeeze that was 10/16/2020 where the volume traded the float.

I went through the options chain to see who owns these short positions that were monthly's at one point that expire THIS WEEK 10/15.

&#x200B;

[15 OCT 21 PUTS](https://preview.redd.it/hv5os40kz9t71.png?width=747&format=png&auto=webp&s=c04042b6ce1df306f31d544c54dee96efc9f09d2)

The 3300 put options I believe belong to  **Walleye Trading LLC,** based off their 13f filing from Aug 16th.

300 Puts owned by  **Centiva Capital, LP**  based off their 13f filing

600 Puts owned by  **Zweig-DiMenna Associates LLC**  based off their 13f filing

&#x200B;

(**How can I check this?** SEC search their 13-f and open the info tables.)

&#x200B;

It's obvious that these institutions will want their puts to not expire worthless but what can they do? It's a bull market and FSLY just took off. Sounds like they will be covering the 43, 44, and 45's if the squeeze goes past the big $45 before expiration.

Are hedgefunds friends? Nope, they cannibalize off each other too, that's probably why some whale moved the price this week in hopes to start this ramp.

&#x200B;

The $43's already got pushed out and the $44 are close. If the $45 are pushed out it's ogre and gamma ramping.

&#x200B;

Where can a squeeze go? I'm not sure but I know it can trade the float or up to three times the float if there is naked short selling.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

FSLY If you are reading this you are using them. SHARES FOR LONG HULL, the internet universe expansion is imminent.

FSLY Price movement, shorts found, squeeze or no squeeze? 10/15/2021 remind you later?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Positions:

400 FSLY Shares @ $43.3

100 contracts 50C1022 @ .13 (to back my squeeze thesis.)"

At least mathematical research is being devoted to important topics for once. As Sun Tzu said, ""If you wait by the river long enough, the bodies of bankrupt WSB degenerates will float by""...

There is a mathematical boundary that distinguishes a Wall Street Bet from an ordinary trade. This boundary may be described as the point at which the expected geometric growth rate of a trade becomes negative (*i.e. you YOLO on an OTM call just before earnings release and lose everything*). The minimum fraction of ones available capital, *w*, needed to qualify a trade as a Wall Street Bet is found by solving the following equation for *w:*

(1+wb)**p**(1-w)1-p*=1*

Every trade can be described by the following variables:

*r:* an expected geometric growth rate, expressed as a fraction of capital. For example, if one‚Äôs expected geometric growth rate is positive 12%, then r=1.12. If the trade has a negative expected geometric growth rate of -15%, then r=0.85. (*yours is -100%*)

*f:* the fraction of capital invested. If one commits 20% of their capital to a trade, then f = 0.2. If one is all in, f=1. (*so for you reading, this is 100% of your mum's retirement savings*)

*b:* the return earned on a winning trade, as a fraction of capital committed to the trade. For example, if the odds are 2:1, and your account is up $2,000 from $1,000 risked, then b = 2.

*a:* the loss from a losing trade, as a fraction of capital committed to the trade. For example, if one loses 50% of the money they spent on a trade, a = 0.5.

*p:* the probability of a winning trade. For example, if the probability of a winning trade is 69%, then *p* = 0.69. (*so for you, this is 0*)

The expected geometric growth rate is found by the formula: r =(1+fb)**p**(1-fa)*1-p*

The Wall Street gambler does not take partial losses however as they prefer to hold losing options until expiry (*tru dat*). The loss from a losing trade, *a,* thus equals 1 as the Wall Street Bet‚Äôs losses are equal to the total portion *f* spent on the trade. The equation can thus be simplified:

r =(1+fb)**p**(1-f)*1-p*

The optimal amount *f* to commit to a trade is given by the Kelly Criterion. When *a* = 1, the Kelly Criterion is *f = p+(p-1)/b.* Plotting *f* on the x axis and *r* on the y axis, the Kelly Criterion gives us the maximum possible value of expected growth rate for a given probability *p* and odds *b*. Where the curve crosses the x axis, however, the expected growth rate of the trade equals zero. For values of *f* higher than this intercept, the trade is expected to lose money. It is thus a Wall Street Bet, and not a respectable trade. ([https://i.imgur.com/39c5qH0.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/39c5qH0.jpeg))

The trade that commits more to a single trade than Kelly and gives a growth rate of *r < 1* is a Wall Street Bet, and the fraction of capital *w* above which the growth rate is negative is the Wall Street Bet Criterion. For example, for a trade with a win probability of *p = 0.333...,* and payout odds of 5:1 *b = 5,* the Kelly Criterion gives a fraction *f* of 0.2, meaning a trader should commit 20% of their capital on the trade for a growth rate of *r=1.09*, which would turn $1000 into over $5 million over 100 trades on average. The Wall Street Gambler, however, would commit more than 44.2% of their available capital to the trade, **ensuring that they would eventually turn their $1000 into $0** (*solid intuition)*.

The formula for the Wall Street Bet Criterion is *(1+*wb)**^(p)**(1-w)^(1-p)*=1.* Solving for *w* is not as easy as it appears. Wolfram Alpha couldn‚Äôt do it, and neither could I. For example, for *p=0.25, w* can only be simplified to algebraic gobbledy gook like *w ‚âà -(2\^(1/3) (-3 b - 1))/(3 b (-27 b\^2 + 27 sqrt(b\^2 + 0.518519 b + 0.111111) b - 9 b - 2)\^(1/3)) + (-27 b\^2 + 27 sqrt(b\^2 + 0.518519 b + 0.111111) b - 9 b - 2)\^(1/3)/(3 2\^(1/3) b) - (1 - 3 b)/(3 b).* Take a look at the solution for p = 0.6: ([https://i.imgur.com/XjemjW3.png](https://i.imgur.com/XjemjW3.png))

I hope that someone can show me a solution to the Wall Street Bets Criterion equation. In the meantime, I have found that for *p=0.5, w*  = 2 times the amount given by Kelly. The relationship between *p* and *w* appears to be polynomial and the relationship between *b* and *w* appears logarithmic.

Less than optimal trades that still produce positive expected returns are not Wall Street Bets, they are just bad trades. If one is having difficulty turning their trade into a Wall Street Bet, there are three strategies one may pursue:

Increase the amount committed to a trade to above the value for *w.* This is the easiest and most straightforward way to turn a trade into a Wall Street Bet. Committing 100% of one's capital to any trade where  *p < 1* will safely ensure that the trade is, in fact, a Wall Street Bet. Alternatively, the aspiring autist can seek to find a trade with a lower probability. Lowering the probability of a win *p* can cause one‚Äôs fraction of capital committed *f* to exceed *w.* Finally, one can attempt to lower the expected payoff *b* for a winning trade.

A word of caution: for high probabilities, it may take more extreme measures than you might intuitively suspect to categorically declare your trade a Wall Street Bet. For example, for *p = 0.9* and the odds are a modest 1:1, *b= 1,* the amount of one‚Äôs capital that must be committed to the Wall Street Bet is over 99.8%! Any amount less than that is actually profitable in the long run and thus not a Wall Street Bet - it is merely a suboptimal trade.

While finding the value *w* is cumbersome without a solution to the equation *(1+*wb)**^(p)**(1-w)^(1-p)*=1,* I hope that my modest contribution may form a theoretical foundation for the definition of Wall Street Bets, and I hope that someone shares a simplified solution for *w.* Solving the equation would make it far more convenient for autists to ensure that one's trades have a negative expected growth rate."

Nasdaq will not list companies that unless they have ‚Äúat least two diverse directors, including one who sel-identified as female, and one who self-identifies as female or self-identifies as lGBTQ+ 

Goldman- Dec 2020 ‚ÄúToday in Davos at the World Economic Forum, I announced another component of our firm‚Äôs holistic approach to driving sustainable, inclusive economic growth. Effective July 1, Goldman Sachs will only underwrite IPOs in the US and Europe of private companies that have at least one diverse board member. And starting in 2021, we will raise this target to two diverse candidates for each of our IPO clients.‚Äù

Originally I found this illustrated in some brief research done by this mini doc https://youtu.be/IA7vN_rBOUA?t=363

Also it claims the Diversity Equity and Inclusion industry is now over 200 billion dollars.

Which lead me to also find this from Comp TIA

‚ÄúTake for example a project announced by the World Economic Forum in January 2021.
Partnering for Racial Justice in Business, which has commitments from 48 global
companies, is ‚Äúdesigned to operationalize and coordinate commitments to eradicate
racism in the workplace and set new global standards for racial equity in business.‚Äù
Meanwhile, the Nasdaq plans to require listed companies to disclose their diversity
efforts,and 80% of corporate boards are planning to tie executive pay to environmental,
social and governance metrics including DEI.‚Äù


So how closely should we be watching diversity efforts by companies and board appointments? Will this affect the consumer demand for these stocks as Environmental Social Governance score logic claims or will hedgies just use it to virtue signal and pour monehayy into who ever follows suit?

Welcome to Tuesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Tuesday, October 5th, 2021-

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/05/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-lordstown-motors-ocugen-pepsico-and-more.html)

*****

> # 1. Wall Street looks higher after Monday‚Äôs tech decline

> * U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open Tuesday as tech stocks bounced, one day after the Nasdaq sank more than 2.1%. Monday‚Äôs session was marked by rotation out of tech names as bond yields remained elevated. The S&P 500 on Monday fell 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 323 points, or nearly 1%.
> * PepsiCo on Tuesday raised its full-year forecast after its quarterly earnings and revenue topped analysts‚Äô expectations. The company‚Äôs shares were up nearly 1% in the premarket.
> * Johnson & Johnson said Tuesday it has submitted data to the FDA for emergency use authorization of a booster shot of its Covid vaccine for all adults. J&J shares rose modestly.
> * Volatility that accompanied September‚Äôs market decline continued in October, with the first two trading days of the new month up big and then down big. The Nasdaq, as of Monday‚Äôs close, was almost 7.3% away from its latest record close Sept. 7, inching nearer to a correction. The S&P 500 was 5.2% from its Sept. 2 record high. The Dow was more than 4.5% away from its Aug. 16 record close.

*****

> # 2. U.S. faces recession if Congress doesn‚Äôt act on debt limit , Yellen says

> * Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC on Tuesday she believes the economy would fall into a recession if Congress fails to address the borrowing limit before an unprecedented default on the U.S. debt. ‚ÄúI do regard Oct. 18 as a deadline. It would be catastrophic to not pay the government‚Äôs bills, for us to be in a position where we lacked the resources to pay the government‚Äôs bills,‚Äù Yellen said on ‚ÄúSquawk Box.‚Äù On Monday, President Joe Biden urged Republican senators to ‚Äúget out of the way‚Äù on the debt ceiling. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said Democrats should use their majorities on Capitol Hill to act without GOP votes.

*****

> # 3. Oil prices rose to around 7-year highs after OPEC, allies moves

> * U.S. oil prices, as measured by West Texas Intermediate crude, rose modestly Tuesday morning to around seven-year highs near $78 per barrel. WTI jumped roughly 2.3% on Monday as international oil producers decided to keep a cap on supplies. Despite pressure from the U.S. to ramp up output, OPEC and its allies were concerned that a fourth global wave of Covid infections could slow a demand recovery, a source told Reuters just before Monday‚Äôs vote. U.S. oil prices have surged more than 60% in 2021, bringing major energy companies along for the ride. Exxon has gained nearly 50% this year.

*****

> # 4. Facebook whistleblower to testify; platform outage fixed

> * Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen is set to testify at Tuesday‚Äôs hearing of the Senate Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection. After recent reports in The Wall Street Journal based on documents she leaked raised a public outcry, Haugen revealed her identity in an interview on the CBS program ‚Äú60 Minutes,‚Äù which aired Sunday night. She insisted that ‚ÄúFacebook, over and over again, has shown it chooses profit over safety.‚Äù Shares of Facebook rose 1% in Tuesday‚Äôs premarket after closing down almost 5% in their worst session in nearly a year.

> * Facebook and its Instagram and WhatsApp services are back online after a massive global outage. Facebook said late Monday that ‚Äúthe root cause of this outage was a faulty configuration change.‚Äù The roughly six-hour incident marked the longest stretch of downtime for the social media company since 2008, when a bug knocked the site offline for about a day, affecting around 80 million users. The company‚Äôs platforms currently have billions users.

*****

> # 5. Tesla must pay ex-worker $137 million over hostile workplace, racism

> * A San Francisco federal court decided that Tesla must pay a former contract worker, Owen Diaz, around $137 million after he endured racist abuse working for the company, his attorneys told CNBC. The jury awarded more than attorneys had asked for their client, including $130 million in punitive damages and $6.9 million for emotional distress. Diaz told the court that colleagues used epithets to denigrate him and other Black workers, telling him to ‚Äúgo back to Africa‚Äù and leaving racist graffiti in the restrooms and a racist drawing in his workspace. Diaz‚Äôs lawyers said the case was only able to move forward because their client had not signed one of Tesla‚Äôs mandatory arbitration agreements.

q1ilp4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q1ilp4/whistle_blower_may_have_lead_to_fb_outage_theory/,whistle blower may have lead to FB outage? theory,67,80,2021-10-05 07:52:22,"So I'm sure you've all seen the news relating to FB today so I'll keep this brief. But what I found extremely interesting is the timeline of the news. 

- first news breaks about the whistle blower 

-about an hour later FB and it's other platforms experience an outage

-around the same time or within the hour news breaks of the FTC complaints and news relating to the gov't trying to force the sale of insta and WhatsApp. 

So here's my theory. Also to me this sounds all tin foily but also slightly plausible. So I am reaching out to the apes here that are much smarter than me to help fact check or provide any insight. Or just straight up rip this statement apart if it is a crock of shit. 

Let's begin. So what I'm thinking is would it be far fetched to assume that these the outage is by no means a coincidence but rather planned? With the news of the whistle blower breaking out what if FB intentionally took their servers offline to either:

A. Discretely purge records that would confirm whistle blowers statements 
B. Strong arm the gov't to drop the suit by blaming them on a future date for the outage and having public backlash force the gov't to back off. 

Why I think this might be plausible is for anyone that's familiar with the game Eve online it's a game that everyones plays on the same server at the same time all over the world regardless of timezone. Therefore the server is always on except for a scheduled downtime that takes the server offline to allow for patches and updates. Now FB is similar in the sence that it's an always on service and probably operates on the same server or set of servers (my guess I don't know). What if in order to get rid of any back end digital paper trails you would need to edit at the architecture/frameworks/coding etc (developers/dev ops chime in here I'm not one so this is purely speculative). Now in order to do so would that require the servers be offline? 

Alternatively point b. That one is a little more self explanatory people as we know are addicted to social media so it wouldn't be a far stretch to assume that if FB pointed the finger at gov't or another scapegoat and said they forced us to do it people would get into a fit and the outrage would be fierce since there's already alot of distrust of the gov't. Since we know FB loves their data and consciousness experiments (i.e Russian interference in 2016 election, and no this isn't a political debate so keep your idiologies out of it) but since they have a general sense of what the consciousness of a country or demographic would be thinking it wouldn't be hard for them to spin stories that subscribe to people's narratives. Because as we can all agree people are almost most accepting of stories that best fit their own internal narratives. 


So again this might be a wild conspiracy theory. I might just be regarded and over analysing so please if anyone smarter then me can fact check this that would be appreciated"

Yet, we go out of our ways to select certain brands over others - most of the time at a higher price \[1\]. Everyone knows the importance of reputation for a company. Highly reputable brands have multiple things going for them:

* Their customers are extremely loyal and drive recurring purchases
* The public is vocal about recommending their brand and products
* Easier to expand to other markets as their reputation precedes them

Basically, you can consider having a great reputation to be a positive feedback loop on steroids! In an economy where 70-80% of the market value of a company comes from intangible assets like brand equity, intellectual capital, and goodwill \[2\], reputations can make or break a company‚Äôs performance.

In one of my previous analyses, we had discovered and proved that the [best companies to work for routinely beat the market in stock returns](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ok4l9c/i_analyzed_the_performance_of_companies_in_the/). So this week, let‚Äôs see how the most reputed brands have performed over the last decade!

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/e1y8b3xtp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=050451ab56c0dd05014ff5207231fc40766dadcf)

**Data**

While there are multiple companies that measure reputation, I chose the [RepTrack](https://www.reptrak.com/) list for my analysis as they seem to be the most established ones and have been creating their top 100 list for the last 2 decades.

They base their study on more than 240K responders over 15+ countries and the rating tells us how the companies are regarded by the general public. They have multiple factors that go into the final ranking, but for this analysis, I am only considering the final rank of the company.

I am considering the companies that were present in the Top 10 list at least once in the last decade \[2012 - 2021\]

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/w05hhrxtp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=5827fd247cb15d12bd50ac6746134c6bb6dac330)

**Analysis**

RepTrack publishes their result in March, every year. Since I could not find any fixed date of publication, for the purpose of the stock price calculation, I am using April 1st of every year as my investment date.

Even though the company produces a Top 100 list, I have limited my analysis to the Top 10 companies \[3\]. We then calculate the stock returns generated by these companies \[4\] over various time periods (1-year, 3-years, 5-years & till date) and then compare it to our benchmark. \[5\]

https://preview.redd.it/serqaextp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=18f15aea04e8a6decc25ff972c0bb01110d65bb5

 **Results** 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/hdjeau7zp8q71.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=a50598f9162d4b211dce3f202ff26e87296c52d8)

Companies in the most reputable list have consistently beaten SPY over different time periods. There is a significant improvement in overall return when holding the investment for a longer-term.

My hypothesis here is that, even though the short-term returns can be affected by market cycles, over the long run, companies having a great reputation end up outperforming their peers, and this is reflected in their stock price.

https://preview.redd.it/shv1yw10q8q71.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b85dbf0596b22f9d93bfa3f1cd954f012e9e796

 Another interesting insight we can derive from the data is the performance of the top-10 companies in each year‚Äôs list. As we can see, the most reputable brands beat SPY by a considerable margin in 7/10 years \[6\]. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/m10k3451q8q71.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=af6fb32d2245b0a5bc5d157d0931a91872716761)

But, before you YOLO your next paycheck into this strategy, do note that most of the returns were contributed by tech companies \[5\]. This is expected given the tech rally we had over the past decade. What is more interesting is how difficult it is to lose money investing in the top brands. Only 4 companies that were in the top 10 list over the past decade had a negative return. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/gz1th2ytp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab684cf2e2d4a3584b1c3590965c804bba19c284)

**Limitations to the Analysis**

There are some limitations to the above analysis that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy.

* Ideally, the backtest should be done over 30-40 year‚Äôs worth of data as we would know how the changing trends would impact the analysis. The last decade or so was predominantly biased towards tech.
* One should also benchmark this against the companies having an average or poor reputation to see if reputation is indeed a distinguishing factor that is driving the returns. \[7\]
* Finally, reputation is just one factor related to the company. There are companies whose reputations are in the gutter but have produced extraordinary returns for their shareholders (Facebook gave 175% return & Volkswagen gave 117% return in the last 5 years even after all the scandals they have been through). 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/cp1acpytp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=79a8269e8083fdbdf4f44e9ef093ee54ee2b73c1)

**Conclusion**

Whether you like it or not, brands seem to have a significant impact on our daily lives. Just think about the number of times you/your friend have sworn by a brand and recommended it to everyone \[8\]. Almost all the brands in the top 10 list (eg. Rolex, Ferrari, Adidas, Harley-Davidson) have users that are extremely loyal, willing to pay a premium, and acts as unofficial spokespersons for the company.

Our analysis, in turn, proves that all these positive factors cause the company to outperform the market! So now you know what to do next time when your friend is swearing by a brand.

Until next week‚Ä¶

**Footnotes and Existing Research**

\[1\] [This great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eIDBV4Mpek&ab_channel=BigThink) by Big Think showcases how Apple and Nike have spent billions of dollars for creating a positive brand image in our brains and most of us, in the end, are not rational customers.

\[2\] [Reputation and Its Risks](https://hbr.org/2007/02/reputation-and-its-risks) \- Harvard Business Review

\[3\] The main reason for stopping with the Top 10 is the manual data pull process. They do not give a stock ticker associated with the stock nor is the list easily parsable. Given we are pulling data for 10 years, I limited myself to the top 10 companies.

\[4\] A stock is only considered if it‚Äôs directly investable from the US market and is an independent company (Examples of companies ignored - Rolex, LEGO Group, and Bosch)

\[5\] Before you come at me with Pitchforks for using S&P 500 instead of Nasdaq Composite, please take a look at the list of companies. It‚Äôs from a wide variety of industries. Adding to this, even though tech provided the majority of returns, starting in 2012, you would not have any idea about the tech run we would be having over the next decade.

\[6\] I don‚Äôt think 2020 and 2021 should be counted here due to two reasons. First, it‚Äôs not enough time as we can see from the first graph (there is very little difference in performance over 1 year period), and secondly, 2020 was one of the largest bull runs in the history of SPY.

\[7\] [This report](https://www.rankingthebrands.com/PDF/Global%20RepTrak%20100%20Report%202016,%20Reputation%20Institute.pdf) by RepTrack shows the impact the Emission Scandal had on Volkswagen

\[8\] Micheal Platt, Professor of Neuroscience at Yale [did a study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eIDBV4Mpek&ab_channel=BigThink) that showcased that Apple users show brain empathy response to the Apple brand exactly the same way they would to a family member. Strangely, Samsung users did not have any positive or negative responses when good or bad news was released about the brand"

I've come to the realization that nothing in life matters so the most reasonable thing I could do is shoot my shot and turn my 
life savings into Roblox, Reddit, Robinhood, and Square stock and maybe plant based milk.

 But mostly Roblox. Working on the distribution rn but like 40-70%

I'm all in on the internet getting weirder and weirder. Fuck it I'm a Roblox Main now.

Is this a bad idea? The people at r/stocks think so. But fuck those guys. The CEO of of Roblox is Dave BasZUCKi and the CEO of Facebook is mark ZUCKerberg, coincidence? I think not.


Anyway on a more serious note, I have like an 8 page DD posted about Roblox and it being an education company from months ago. I've researched engagement based learning systems for nearly a decade. I think Roblox is it. And I don't think a lot of people see Roblox taking in Facebook. I do, fuck it, and fuck what anyone thinks about that idc. I think this is it.



The most recent earnings report says:

""We're really excited about the traction we've seen in China with respect to just the initial user growth. And especially in China, education is so important, both learning to code, learning to create, that we think there's amazing opportunities there to adapt and be beneficial there. I just saw some stats in South Korea, which shows how well our platform is working in that. The top 10 experiences in South Korea are somewhat different than the top 10 in the U.S.

...

Yeah. So I love how you brought up online learning. You'd start internally. We have a very big vision around education on the Roblox platform.

...

And it goes, as you -- I think, Mike hint at, way beyond learning computer science. It goes into learning all topics that goes on to learning about history immersively, all the way to learning about physics by jumping into a physics experiment. So we are hard at work kind of an educational vertical segment and more to come on that within Roblox. Really, when we think about the metaverse and what Roblox is, we do think of it as a utility, where there's going to be a lot of use cases that we can't even imagine right now.

I‚Äôm building an absolute monster position and the last week has been great for adding.

**Goal**:

100k shares

**Currently**:

Circa 75k shares between four accounts

**Why do I Like the Stock?**

From a Macro view industries have been getting disrupted with tech for awhile, insurance is next. At its heart Root is an Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and a future high cash flow generating monster. Everyone legally needs insurance and the Total Addressable Market is massive. Insurance industry is circa $4 trillion, while the USA Auto industry is $288bn annually. Discrimination against insurers is real, remember when your were a kid and paid 100's of % more than your parents? Good drivers should pay low rates, bad driver pay high rates. Age, degree, skin color, health condition aside. Just like Smokers should pay more for health care and so on...

With regards to all this data they are collecting? Well Facebook always said they would not monetize the data, but you know the story.. they did. Can Root monetize the data they are collecting? Yes for sure on internal optimization but what can they do externally? Partners products like financing, etc.? Will they? We will see, I'm betting yes.

I'm 33, for consumer acquisition I'm a mix of people and apps. For insurance, I haven't been to the broker for awhile but deal in email, however, some of the apps recently they are so damn good and so easy to use I would much prefer that. The days of calling or going to a brokers is over. Soon this will be the norm.

The culture at Root looks amazing, they care about the people and provide a nice work environment. I've done some research on LinkedIn and many have left All State, State Farm, etc. to go to Root. This is telling, IMO.

Lastly, a story that really hit home was Warren Buffet and Geico. His biggest regret was not buying it sooner. While I'm not saying Root is Geico and I'm not Buffet, I'm just doing what works best. Learn from others mistakes not your own. Buffet fully acquired Geico in the 90's for \~3.5bn its now valued over $50bn, enough said!

**I've Seen The Negative Comments:**

Companies face growing pains and Root is not immune to this. By replacing the Chief Technology Officer and recently moving the Chief Financial Officer to essentially head of Company Growth I see this as very bullish signals that they are adjusting and correcting course. Can they get by without removing Alex Timms? We will find out shortly.

I'm thinking Embedded Insurance, future insurance products priced on use and the sheer expansion across the USA will send G$ROOT to the moon!

Stock is extremely undervalued. Last round of funding before the IPO was for \~$15 and IPO at \~$27.

This could squeeze which would be great but I'm buying because of the undervalued aspect and disruption to a multi-trillion dollar industry.

**Finally Price Target:**

Realistically I don‚Äôt see why this isn‚Äôt back to $27+ it‚Äôs IPO price. With a higher valuation multiple like Lemonade even $50, 60+. It‚Äôs even scooped additional partnerships with Carvana and more in discussion with financial institutions. If it can squeeze then even higher. Root has a Billion of Cash on hand. They are burning through cash every quarter.

Carvana increased its gross profit per car from $1k to $4k by vertically integrating. 80% of Carvana customers take them up on their internal financing offering. Cantor Fitzgerald predicts 40% of customers will take Root up which is 38k Policies initially making its way up to 338k policies in a couple years. The average Root policy is around $1k. Carvana has options for 5% to 33% ownership of Root.

Have you checked out Carvana Market Cap Growth? Currently $27bn MC with 2800% growth in last 5 years. I think they know what they are doing when they invest $126m into Root.

**Short Squeeze: BONUS. BIG MONEY BIG MONEY. LMAO**

I‚Äôm not here for the squeeze I‚Äôm here because it‚Äôs criminally undervalued and the growth opportunity is wild.

Short Interest is 30%+, borrowing rate is growing. Around 22m shares short.

Technical Analysis shows imminent bounces to $14+ after imminently breaking out of the current descending wedge.

**Catalysts**:

Official Carvana ER guidance, New states sales increases, RootReady and embedded insurance, More insurance products driven by tech.

**Positions or ban:**

Four accounts with a total of 74,150 shares, \~70% of my liquid investments. Out of a possible 742 calls I have about 200 calls out. Need to keep some income coming in for more shares! If it squeezes I've got over 50k shares free of any covered calls. Will be buying some cheap OTM calls to protect my covered calls and those gains.

Currently selling way OTM covered calls to generate some income for buying more shares.

Dec 17 added 30, 35 strike, as if this isn‚Äôt a good sign!

It's time to wake up the Sleeping Giant and UNLEASH THE BEAST!!!  ‚úä

This opportunity is like buying $AMD sub $2 before SU BAE took the stock to $100!  üòç

\--------------

**Earning Results: (Beat on top line + Beat on the bottom line + Raised Guidance)**

BlackBerry revenue of $175M beat consensus by $11M, with Cybersecurity beating by $3M, IoT beating by another $3M and Licensing beating by $5M.  Shares have been up 8-10% after hours.  I personally can't remember the last time BlackBerry had a revenue beat.

**Customer wins:**

1. Top 10 automotive OEM chose BlackBerry Protect & Optics, after going head-to-head against CrowdStrike
2. Fortune 100 financial firm chose BlackBerry Protect & Optics, displacing Microsoft Defender
3. Australian Gov chose BlackBerry Protect & Optics, displacing Trend Micro and Symantec Norton Life Lock

**Patent Sale Date:**

John Chen on the conference call said price has been decided and 80% chance the rest gets closed/announced before the end of this quarter (before year end)

What‚Äôs interesting is that he said he‚Äôs got other buyers lined up and that the current company (or companies) had exclusive negotiating rights

With billions being thrown around in this space, he‚Äôs going to get a VERY good price for his IP (Intellectual Property)/licensing

This is awesome!

**IVY + Amazon (IoT and the Connected Car):**

IVY Beta will be available October 2021 which is much sooner than expected and will have embedded battery efficiency and Payment platform Apps

* SOFI mentions soared today after the stock price provided solid returns to shareholders today, up 11% for the day.
* SDC momentum is carrying over from the last couple weeks. This seems to be the next ""short-squeeze"" stock you folks like.
* BB took off after-hours and was up 11% at one point, but is now up 6%.
* FB stock slid down 4%, which is unusual for a blue chip operated by none other than Mr Zuckerberg. As the WSB saying goes ""you cant cuck the zuck"" and so WSBers were buying the dip.
* LCID slid 7% down today, but that's okay because the stock went up 10% the day before.

Here's the data of ticker mentions throughout the day, visualized. We can see the exact moment BB took off after-hours and when SOFI reall started to pick up momentum.

I am going to paraphrase a case study for you... it's gonna be choppy cause I am doing this off of memory which is garbage. I could pull the study in an hour or two when I go into work... 

Background: 
Back in the day federal government implemented the use of employee selections. They conducted a utility analysis on the selections assessments across a wide variety of factors (turnover, retention, performance, etc.) It was determined that there was a cost savings of approximately 18 billion dollars over a period of time. 

Facebook has been posting a bunch of these positions over the last few weeks - I know this cause I applied to a few of them. Not a fan of their policies, but I am willing to sell my soul for money - ya heard? 

If they fill the positions within 2-3 months, people will probably start to working towards their development, validation, and implementation cycles within the following 9 months. Based on their postings the positions may initially be geared to high volume entry level and mid level positions. I estimate that within 1.5-3 years they will start to have better financials surrounding human capital. It will take a little bit of time to show the benefits concerning retention while the herd is culled and replaced with better hires. 

It's a safe investment. Only downfall is that in 3 years there will be a federal election and Facebook usually sucks publicity wise around those times."

So we will see if the mods even allow this.I thought to myself the other day about ‚Äúapex‚Äù companies. These are the companies that are far and away the leading companies in their space.   


For example:  
Social Media:   
Facebook  
Online Shopping (and cloud..): Amazon  
Search: Google  
Smartphones: Apple  
EV cars: Tesla

You get the idea. But what I was moderately surprised at was the **lack of social media** **marketing** company. When a company is scheduling things to advertise on Instagram, responding to your whining on Twitter, or answering customer queries via Whatsapp, what are they using? **If you‚Äôre a top company, they‚Äôre using Sprinklr.**

Go look for yourself. What‚Äôs Amazon‚Äôs Twitter using? What‚Äôs Google‚Äôs Twitter using? What‚Äôs ESPN (Disney) using?  


Other examples of companies that use Sprinklr (as of Q2):  
Netflix  
Microsoft  
Twitter  
Amazon

Google  
The Marines (yep, it‚Äôs been government-certified)  
TSA  
Accenture

Deloitte  
McDonalds (tendies)

If you work at a big company, you‚Äôll recognize there are a lot of disparate tools being used in a similar function. Social Media management is no different. At its simplest, Sprinklr allows companies to organize content across platforms, easily respond to customers through different channels, and analyze the outcomes. This is exceedingly valuable to companies in order to manage their social media (helping with marketing efficiency, customer service outcomes, social listening, etc.)

There are also much deeper integrations here as well, but we will start with that. Now, how much do you think a company would be worth, given that the majority of the Fortune 100 uses their services? What if I told you they had 74+ customers generating over $1M each on a yearly basis? What if I said they had about 1000 other customers, with average subscription revenue (yearly) of $350K each?

Well, whatever you had in your head - the current market cap of Sprinklr is roughly $4.3BN. By EoY, they‚Äôre expecting (their prediction from Q2 earnings) to generate \~$415M in revenue (22% growth YoY).

However, I believe it‚Äôs generally undervalued for a variety of reasons.

1. They are recognizing revenue from subscriptions (90% of their revenue) as it happens, not when the deals are signed. I believe their estimates to be really low. Consider that there are 74 customers with at least $1M in yearly subscription revenue, and they themselves have stated they have 1000 customers with an average yearly value of $350K (as of June 23).Well, if you just took the average value X 1000 customers, + $74M, you‚Äôre already at $424M revenue. And no doubt, there are more customers signed since June, and no doubt some of the 74 ‚Äúbig‚Äù customers are spending much more than $1M annually. They also have the opportunity to upsell their current customers. **TL;DR** they‚Äôre clearly going to be way ahead of their projected earnings and will continually revise earnings skyward.
2. This is a really sticky industry. The companies that put the amount of work to migrate to use Sprinklr aren‚Äôt going to change to a different provider easily (and frankly, a single competitor doesn‚Äôt really exist). Retention is likely to be extremely high.
3. Sprinklr is **really early**. The fact that they have the majority of the biggest companies on the planet signed bodes well for their future. They have now stated they‚Äôre targeting the next biggest 30000 companies, and their sales pipeline/staff has started to ramp up (paused all of last year). I would expect many more companies to be signed here; additionally, I expect additional products to be released that can be upsold to existing customers (live chat analysis, liter-research platforms - they just announced something like this called Modern Research Lite - etc.)

Anyway, I could say a lot more, but by this point I either have your interest or not. A few things to conclude with -

1. Look at companies in an adjacent space to them. Qualtrics (survey + experience management company) - $23BN. Zendesk (mainly customer support/comms) - $14.5BN. Liveperson (a stock that literally just does chat on a website) - $4.7BN. Take any comp you want - probably undervalued.
2. Sprinklr does have a competitor called **Sprout Social**. Sprout is awesome too, and much more targeted at small companies. I‚Äôm invested in Sprout as well; they‚Äôve been on a rocketship recently ($7.3BN cap with $132M in yearly rev). However, I like Sprinklr over Sprout for a variety of reasons.. But the main one? **Trust what the top companies on Earth are using**. And I will take their judgment on this one. There‚Äôs probably room for both to succeed, but Sprout is much more narrow in my mind.
3. All wall street analyst PTs are above current price, with the lowest at $21 and the highest at $29.
4. There is basically **zero** ETF ownership of this, which is absurd as Sprout has **60** ETFS that contain it. I would be shocked if ETFs didn‚Äôt start picking this up, which will likely lead to a quick upswing in price because the amount of outstanding shares is quite low (high amount of institutional shares held, but can‚Äôt be sold).
   1. This has led to volatility recently (5-7% up and down days), but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be reflected in options pricing as IV is \~60-70%. Options not a bad idea.

TL;DR Sprinklr is undervalued. Massive opportunity. I think it could be the ‚ÄúSalesforce of Social Media Management‚Äù. Position = 2600 shares and 38 Feb 20 calls.

**BlackBerry has earnings coming up this Wednesday, September 22nd after the market close, and there has been speculation from RBC Equity Research that the patent settlement/details could be announced.**

[RBC Equity Research](https://preview.redd.it/u8c9mp5kovo71.png?width=1083&format=png&auto=webp&s=be29bb850a6833f65987bcce09b4d81d6a552aa5)

**On top of this, IAM media outlook who is a legit and fairly accurate media outlet specializing in Intellectual Property (and who first broke news about the BlackBerry Patent sales earlier in 2021) said in August 2021 the announcement is likely close and could be announced towards the end of September 2021, which is now (see below for the article):**

""Nine months after IAM first broke the story of a potential sale of BlackBerry‚Äôs patent portfolio, the deal to get it done may now be entering the endgame

It‚Äôs almost exactly five months since BlackBerry confirmed in a press release about its Q4 and full year 2021 financials that the company was looking to sell a large section of its patent portfolio:

During the quarter BlackBerry entered into an exclusive negotiation with a North American entity for the potential sale of part of the patent portfolio relating primarily to mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking. The Company has limited its patent monetization activities due to the ongoing negotiations. If the Company had not been in negotiations during the quarter, we believe that Licensing revenue would have been higher.

This came four months after IAM had broken the news that such a sale was being considered by the Canadian telecoms business.

Since that March announcement, though, and the contents of a 10K release, there has been very little public or, indeed, private comment on the state of play in how the transaction negotiations are panning out.

So, while it was known that the possible deal was with a North American entity and involved that part of BlackBerry‚Äôs 38,000-strong portfolio of patents ‚Äúrelating primarily to non-core or legacy mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking technologies‚Äù, there was no mention of a price, the stage the negotiations had reached or the identity of the possible buyer.

Inevitably, rumour finds its way into such a knowledge vacuum. Over recent months, IAM has heard all manner of things, including, most often of all, that the deal is going nowhere because the parties are so far apart on pricing; or, alternatively, that a deal is imminent and involves a single, big, Silicon Valley tech player, possibly Facebook.

Our understanding, though, is that neither of these ‚Äì or the many other stories doing the rounds ‚Äì are correct. Instead, although parties close to the negotiations are staying tight-lipped, we believe that things are reaching a conclusion, to the extent that an agreement could be announced around the time BlackBerry releases its FY 2022 Q2 financials towards the end of September.

The pricing has been more or less agreed, and the numbers are material. Meanwhile, the buyer is actually a group of entities that have been negotiating without an intermediary. That has created a level of complexity around the deal structure which explains why it is taking so long to finalise.

However, while there may be an announcement in the last week of next month (September 2021), closure will take longer as the deal is going to require clearance from regulatory authorities in at least two countries: Canada and the US. If everything goes well, though, the sale will be signed, sealed and delivered by the end of this year.

Note ‚Äì the above is not definitive, it could be wrong in places. However, what IAM is confident in saying is that the deal is progressing, pricing is not an issue, the potential buyer is not a single company and the aim is to go public with an agreement on or around the day that BlackBerry announces its next set of financials towards the end of September.

Here is my response

‚ÄúWell, seeing as how everyone is over leveraged including hedge funds, it could pull back 10%. Right now it's at 5, and everyone swore it wouldn't get to 5 lol. 

The 50 EMA, which is the uptrending channel it's been on for the past year and a half, convincingly broke the past two trading sessions. It is now focused on the 100EMA, if it breaks that, youre looking at a fall to about 390/395 for the SPY, and 3800 for the SPX. (Spitballing here for you gay technical gurus)

To be honest though, I'm not buying that it will be a crash or a major correction past 7%. I believe it falls tomorrow and Wednesday, which allows me to make profit lol, and then soars Friday. There is no way the federal reserve 1) stops buying bonds at the rate they are doing, or 2) hike interest rates while delta variant is growing in the US.

Although the economy is showing good growth, and inflation is running rampid (not transitory like  they try to say), the fed will continue to print infinite money therefore ruining the economy and setting up another great financial crisis event. The crash will severely destruct the country. 

1. The debt ceiling raise is being opposed by the republicans , without that raise, America essentially defaults on debt, which makes the evergrande (you need to google that, that's important) situation look like a walk in the park. They are probably doing this to delay the infrastructure bill (which will ""help"" the economy by pumping even more money into it, therefore causing a crash)......excuse my language but basically either way we are in a shit ton of trouble . 

2. In terms of the bill, it's coinciding with a tax rate for every class, let's start from the bottom up, there is a 11 million dollars getting pumped into the stock market every day by retail investors, this is largely from shutdowns, stimulus checks, and no incentive to put money in savings (see: interest rates) this slows down when the public opens up unrestricted, and when taxes are hiked to pay for the bill. Now, here is the trick that is lost on a lot of people. The administration doesn't want to hike taxes for anyone under 400000, but what they are missing is taxes are being put on popular items that people under the 400000 limit typically spend their money on (see: tobacco), moving on from that, those with incomes ranging 400000 to 5 million will be taxed at 28%, this is the somewhat important money, not as much as corporations but has the ability to drive prices unlike retailers. A lot of loopholes like the mega roth back door and criptoe (see: mods üôÑ)  being treated as a property rather than a security would be reversed. That has big implications into the next part. Corporations. The administration hopes to raise the tax rate on capital gains to 39%. The one thing the rich know how to do, is get around the system that was built for them to succeed. What this will do is force a further sell off by the big money in order to escape the new tax rate, and buy at a cheaper price in order to capitalize/make up for the tax rate during the economic recovery. The corporations will make off with more money than they had before, in a resurgent economy that is powered by the money of the only losing party who started the year and half rally in the first place, the retailers. 

3. I don't know if you remember, but I spoke to you all in the group chat about the federal reserve and their bond buying program, I was betting on that it stopped, but it didn't and reversed to its last ATH. The fed stated that the economy was not ready to go in its own and decided that tapering was off the table, the stock market rallied from its 2.5% low to an ATH in 3 hours. 10 days. 10 days later it created its last ATH (all time high) and has fallen for the past 3 weeks. Which is a clear sign that it is over valued. & furthermore, several fed board members have sold exactly at that ATH (which is illegal), Congress and pelosi has as well (which is illegal) and the only people who think the stock market will reverse back to ATH are, the retailers. The fed has two options, continue printing infinite amounts of money to stabilize a already stable economy further losing up the bubble to Great Depression proportions (which would not serve their best interest since they all have capitalized and SOLD already üò¨) or taper the economy and have the equivalent of the great financial crisis sell off for the next month . Technicals or news doesn't move the markets, people do. 


I'm hoping for a 10% correction, which is healthy for the economy and also for my bank account, I've already made my profit thus far, but if it doesn't continue correction and reverses to all time highs, we are going to enter a year long recession. There just isn't anymore money to throw at the economy without it coming back. 

And technically, the S&P/Nasdaq are tech heavy and controlled by FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, google), if there is a sector rotation there isn't one single sector that can hold a candle to them. The economy will falter.‚Äù

I‚Äôm not the smartest in the world on any of these subjects. I suspect neither of you guys are either. Jokes are welcomed. And I‚Äôm also willing to learn on shit I was probably wrong on in here. CAN YOUUUU DIGGGG ITTTTT?! 

LET THE GAMES BEGIN!

TL;DR - What do you think about the correction, recovery, and future of the stock market?"

In one day the share price peaked from $4.73 to $9.79. Buyers refused to listen bears explaining that the 5.6 billion share count was too high to move $NOK. Instead they kept buying hitting 1.2 billion volume in a day before trading was halted.

&#x200B;

**Global leader in 5G networks**

To keep it short Nokia is currently a network company. Main competitors being Huawei, Ericsson and Samsung. You can still buy Nokia branded mobile phones and other products under their licensing agreements, but the core is in the networks (fixed and wireless). Heart of the R&D is an iconic Bell Labs. Key words to current Nokia are 5G, edge cloud, AI, IoT etc.

&#x200B;

**Share count vs Market cap**

Nokia share count is 5.6 billion and market cap $31 billion (9/17/2021). During the meme action people figured out that the market cap 26.4 billion in January is what really counts, and this proofed to be right. It really doesn't matter if there are 5.6 billion shares at the price of $4.73 or 1.12 B shares with the price of $23.65 - exactly the same market cap.

As a comparison this year $GME and $AMC market caps peaked $37.3 B and $36.9 B respectively. However, $NOK didn't have a huge short position for leverage but instead it was and still is a value play with EUR 3.7 billion net cash and solid profitable cashflow. It is an undervalued quality stock in the blink of a turnaround. To give some perspective Nokia market cap was in January 2021 one tenth of Cisco's.

&#x200B;

**Renewed product portfolio is second to none in the industry**

Let's face it, Nokia had problems with 5G product portfolio development after it acquired Alcatel Lucent in 2016. Company simply didn't have enough resources to focus on 5G product line while they were busy to merge ALU and Nokia 4G product portfolios. So, they ended up taking a shortcut by using programmable FPGA chips in their products instead of more efficient and cost friendly SoC chips.

Eventually Nokia focused to SoCs in 2019 and it took two years to catch the competition with new Reefshark based products using SoCs. In July 2021 the huge workload was pretty much done and at the end of this year over 70% of shipped products will be based on SoC's and the new deals will be more or less all part of the renewed product portfolio.

Now that Nokia has catched up the gap to the competitors in product competitiveness it is adding even more firepower to the R&D efforts which can be seen as a good sign. Main target is to be the best network company in the industry and according to the management we will see some new exciting product launches still in this year.

&#x200B;

**Main competitor still banned by US government**

US has been accusing Huawei about close connections to Chinese communist party and sees it as a possible security threat. Therefore, it has been warning other countries to avoid using its products and about a year ago even banned Huawei to buy much needed 5G chips. Naturally the company bought as many chips to stock as it could but it‚Äôs now running out of parts (much worse situation compared to January 2021).

Their mobile handset business is currently sinking (no new 5G phones at all), and it seems that for base stations it must start using less sophisticated and more energy consuming components manufactured by Chinese suppliers. So, they will be able to deliver products but at what cost?

There have been articles stating that Chinese government should compensate energy costs to operators in order to make the new products more appealing. Pretty much the same strategical approach which Huawei has been successfully using in the past decade stealing market share from Nokia and Ericsson by selling products even under the price of components. All this has been possible because Chinese government has been subsidizing the company generously. Sad side effect has been that even there are a handful network providers left in the industry it has been hard to make any profit. Now it seems that US ban is changing the game and market share is flooding to western rivals which can start raising their prices and margins to reasonable levels.

&#x200B;

Overall the global situation is much different than it was a couple of years ago. It‚Äôs too risky for operators to focus purely on buying less secure underpriced Chinese products as their own government or consumers might turn against them. For operators it‚Äôs more important to do business with reliable and ethical partners. Nokia is a good choice as it has been named by Ethisphere as one of the 2021 world's most ethical companies.

&#x200B;

**Competent management with can do attitude**

Pekka Lundmark is the current CEO following Stephen Elop and Rajeev Suri. He did a much-needed strategy review in the company about a year ago and since then the progress has been convincing. Nokia buried its end to end strategy, business unit heads are now fully responsible of profit & loss and the decision making is not anymore scattered around the organization. All businesses are seeing growth and the change is already visible in the financial numbers even the three-year strategy execution is only in its first phase.

Pekka has also totally changed the company's comms policy. Nowadays Nokia is very transparent with its comms. It prefer to set lower targets and give surprise profit raises instead of promising the moon from the sky in the first place. The new policy might seem pessimistic to some but to be honest the overpromising strategy didn‚Äôt work well either and shareholders along with analysts lost the faith to the company. We might argue that the current undervaluation is indirect consequence of bad comms and it simply takes a few solid quarters to convince otherwise.

&#x200B;

**COVID and future technologies supporting 5G √≠mplementation**

COVID boosted the network usage globally and we are seeing growing demand for better networks with higher capacity and lower latencies. However, behind the scenes there is much more happening. Companies and research labs are inventing killer apps and products to best use 5G networks. For example, VR and AR could potentially be something to wait for.

Big problems with VR/AR have been the storage, power consumption, and processing power. 5G will solve the problems by pushing these  away from the PC and into the edge cloud. Imagine the next Facebook where people will get a totally new sense of immersion with VR/AR. When this happen the consumers and companies will be begging for growing 5G availability with more bandwidth and lower latency capabilities.

Private wireless use cases and smart city solutions are key parts to lead the next technological revolution with significant productivity gains and will grow the demand for high quality networks. Lufthansa, many ports and mining companies are already taking advantage of early wins to beat the competition.

Oh boy, oh boy when the first significant use cases for masses pop up. The demand for high speed networks will skyrocket and I bet that the few relevant network companies will not sell their products and services cheap now that Chinese are not anymore disrupting the markets.

&#x200B;

**What analysts are saying?**

Analysts focusing on the company are much more optimistic than the market currently. End of July Goldman Sachs raised their target to 6.10 EUR.

&#x200B;

Closing price (September 17): **$5.50** (4.70 EUR)

Target price: High $8.27, Median **$7.12**, Low $5.75

Buy: **17**, Overweight: **3**, Hold: **9**, Sell: **0**

&#x200B;

**Peculiar trading activity this week**

Nokia stock has been arrogantly used to rinse option players every now and then by market players. It seems that max pain levels for option players have been reached time and again. Actually, this happened past weeks as well when the share price was pushed from $6.29 (peak after Nokia raised their guidance for 2021) to $5.50 without any negative news. Someone adjusted the robots well as the closing price on Friday was precisely $5.50 (maximum gains for bankers). Only medicine to stop this kind of activity would be to grow the faithful owner base so it would be more difficult for market player to move the share price. Eventhough in the longrun these kind of short-term movements are meaningless.

With these levels, next week will be a great buying opportunity for long-term investors who see the underlying potential in this hidden gem. Not even meme phenomenon is needed to reach the double digits in $NOK share price in the coming years.

Disclaimer. I‚Äôm long-term Nokia owner with solid position of shares (9/17/2021 -> up +10%, YTD +49,13 %). I see the stock as a great value play in a long run but I‚Äôm not a financial advisor so buy with your own risk."

**This DD contains 10 hours of research and writing.**

**It is very comprehensive and will go into the nitty gritty details. It will be almost like a wiki for what we currently know about ASTS. In addition, I've went through all of the comments and tried my best to address all of the criticism in this part.**

Since my first $ASTS DD, The stock went up quite a bit, but it's still no where near the valuation it deserves. The potential upside of ASTS is comparable to $TSLA in its 50$s(post split) and this is an understatement. At a valuation of 2.03 Billion(now), a **10-100X increase in valuation**(stock price) is not far away from reality, if everything goes to plan. This is literally a once in a lifetime opportunity which for me deserves the risk (The risk of it going to 0$ if shit hits the fan or going to **200$+**).

One thing that ASTS has recently shown, **which ClOV failed to do**, is that **it's not a pump and dump scheme.** When it shot up, it stayed up and for me that shows that the holders are true believers and not just pumpers.

# WARNING! (Should Not be Skipped)

Since this is a speculative play, skepticism is healthy especially when the stock is in it's very early stages. We definitely don't want this to become the next $NKLA... In addition, as I mentioned, this could go either way **0 or +200$+ so always keep that in mind!**

# Intro (Should Not be skipped)

Roughly 40-47% of the world doesn't have access to online Porn or the internet, a **Trillion** dollar market unFapped. Imagine more than **3 Billion** horny people limited to only masturbating to their imagination!!

ASTS is developing the **First and Only** Space based Cellular Broadband network, **SpaceMobile.** SpaceMobile will be **compatible** with all currently existing 5G and LTE smartphones without the need to do any modifications to your phones hardware. It will provide connectivity **at 4G/5G speeds** **everywhere on the planet ‚Äì on land, at sea and in flight.** In addition, 5 Billion phones move in and out of coverage all the time, SpaceMobile is planning to bridge the gap of connection loss without the need of specialized equipment! Finally and More importantly, it currently has **no competitors,** not even **StarLink**(as per the CEO).

# 1) The Technology in details (Too fancy and can be skipped):

**TLDR;  The tech has been proven to work on smaller scales but has yet to be done at the scale ASTS is aiming for. Additionally, it's 6G forward compatible!**

AST SpaceMobile has designed a large aperture satellite system to provide ‚Äòdirect-to-device‚Äô service to normal phones using a **low earth orbit satellite** array to directly connect to mobile phones anywhere on Earth.

    1- Low Earth Orbit Satellites

Now let's start with good old GEOsatellites so that we can talk about LEO satellites. Traditional communication satellites are geostationary and have been in orbit for more than 50 years. GEOsatellites weigh more than 1000kg and operate 36,000 kilometers above the earth. These satellites remain in a fixed position relative to any position. Despite Earth‚Äôs orbit, this allows ground-based antennas the ability to point directly at the  satellite, in a fixed position.¬†

In contrast, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites(which ASTS is going to use) orbits between 200 and 2000 kilometers above Earth‚Äôs surface. ASTS is planning to have their satellites at 720Km using cellular spectrum primarily located between 600mhz - 2.2ghz weighing around 2000kg.

Unlike Geostationary Orbits , LEO satellites move rapidly(at an altitude of 500km, it can move at a speed of 7.6 km/s)  with respect to the Earth‚Äôs surface and have a small ground coverage. In particular, the ground coverage of a LEO satellite deployed **at 600 km** above the Earth‚Äôs surface and with a typical elevation angle of 30 degrees **is around 0.45% of the Earth‚Äôs surface.** Moreover, **due to the low altitude of deployment,** LEO satellites can communicate **with diverse types of ground terminals, such as dedicated ground stations (GSs), 5G gNBs**, ships and other vehicles, or Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This creates the need for a relatively dense constellation **to ensure that any ground terminal is always covered by at least one satellite.** Therefore, global commercial deployments such as ASTS usually consists of more than a hundred satellites to be able to have a full global coverage.

5G is a standard that incorporates many different bands of spectrum, including cellular (600mhz - 3.5ghz), which has great distance and propagation characteristics, and much higher millimeter band spectrum which has issues traveling far distances and penetrating objects.  ASTS is planning to use its partner‚Äôs CELLULAR spectrum, which can travel much further than millimeter band spectrum that is referred to by bears.

Now AST satellites each will have up to 2800 user beams and two or three gateway beams. Each user beam will be electrically steered through a large phased array antenna and will be capable of being pointed anywhere within the Field of View (‚ÄúFoV‚Äù) of 20 degrees elevation angle. Additionally, each satellite in the AST constellation will provide service up to 58 degrees away from boresight.

The satellites may transmit all of its active user beams on the same frequency or different frequencies. Each active user beam will track a fixed cell on the ground within its FoV without steering the boresight of the planar phased array antenna. All of the active beams can be distributed flexibly  within the FoV.

The same cell on the ground can be illuminated by a single beam, by multiple beams from same satellite, or by multiple beams from different satellites with in the view of the cell to enhance the user experience. The beam-to-beam handover and the gateway handover are based on schedules and  use a ‚Äúbreak -then- make ‚Äù approach.

    2- Frequency and User count

The large LEO concepts are mainly planning to use Ka band for Backhaul. These frequencies **enable higher data rates,** smaller antennas, narrower beams, and greater security. Moreover, improved spectral efficiency and spectrum-reuse rates can also **increase the amount of data a system delivers.**

In addition to better use of spectrum, advances in active antennas and processing have **raised throughput per individual satellite, increasing constellation capacity.** Consider a few changes:

* A satellite can now deploy more spot beams, and greater power can be delivered through each beam.
* Intersatellite links (ISLs) improve connectivity and confer particular benefits to large constellations, including improved throughput and management.
* Improved data-compression methods reduce bandwidth requirements without reducing the quality of communications.

So, a 10 Ka-band steerable antenna can provide up to 1.6 Gbps of symmetrical data connectivity. In addition, two high-performance antennas, can provide up to 5.2 Gbps of symmetrical data connectivity. This is only for the backhaul between the satellites and terrestrial stations. ASTS btw is planning to use V bands for backhaul, which have less traffic on them vs. Ka.

Now for the Fronthaul ASTS will use cellular spectrum (600mhz - 2.2ghz). These frequencies are used today by cellular phones. These frequencies are the best at covering long distances and can propagate through rain, walls, trees, etc .

The numbers for ASTS aren't out, but we can talk about Starlinks numbers since it uses LEO satellites too which is essentially the same technology. Starlink will be able to support 485,000 simultaneous users at 100Mbit/s across the entire US, according to new estimates. Additionally, Elon Musk tweeted on 26 of June ""Starlink simultaneously active users just exceeded the strategically important threshold of 69,420 last night!"". The technology works and the numbers are impressive.

    3- Latency

Ancient geostationary satellites (at 35,786 km) already provide broadband services but their transmissions take about 500-700 milliseconds (ms) to travel up and another 500-700 milliseconds to travel down. This time-lag is why users suffer the infuriating time delay during a conversation between the broadcast studio and an outside broadcast unit. Additionally, If the OB (Outside broadcasting) is more than one satellite ‚Äòhop‚Äô away, then the delay is multiplied.

Now on the other hand, A low Earth-orbiting satellite(What ASTS is using), between 200 and 2000 km, would manage these links in **about 25-35 ms**, a true fraction of existing satellite links and quite comparable to existing cables or fibre networks!

# 2) Timeline(can be skipped):

**TLDR;** **They have broken up their plan into 5 different phases spanning multiple  years with the intent of slowly expanding their satellite constellation until full global coverage is achieved.**

&#x200B;

* Phase 1 - Equatorial constellation, 20 satellites by 2022
   * Cash flow from phase 1 will support the following phases
* Phase 2 - NA/Europe/Asia, 45 satellites by 2022
* Phase 3 - Full global coverage, 45 satellites by 2023
   * At this point ASTS expects to start turning a profit
* Phase 4 - Full global MIMO coverage (increased data capacity), 58 satellites by 2023
* Phase 5 - Scaling network globally, 16 satellites by 2028

# 3) Management(Can be skipped):

* CEO Abel Avellan
   * 25+ years of space industry experience
   * Track record of building a successful global satellite communications company
      * EMC Emerging Markets Communications
* CFO Tom Severson
   * Former CFO of Emclaire Financial Corp
* Chief Technology Officer Huiwen Yao
   * 30+ years of experience in satcom
* Chief communications officer Chris Ivory
   * 25+ years of experience in satcom

Employees:

* 236 full-time employees
* 13 part-time employees
* 161 scientists and engineers
   * 34 of whom are PhDs

**The deep executive ranks include executives from Orbital ATK, Globecomm,  NASA, and Maxar ‚Ä¢ The team has 161 scientists and engineers, 34 of whom  are PhDs.**

# 4) Business Model(Can be skipped):

**TLDR; ASTS brings the satellites and execution while their partners bring the customers.  Projections for 2024 annual revenue are $1 billion, and for 2030 annual revenue of $16 billion with 90% EBIDTA margins.**

***The Model:*** ASTS has chosen to partner with **preexisting telecom giants** to acquire a large customer base with essentially **0 acquisition costs per customer** for ASTS. They have agreed to a **50/50 revenue** split with its partners who are going to provide the customers. The 5g connection will be offered as an add-on to preexisting data plans provided by their partners or as a standalone purchase.

***How Does it generate Money? :***  With its current carrier partners, Vodafone and AT\&T; given its large, fixed cost base, the Company expects to generate 90% asset-level EBITDA margins that provide  significant operating leverage and cash flow.

In-place there are binding agreements with carriers to provide ASTS with access to  >1.3BN existing customers without having to independently market to or acquire customers (or directly bear the cost of churn). Phase 1 will  target key Equatorial regions and cover 1.6BN people. In subsequent phases, it's planning to expand into Europe and N. America by 2024.

The company is expected to generate >$1bn of EBITDA by 2024 based on 168 satellites launched, 27MM total subscribers, with an ARPU of $2.50 per user.

***ASSets:***  ASTS has 750+ patents as well as a first-mover advantage(no competitors yet). Moreover, Commercial progress reinforces the Company‚Äôs technical lead in the market having ATT, Vodafone, American Towers and Rakuten in it's pocket.

# 5)Catalysts(can be skipped):

**The most important catalyst is the BlueWalker 3 satellite launch which will be taking place between March and April of 2022 and will be launched by SpaceX.**

This will be a bigger satellite than any previous ones created but it still is not the biggest they plan to make. However, a successful launch and connection to BlueWalker 3 would definitively **prove that the tech works at larger scales.**

**Expect major runup to BlueWalker3 test date. AST is currently valued at only about $2 billion ($12/share). In 2017, about 7 months prior to Starlink's first test launch, it was valued at $15 billion ($83/share).**

Other smaller but still significant catalysts include:

* Government approvals for servicing in each country
* The launch date for BlueWalker3
* Acquisition of a portion of the federal 5g fund

# 6) Share Holders(Can be skipped):

According to Fintel, 29% is held by institutional investors. In  addition, These investors are well versed in the 5G market and I don‚Äôt  think that they would‚Äôve invested if they didn‚Äôt see a proof of concept.

The following companies are partners  and large shareholders with their percentage of capital ownership  (includes both Class A and B common shares):

* Vodafone - 6%
* American Tower - 3%
* Rakuten  - 17%

Other notable partners include:

* ATT
* Samsung
* Safran
* LLA
* Telefonica
* Telstra
* Tigo
* Telecom
* Indosat

# 7) Risks(Should not be skipped Asshole...):

Every play ranging from 0dte to year long investments come with some amount of risk and this is no exception.  While some may simply be setbacks they are still worth knowing.

* Delays
   * Satellite construction and launch delays.
* Execution
   * Building, launching and deploying the satellites.
* Regulators
   * Need governmental approval for satellite operations from each country they wish to provide before they can service them.
* Tech
   * Satellite to phone connection still unproven on a large scale.
* Funding
   * Not fully funded (Need to raise \~1.5 bn) however phase 1 is fully funded and is planned to help pay for the subsequent phases.

# 8) Valuation(Most important part):

The current market cap of ASTS is only 2.03 Billion for a stock with an extremely high potential, endless possibilities, and no competitors.

SpaceX's Starlink(If we want to compare apples to oranges), will provide **FIXED-POINT(Doesn't connect to mobile)** broadband to customers at very high costs with unclear quality. Moreover Starlink cannot translate to mobile devices. It depends on Dish Satellites.

StarLink is valuated between 40-50Billion Dollars! **Which equals around 222$-277$ of ASTS!!**

Just like Facebook found out after it's IPO, the real market is and always will be in **MOBILE** and Starlink cannot translate to mobile devices.

***Deutsche Bank most recent coverage:*** Their price target was set on 35$ and they added this nice comment **‚ÄúIf management executes on plan over the next five years, the company's intrinsic value should ultimately be ""significantly higher""** than the $35  price target.""

**Deutsche Bank adds: ""2024 is  early in this project's lifecycle. If we take AST management's 2030  EBIDTA of more than $16 billion and apply a 10x multiple (which we think  is still conservative given the business' expected growth profile),  this implies a 2030 enterprise value of $163 billion (vs $2 billion  today). Discounting that EV back to present time at a 15% discount  yields a share price of roughly $190 today.""**

***Barclays Most recent coverage:*** Their price target was set on 29$.

**And Most importantly my coverage:** Well, you cannot really valuate this rare breed, because it's like trying to valuate $TSLA in the early days when it was just 50$(post split). ASTS is in a very similar situation right now having no competitors with a massive lead in the industry(A proven product on a small scale with well established partnerships with Vodafone, ATT, American Towers and Rakuten).

Right now, it should atleast have a market cap of 10 Billion, which is 1/4 Starlink, and there's actually no competition.

My price target remains unhinged and will be illustrated bellow with Crayons:

Not just general intelligence but incompetence in individual fields. 

If you haven't beaten the market over the last 6 months, you probably think you got a bit unlucky. If you've managed to beat the market over the last 6 months, you probably think you're an investing god. That ego can make you broke, and now is the time for a humility check. 

You're in this subreddit. If you're reading this, do you think you're better than the top investors out there- Burry, Dalio, Wood, Buffet? Well, maybe you are, but statistically, you're probably not. 

So, what do the top investors say lately? Here's my interpretation:

Burry: We're in the biggest speculative bubble of all time in all things.   
Assets under management (AUM): $635 million

Dalio: US Bonds are crap, US equities are frothy, tech is bubble-ish. Get into emerging markets. China isn't so bad.   
AUM: $140 billion

Buffet: I'll reduce my positions and wait for a better entry.  
AUM: $632 billion

Wood: Innovation will lead to enormous GDP and productivity growth over the next 5-10 years.   
AUM: $53 billion

=============================================

If you've been following financial news this year you probably know that Burry started shorting TSLA back in Dec 2020 and has been crying wolf that we're in a bubble since this spring. Ever since then the market has gone up a lot. Doesn't that make him wrong this time? Not necessarily, no. In fact, that means we might be in an even bigger bubble than we were earlier this year. Luckily for him, seems like he learned from last time to hedge his shorts too, and bought FB and GOOG calls in case the market continues to rocket, which have printed hard. 

 Speculation is at an all-time high. Look at this chart of subscriber count for WSB:

Now with fundamentals way off, TA lining up, and lots of possible macroeconomic issues in the near future, this looks to me like a great setup for a short. Now of course, nothing is certain in the markets. BUT, if the bubble is about to pop, this could be the trading opportunity of a lifetime. That's why I'm going short. 

""Burry is a value-shill permabear""

Burry was long on a bunch of equities at the bottom of the pandemic last year, he bought GME at $5. [https://www.yahoo.com/now/michael-burry-doubles-money-3-174031896.html](https://www.yahoo.com/now/michael-burry-doubles-money-3-174031896.html). He has consistently beaten the market in bad years and good years too.

""Cathie Wood gives TSLA a $3k price target""

Wood, Dalio, and Buffet have such high AUM that their positions can be highly illiquid. That is, even if they knew they positions were overvalued, they aren't always able to get out of before causing panic in the underlying. For this reason, you always have to take what they say with a grain of salt. Wood, who is a brilliant investor, would obviously not say that TSLA is overvalued, same that Dalio will not say that BABA is a risky stock to hold. It's a perfect case of ""do as I say, not as I do."" So instead of listening to what they say, which is always going to be biased, try looking at what they do. 

And lately, Wood has been selling TSLA. When the **bulls start selling**, it might be a good time to get out.

Website for reference [https://www.microvision.com/](https://www.microvision.com/)

MVIS has many uses for it's technology but the two main verticals are Automotive Lidar & AR/VR.

**Automotive Lidar -** Microvision just completed what they claim (with good reason) is their ""Best in Class"" Long Range Lidar unit. It is an actual product that they are track testing and showing off at the IAA Mobility Conference in Germany. Look at the live demo they have up vs. our competitors:

* Luminars Lidar Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/c8v23x](https://streamable.com/c8v23x)
* Continental Lidar Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/gyee85](https://streamable.com/gyee85)
* Velodyne Lidar Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/lhtsw2](https://streamable.com/lhtsw2)
* Microvision Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/paywxe](https://streamable.com/paywxe)

As you can see by the point cloud and refresh rate MVIS sure looks best in class. MVIS is currently on the path of scaling for production and looking for partners.

Market Size - The global lidar market size is projected to reach **$6.77 Billion by 2026** and virtually every car company is investing/looking to utilize Lidar in the future for assisted and automated driving. It could be in every new vehicle. Luminar (LAZR) the inferior product as you can easily see by the videos above IPO'd last year with a market cap of $8.1 Billion.

**AR/VR** \- Microvision produces the MEMS Laser Beam Scanning display engine found in the Microsoft Hololens 2. It was confirmed through a tear down before and just officially via MVIS's last ASM. Also, since Microsoft produces the IVAS (rugged Hololens 2 for military use) it is highly speculated that MVIS is the engine inside that also.

Market Size - According to a comprehensive research report by Market Research Future (MRFR), ‚ÄúGlobal AR and VR Market information By Technology, By Component, By Device Type and Vertical - Forecast till 2027‚Äù the market to reach **USD 766 billion by 2025.** Also, Microsoft just won an army contract this year **worth up to $21.9 Billion.**

Google the Hololens 2 or IVAS units to see all the cool futuristic shit they can do. I'm not gonna spoon feed you everything.

**Stock Info**

Current Market Cap = $2.24 Billion

52 Week High = $28

52 Week Low = $1.38

Estimated Short Interest = 29.75m or 18.29% of FF

Q2 2021 shares held by institutions: **42,174,027 (25.7%)**

**Summary**

Since Sumit Sharma took over as CEO he continues to deliver on his promise to increase shareholder value. The company is open for a buyout, strategic alternative, or going it alone with it's amazing technology. Whatever will be the best route to **INCREASE SHAREHOLDER VALUE**. At it's current share price we are way **UNDERVALUED.** There is more DD out there on the technologies, different verticals, and how we are at an inflection point for these things to pop. Go look at the MVIS subreddit and the meta thread there of DD I can't link.

**Edit -** Thanks for all the internet points you POS I'm gonna take a screenshot and hang this on my fridge. Seriously though this was just a quick bullish summary I put together, there's way more going on if you're interested all the info is on the line and with some in the comments."

# Part 0: Intro

Sup freaks. Just came back from the moon and that shit is glorious. Here to officially introduce you to a play I‚Äôve been loading up on for weeks. The company is Genius Sports Limited, ticker $GENI, aka GENIE, or as Forrest Gump would say Jennaaaaay. You may be wondering why I‚Äôm here? I‚Äôm clearly (newly) rich, I should get a life. The answer is simple. I‚Äôm a degenerate and it's short hunting season. Pow Pow. The FUD‚Äôr of interest is forensic bitch and noted short seller Spruce Point Capital Management. These guys are incredibly ***unsuccessful*** in their calls so I take this as a major bull flag that they released a short report on GENI. Spruce‚Äôs past successes include: MGNI (moon shot/money printer), DBX (DropBox), Nova (rose 88% after their post, talk about poor timing). These guys have the Midas Touch, ***anything their*** ***fungus filled fingernails*** ***stroke eventually end up moonshotting***; I‚Äôm here to expedite the process.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/kw02izf6xbm71.gif

Anyway, Genius Sports Limited (GENI) is a tech company that collects data from sports events, processes it, and sells it to major gambling companies to run their sportsbooks (SKLZ, DKNG, Fanduel, Caesars etc). They are the [pick & shovel](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pick-and-shovel-play.asp) play of a rapidly growing sports gambling segment ([gambling record $44bn in revenue 2021](https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2021/08/10/us-gambling-revenue-to--break-44-billion-record-in-2021/)). They have 4 competitors (large moat) but only Sportradar offers any real competition. GENI has deals with NASCAR, MLB, NBA, NCAA and the English Premier League amongst others. They are also the [official data partner of the NFL](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/01/nfl-agrees-to-data-rights-deal-with-genius-sports.html) holding exclusive rights; dump truck sized moat. Prominent investors include Cathie Wood, Mrs ‚ÄúAverage Down at all Costs‚Äù, Anpanaman ‚ÄúGod Tier SPAC Wizard & [wsb Yolo‚Äôr](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oyjk9i/geni_spruce_point_smash_grab_shorts_disclose_your/) (1.1m+ [üò≥](https://emojipedia.org/flushed-face/))‚Äù, amongst others (institutional ownership is 90%+). But, before we get into more specifics about the company + setup please watch this educational video:

# Part 1: Institutional fuckery

Spruce Point Capital Management [issued a hit piece](https://www.casino.org/news/genius-sports-stock-could-see-big-declines-says-noted-short-seller/) on Genie. Their primary claim is that Genius is a ‚Äúmiddleman‚Äù with an ‚Äúinferior business model‚Äù saying the stock could fall 60% to 80%, so a PT of $3.25 to $6.50. Well first off Spruce, fuck your bitch and the clique you claim.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/uk0m1vhlxbm71.gif

With that being said, Spruce is so so so wrong.  Given Spruce‚Äôs history of abject failure I would go further and say this report is baseless FUD. So, why would Spruce put itself in the path of a runaway train like Jenaay? Seems crazy tbh. Welp they‚Äôre known as a [‚ÄúSmash & Grab‚Äù short seller,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/reddit-jolts-activist-short-hedge-funds-into-adapt-or-die-mode) so these guys give friends an early view of their calls so they can front run the market before it's released to the public, profiting from the panic.  Spruce‚Äôs hit piece was released Aug 5th, the stock rose the entire day and it‚Äôs been in a legit uptrend since then, no panic lol. If this is Spruce‚Äôy bois M.O. they just fukd their company and their friends with another horrible call. [It seems like Sprucey‚Äôs gone into hiding, hoping this all blows over. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oyjk9i/geni_spruce_point_smash_grab_shorts_disclose_your/)

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/enqy9vfmxbm71.gif

Now it‚Äôs Cathie Wood‚Äôs/Ark Capital turn to polish off Spruce‚Äôs beautiful thighs. Cathie started loading the boat Aug 5, the same day of Spruce‚Äôy bois FUD article, and the same day of the DKNG/GENI transformative deal \[[source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/draftkings-genius-sports-sign-transformative-110000399.html)\]

Can‚Äôt help but respect Cathie‚Äôs bullish buying. More importantly however, is this rising floor Cathie is building into the stock price. She is known for having strong convictions and sticking to them. She‚Äôll buy the triple layered guacamole sized dip & take the ride.

[But don‚Äôt take my word for it. Check out this big, green, dildo. Cathie, you bad.](https://cathiesark.com/arkw/trends)

If you need any more proof, let‚Äôs take a look at the near-100%-of-float institution rate. It‚Äôs almost as if GENI has an unconscionably small float that‚Äôs being aggressively bought by diamond handz Cathie while the MM buys remaining float shares to hedge calls.

# Part 2: Fundamentals

GENI is the backbone/infrastructure play on sports betting since they supply the  data that major gambling companies use.  GENI offers a suite of four products:

* **GeniusLive**: this is a vertically integrated video service that allows teams or sports leagues to launch something like NBA League Pass. So the platform supports payments, live statistics, advertising, live streaming, and video on-demand, without having to buy a bunch of extra software/hardware.
* **Sporttech:** Data capture, management and analysis tools that help leagues run their sport, unlock new revenue streams, and protect the integrity of their competitions. This is essentially the shit that has turned Facebook from some site used to scam on girls in  college into a company with revenues of over $10B a year. GENI collects all the data from degenerate bets, and provides the information gathered from them to their partners for future use.
* **Sportsbook:** GENI provides the capability (but not requirement) to build out an entire sportsbook platform for their partners.  This provides all the benefits of having a sportsbook with none of the risk of spending capital on a field GENI partners are unfamiliar with.
* **Media & Engagement:**  GENI has the platform capabilities to allow their partners sports betting experience to enter into the world of social media.  You can chat in real time with other sports betters and complain that Nick Chubb stepped out at the 1 yard line and completely boned your 3 bet parlay. Through this platform GENI can leverage their fan engagement capabilities to drive advertising revenue and also promote future bets that may be to your liking based on your prior activity.

As  mentioned Genie‚Äôs only real competition in this space is Sportradar, but Sportradar‚Äôs [SPAC merger fell through](https://www.casino.org/news/sportradar-filed-for-a-highly-anticipated-ipo-on-tuesday/) after GENI swooped the exclusive rights to the NFL from under them -- ya know, the ole‚Äô Bulgarian ambush perfected by Vlad.

The NFL deal is pretty significant so let‚Äôs dive into it:

* **Expensive af**: Genius will [pay the NFL $120 million a year over six years](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/53865/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute/), with half paid in warrants making the [NFL own roughly 5% of GENI](https://www.yahoo.com/now/nfl-stake-genius-nearly-15-215504358.html).
* **Locked in profit**:  Sportradar was pulling in 1.5% to 2% of in-play gross gaming revenue (GGR) on NFL wagers \[[source](https://sportshandle.com/sportradar-genius-nfl-data/)\].  Genius decided to go the opposite route by jacking up rates; asking for around 4% of operators‚Äô pre-match NFL betting revenues and 6% of in-play \[[source](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/53865/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute/)\]. Operators are big mad about this:

>*""They don‚Äôt really have anything new,‚Äù said another operator exec. ‚ÄúThey are charging 4x for the same dataset.‚Äù*

These guys are forced to use Genie‚Äôs official NFL Data either because they are official partners of the NFL (FanDuel, DraftKings, Caesar), state regulations require use of official data, or the TV networks force them to subscribe to Genie data to advertise.  As of now, [DraftKings has already partnered with GENI in a multi year deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/05/draftkings-partners-with-genius-sports-for-sports-betting.html?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_medium=Social&utm_content=Main&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1628161383), PointsBet, WynnBet, BetMGM, Caesars, and Fox Bet have also signed deals w/ Genius ([NFL names Fox Bet, PointsBet, BetMGM and WynnBet as Approved Sportsbook Operators](https://www.gamblinginsider.com/news/12973/nfl-names-fox-bet-pointsbet-betmgm-and-wynnbet-as-approved-sportsbook-operators)).  This leaves only Fanduel as yet to be disclosed, but likely already signed with Genie. Senior operator exec‚Äôs legit crying that [its a monopoly.](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/53865/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute/)lol. Sucks for them, great for us.

* **Sticky**: The Sportradar deal was inked in 2019 and they got cucked in 2021. Sad. GENI is proactively making moves to make the deal last longer than 6yrs by hiring a good amount of NFL vets. Including [Steve Bornstein](https://www.sportico.com/personalities/executives/2021/genius-sports-steve-bornstein-1234637226/), he now leads GENI‚Äôs US business. Mans spent a decade at the NFL managing the media strategy, and spent multiple decades at ESPN and ABC.  He also was the CEO of ESPN for a cool min.
* **NFL shills for GENI**:  This cannot be reinforced enough: the NFL‚Äôs chief concern is the integrity of the data provided, and they are entrusting GENI, and ONLY GENI, with that.  They will also force anyone who wants to do business with the NFL to adhere to the NFL‚Äôs core integrity policies by [agreeing to license all Official League Data from GENI](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-announces-agreements-with-four-approved-sportsbook-operators)

To put this in simpler terms: the NFL is telling the world -if you want us, you‚Äôre gettin‚Äô some GENI.   GENI also issued warrants to the NFL (5% stake in GENI)  meaning when GENI is successful the NFL is successful so they are locked in and incentivized to push GENI to anyone who wants to work with them.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/l3e1xpncxbm71.gif

The reason I‚Äôm bullish on Genie and jacked with shares/options other than the regular ‚Äú*it could squeeeeez*e‚Äù play which I know, love, and bang the shit out of, and will explain this angle later, is because Genie secured the NFL deal at the perfect time. So, 3 yrs ago the supreme court overturned the ban on sports betting. The NFL has responded by moving its business model towards generating significant amts of revenue through betting. Sucks for Sporttrader, since for most of the time they held the  exclusive rights to NFL data, the [NFL actually considered gambling to be threat](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/08/25/nfl-sports-betting/)**üò±**, what a bad position to be in going into the gambling golden age.

The NFL expects to make $270m in revenue from sports-betting this yr, and  NFL execs are super bullish about their future sports betting revenue, here‚Äôs a quote from one:

>*You can definitely see the market growing to $1 billion-plus of league opportunity over this decade.\[*[*source*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/08/25/nfl-sports-betting/)*\]*

The ideal sports-gambling legislation, the NFL concluded, would include substantive licensing requirements creating clear and transparent markets that protect consumers. Bets needed to be resolved using the league‚Äôs official data (GENI!! - fuck you, pay me.)\[[source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/08/25/nfl-sports-betting/)\]

***So, when I invest I try to think of analogies that speak to me. This lets me invest in a more  logical and clear headed way. I compare this situation to the girl that sat next to you pre-OnlyFans. She used to eat ramen for lunch. A couple years later she has a poodle, a G Wagon, and goes by ‚ÄúCyrstal like the champagne‚Äù instead of Bernice. Yah, she twerking on cam because she found a money printer, the NFL will twerk to online-betting.  Analogy.***

*The whole industry will be twerking.*

Cathie Wood‚Äôs a month before she started yolo‚Äôn on Jenaaay estimated x10 increase in domestic sports betting handle (the amount of money wagered by bettors is called ‚Äúhandle‚Äù), to $180 billion by 2025 , with revenue‚Äôs for the sector projected to sky at a 31% CAGR.

One reason for this bullish prediction is the New Jersey example; since NJ legalized online sports betting mid-2018, they've seen online handle moon to $15 billion, 1/2 of this took place in 2020. (*Don‚Äôt know why people would yolo on sports and* [*not options*](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pg9jpn/why_doesnt_everyone_only_trade_options_0_dte_spy/)*, but to each their own lulz*).

Sportsbetting is picking up so much steam, ESPN keeps their own tracker for up to date info on which states are going to let you yolo rent $ on Appalachian State vs Syracuse:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g68ri70exbm71.png?width=1272&format=png&auto=webp&s=95e3af4ca366eb8d64ba23ac0f970d51bdac69b8

There are only 3 states (Utah, Idaho, and Wisconsin - which btw if you live in any of these places - move the fuck out) that do not currently allow for sports betting and/or are in the process of allowing it.  Ground floor opportunity here.

[Earlier this month, Wyoming Awarded Genius Sports Inaugural Sports Betting License - upping the number of states GENI can operate in to 15. ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wyoming-awards-genius-sports-inaugural-213000130.html)

So clearly Jenaayy is a growth stock but let‚Äôs look at the fundamentals & also how Genie compares to the competition. (Genie, Jenaayy, GENI, Genius ‚Ä¶ lol sorry I‚Äôm  dislexic). Ya so  Sportradar (Genie‚Äôs rival)  is slated to go public this year and will likely trade in the $10-12B valuation range \[[article/source](https://www.sportico.com/business/finance/2021/sportradar-ten-billion-valuation-1234623092/)\].

Sportradar filed its S-1 a few weeks ago which provides historical financial performance.  Making some simple assumptions on continued revenue growth (based on historic CAGR) we can figure out Sportradar‚Äôs valuation multiples which we‚Äôll compare to Jenaayyy‚Äôs.  I‚Äôm also throwing in Draftkings in the comparison as a high growth (but unprofitable), pure play sportsbook leader.  You can see below how the financials compare:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1f6alqkfxbm71.png?width=1258&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c25a5c75f0ca5b4498d9883053284138e273ec7

I would argue Genie and Sportradar should trade at a premium to Draftkings as they have an effective duopoly on the sports betting data market.  Draftkings‚Äô sports book market is getting more competition from new players, which is causing customer acquisition costs to skyrocket.  HOWEVER, as more of these players enter the market, they‚Äôll have to buy all their official sports data from Jenaayy!

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/fk2cxfmgxbm71.gif

Let‚Äôs get serious for a sec,, below is a valuation comparison and as you can see Genie trades at a discount to DKNG and at a premium to Sportradar‚Äôs expected IPO pricing valuation of $26-29 or $7.4B - $8.2B. It‚Äôs expected that Sportradar will trade in the $10B - $12B range once it starts trading.  Genie should probs trade at a premium to Sportradar valuation given the enormous potential of its exclusive NFL deal over the coming years. Vauling Genie at a premium would imply a conservaitve estimate of $25 to $30 price per share based on the company‚Äôs CURRENT projections..

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f75x253ixbm71.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5a6d0efe77944fcd133102ba7e3424f6b93b026

Genie reported Q2 earnings on 9/8 which beat estimates.  Revenue was $55.8M and EBITDA $5.2M vs. street estimates of revenue $53.8M and EBITDA $1.7M.  Genie tightened its FY2022E guidance to $250M-$260M of revenue (which was increased in Q1 from $190M) and EBITDA of $10M-$20M.

Don‚Äôt take my word for i though, Wall Street analysts agree with their Price Targets:

* Benchmark BUY $33 PT
* Oppenheimer BUY $32 PT
* Goldman Sachs BUY $31 PT
* Craig Hallum BUY $30 PT
* Needham BUY $28 PT
* Singular Research BUY $28 PT

These 12-month price targets equate to an average $30.33 or 43 % upside from the current stock price.

Some other data points:

* GENI is in a $330M net cash position
* Does it pay a dividend? Of course not
* Free cash flow is absolutely atrocious - the company is in reinvest and GROWTH mode
* Holy fuck is price to sales looks steep based on 2020A at 27.9x, but gets cut in half by 2022E at 12.3x due to massive growth
* Positive seasonality outlook, very volatile but shows recently strong performance
* Sales forecast looks great, with a forecasted growth of 126% from 2020 to 2022
* First quarter group revenues of 52% year-over year
* First quarter group adj. EBITDA up 414% to 9.3M
* 6-year exclusive partnership with NFL
* Has exclusive events with almost every professional sports agency, as well as tournaments

# Part 3: Float and Lizard

Lizard theory has evolved since my [$NEGG](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofojpw/whats_going_on_with_negg_a_ticker_with_35m_float/) and SPuRT posts. Other redditors have come up with extensions of the general idea. I‚Äôm going to do a breakdown of similar data from past analysis, including FTD rates and float comparisons, institutional ownership and recalculation of all this data (differs from online).

As of now, the outstanding shares listed on Yahoo and sites such as [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/geni/statistics/) is 191.51M shares. \[However, the float varies, with Yahoo listing it as 63.36M and other sites listing it as 58.66M.\]

\*\*The current float can be calculated as follows:\*\*SPAC IPO:    27.6M shares

Unlocked PIPE:   33M shares

Follow-On Offering:   22M shares

**Total tradable float:**   **82.6M shares**

**Lock up:**

Management (34.9M shares / 18% ownership) lockup expires on 11/17 and the SPAC Sponsor lockup (6.825M shares / 3.5% ownership) lockup expires on 10/17.  Apax, the private equity owner of Genius (60.2M shares / 30.9% ownership) lockup will expire on 10/17.  The gory details are all laid out here

&#x200B;

They also list the institutional ownership as around 44-45% but doing some calculations shows this is higher.

**So is this an overcount or undercount? Lets see.**

**Begin Math:**

Given **191.51M shares outstanding** as the general consensus across various financial sources, we can look into the overall preferred shares and institutional buyouts across several 13F filings and aggregated data on Fintel and StockAnalysis:

**Top 3 Institutional Holdings:**

1. Caledonia Investments - 16,305,582 shares
2. Fred Alger Management - 15,046,102 shares
3. Dmy Sponsor LLC - 6,825,000 shares

These top 3 holders combined have 38176684 shares or about 19.93% of the shares outstanding.

There are 137 other funds that also own shares directly, for a total of 63694543 shares or about another 33.26% of the shares outstanding.

Therefore, institutional ownership alone is around (19.93% + 33.26%) or 53.19% of shares outstanding.

Next we can take a look at the insider transactions. This has a general consensus of 19.25%, indicating that a total of 72.44% of the outstanding shares are owned currently.

Now lets take a look at merger deals, ETFs and ownership through mutual funds.

We can see that the top holders for Q2 of 2021 in aggregate own 17,422,176 shares or about 9.10% of shares outstanding.  \[source fintel\]

**Our total ownership of outstanding shares becomes 81.54%.**

However, now we need to account for any institutions holding shares through these funds and for this reason some ETFs are excluded. Fred Alger Management has 15,046,102 shares of GENI yet through the ATFV Alger‚Äôs ETF, they end up owning approximately‚Ä¶ oh wait.. Lol‚Ä¶ approximately an equivalent of 75 shares of GENI. Okay so looking at these ETFs looks like they have negligible impact on the float.

**TLDR; The float for $GENI is about 35,352,746 shares or about 18.46% of outstanding shares.**  **With 4.14M** shares shorted this means that approximately **11.7% of the float is shorted.**

From the FTD angle we see that nice giant spike with the price staying stable/bleeding up. This type of pattern I‚Äôve found to give more pop, and it‚Äôs something I looked for.

Call OI has been trending up over the last month, you can see an increase in OI for higher strikes as GENI‚Äôs share price has increased 34.43% over the last month. The smart money has been betting on the price increase continuing.

The option chain: there are only monthly options, and the options chain itself is somewhat condensed to near the money strikes. This is all actually a good thing. It is forcing investors to streamline their investments into a more concentrated area, which has a greater overall impact on both hedging requirements and overall stock price. This is exactly how a MM or a shorty in duress would ***not*** want the options chain to look.

I don't think it's a coincidence that it's happening ex dividend date.

My guess, virtual zoom appraisals with the borrower and appraiser that allow for turn times in less than a week. Currently in my market, appraisals take 3 weeks+. In other markets, 10+ weeks.

12% of Fannies loans come from UWM. If there is a pilot program for a new appraisal process, UWM will get it first.

**$BB Patent Sale update**

https://preview.redd.it/qncbfdax16m71.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=70ab21d0f188b6fadddb3f8349aee5e322c81813

Nine months after IAM first broke the story of a potential sale of BlackBerry‚Äôs patent portfolio, the deal to get it done may now be entering the endgame

It‚Äôs almost exactly five months since BlackBerry confirmed in a press release about its Q4 and full year 2021 financials that the company was looking to sell a large section of its patent portfolio:

During the quarter BlackBerry entered into an exclusive negotiation with a North American entity for the potential sale of part of the patent portfolio relating primarily to mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking. The Company has limited its patent monetization activities due to the ongoing negotiations. If the Company had not been in negotiations during the quarter, we believe that Licensing revenue would have been higher.

This came four months after IAM had broken the news that such a sale was being considered by the Canadian telecoms business.

Since that March announcement, though, and the contents of a 10K release, there has been very little public or, indeed, private comment on the state of play in how the transaction negotiations are panning out.

So, while it was known that the possible deal was with a North American entity and involved that part of BlackBerry‚Äôs 38,000-strong portfolio of patents ‚Äúrelating primarily to non-core or legacy mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking technologies‚Äù, there was no mention of a price, the stage the negotiations had reached or the identity of the possible buyer.

Inevitably, rumour finds its way into such a knowledge vacuum. Over recent months, IAM has heard all manner of things, including, most often of all, that the deal is going nowhere because the parties are so far apart on pricing; or, alternatively, that a deal is imminent and involves a single, big, Silicon Valley tech player, possibly Facebook.

Our understanding, though, is that neither of these ‚Äì or the many other stories doing the rounds ‚Äì are correct. Instead, although parties close to the negotiations are staying tight-lipped, we believe that things are reaching a conclusion, to the extent that an agreement could be announced around the time BlackBerry releases its FY 2022 Q2 financials towards the end of September.

The pricing has been more or less agreed, and the numbers are material. Meanwhile, the buyer is actually a group of entities that have been negotiating without an intermediary. That has created a level of complexity around the deal structure which explains why it is taking so long to finalise.

However, while there may be an announcement in the last week of next month (September 2021), closure will take longer as the deal is going to require clearance from regulatory authorities in at least two countries: Canada and the US. If everything goes well, though, the sale will be signed, sealed and delivered by the end of this year.

Note ‚Äì the above is not definitive, it could be wrong in places. However, what IAM is confident in saying is that the deal is progressing, pricing is not an issue, the potential buyer is not a single company and the aim is to go public with an agreement on or around the day that BlackBerry announces its next set of financials towards the end of September.

Famous last words!

Well, I guess, none of you. However, 3.7 billion people do not have any access to the Internet; poor dudes no porn, and no YouTube. Well, guess what, one company will make money anyway when these guys get access to the internet, and **I am not talking about PornHub, it is Nvidia!**

Nvidia is developing very quickly its chips for data centers and eats Intel's market share every day. Here is why, if you are not a retarded living in a cave, you should buy Nvidia (NVDA). 

# Crazy quarterly results: 

Last quarter's results were monstrous, **bears go back in your cave!**

* Revenues: $6.51 billion versus $6.33 billion expected (dumb-ass analysts were not even close). 
* Revenue growth:  68% annually after a growth of 84% last quarter (get the rocket ready). 
* Adjusted earnings: $1.04, versus $1.01 expected (analysts cannot grasp how much money it makes).

**Dude, have you ever seen a company with such growth?** In comparison, Facebook with its 39% % growth year-over-year looks like a boomer company.  

&#x200B;

**Here is why Nvidia is a cash cow for the coming years:**

# Why you will make money in 1 year:

¬∑ Graphic cards (current biggest segment): **growth of 87%** to $3.91 billion. This is crazy growth, and the current valuation seems not to fully consider such growth, especially considering that it is the biggest segment of Nvidia. Nvidia has a PE of 79, it may look big, but Amazon (AMZN) has a PE of 59 and growth is tiny in comparison. Square (SQ) has a PE of more than 200.

# Why you will make money in 3 years: 

¬∑ Compute and network segment (chips for data centers): growth of 46% to $2.6 billion. This is crazy growth for a normal company, but it is not sufficient for Nvidia. However, the future looks sexy.

¬∑ Data are the future and companies are building data centers all the time. If Amazon invests so heavily in AWS, it is because the cloud is the future! Well, the more Amazon spends on the cloud, the more money Nvidia makes. **Demand for Nvidia chips is exploding**, especially when considering that they are way better than the one from Intel (boomers go home). The cake and the slice of the cake are growing for Nvidia and I will eat the cake as I am a shareholder!

# Why you will make money in 5 years:

¬∑ Professional use: Industry will progressively get more automated and therefore needs more chips. Annually graphics cards for high-end professional workstations **went up 156% annually** to $519 million. This growth is tremendous and proves that demand is enormous. 

¬∑ Secondly, its automotive business unit. Sales were up 37% from last year's respective quarter. This is poor growth (LOL) for Nvidia but the future looks awesome. If you think two seconds, you will realize that the future is not about EVs, the true revolution will be autonomous cars! And who will be the true winner? Tesla? No! Nio? No! Nvidia? Yeah boy, you got it! Considering the potential of this sector and how crazy people get ‚Äújust‚Äù with EVs, **Nvidia will not go to the moon but through the whole universe**, once people understand the potential of this division! 

# TLDR:

Bears have been repeating that Nvidia has been too expensive for a while. They have been repeating that it is not rational for the stock to double in 12 months and blablabla. Well, if they were not retarded, they would see that they are still **tons of catalysts** and the more time passes, the more we will use Nvidia products. So bears are gay and bulls are strong! 

Position: because I do not live in a cave, I bought 50 shares, worth approximately 11,350 USD."

**Near-term catalyst for social feature / user growth**

The more specific reason I see for the short-mid term upside is even greater exponential user base increase, stemming from plans to allow friends to player together; think ""Facebook + Gambling"". They're working out kinks with potential cheating but it seems this feature is just around the corner for the Big Buck Hunter app. This is big for a few reasons:

* Greater organic + referral profits
* Greater organic exposure 
* Greater retention rates (we typically play games longer/more often if our friends are playing them)

Also, one of their top grossing apps, Bowlero, has seen a natural organic search surge over the past \~6 months, indicating growing interest.

The biz model is largely based on paying entry fees for games, so the more ""skilled"" you get at these games the more likely you are to spend more $$. Some of the biz model understanding is split between two types of users:

* **Power Users** \- these users are playing daily and spending top percentile entry fees per game, and SKLZ takes a nice cut (as seen above)
* **Noobs** \- users who start with smaller entry fees and start grinding their way up, evolving into Power Users

The addition of playing w/ friends will help evolve noobs into power users. There are also growing incentives/milestones (gamification of gambling games) that help w/ retention rate.

So here's a better more honest analysis of SBC and a look into the companies current prospects.



Firstly regarding Palantir. Their leadership is incredible. 90% commercial growth YoY. 50% overall YoY growth and a guidance of 30% growth through 2025 that is totally sandbagged and going to get beaten easily next earnings. 

They have 0$ in debt.  Zero fucking dollars in debt. 

Roughly 2.5 billion in cash including 50 million in gold because they're so diversified 

Hundreds of millions in start up investments

3.5 billion in remaining money coming in from contracts (meaning they could stop doing business and still pull in 3.5 billion first) 

Stock based compensation has gone down significantly in last two quarters. 

Stock based compensation is completely comparable to other companies in similar fields or in tech. 

It's not just for their executives it's a fantastic way to incentivize all employees existing and future to stay with the company for the long run by granting shares. 

Stock based compensation doesn't equal them selling shares. It means granting shares. You're equating it with mostly Alex Karp and a few other leaders doing PRE SCHEDULED tax sales of shares because he's as part of going public (he has almost 10% ownership) the government is taxing him as if going public means he owes taxes on billions of dollars that he ONLY has in shares. In order to cover this he and others sell shares on a pre determined schedule so they don't go to jail with the IRS.


It has nothing to do with their commitment to the company or their leadership or their faith in the future. If you had any idea what you were talking about you'd realize none of them have really changed their overall stake in the company which is basically what your post alleges is that they're just printing money and getting out dishonestly which couldn't be further from the truth

There is a really good seeking alpha article on this that goes into comparing them to other companies, I tried to link to it but apparently it's a reddit rule that you aren't allowed to so if you want an HONEST analysis not hype bear fud. Google it you'll find it instantly it's titled 

Palantir: The Truth About Its Stock-Based Comp
Written by : Business Quant


Nothing is uniquely negative about PLTRs stock based compensation and it's a very good long term tool for growing a company that has only been public for about a year so what can you really expect at such a stage. It's total dilution amounted to about 10% . Retail traders own 75% of this stock and have sold off well over 10% many times over the FUD from this shitty narrative.

Here's some general insight into the company 


The company is NOT a 20 year company that has never been profitable. What they were doing 20 years ago for the government is barely comparable to the company today. Foundry (their flagship product for both commercial and even government partners) has basically only existed for about 2 years and has even undergone significant improvements even in the last years that will guarantee great margins and efficient delivery. They continually built the company under a growth model taking in revenue, hiring the BEST engineers ask anyone who studied coding and software in any large schools around the country between 2005-now these guys have always had a legendary reputation with engineers students would wear palantir t shirts and shit constantly because they were the place that was actually doing cutting edge software work. They always reinvested over and over growing the government side while working on perfecting their current new products for over a decade making Foundry and the apollo AI framework that now allows them to actually deploy Foundry cheaply. 



Lets even take a look at recent earnings. Quarter prior international growth was 17% So at most recent quarter 28% international growth they posted a pretty excellent QoQ increase. It suggests growth is picking up everywhere. Also I think the fact that they've done immense hiring in the short term plays into both why SBC is being kept high and why some margins were less than Q1. Most of the hiring they've done started in Q2 and only really picked up steam into the middle of the year. Let's also realize that the hiring has been almost entirely focused on distribution employees so they're very clearly moving into much greater expectations and focus of sales than they ever have in the history of their company. Peter Thiel actually has incredibly long explanations of how he thinks the optimal way to build a software companywide is to give as little focus on distribution as possible for as long as possible. This year's hiring is a dramatic indication that they're moving to a new stage as a company. 

Also the fact that their product keeps improving even quarter to quarter. They're constantly saying that they themselves are continually finding new ways and more importantly new industries that Foundry and Appllo can enter and be extremely useful. The perfect example of this was the exciting and very recent development of their meta constellation satellite work that they're now doing. 

I think the reason the stock jumped 10% on earnings and now a lot more since was a direct reaction to the evidence that there is no industry they aren't relevant in for software and they're definitely only at the beginning of entering many industries. 

Recent announcements like Foundry for builders or startups more accurately is another reason for the stocks rise because it was argued for a very long time that they would never be viable at offering their product to anything other than extremely large companies. Most importantly was that at the end of Q1 they announced that they were going to be offering Foundry for free as a way to get it into the hands of more companies it seemed very clear as investors to expect this as a short term damper on margins. The idea is that it would get their product into so many more hands that it would be worth it in the long term with a very obvious temporary effect on margins. The fact that client growth both US AND internationally is accelerating not decelerating points to the idea that their distribution network is at its beginning but it is working and I assert extremely high odds that client growth continues to accelerate for consecutive quarters for a long time. 

They will easily do more than 400 million revenue at next quarters report easily beat guidance and the one benefit to where SBC has been is that it is very likely it decreases potentially even dramatically decreases. Their trajectory is very predictable currently and they are a company that eventually will be a necessity to use if businesses don't want to get out competed. One of their main benefits to their customer companies is increasing margins of customers by finding many inefficiencies so they're one of the few products that can increase your bottom line without making you do anything as a company. This means that even during economic downturn they will be strongly potentially even more in demand because companies will need ways to look better and show cash flow even when consumption declines for periods of time.



If you want to understand the history of the company or what they do they're basically a SaaS company (yes SaaS their margins are good enough and they're only going to improve as they focus more and more outside of government Gotham products) 

Their software allows you to run your company through their platform and it keeps your data completely private. Meaning palantir doesn't see your data and mine information and neither does anyone else. You get better illustrations and representations of your companies affairs and it makes significant insights and determines ways to create better efficiency, heads up preemptive solutions before problems occur, and in many cases can bring so many data sets into play that you can learn things you didnt even know were possible. 

If you want resources for this there are a number of testimonials from customers describing what Foundry does for them on Palantirs youtube

You can go search Tom Nashs video on SkyWise (which is Foundry for airbus). He has a couple of them really incredible deep dive

You can watch their most recent video about meta satellite constellations

They have partners within every industry. Research, academics, science, cancer, genomics, aerospace, literally every military branch, health care both insurance providers and health care providers like the NHS, also NIH, big oil companies like BP, big manufacturers like 3m, faurecia, Rio Tinto mining, John deere, big retailers like bass pro and others even larger, news media companies, robotics, AI, autonomous driving like wejo partnered with gm on that, electronic vehicle startups and even electronic flying vehicle start ups, now satellite companies and US Government satellite ownership even. Do you see where this is going? There's nothing they can't break into and they are what is going to be necessary to have a competitive edge which is why everyone is going to have to use them. 


Which brings me to another point. Palantir doesn't have direct competition. They've explained this many times and anyone who says they are a snowflake competitor doesn't understand them as a company at all. Their competition is potential clients who choose to attempt to make an in house software to glean insights into their own data and structure it uniquely for their own needs. This is Palantirs biggest ""competition"" and they will crush it. That kind of work often takes years and is extremely expensive. Just the time that Palantir can save companies and the headaches of making all the mistakes that come with originally building a software like that makes Palantir worth it. 

They have incredible partnerships with Amazon and IBM for new and important distribution channels for getting their products out and quickly and have stated many times that they can deploy their software completely remotely cutting out the old concern that they will never scale because they need forward deployed engineers to set up software. They still use those but I think it's heavily around massive clients and particularly US gov gotham products not Foundry as we now know it. 

Sick of this ridiculous SBC destroying value garbage narrative. We'll see how much value is destroyed in a year when their stock explodes and you'll be wishing you didn't listen to the geniuses who thought they caught Palantir swindling everyone. Also all the people who didn't get swindled by the bear narratives this year are fucking happy as hell because most of them have at least doubled their positions over the last 6 months as the stock constantly traded in a holding pattern. 

Last point is its holding key resistance right now could easily break out in the short term towards 30$ or beyond. Don't say I didn't warn you. If it holds this 26$ mark and doesn't break down below it this month you'll never see PLTR under 24 dollars again and after next earnings I guarantee you'll never see it under 30$ again."

But at the same time, we have investors like Warren Buffet who still swear by a low-cost index fund and recommends it over his own Berkshire Hathaway stock! So, in this week‚Äôs issue, we analyze both sides of the argument and see if we \[1\] should be worried about the index fund bubble!

**The Problem**

The argument against the index fund is a logical one. The basic premise is that index funds affect the price discovery of stocks in the market. If a stock is bid up just based on the presence in an index and not by analyzing the underlying asset, then it can lead to a bubble-like scenario where you are buying more and more just because the asset prices are going up.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/a04wyrgmpvl71.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=1693f22d16deb337345e5accb8f360de959707a7)

If you look at the above chart, you could see that in the first 4 months of 2021, a fund inflow of more than $20 Billion occurred just to the Vanguard 500 index fund. There are arguments stating that in the US, index funds make up [more than 50% of the fund market.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/) (This exponential growth is not a surprising one given my last analysis showed that passive funds have summarily beaten active funds over the last 2 decades)

If you think about this, more than half of the money that is flowing into the market is now just buying stocks that are on an index without doing any underlying stock analysis. The problem becomes that companies get more and more investment just because they are big and not because of their future growth prospects. So the question becomes

**Is the index fund affecting the integrity of the stock market?**

The problem with the fund inflow statistics is that stock price is not decided solely based on fund inflow but majorly by trading.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/cjlyt4unpvl71.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=67be6be3b3604712dd017a823da8aee69116019e)

If you look at this [study done by Vanguard](https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/ISGBEL.pdf) \[2,3\], it destroys the price discovery argument. It shows that only 5% of the overall trading volume is captured by index funds. The rest of 95% of trading is made by active traders, pension funds, and institutional investors who do individual stock analyses.

Adding to this, even if the index funds become large enough to create significant price distortions, it‚Äôs something that the active fund managers can benefit from as it would give them more opportunities to short overvalued companies and create outsized returns. The fact that it‚Äôs not happening right now shows that we are not anywhere near a situation where the index fund is big enough to fundamentally alter the market\[4\].

Now that we know that index funds are not causing any price distortions, one has to wonder

**why there is a sudden rise in concerns regarding an index fund bubble over the past 2-3 years?**

I believe that this issue is being brought up by institutions and active fund managers as there is a drastic shift from active to passive management over the last few years.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/pq1b3fbppvl71.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=699fc8dd9d5f2dee76f47e6f02763c8b352084b6)

The above chart from Morningstar showcases that active funds on average lost more than $150B every year over the 2014-18 period and this trend is only becoming worse for the active funds. This trend is also replicated worldwide with more than $300B is pulled out of active funds and $500B is pushed into index funds every year (as of 2016).

Finally, as of 2019, for the first time, more money is being pushed into passive than active funds! All of this must be ringing alarm bells across active funds as their income is directly dependent on the total asset under management.

**Alternatives to index funds**

While researching this topic, I came across some genuine concerns about index funds. The most important of them being that you might not be as diversified as you expect investing in an index fund.

As of Aug 2021, the top 5 tech stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN & FB) account for more than 23% of the S&P500! While this worked out great for the overall index over that last decade given the tech rally, any long-term downturn for tech stocks will significantly affect your portfolio.

There are two alternatives that I found to the regular market cap based index fund allocation

[Equal-weighted index funds](https://www.lynalden.com/equal-weighted-index-funds/): Equal-weighted index fund allocates your capital equally across the stocks in the given index. For Eg. in S&P500 index, all the 500 companies would get an equal proportion of your index. This will avoid your portfolio becoming concentrated on a few highly overvalued stocks!

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ikn5px2rpvl71.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff145127fe86a728e0ebd0663d8566341163aa3a)

[Reverse weighted index funds:](https://www.etftrends.com/smart-beta-channel/an-etf-that-beats-sp-500-by-turning-it-upside-down/) This one is for the more adventurous, where the investments are made by turning S&P500 upside down on its head! The smallest companies on the list get the largest share of investment! Even though this reduces your exposure to large tech stocks and blue-chip companies (which get a lot of attention and is possibly overvalued), your investments will be concentrated on smaller companies that are inherently volatile and can produce outsized returns! Even though this strategy has beaten the traditional index returns, you still have to consider that this type of fund was introduced [just two years ago](https://www.barrons.com/articles/sp-500-index-fund-reverse-weighting-51557430544).

**Conclusion**

I believe that the index fund bubble narrative is over-blown and is being predominantly driven active fund managers who are trying to stop losing their business to the passive funds every year. All the data from our research shows that we are nowhere near a situation where index funds can alter the price discovery in any significant way!

While the index fund bubble might be getting undeserved attention, it's always a good thing to check if you are comfortable with the current skewness of your portfolio towards tech stocks. After all, the tech rally over the last decade has undoubtedly benefitted all our portfolios, but we should also be ready for when the party inevitably comes to a close!

Until next week :)

**Footnotes**

\[1\] This is the first time in an analysis where I cannot claim to be unbiased as a substantial portion of my portfolio (>90%) is tied up in an index fund. So take all the arguments with a grain of salt!

\[2\] *Setting the record straight: Truths about indexing* is an excellent study done by Vanguard in 2018 where they review the rationale for indexing‚Äôs efficacy, quantify the benefits of indexing to investors, clarify the definition of indexing, and explore the validity of claims that indexing has an adverse impact on the capital markets.

\[3\] This study also showcases that ETF trading (creation/redemption mechanism of exchange-traded funds (ETFs)) has minimal impact on the underlying securities as only 6% of the trading is involved in primary market trading with the rest being in the secondary market.

\[4\] This is also known as the Grossman-Stigliztz paradox:- There would be a point where indexing would become big enough to affect price discovery, then active managers would be able to profit off that, and more and more people would move to the active funds. Finally, in an efficient market, an equilibrium point would be reached where neither party (index funds or active fund managers) would be able to beat each other."

We all know how the typical DD goes:

> Stock XYZ has been trading sideways but in D days their P patent will be approved and... 

> They have great fundamentals and have John Doe as their CEO. With experienced leadership, they could...

> XYZ has had solid customer acquisition growth in the past year, and it's only now beginning to show up in these results. This will alert investors that XYZ is...


This kind of talk is usually the majority of every DD post. However, this purely traditional way of doing due diligence is simply not enough for a truly transcendental DD. 

There are millions of Wallstreet traders every day looking at companies. Someone is always going to have more financial experience in this space than you. To actually make a successful play need to have *individual insight*. Something that *you know* that the rest of Wallstreet does not. This is what actually makes great DD's more than anything else.

&nbsp;


**What is II (individual insight)**? It's an intuitive understanding of the world that *you have*, but that most other people do not. 

You have this knowledge about *how something really is* that the majority does not already know. This is the foundation of a profitable strategy.

&nbsp;

Examples (from worst to best):

1. 
         
  > **II:** My uncle has a Tesla and I got to ride in it. It was super fast, EV's really are the real deal. TSLA & GOEV üöÄüöÄüöÄ

  Even something as simple and ü¶çüß†'d as this counts. This person had an experience that many investors still would not have had, and thus has some personal intuition about the EV space that is uncommon. The reason this is the *worst* example here, is because most people already know how great EVs are, but it still counts.

2. 
         
  > **II:** I'm a Type 1 Diabetic and have recently tried a new glucose monitoring product from SENS. This was a huge improvement to my life, SENS all the way!

  This II is even better and it's obvious why. Far fewer people are Type 1 Diabetics, and it's not even an experience that can be attained by the layman. As strange as it sounds to say, this person was *born* with this individual insight.

3. 
         
  > **II:** I worked for a pool cleaning company for 30 years. Therefore, I know how important Chlorine is for maintaining a healthy pool. Because of the recent shortage of Chlorine, and the need to clean pools, Chlorine alternatives such as saltwater will have increased buying pressure. $HAYW pool equipment company controls the production of these alternatives.

  *Niche jobs* like working for a pool company is going to give this person insight that few other people have. **Most good II is going to come from personal specializations** like this. What do you know of the world that most people do not?

&nbsp;

As important as II is, it's important to not *overemphasize* one singular company unless it makes sense to do so. If you're bullish on a company due to some II, it still needs to be the *cherry on top* of an otherwise already healthy company. 

**TL:DR** - Please include II (individual insight) as part of your DD. If you don't have any, it may be time to reconsider just how lucrative your DD post really is."

We are looking at the 1 day chart below and 2 indicators. The yellow indicator is RSI with a divergence line rather than overbought and oversold lines. The blue indicator is on balance volume.

Drawing a horizontal line on both indicators on where they closed today you can see the last time that daily RSI or obv has been this high was the last run up to $22 with the reverse merger dividend speculation.

OBV has only been this high since the very tippy top of the peak. (this indicates that while price has been driven down the volume of the red days is being outweighed by the volume of the green days. This means that people have diamond hands. The idea of OBV is that price movements with low volume are much less significant than the same price movement on high volume.

RSI: Last time RSI closed at this level on the uptrend (61.85) was on may 28th. May 28th had a closing price almost identical of our closing price today. This day also marked the beginning of the runup to $22.

we have a closing price and RSI to match the beginning of the runup however our OBV is already as high as it was at the peak.... this indicates to me that we have a very likely probability that this run up will be more violent and has more power behind it than the previous run up.

This is the sort of technical analysis that many professional traders would use to enter what they would call a high conviction trade setup. Most would enter here with a price target of $22 and a stop loss of $3.70 and never look again until the either the price target or stop loss was reached.

lastly the candlestick pattern is bullish as hell. we have a bullish engulfing on friday, monday met with high resistance and insane volume, my guess is market makers delta hedged their $5 calls they have sold and proceded to short the price immediately after. Today leaves us a bullish hammer.

I think we will see a few high volume days met with quite a bit of short fire power but it should be obvious as to the direction of the price. No one can be sure but because of the monday volume i would guess the $5,$6 calls have been delta hedged at this point therefore we likely wont breakout completely until we push over $8 with volume. $8 strike calls has a ton of open interest and i highly doubt those calls have been hedged.

Im betting now, we see a price real close to $8 by end of the week and next week we breakout."

Only other companies that can be compared with Blackberry Ai cybersecurity is Crowdstrike and SentenialOne, both use Ai for cybersecurity BUT they both have older Ai engine that comes nowhere close to BB Ai engine. 

CRWD market cap : $60 Billion ($800 mm annual rev)  
SentenialOne market cap: $17 Billion ( $100 mm annual rev)

BB Blackberry market cap: $6 Billion ($1billion annual rev)

&#x200B;

BB is not just leader in cybersecurity protecting 500 million endpoints including 200 million connected cars on the road but they are also providing the foundation for iot platform, QNX secure operating system. The QNX runs the entire medical device industry, drones, and controls over 78% of Ev connected car market. QNX is kinda monopoly with a HUGE moat because it has BB Ai engine embedded to prevent hacks and ransomeware and viruses. 

&#x200B;

I'm happy that WSB crowd and Apes are holding and brining much needed attention to this stock. This stock was being kicked around by analyst on purpose in hope that the company would go under 5 years ago so they can come buy patents and parts for cheap. 

&#x200B;

BB holds over 42,000 patents and over 70% of cybersecurity ai patents!!!! They are selling of their old business patents like messaging, phones, networking wireless to likely Facebook. Once it's announced the stock should do 3-4x. 

Not a financial advice but please look into BB. It's not a phone company but a leader in cybersecurity!!! they run iot and cybersecurity world for banks, defense, drones, cars, etc!!"

SKLZ is a mobile tournament platform. Basically, they take competitive mobile games, and create some sort of tournament experience for those games with a prize pool. They provide this service through an API (application program interface). Basically, their product goes like this:

1. They create the software for hosting tournaments with prize pools
2. They offer the software to mobile game companies as an easy-to-implement solution
3. Mobile game companies implement tournaments using their software
4. They take a cut of the total prize pool every time a tournament is hosted with their software

It is extremely important to note that SKLZ‚Äôs product is only this tournament software package. They do not develop any mobile games themselves and are entirely reliant on 3rd parties to choose to use their software.

# The mobile gaming market

Mobile gaming accounts for over 50% of all video gaming revenue worldwide. In the US, one of the largest gaming markets in the world, mobile gaming revenue reached \~$11B in 2020. It‚Äôs expected that the global share of mobile gaming will continue to rise even in relation to the rest of global gaming growth.

https://preview.redd.it/gif44y4jbbk71.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=f026cdb33eb7c4b70852ac0460c53b25315bd4aa

&#x200B;

In the US specifically, there has been an increased in global mobile gaming revenue share. Over the years, it has overtaken Japan as the largest mobile gaming market globally.

https://preview.redd.it/rxlrp0jjbbk71.png?width=818&format=png&auto=webp&s=84a1c4fd8a085b76c82bb28e1a8a4c959485de16

&#x200B;

**Demographics**

The demographics of mobile gaming has been rapidly changing over the years and, especially in the US, is no longer what one would traditionally expect. For example, children and young adults aged 16-24 no longer make up the majority of mobile gamers. In fact, over a third of all mobile gamers are aged 45+. Furthermore, while 66% of men play mobile games, 70% of women play mobile games. Market research into gaming and spend indicate that older adults spend both more money and time in video games.

https://preview.redd.it/5y0ruixjbbk71.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=32f9cc844b6016c7d6c9d74f9186e94ade846203

&#x200B;

Thus, the most valuable demographic for mobile gaming is actually the female aged 45+ market.

&#x200B;

**Popular game trends**

The most popular category of games is the ‚Äúhyper-casual‚Äù games where users download ten times more games in that category than average. The most profitable mobile games in North America are actually puzzle games capturing 22% of the total North American mobile gaming revenue. AR (augmented reality) /Location-based games represent the smallest market in terms of North American revenue at (2.83%).

https://preview.redd.it/n1h6pl8lcbk71.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=6201cc14dacf5e0ad3b0b0f17020b04bd5659f55

&#x200B;

# Where SKLZ stands

**The bull case**

SKLZ is appropriately positioned to capture the correct demographic of gamers for the highest revenue. According to their 10-K, over 50% of their users are 45+ with \~10% of their users being aged 18-25. Furthermore, the majority of their users are women.

Beyond that, gamers who use the SKLZ platform are spending more time on the game or other SKLZ games than on TikTok, Facebook, or YouTube. They spend over 3x the amount of time they would spend on a SKLZ game than an average mobile game!

They are still on track for their India expansion which represents a massive injection of revenue possible. Furthermore, SKLZ is attempting to expand out of card games and into racing, shooting, and battle-royale type games as well.

Lastly, SKLZ‚Äôs current per-user revenue has increased by over 60%. They are successfully monetizing their current user-base and increasing the amount of revenues they gain from that user-base.

https://preview.redd.it/b01rfu6qcbk71.png?width=1160&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6d7dab72b2c11cd6c48f08593d3b7dfd802e5d8

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The bear case**

Most recently in Q2 2021, nearly three-quarters of SKLZ‚Äôs revenues comes from just 3 games: Solitaire Cube, 21 Blitz, and Blackout Bingo. In general, a handful of games has contributed to the majority of SKLZ‚Äôs revenues and this has remained consistent over the past 5 years! This represents a significant risk as it shows that SKLZ is not able to innovate away from its cash cows and as the mobile games grow out of popularity, SKLZ will not have any way to make up for lost revenues.

SKLZ is paying record amounts of money in terms of customer acquisition through marketing. However, their monthly active users is actually dropping from 2020 to 2021. In fact, SKLZ has currently spent more in marketing than the previous year‚Äôs total revenues! Yet, they are losing users. This is extremely worrisome about SKLZ‚Äôs ability to continue their rapid growth.

Lastly, SKLZ has currently only proven its market in a small segment of the mobile market. SKLZ, by definition of its platform, must operate in player vs. player games (one of the most unpopular categories of mobile gaming) which accounts for around 15% of the market. Furthermore, SKLZ has only proven itself in the arcade gaming market which accounts for 5% of North America‚Äôs revenue market. In general, SKLZ has only proven themselves in a sliver of the mobile gaming market.

&#x200B;

# The financials

**Income statement**

Revenue growth in SKLZ continues to be extremely impressive, doubling every year (and on track to double again this year).

https://preview.redd.it/65x5svm2dbk71.png?width=1162&format=png&auto=webp&s=015cf3d5f5132c43e52a5849526dbeb3cae3696a

&#x200B;

However, we are also seeing marketing costs increase at more than the rate of revenues which is an extremely worrisome rate. Marketing has increased spend by over 100% per year and are on track to far exceed that this year.

https://preview.redd.it/bnrj4r13dbk71.png?width=1180&format=png&auto=webp&s=07bfeccecfc9cd7d4b31181873ac2b9f231b0361

&#x200B;

This is especially worrisome as it means that SKLZ is spending more dollars in marketing than its receiving back because of the marketing. Also, because this is a multi-year trend, it doesn‚Äôt look like marketing is paying off even in the long term. As a result, SKLZ is losing money at an increasing rate every year.

https://preview.redd.it/slwsiph3dbk71.png?width=1176&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b89b0a1d1b2d9f23fc86062135d9430a2249795

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Balance sheet**

SKLZ sports a decently healthy balance sheet. It has over $700M in current assets with only $125M of current liabilities. This leaves SKLZ with $575M of additional cash or other liquid assets to operate with. While this is a lot of money, SKLZ is on track to burn over $300M in net losses in 2021 which will reduce this amount by over one half. Furthermore, the reason SKLZ has such a high current asset is because it has already sold additional stock in order to finance its operations. In 2021, SKLZ raised over $400M by offering new stock.

&#x200B;

**Cash flow**

SKLZ has awful cash flows due to it burning money through its operations. It‚Äôs only positive cash flow over the past few years has been through financing, which means that SKLZ survives only by offering additional shares and using that money in its operations.

https://preview.redd.it/8xffatxcdbk71.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=1af6775163b1ff7be555c82010fe63e5aa70b116

This should be a glaring red flag for any current investor in SKLZ.

&#x200B;

# The Outlook

SKLZ has an interesting position to capture a high value demographic within the mobile gaming market. However, they are doing so within the smallest categories that are popular within their demographic. They have the ability to expand into other categories, but as they are not a mobile game development company, they aren‚Äôt able to deliberately expand into other types of games. They must depend on 3rd party developers choosing to use their platform while developing more popular categories of games for them.

What is most worrisome for me is their cash losses and their inability to sustain their operations without additional financing activity. I would expect SKLZ to further dilute their stock (and drag down their stock price) in order to finance their operations next year as well.

Lastly, I am uncertain about SKLZ‚Äôs ability to capture other hit games beyond their current cash cows. Once more, SKLZ has little control of this as they do not build games themselves and are reliant on the market choosing them with popular games. In this way, there is a great risk that their current cash cows will get phased out due to age and the newer games will not utilize SKLZ as a platform. If that happens, SKLZ will lose 75% of its revenues.

&#x200B;

Few things I was curious if anyone has speculation or more clarifications: 

""Well, it's a major portion of our portfolio. As I said, we cover three major areas; cellular, wireless communications and networking. So things that is relevant but it's not useful to us today in our strategic software part of the business and we retained all the embedded and all the site ends and all the encryption and security technology patent."" - John Chen

* John Chen suggested there will be a large portions of the patents being sold, out of the 38,000 patents owned by BB. From an article suggested in 2013, the patents owned by BB are worth a good $2bil - $3bil, but there was some sold to Huawei which might either take a small nip out of this according to the reports. Potential inflation of these patents could be considered. One article from Seeking Alpha in 2019 suggested it's potential worth is $10bil if $BB play its cards right.

"" So this is an unusual year. So let's talk about, if the patent license goes through, if the sale goes through, we will have -- we will report a one-time gain of a reasonably big number, followed by a tail of up to seven years. So it will not go away to zero, there are some recurring -- that most of them will not be with us. But, so it will not be zero, but it will be quite small, if this happens -- sales go through with one big year in this fiscal year 2022. If the patent sale does not go through, then the first couple of quarters will be low, because if the pattern sale is being negotiated right now, I actually are unable to do more other negotiation going on. So the pipeline basically is frozen, but it won't go away. So if the patent sale does not go through, I may have to suffer a little bit for the first couple of two, three quarters and then we will then assume the target 250 a year patent licensing."" - John Chen 

* Patent licensing makes up 100M in their revenue (but not fully for all of the patents it seems) which is fairly a large amount of money. But let's say they do sell it, $BB get one big payment for one quarter, and installments for up to 7 years (seems to be the current terms of negotiation). Also it seems like there could also be a possibility the sell does NOT go through at all or negotiations won't be down for a few quarters. But then they still can request license money from FB if the agreement fails. For the future, if they do sell this, assuming they will sustain some other products and services for the next 7 years. As this constant selling of their own product revenue isn't sustainable. 

""The company limits its licensing activities in the quarter due to the negotiations and because of accounting rules which Steve will explain later."" - John Chen

""Further to John's comments regarding negotiations relating to a potential sale, licensing activities have been limited not only due to the ongoing negotiations, but also because revenue from additional transactions that could have been completed in the quarter would have been treated as contingent revenue and deferred to future periods. Therefore, had negotiations not been in progress, we believe licensing revenue would have been higher."" - Steve Rai

* Earlier in the presentation, John Chen mentioned that the purchasing ""company"" has some licensing/accounting rules. If this was FB - are we expecting sometime at the end of FB's quarter or next quarter? I noticed FB already close out it's quarter since this statement, so technically it's been almost 2 quarters now since this reported. If they keep pushing this out, I am assuming their revenue report will keep taking a hit because the sale is not considered. Until then, my speculation is the patent sale will be announced at Q2 2022 for $BB, or some time early September, but no actual numbers until the reports earnings.


I also read Q1 2022 transcript, but it was disappointing and lacked info. Seem to focus more on QNX and IVY.

Cushy notes from Q1 2022 transcript:

""The negotiation for the sale of a large portion of the patent portfolio are ongoing and good progress has been made. In fact, we have started negotiating the definitive agreement"" - John Chen

The stock I‚Äôm talking about is COIN (Coinbase)

COIN is so undervalued it‚Äôs insane. It has a 30 PE ratio while literally 11x revenue YoY when corn halved from it‚Äôs May peak. It‚Äôs priced like fucking AAPL or FB who are growing 30-50% YoY not fucking **tentupling**. Not to mention during the quarter where corn halved from its peak, they increased their profit by 4900% year over year, so the bear argument ‚Äúif corn drops they‚Äôll stop making money‚Äù has already been disproven.  

In terms of financials, COIN is literally the fastest growing stock I have ever seen. Let‚Äôs take a quick look 

‚Äî-

**Q2 Earnings:**

Revenue: $2.23 billion (up 1097% YoY)

EPS: $3.45/share 

Net Income: $1.61 billion (up 4880% YoY)

Net profit margins: 72%

Cash on hand: $4.4 billion

**Bear Arguments**

*Growth will slow down*

Obviously growth is going to slow down, but there has been no big tech companies that we see today (the FAANGs) that has grown nearly as fast it this is. They have so much money, they don‚Äôt know to do with it. Their profit margins are exceptional on that kind of revenue and even if growth halves, they‚Äôll still be making an absolute metric fuck ton of pure revenue and profit. 


*Their money is dependent on transaction fees*

For now, but they‚Äôre branching out. This is a brand new company we‚Äôre talking about. I literally know somebody personally who had their company acquired by Coinbase. They‚Äôre spreading their roots to more revenue streams so they‚Äôre not entirely dependent on transaction fees. Not to mention they already have Coinbase Pro, so people who want low fees can already get them. 


*What if Corn drops*

Corn halved last quarter and they still saw enormous revenue and profits. The *only* reason why I think this could be a problem is if you think corn will flat out stop existing. Corn could drop to 10,000 and as long as people still trade the currency, COIN will be making money


*Competition*

That‚Äôs the bear argument to every single superior product. It‚Äôs a non-issue. Tesla has competition. Apple has competition. The market is big enough for multiple exchanges. Coinbase ranks up there as one of the best; literally the only better alternative (having a physical wallet) is so inconvenient that nobody in that community does it. The only thing bears can say is ‚Äúfees‚Äù but it‚Äôs obvious they have absolutely no idea what they‚Äôre talking about and have never even used the app, because if they did, they‚Äôd know that Coinbase Pro exists and their fees are almost non-existent.

**Overview**

Medifast is a weight-loss company similar to Weight Watchers, but much more profitable and with better management. The company is an MLM that uses coaches (aka Facebook moms) to sell weight-loss plans. This means they market and ship directly to the customer at retail prices, so margins aren't compressed by third-party distributors/wholesalers. About 90% of coaches started as clients, which is a crazy statistic.  They have about 60,000 coaches and each brings in about $3,500 a quarter. Check out the Yahoo Finance conversations page to see how much people really love this company.

**Fundamentals** 

Medifast is currently trading at around 2x sales with a PE of around 17. They consistently offer conservative guidance (the main reason for the stock being down 30% from its 52 week high is that they warned the cost of their raw materials may increase due to inflation) but they significantly beat earnings more often than not. Just look at their performance over the last 10 years. My favorite part about this company is that their ROIC, ROA, and ROE have been growing consistently since 2011.  They also pay out a dividend of close to 3% and have grown net profit margins from 12.7% to 15.5% of revenue since the beginning of the year.  The potential upside is 77% according to Yahoo Finance.

**The Play** 

Medifast currently has just under 12M shares outstanding, which means that the stock can move insanely fast with even a small amount of volume. We saw an almost 50% gain in May and we're currently about 33% below the 52 week high.  I don't see the stock going more than 5% below where it currently is given they crushed earnings last quarter and they're repurchasing shares.  The only thing this stock needs to run is volume. A quick reversal here is inevitable even without WSB attention, so get in while you can. 

TL;DR: $MED is insanely undervalued as a debt-free company with a Revenue CAGR of 46% since 2017, not to mention consistent net profit margin growth. There are also only 12M shares outstanding and insiders hold about 5%, so this thing will move quickly with enough volume."

# The Technology (Too Technical and can be skipped):

**TLDR;  The tech has been proven to work on smaller scales but has yet to be done at the scale ASTS is aiming for. Additionally, it's 6G forward compatible!**

***OVERVIEW***:  AST & Science (‚ÄúASTS‚Äù) has designed a large aperture satellite system to provide ‚Äòdirect-to-device‚Äô service to normal phones using a low earth orbit satellite array to directly connect to mobile phones anywhere on Earth.

***Hardware***\*\*\*:\*\*\*   ASTS‚Äô satellites are \~10x bigger than the norm because they are essentially cell-phone towers in space. With a [900-square meter array](https://preview.redd.it/sk0cpuxbfnd71.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=f57703695f83ed465a1912b1ae546a4c04c4852c), the system is a large **‚Äúloud‚Äù**  system that can connect with a regular mobile phone. Traditional satellite phones are just ‚Äúlisten hard‚Äù whereas ASTS simply produces a loud signal to connect to regular mobile phones.

***SOFTWARE:***   ASTS‚Äô system does not require a special chipset on the phone because of its proprietary back-end software system that allows for interconnection to existing terrestrial(on Earth) spectrum and telecom networks. The ‚Äúmagic‚Äù of the technology is the back-end software that allows the system to utilize terrestrial spectrum, seamlessly interconnect over existing networks, and talk directly to an LTE system; ASTS is 6G forward compatible.

***BACKHAUL***:   Once the signal is collected from a handset, ASTS sends the data back  on B-Band satellite spectrum to a ground gateway system. The phone-satellite connection is native to the carrier‚Äôs terrestrial spectrum.

***CAPACITY***:  Each satellite can handle 1.2MM GB per month; extra capacity can be added by directing additional satellites at an area.

# Business Model(Can be skipped):

**TLDR; ASTS brings the satellites and execution while their partners bring the customers.**

***The Model:*** ASTS has chosen to partner with preexisting telecom giants to acquire a large customer base with essentially 0 acquisition costs per customer for ASTS. They have agreed to a 50/50 revenue split with its partners who are going to provide the customers. The 5g connection will be offered as an add-on to preexisting data plans provided by their partners or as a standalone purchase.

***How Does it generate Money? :***  With its current carrier partners, Vodafone and AT\&T; given its large, fixed cost base, the Company expects to generate 90% asset-level EBITDA margins that provide  significant operating leverage and cash flow.

In-place there are binding agreements with carriers to provide ASTS with access to  >1.3BN existing customers without having to independently market to or acquire customers (or directly bear the cost of churn). Phase 1 will  target key Equatorial regions and cover 1.6BN people. In subsequent phases, it's planning to expand into Europe and N. America by 2024.

The company is expected to generate >$1bn of EBITDA by 2024 based on 168 satellites launched, 27MM total subscribers, with an ARPU of $2.50 per user.

***ASSets:***  ASTS has 750+ patents as well as a first-mover advantage(no competitors yet). Moreover, Commercial progress reinforces the Company‚Äôs technical lead in the market having ATT, Vodafone, American Towers and Rakuten in it's pocket.

# Timeline(can be skipped):

**TLDR;** **They have broken up their plan into 5 different phases spanning multiple  years with the intent of slowly expanding their satellite constellation until full global coverage is achieved.**

* Phase 1 - Equatorial constellation, 20 satellites by 2022
   * Cash flow from phase 1 will support the following phases
* Phase 2 - NA/Europe/Asia, 45 satellites by 2022
* Phase 3 - Full global coverage, 45 satellites by 2023
   * At this point ASTS expects to start turning a profit
* Phase 4 - Full global MIMO coverage (increased data capacity), 58 satellites by 2023
* Phase 5 - Scaling network globally, 16 satellites by 2028

# Management(Can be skipped):

* CEO Abel Avellan
   * 25+ years of space industry experience
   * Track record of building a successful global satellite communications company
      * EMC Emerging Markets Communications
* CFO Tom Severson
   * Former CFO of EMC
* CTO Huiwen Yao
   * 30+ years of experience in satcom
* CCO Chris Ivory
   * 25+ years of experience in satcom

Employees:

* 236 full-time employees
* 13 part-time employees
* 161 scientists and engineers
   * 24 of whom are PhDs

**The deep executive ranks include executives from Orbital ATK, Globecomm,  NASA, and Maxar ‚Ä¢ The team has 161 scientists and engineers, 34 of whom  are PhDs.**

# Catalysts(can be skipped):

**The most important catalyst is the BlueWalker 3 satellite launch which will be taking place sometime in Q4  2021.**

This will be a bigger satellite than any previous ones created but it still is not the biggest they plan to make. However, a successful launch and connection to BW3 would definitively prove that the tech works at larger scales.

Other smaller but still significant catalysts include:

* Government approvals for servicing in each country
* The launch date for BW3
* Acquisition of a portion of the federal 5g fund

# Risks(Can be skipped):

Every play ranging from 0dte to year long investments come with some amount of risk and this is no exception.  While some may simply be setbacks they are still worth knowing.

* Delays
   * Satellite construction and launch delays.
* Execution
   * Building, launching and deploying the satellites.
* Regulators
   * Need governmental approval for satellite operations from each country they wish to provide before they can service them.
* Tech
   * Satellite to phone connection still unproven on a large scale.
* Funding
   * Not fully funded (Need to raise \~1.5 bn) however phase 1 is fully funded and is planned to help pay for the subsequent phases.

# Valuation(Most important part):

The current market cap of ASTS is only 1.71 Billion for a stock with an extremely high potential, endless possibilities, and no competitors.

SpaceX's Starlink(If we want to compare apples to oranges), will provide **FIXED-POINT(Doesn't connect to mobile)** broadband to customers at very high costs with unclear quality. Moreover Starlink cannot translate to mobile devices. It depends on Dish Satellites.

StarLink is valuated between 40-50Billion Dollars! **Which equals around 222$-277$ of ASTS!!**

Just like Facebook found out after it's IPO, the real market is and always will be in **MOBILE** and Starlink cannot translate to mobile devices.

***Deutsche Bank most recent coverage:*** Their price target was set on 35$ and they added this nice comment **‚ÄúIf management executes on plan over the next five years, the company's intrinsic value should ultimately be ""significantly higher""** than the $35  price target.""

***Barclays Most recent coverage:*** Their price target was set on 29$.

**And Most importantly my coverage:** Well, you cannot really valuate this rare breed, because it's like trying to valuate $TSLA in the early days when it was just 50$(post split). ASTS is in a very similar situation right now having no competitors with a massive lead in the industry(A proven product on a small scale with well established partnerships with Vodafone, ATT, American Towers and Rakuten).

Right now, it should atleast have a market cap of 10 Billion, which is 1/4 Starlink, and there's actually no competition.

Price target will be illustrated with crayons bellow:

**Facebook Patent Settlement/Partnership Catalyst**

Blackberry filed a lawsuit against Facebook for Patent Infringement (and won). Technology in WhatsApp Messenger apparently is Blackberry's tech and Facebook wasn't paying any licensing fees to Blackberry. Both parties settled out of court, Blackberry got a positive judgement against Facebook and a judge in Germany ordered a halt on WhatsApp use of BB technology which could have affected nearly 80 million users.

Only the patent settlement Facebook and Blackberry reached out of court recently turned into a patent sale. With a large upfront payment and 7 years of IP licensing tail.

John Chen CEO said in March that BB entered into patent sale negotiation with North America based tech company and can't disclose more.

I strongly believe that BB and FB are negotiating not just patent sale but also a partnership agreement. Blackberry will secure WhatsApp Messenger for Enterprise. (This might be huge as Salesforce bought Slack). Blackberry also gets free advertising on FB Instagram.

Patent payout upfront 600 million plus 1.4 billion over seven years in IP licensing.

Facebook wants to get in on the action and partner with Blackberry. After all it's Blackberry who invented the smart phone and the instant messenger. Judges, lawyers and political figures were using Secure Messenger BBM well before anyone else. They were first to market in smart phones and BBM

Mark Zuckerberg was living in the college dorm even Blackberry enterprise customers were already using BBM and it's only fair that Blackberry finally gets fair compensation for their innovative technology.

John Chen when asked about the patent sale he said stay tuned. He meant there is very good news coming soon. Don't sell your shares.

**IVY Connected Car (IoT Internet of Things) + Amazon Partnership**

As we all know AWS has entered a multi-year, global agreement with BlackBerry (BB) QNX to develop BB IVY.

Ivy benefits the whole value-chain

* IVY enables automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences by allowing for a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights. AKA feed OEMs MORE DATA that is actionable.
* The developers won‚Äôt need specialized or automotive software skills.

Modern cars and trucks are built with thousands of parts from many different suppliers, with each vehicle model comprising a unique set of proprietary hardware and software components. These components, which include an increasing variety of vehicle sensors, produce data in unique and specialized formats. The highly specific skills required to interact with this data. With BB IVY there is no need to worry about special automotive programming languages, hardware variations, or proprietary sensor data formats.

* The consumer (driver) gets more frequent feature updates allowing for better performance/experience along with safety of their data

Data is the new Gold/Oil

BB has had a vision to build a data analytics platform for years which they showcased at CES 2 years ago.

In a Bloomberg interview, John Chen says the following in regards to BB Ivy ‚ÄúBy the way this project, we‚Äôve been working with Amazon has taken us probably about 2 years - we started this whole program 2 years ago at CES. We demonstrated a little piece of technology at that time, obviously not as elaborative as today..‚Äù.

He goes on to say that this creates a recurring data business for BB. This point should not be overlooked! As a Mckinsey & Co report  ([https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/unlocking-the-full-life-cycle-value-from-connected-car-data#](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/unlocking-the-full-life-cycle-value-from-connected-car-data#)) connected cars (the new iPhone) will allow for the OEMs to monetize data from connected cars. We all know that 7/10 most valuable companies in the world generate billions in profits from data-based services.

Chen explains that Amazon is interested in BB for 2 reasons:

1. QNX provides Amazon with a secure, safety certified OS (aka the ‚Äúplumbing‚Äù or ecosystem Ivy will be built on)
2. BB secures all endpoints in the Internet of Things

**Pros:**  
\- $12b market cap, profitable, positive cash flow, stable financial position, doing share repurchases  
\- Lots of innovation. New apps like the ability to accept payments directly via their platform. New partnerships with Facebook and Google to allow their users to advertise and sell on those platforms more seamlessly. Expanding in India  
\- Currently sits at 52-week low (\~$70) b/c of the recent earnings miss (dropped \~15% from before the announcement). But this appears to be a short-term overreaction   
\- Traded consistently in-range (\~$65-85) over the last 3 years, this looks to be the bottom of another such cycle before jumping back up.  
\- Super cheap options / leaps with an implied volatility of just \~30%

**Cons:**  
\- No immediate catalyst. The play is reversion to the mean  
\- Pandemic was a good thing for the company as many people tried creating online businesses from home. In the current environment, it is unclear what the trend is, reopening vs the variant. They missed their earnings target for Q2, and they provided a softer than expected Q3 sales forecast ($945m vs $948.6m, duh), but in-line full-year.  But their strategy seems to target both online and offline businesses, as well as not only attracting new customers, but also making existing ones more profitable.

Just to share my alternate DD, not on projections but valuations. How is Paysafe so much undervalued compared to other spacs. Bill Foley took paysafe public at a valuation of 9B with 4B debt. This valuation was conservative as Paysafe did not have any growth in 2020 due to Covid.

2B of the money was used to pay the debt which means investors got a good deal at $10 with market cap at 7B. Which means either Bill Foley paid 2 billion more or blackstone received 2 billion less. Either way, investors got a 2B discount. Fast forward to now, the market cap is at 6 billion with revised upwards guidance for the year at 1.55b compared to 1.5b, with 23% growth excluding divested business. This is impressive as in just over a year, they grew from 0 growth to 23% growth and increasing their operating income margins from 10+% to over 30%, helping them to their first ever net positive income quarter.

However, as we know shorts attacked it just as any SPACS. What separates it from other SPACS was the valuation initially at 9B was already undervalued unlike many clean energy SPACS which has lofty valuation and unrealistic projections. Paysafe was projected base on 0 growth in 2020, and a mere 10% annual growth.

Furthermore, given many recent fintech acquisition such as square acquiring of afterpay is upwards of 20x revenue. FB and Paypal have both indicate they see the digital wallet segment as a game changer, whereby Paysafe is already a established player in the segment for 10 years and is still further growing due to igaming. Microvision being a rumored acquisition for microsoft sustain its p/s ratio at over 800. In comparision, Paysafe p/s ratio is now under 4. I can assure you NONE of the SPACS out there has a p/s ratio under 10, with POSITIVE NET INCOME. 

The last confirmation that their stock is undervalued is management decision to acquire pagoefectivo and paysafety in an all cash deal as compared to recent acquisitions made by draftkings and square using solely stocks.

So why such a steep drop. It was up 10% premarket initially due to earnings beat. Look what I found. AGAIN SHORTS ARE COMING. Short interest is at 5% at 17M already reported at JULY 30TH with around 50% short volume daily. IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY BY NOW. DAILY volume on average is 4m which means any squeeze would require shorts 4 days to cover. THEY HAVE TO BUY AT LEAST 4 DAYS WORTH OF THE ENTIRE FLOAT TO COVER, JUST LIKE ANY OTHER SHORT SQUEEZES. 17m more shares already floating around. Share price would rocket further if shorts are forced to cover. PLUS many in the wsb community have already entered prior and are diamond handling now.

I am sure everyone have seen different analysis all putting its target price from 15 upwards to 45. USING BELOW EXAMPLE, THEY HAVE GROWTH, VALUATIONS, FINANCIALS TO BACK THE SQUEEZE WHERE NO INSTI WILL EXIT. Those who would, would have already exited. This is the best short squeeze play around in my opinion as shorts blindly attack it cause its a SPAC. 

Looking at a larger basket of comps with a collective growth rate of \~12.5% (not far from Paysafe‚Äôs minimum 10.6% projection) here are valuations based on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign among others:

Paysafe‚Äôs share price with average of sector peer multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09

EV/Rev ratio : $83.91

EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

After eliminating outliers with highest multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75

EV/Rev ratio : $44.64

EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average :$46.52

Notes:

1. Unlike Paysafe, around half of these competitors report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.
2. Used low end of Paysafe's projections and factored in debt and high-end of potential dilution.
3. As noted Paysafe‚Äôs 10.6% rev growth projection excludes planned inorganic M&A growth and projected 55% CAGR iGaming growth, which constitutes a third of their revenue.
4. The above comps were taken during a sector-wide pull-back and do not reflect recent fintech gains since Jamie Dimon‚Äôs ""enormous competitive threats"" comment.

This is not any financial advice, but I am just a nerd that all in on Paysafe at 8.2. Only when we unite, we become stronger and earn from short sellers.

Btw, Grasso tweeted and hes still holding for his 45 pt too.

SelectQuote is the pioneer of the direct-to-consumer model for various types of policies in the insurance space. The company has three primary business segments: SelectQuote Senior, SelectQuote Life and SelectQuote Auto & Home.

Before we start, a few key facts:

* By 2030, all baby boomers will be 65 or older (source: the goddamn US Census)
   * 73 million boomers out in the wild‚Ä¶10K a day.
* Consumer buying will continue to shift away from the traditional face-to-face format as the population continues to have ever increasing access to technology (source: common sense).
   * HOW MANY FACEBOOK POSTS HAVE YOUR BOOMER PARENTS OR GRANDPARENTS POSTED IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS? That‚Äôs proof.

[Cool colors with dates. Basically, more boomers.](https://preview.redd.it/rhlwxupkmmh71.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=c375402cfe6f22a29de4940750f6b82908b5fbc4)

Why now:

The first thing you probably did was Google who the hell SelectQuote is as you slowly rolled your eyes‚Ä¶ all while mouthing the words ‚Äúboomer‚Äù and ‚Äúvalue investing‚Äù to yourself. Not so fast‚Ä¶ Well, the stock is DOWN and DOWN BAD the past week. One of SelectQuotes biggest competitor‚Äôs (GoHealth: GOCO) had a less than stellar earnings report, which (in my opinion) falsely tanked the entire market segment, which has presented a great buying opportunity. I actually bought some of them too, but that's not important. That said, when a company loses 50-60% overnight, it kinda makes me want to buy it.

Anyway...

Financial points about SLQT and their previous earnings (source: few various websites that a quick google search of the below will show!)

* Q3 results: +80% revenue growth (SOLID)
   * Senior aspects up 101% YoY (SOLID)
   * $266.9M against expected $262.5M (SOLID)
   * EBITDA up 63% YoY (SOLID)

The ONLY aspect of SLQT‚Äôs business that I see as being ‚ÄúBAD‚Äù is their auto insurance segment, which dropped 33%. Good, because Boomers shouldn‚Äôt drive anyway. Safety first.

Well, what happened? Completely unrelated to last week‚Äôs decrease, when the previous totals were announced for the company‚Äôs Q3 growth, the company tanked before as well. This company spends money to make money. They also rely almost entirely on the boomers. All other areas of the business are nice, but it‚Äôs just noise. Medicare makes the world go round.

To me, the company was a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù even back it initially dipped. Now, my interest is absolutely peaked. 

Once the GoHealth debacle went down last week, this company (SLQT) announced earnings will be released on August 25th for Q4 and the cumulative FY.

Note: SelectQuote is trading at just 2.8x EV to Sales and 11.5x FY 2022 adjusted EBITDA. (source: Google). 

I SEE OPPORTUNITY.

Positions: 400 $22.50 calls ; also around 450 shares or something like that across a few different areas. Not important... Not really a high dollar position by me (can see my other failures that I have posted), but I think it could be a good (relatively) low risk play.

I think this goes up off earnings and retraces previous support ranges. From there, you make your own decisions.

p3pmj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3pmj6/semrush_semr_compelling_small_cap_growth_stock/,Semrush ($SEMR) - Compelling Small Cap Growth Stock with Potential,19,25,2021-08-14 01:16:07,"TLDR;
1. Recent Martech IPO
2. SaaS business model, 121 NRR
3. Small cap stock ($2.9 B) growing 40-50%
4. Attractive multiple valuation vs. competition with lots of opportunity to double
5. Leader in space with pricing power
6. No options sadly but maybe someone can ask?

**Introduction**

Semrush is a SaaS-based marketing tool that enables users to get detailed insights about their SEO, SEM, Social Media, Content, Display advertising. They are a leader in the space and have gotten many awards for their product offerings. They offer a number of subscriptions ranging from $99/month (annual price) to $375/month with add-ons such as additional seats or additional features that cost $50-200/month.

As someone who practices SEO and is very familiar with the space and their competition, I can definitely say SEM Rush is best in class and offers a robust suite of products that are incredibly beneficial for optimizing SEO & SEM. What's amazing about their product is that it's significantly cheaper than competitor offerings. Their average deal size is around $2,100/year which is ridiculous given how much value they provide their users. They have increased their pricing earlier this year and in the Q2 earnings call, they noted that churn was stable so far (still TBD of course).

Also, SEM Rush benefits from being a leader in the search space that continues to grow exponentially per Google and Microsoft's earnings calls. Their social media marketing solutions will also be helpful given the growth of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, etc.

**Product Leadership vs. Competition**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/khes87bhr5h71.png?width=1851&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e504cfe54d5887b9d4df2d69cc3276784e9bd2c

Per their Q2 earnings slide, this is where they see themselves vs. their competition. Of course, they are biased, but the awards they've earned, plus the recognition they've received confirms at least some of this promotional content. In addition, as someone who has used a number of the products listed in the above screenshot, SEM Rush is definitely a leader for sure in the space relative to its competition.

Other notable competitors in the space are:

\-BrightEdge  
\-Conductor  
\-Botify  
\-DeepCrawl

The reason I bring them up is that the above solutions are considered ""Enterprise SEO"" or ""Enterprise marketing"" solutions and thus have a starting package of $1,000+/month (i.e. 5-figure contracts), given SEM Rush's core offering, I think SEM Rush can continue to position themselves as a cost-efficient leader in the space and to investors, given where competition's pricing is at, SEM Rush will have some pricing power. I would say their closest competitor that offers similar product offerings at a reasonable price is Ahrefs and from what I'm reading, they are growing quickly too.

**Financials**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iusju9eyr5h71.png?width=590&format=png&auto=webp&s=032fdb5fb454584ea96b09e8e0df25e43743ff1d

As you can see this is a high-growth company that COVID has definitely helped accelerate too. They've accelerated revenue sequentially and their YoY revenue growth accelerated from 35% in 2020 to 45%+ in 2021. Moreover, their sequential guidance, assuming if they can beat and raise like they did last year, means that revenue could very well grow 50%+ this year and if they can continue to grow 8%+ sequentially, we should see a 35%+ growth year in FY 2022 on some already impressive growth figures.

**Gross Margin**

Gross Margins for the business have increased steadily from 2018 to present:

2018: 72.2  
2019: 75.5  
2020: 76.0  
Q2 '2021: 77.3

So this company has the potential to be very profitable with its continued margin expansion. Per their long-term targets, they hope to get GM to around 80%, so that's another 2%+. That's pretty impressive, even in the SaaS space.

**Operating Margins**

Their non-GAAP operating margins has continued to improve, where they started Q1'20 at -6% and the FY 2020 at -3.7%. In Q1 '21, they improved operating margins to 5.3% and in Q2 '21, they had operating margins of 1.2%. So they are definitely improving in this area esp. vs. last year which demonstrates their operating leverage and ability to achieve profitability. Moreover, their long-term operating margin target is 20%+.

**Net Revenue Retention**

As with any software company, net revenue retention is incredibly important since it helps fuel top-line revenue growth since existing customers are buying more (""land and expand"") and you continue to generate new business.

Their NRR in 2019 was 120%, in 2020 it was 114% largely due to COVID's impact in Q2 when everything was shut down and companies were getting lean. In Q1 '21 it was 116% and in Q2 '21 it was 121%. It seems that per the earnings call, management will continue to grow that figure with additional product offerings and add-ons.

Here's a graph from their S-1 about their existing cohorts:

**Customers**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r94iuwikr5h71.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5113b4f93f5490975b3f5979a88e16db42a40dee

They continue to grow their customer base at a decent clip, with Q2 '21 customers totaling over 76k customers this was a 29% increase YoY and 5.6% sequentially. This is definitely impressive growth and as long as they continue to ""land and expand"" it should continue to contribute to their revenue growth. In the earnings call, management noted that 10k+ ARR customers grew 50%, so they are definitely seeing some up-market momentum.

**Valuation**

As of yesterday's close, SEM Rush had a EV/S multiple of 16.06 this compares to other martech solutions such as Hubspot ($HUBS) with an EV/S of 28.3 and Sprout Social ($SPT) with an EV/S of 34.7. It appears SEM Rush is growing faster than both of these companies and thus is ripe for some multiple expansion if they can continue to grow their revenue at the rates we've seen recently. I personally think the market is still in a ""wait and see"" mode since this is a new IPO and has only had 2 earnings releases so far. If they beat and raise next quarter, I would expect some material multiple expansion, similar to what we saw with Asana ($ASAN) where it took them 3 earnings reports to grow from an EV/S of mid-20s to 50+ (I don't expect SEM Rush to attain a 50+ multiple, just saying that there is definitely an opportunity for multiple expansion as long as they demonstrate their ability to impress the market).

**Final Remarks**

I think SEM Rush is an attractive small-cap ($2.9 B market cap) with a large and expanding TAM ($20 B per their S-1) thanks to the likes of tech behemoths Google/Microsoft/Facebook. They continue to innovate with strong product offerings that provide tremendous value to marketers all around the world at a fair price.

The subject is too complex to be summerized so it is better to just read what PLTR's management had to say.


""Before diving into results, I'd like to share a bit of our latest product innovation, something that we deployed at the Global Information Dominance Experiments, GIDE 3 last month. We call it the meta-constellation, and it's radically changing how satellites are tasked, the latency of collection, and it's creating a fundamental link in that AI-enabled decision chain.

""Overnight, we orchestrated a meta-constellation of 237 satellites by working with an array of commercial space companies. These companies have been deploying constellations of hyperspectral, radar, and elite sensors into orbit. And we're putting all of that power directly into the hands of the frontlines, empowering the edge. It's one of the largest collaborative sensor constellations ever to see operational news.""

Palantir's meta-constellation software harnesses the power of growing satellite constellations, deploying AI into space to provide insights to decision-makers here on Earth. Our meta-constellation integrates with existing satellites, optimizing hundreds of orbital sensors and AI models, and allowing users to ask time-sensitive questions across the entire planet.

Important questions like, where are the indicators of wildfires, or how are climate changes affecting crop productivity? And when and where are naval fleets conducting operations? Meta-constellation pushes Palantir's Edge AI technology to a new frontier. As we all know, submarines present threats to the U.S. and its allies. And to protect strategic interest, allied forces need to track every submarine's deployment around the world.

And at the forefront of this challenge are anti-submarine warfare officers. They turn to meta-constellation to monitor ports across the Pacific. Let me show you a little bit about what that looks like. In response to Allied monitoring requests, meta-constellation dynamically determined, which orbiting sensors are available. Integrated through Palantir, the constellations then collaboratively scheduled coverage over each port.

""Meanwhile, Apollo for Edge AI assigns tailored AI micro models to each satellite. Running onboard the satellite, the models will automatically find submarines and stream those insights directly to users. With the mission planned, Apollo automatically reconfigures each of the satellites, pushing the right micro models into orbit. And as a software payload on board, Palantir's Edge AI platform connects complex satellite subsystems to models integrating new AI with the hardware.

The best part, my favorite part is that as it orbits, the Edge AI platform hot-swaps the right micro models in, rapidly reconfiguring the satellite. The models process imagery, they detect submarines, geo-locate them, and then determine any movement since the last collection passed, all in under a second. When the AI sees a submarine movement, that insight is directly downlinked to allied forces as the satellite passes overhead, and the anti-submarine warfare officers are notified in just minutes, empowering them to respond in a way that we've never seen before.

As you can tell, we're really excited about Palantir's meta-constellation and see it as the software that brings hundreds of satellites to bear on your hardest problem. Whether it's the anti-submarine warfare officer that I just described using it to find submarines, or first responders leveraging AI to spot wildfire signs. Meta-constellation is there to empower users"". 


After you have read all of that, you might say "" Oh a lot of fancy words, space, satellites yada yada it sounds cool, but what is the practical implication? How could PLTR generate revenue from all of this? 

Well, here is my take on this matter. Since the early 2000's, people are saying that data is the new oil. The problem is that it is not only hard to analyse, organise and visualise large amounts of different data (That is where PLTR comes into play), but it is also very hard to collect the most relevant information to your enterprise exactly when you need it. Let's say that you are the management of a multinational corporation that specialises in growing crops. There is no chance for you to know that there are signs that wildfires might erupt in Brasil and ruin your crops, or that a large ship has blocked the Suez Canal just 2 minutes ago. But what if there is a chance to know all of this. Well, that is when satellites become important. In the future there is a high-probability that most large companies will have their own satellites that will make high-quality images 24/7 which will help them to predict certain events or act as fast as possible when some disaster happens. A lot of newly-created startups like BlackSky are trying to position themselves in this market. However, the opportunities are not  concentrated only in the commercial segment. The future battlefield of the global superpowers will be in space. It is no wonder that the U.S governments has started its newest military branch the U.S Space Force just recently. ( They are already customers of PLTR). 

How could PLTR benefit from all of this? They most definitely won't be the ones sending the satellites, but they are trying to be the go to software provider when it comes to the analysation of all the data collected. As they said on earnings call, by integrating different AI micro models, they could make the satellites work together, collect and analyse the most relevant information to you and then notify you in seconds. I know that this might still sound like science fiction , but one of the most successful enterpreneurs of our time like Musk, Thiel and Jobs are on the opinion that in order to create a monopolistic trillion dollar company you need to create a product that is so innovative and futuristic that people still do not know they need it. (IPhone, Tesla). If all of this becomes a reality, PLTR's opportunities when it comes to revenue growth will be massive. Alex Karp himself said that they do not care about the short-term, but about becoming the most important software company in the world.

Together, let's hyperfocus on Matterport. This following DD is my PhD thesis that I've compiled on this stock. If you don't know about Matterport, start off with my [introductory post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ou2ap9/mttr_bringing_3d_photogrammetry_experiences_to/). Also, check out some other bullish sentiment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/owofq2/the_stock_that_mttrs/).

TLDR: Matterport is a software company that enables individuals and enterprise clients to efficiently create digital 3D models of physical locations.

\[The bot isn't letting me post certain links. Gotta remove em\] 

## Let‚Äôs Begin With an Analogy:

Amazon started selling books with a *vision* to expand into many products. Matterport is doing something similar. They‚Äôre targeting some specific industries such as real estate and a few others. However, the *vision* goes far beyond this.

## Indexing of 3D models:

Matterport‚Äôs CEO RJ Pittman (formerly at Google, Apple & eBay) [spoke in 2008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aH6q2NOTFAE) about Google‚Äôs plan to index the world‚Äôs images. This is the essence of what Matterport is going to do with 3D models. **They‚Äôre actively indexing the world‚Äôs fastest-growing database of 3D models.** This process will be automated and powered by AI.

Why does this MTTR?

## The Apex

Let‚Äôs talk about APEX Imaging Services \[Link blocked by Bot, just google it\]. Apex is [utilizing Matterport‚Äôs](https://matterport.com/industries/case-studies/apex-imaging-services-brings-store-experiences-life-3d-site-survey) products to bring 3D building information and visualization to storefronts.

**APEX serves multiple companies such as:**

* **Starbucks**
* **Home Depot**
* **Chipotle**
* **7 Eleven**
* **CVS**
* and even **Chick Filet**

These 3D models enable retailers to take measurements of the store without sending somebody out to do it in person.

Most importantly, the features of these stores are *MASS-SEARCHABLE* because of indexing. With indexed 3D buildings, you can search for every Starbucks that has a 5 sq foot bathroom. Instantly see specific features in stores. Corporate can click a few buttons and get whatever data they need.

**Indexing Applications for Real Estate:** These searchable features carry over to real estate. Want to find an apartment with large closets? Just click a few buttons. I don't actually have any idea if this applies in real estate I just figure that it will.

I mean, after all, newer generations value integrity and honesty in real estate listings. 3D tours enable users to experience a more transparent and honest representation of the space they‚Äôre looking into. Many agree that [pictures in real-estate are becoming misleading](https://www.macleans.ca/economy/realestateeconomy/real-estate-photos-are-distorting-reality-frustrating-would-be-home-buyers/).

Not to mention, being able to measure space to see if that couch will fit. It's a real value prop.

## The potential of searchable, indexed, 3D buildings is huge.

Just look at their partnership with Facebook AI. (Search ""Habitat AI Facebook"") 

That‚Äôs right. They‚Äôre [training AI on 3D datasets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDNamn-mYAQ). Matterport‚Äôs ever-expanding database of 3D buildings will fuel AI researchers in the coming years. Not to mention the datasets can be used for training robots in simulation.

This means Matterport could inadvertently accelerate our ascent towards an AI apocalypse. How could you not be bullish?

## Explosive Android Market Potential:

Android Capture is Matterport‚Äôs upcoming app which will enable a huge amount of onboarding onto Matterport‚Äôs subscription platform. Much of their growth can be attributed to their recent iPhone app, but that's only 20% of smartphone owners.

80% of smartphone owners own an Android device.  Matterport‚Äôs stock will pop when they release Android capture. I‚Äôm unsure about the specifics of how that'll work, whether it uses traditional photogrammetry, or will be supplemented with user-owned lidar attachments for Android.

## The Team:

>A goal without a plan, is just a wish. And they‚Äôve got a plan.

New hires are coming in from Slice, Grubhub, and other startup companies. Their reliable and quickly growing team is the sole reason they‚Äôll accomplish their plan.

## In-conclusion

Thanks for momentarily skimming through this post that I spent the past hour writing. I‚Äôll continue to post fresh and relevant updates on Matterport as more news comes around.

This is  an entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a retard  posting on WSB  with a bias due to having a very large position of my portfolio in $F.  So, Don't act on anything posted in here and proceed on your own risk...)

**1- Ford's secret weapon unleashed:**

For the last **44 consecutive years**, the F-150 has been Americas **best selling Truck**. In 2019, the Ford F-Series was **second only to the Apple iPhone**, which  raked in **$55 billion**, in terms of **total revenue** generated. The F-Series **generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined**, Just something to think about.

On May 19, Ford has unveiled its EV F-150 after Biden had driven it a week prior. The EV's features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations (Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min ad video). It has all the features crucial for it's **target buyers** (Construction workers, Farmers, Free-lance delivery drivers, Basically hardworking Blue-collar Americans...) and it's **a Truck which actually looks like a Truck.** ‚ÄúFord knows what pickup owners want,‚Äù IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. More importantly, it's an F-150 first, an EV second, Ford didn't abandon the F-150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years.

The reservation now have exceeded 120,000 since it's debut. An important point the CEO mentioned on the call was that **about 75%, or 90,000, are new to Ford, according to the company!** If anything, this indicates that Ford is the runner up for Tesla in the EV competition. almost every car manufacturer can make an EV, but only a few (I can count on one hand) can supply enough cars to keep up with demand with superb price and quality.

Now Ford's EVs are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla for the past 4 months with sales, more on this on #5). The F-150 starts at  $32,500 after Federal tax credit!! Cheaper than any of **""Potential(because they don't exist yet)""** competitors with superior car features.

It's relevant to mention that Ford's EV sales (counting electric vehicles and hybrids) increased 177% during June, capping off 56,570 units sold so far in 2021.

**As Ford promised, F-150 Lightning will deliver more features, and cost less...**

^(Don't forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs, and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year.)

**2- Ford Rivian Partnership:**

Ford-Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September. It's looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now üòÇ(Ford is 55.64B at 14.18$). Ford has initially invested 500$ million in Rivian, but it added much more of an undisclosed amount with **the most recent news being 902$million in Q1 of 2021.**

**On Jul 23, it was announced that Rivian closed a $2.5 billion funding round,** led by existing investors **Ford**, Amazon and T. Prior to it, they announced plans to open a second manufacturing plant and U.S States started submitting bids on it.

Farley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market. **As more companies continue to invest in Rivian, Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares,** ""but that's not why we invested,"" Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend.

Farley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV-SUV market too **with a Lincoln or Explorer-Rivian car**. He understands that **the first move is the most important one in the EV Game,** and with the Mach-E and F-150, Ford executed it's moves perfectly! Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices, high quality, while maintaining the demand(something which Tesla still isn't able to). Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1.3

**3- Bronco capturing Buyers of other brands:**

Prior to the release of the Bronco, it had 190,000 reservations. **66% of the reservations were converted to sales!** Additionally, Farley mentioned in the earnings call that 70% of the 125,000 orders it has are customers of other brands.

According to Ford, dealers are keeping Broncos on the lot for an average of **15 days!,** with a big chunk of of the buyers coming from jeep. People are killing to get their hands on one. just go on Ebay and see for yourself. Bronco first Edition is going for 6 figures with the buy now being approx 150K$.

I would understand PS5 scalpers, but that happening with Cars, I never would've imagined. This shows how the demand of this car is insane and why Ford raised it's 2021 Revenue expectation from $3.5 billion, to between $9-$10 billion and they'll probably raise it again in the next quarter.

&#x200B;

**4- Ford's Governmental Fleet 3D chess Strategy:**

‚ÄúFord clearly has business and government fleets in mind,‚Äù Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said.

Ford revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F-150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday. Called the Lightning Pro, it‚Äôs equipped with a standard battery that‚Äôs good for an estimated 230 miles and costs $39,974, which is the base price for retail F-150 Lightnings.

Ford's vision to lead the EV market has a ‚Äúno-brainer‚Äù component Elon Musk lacks: Targeting business and government fleet customers with new battery-powered trucks and vans. Ford‚Äôs focus on converting Gas fleet buyers to electric models builds on the company‚Äôs existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts. They know that they are already the best with no competitors when it comes to the quality or price of the F-150. They will literally destroy their competitors with this approach.

# 5- Valuation and Price target

Yes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.

$Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple

(Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- outdated)

TSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X

NIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)

GM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X

F - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X

**(Important part starts here)**

As you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.

If you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.

At that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **üá∫üá∏ ü¶Ö**.

**Ford is ready to dominate the EV market and it's just starting!**

[Currently, only Maryland has passed this bill](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/tax/library/maryland-digital-ad-tax-delay-digital-products-amendments1.html), but states like Texas, NY, and West Virginia are trying to push it through as well.

IMO, if this becomes a countrywide standard, this is gonna be a huge fine on a bunch of companies like Google, FB, Amazon, etc. The worst part is the tax **(EDIT: bracket)** is calculated on gross TOTAL revenue:

ex. If I made $3 bajillion selling oranges and 50 cents selling ads, the tax would be calculated ~~on a percentage of $3 bajillion and 50 cents.~~  on the 50 cents from selling ads, but how much you're taxed is based on the $3 bajillion and 50 cents.

**EDIT: I can't read.** the tax is imposed on the amount you earned from the digital ads, but the tax rate depends on your global annual revenue. So it's not as stupid, but still pretty stupid. A little more faith in our government, a lot less faith in my reading comprehension

These companies could offload the tax onto their customers but that would probably deter customers and less companies will want to rent ads from bigger companies (if they make more money in total, the added charge will be higher)

This will probably be a long term play (first actual tax will occur April next year) but my ape ass is looking for ways to play this and I can't think of anything below surface level.

Thought some of yall would wanna know.

TL;DR: Orange peels are a good source of pectin."

ZIP went public in late May via direct listing. Only existing shares were sold as the company is already profitable, and they had no need to raise additional cash or dilute ownership.

Since then the stock has had a floor of about $20, slowly rising to $27+ today, about a week before their first earnings call as a public company.

There have been 3 notable events that have had an effect on the stock in this time:

(1) A partnership with FB on 03August, which has pushed the stock up \~$1.50 (6%).

(2) Initiation of research coverage by a number of financial services companies. Mostly on 21June, which caused the stock to bump \~$2.25 (10.5%).

(3) A steady stream of conversion of reserve stock units to common stock and sales by early investors and executives.

The last of these increase supply of liquid stock in the marketplace and clearly puts downward pressure on ZIP. But‚Ä¶. the amounts you see being traded are not substantial on the scale of a \~$3B market cap. (Look for Form4 on SEC.gov for these sales) From the looks of it, it‚Äôs C-level execs cashing out \~$50-250k here and there. Nothing compared to the 85+ million shares sold (out of a fully diluted 123m) in the direct listing. (That and most of the high-ups seem to have the bulk of their stock locked up in family trusts.) Plus, I assume execs are kept from trading right now with their earnings announcement next week. Speaking of‚Ä¶

Unlike most tech companies going public these days, $ZIP is already quite profitable. By the looks of their S1, they took advantage of Covid to significantly reduce their cost structure and run a tighter ship (Operating expenses dipped from $381m (2019) to $300m (2020), over 20%. That while the money they‚Äôre making per employer (‚ÄúQuarterly Paid Employers‚Äù in the S1) seeking employees via Zip went up 16% from \~$1100 to \~$1275. All in, the company ended 2020 with $86m in net income off of $418m in revenue.  ($64m of net income, ignoring a tax benefit.)

Their Form 424B4 shows that the March quarter continued this trend, turning an $11m loss (2020) into a $13m profit ($20m). Revenues increased 10+% quarter over quarter. They were $20m cash flow positive for the quarter, with $135m in cash on hand against a little over $25m in convertible notes, the only debt listed.

Last: The business. I like that this isn‚Äôt a sexy business. The company is profitable and well-capitalized, but what they do (online job marketplace) keeps them under the radar. And we‚Äôre at a place where employers are willing to pay out their ears to get warm bodies in seats. See recent headlines like: ‚ÄúMillions of jobs and a shortage of applicants‚Äù and ‚ÄúUS job openings hit record 9.2 million but businesses can‚Äôt find enough workers to fill them.‚Äù Which means ZIP‚Äôs customers are going to have more listings (+) and willing to pay even more for each of them (++).

So, yep, I‚Äôm long ZIP and have steadily bought between $20 and $25."

**Overview of business:**

At its core, Poshmark is a platform that connects sellers of clothing with buyers. The founder, Manish Chandra often touts the ""social commerce"" element and continues to talk about social commerce as this is where he believes the moat of the business is. I wish he would stop, Poshmark isn't about social commerce, the true moat is empowerment.

**My experience with Poshmark:**

During the Pandemic, I grew interested in vintage clothing and began buying stuff on resale platforms and reselling it to an audience I've built on Instagram. I sell on instagram because most of the things I sell are $200+ and I find my margins to be around 40% so if I were to make $100 gross profit on a $200 sale and net $80 after shipping and other expenses, selling on a platform like Poshmark wouldn't makes sense as the fee to do so would be 20% of sale price: $40 on a $200 sale, AKA half my net profit. My resale activity is extremely niche and not a scaleable business. What I have found in doing it is that I need to source my inventory and I have bought items on Poshmark, Depop, Mercari, Ebay, Etsy, Grailed, and Facebook Marketplace. Ebay takes the cake, I find the most stuff on there and whenever I have tried to sell I move stuff quickest on Ebay. Poshmark is a close second. Over the winter I found the supply of stuff I could buy cheap on Poshmark and flip on Instagram outstanding. For the longest time, I couldn't understand why all these people would sell things on Poshmark as the percentage of each sale they take is the highest compared to their online marketplace competitors. Poshmark takes 20% of every sale above $15 and a flat $2.95 for sales below $15. Ebay takes around 10-15% (they have recently cut PayPal out of the payment processing and are now charging more and I know a lot of sellers are not happy). Etsy also has a long and complicated breakdown of what they charge, but its less than 20%, Grailed & Depop take 10%, and Facebook marketplace takes 5%.

So why would anyone in their right mind sell something on Poshmark and pay a 20% fee when they could sell it on Facebook Marketplace and pay a 5% fee?

Isn't this whole industry about to compete in a race to the bottom where one platform with resources (like Facebook) can undercut the others and then another platform does the same until there is no profit left in the industry?

When I heard Poshmark was going to IPO I was thinking about buying puts or avoiding the stock altogether as my answer to these questions was people will move from where the fees are highest to where they are lowest. Because of this straightforward incentive, platforms will undercut each other until there is no profit and eventually there will be consolidation. When conducting some light DD on this thesis I spoke to a number of Poshmark sellers and did some digging, I changed my mind and went long shares at $75, then again at $68, then again at $62, then again at $57, then again at $56, then again at $47. Now, I am holding a massive bag of shit. When the stock crashed after Q1 earnings I was feeling very discouraged and although I was not considering selling, the 40% loss on my position stung. But, after seeing the stock crater another 8% yesterday on news they are planning to expand into India, I felt that maybe I should take a look at call prices. Before we get into options plays, I want to try and articulate what caused me to feel bullish about the stock.

**Poshmark's Competitive Advantage**

Poshmark's CEO, Manish Chandra, touts social commerce and ""posh parties"" similar to Tupperware parties as one of their key differentiators. I get a notification on my phone everyday that one of these parties is going on but I haven't been able to figure out what its about.

I see Poshmark's competitive advantages differently. Three come to mind.

The first is how easy it is to list an item on Poshmark. Take a photo, check a few boxes, name a price, and post. Compared to Ebay which is incredibly labor intensive and involves so many categories and sub-categories, Poshmark streamlines the process through having an efficient and easy to use UI.

The second competitive advantage is how easy it is for Poshmark sellers to ship items. Buyers pay for shipping and it is a flat rate of $7.45. When an item is sold on poshmark the buyer has to pay instantly (ebay does not have this feature and as a result sellers say 10%+ of items sold have buyers that do not pay and they have to go through the process of canceling and re-listing). When the item is sold Poshmark E-mails a shipping label to you, all you have to do is print it out and tape it on ANY box or packaging and either drop it at USPS or have them pick it up. It is incredibly easy.

Both of these attributes remove the barriers to entry that new sellers face. When you get started you want it to be easy and straightforward. Incredibly, Ebay and other platforms have fee structures that are difficult to understand, platforms that are difficult to use, and most require a PayPal to be set up as well.

The third competitive advantage is by far the most important and hardest to create and sustain. Poshmark has a fiercely loyal and passionate user base of sellers who swear by the platform. Some become ""[Poshmark ambassadors](https://support.poshmark.com/s/article/How-do-I-become-a-Posh-Ambassador?language=en_US)"" and receive next to nothing for being ambassadors. They do it because they love the platform. I have tried in vain to convince sellers to go around the platform. Consider a $200 item, if they sell it on Poshmark, they will net $160. If I am willing to pay $175 through PayPal and try and convince them it's a win win as I save $25 and they'll make $15 more, I should stand ready to take the wrath of the Poshmark ambassador who will report me to Poshmark and decline my offer.

Let's take a closer look at this third competitive advantage and see if it can help answer my question about why sellers would choose to sell on a platform that charges them a higher percentage of each sale. Why would they also loyally defend and promote this platform for few tangible benefits?

The answer is has to do more with psychology than with financial logic. The reason Poshmark was able to grow and compete is due to the first two competitive advantages I listed: it's easy to list, it's easy to ship, (and easy to get paid). Because it's easy to use sellers tell other sellers and buyers become sellers. We live in a market economy and with the rise of social media, large internet companies, and superstar founder entrepreneurs, the lives of entrepreneurs and the value they bring to society has been glorified. I think most people want to participate in the market economy, they want to be an entrepreneur, be their own boss, or have a ""side hustle"". Unfortunately, it's not easy and the few that succeed stand on a pile of failed ventures and crushed dreams. Poshmark makes it easy. Poshmark enables people who have been excluded from the wealth generating aspects of the online internet economy into successful participants. Broadly, those who haven't benefited from this new globalized economy have been: Women, racial minorities, geographic minorities (south, midwest). The demographics of Poshmark sellers and users closely align with those who have been excluded. The vast majority of Poshmark sellers are women, I was unable to find an exact number but in Poshmark's [2020 social commerce report](https://www.report.poshmark.com/) a survey conducted by Zogby Analytics had a user response rate that was 97% female. In this same report, Poshmark states that ""the south dominates"" and that 35% of sellers live in the south and 37% of buyers live in the south. [Poshmark's real product is empowerment.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRVNdxz_thk) Their platform empowers women and minorities (racial and geographic) by making it easy for them to feel successful and have a side hustle. Empowerment is an incredible feeling for those who haven't felt it before and Poshmark makes it possible for millions to feel this way.

**Why Wall Street Misunderstands Poshmark**

In order to find an investment that can provide outsized returns, it's important to have an information advantage over the consensus view. Wall Street does not understand this stock because broadly speaking Wall Street is an information laggard when it comes to valuing companies that provide products and services primarily to women. I've made similar investments in Lululemon and Revolve that have preformed extremely well as the consensus changed. As investors have seen this pattern play out over and over Wall Street investors have started to ""ask their wife"" or ""pay attention to their daughter"" in looking for innovative companies. The problem with Poshmark's stock is that the types of people who work on Wall Street analyzing stocks and their wives don't use poshmark, and neither do their daughters.

When I was looking into the management at Poshmark I noticed Serena Williams is a board member. I am an avid tennis fan and as such I have a favorite player: Roger Federer. Everyone loves Federer, he is a class act and attracts sponsorships from the likes of Rolex, Mercedes, Netjets, Rimowa, Swiss coffee machine makers, and has an ownership stake in On Running. These are brands Wall Streeters love! Serena Williams has a different public perception. On court she in an incredible competitor with a lot of passion which sometimes translates into dramatic meltdowns and aggressive behavior towards [umpires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx9iT1OQMl0) and [linesmen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNwc7o_0Sgg). She has sponsorships from Nike, Gatorade, PUMA, Wilson, Pepsi etc. The respective brand deals the players have represent their public image and who they will be most effective in marketing towards. Serena Williams‚Äôs image is used to target a demographic of consumers that is antithetical to the types of people Roger Federer‚Äôs image is used for. Think about who evaluates and writes research on stocks. Its Federer fans, it's Rolex wearing, Swiss latte sipping 25-50 year olds who love the class and sophistication of Federer. Now think about the users of Poshmark, its young women, women of color, and women living in geographic areas that have taken a lot of the brunt of globalization. Serena Williams is the perfect match for Poshmark as she represents their user demographics much better than Federer ever could. But, Wall Street loves Federer and therefore has overlooked this stock.

**Financials and Valuation**

Etsy recently bought Depop for 1.6B when Depop had 70M in revenue in the previous year. This equates to a Price to Sales ratio of 22.85. Poshmark's market cap at its current share price of $36.25 is 2.72 Billion. Last year they did 262M in revenue For a P/S ratio of 10.3. Remember, Depop is an inferior platform for sellers and barely has a useable website. Why did it sell for double to P/S ratio Poshmark is selling for now?

**Potential Catalysts / The Set Up**

Poshmark is expanding across the globe entering multiple new markets each year. Yesterday, 8/2, [Poshmark announced they will be expanding into India](https://investors.poshmark.com/news/news-details/2021/Poshmark-Inc.-Announces-India-Expansion-as-Part-of-a-Continued-Focus-on-New-Market-Opportunities/default.aspx) and the stock tanked 7.5%.

A few months ago Poshmark announced a [partnership with Snapchat](https://investors.poshmark.com/news/news-details/2021/Poshmark-Inc.-and-Snap-Inc.-Partner-to-Bring-Social-Shopping-to-Snapchat/default.aspx). I am very excited about this partnership as I am bullish on Facebook and Snapchat and see commerce as an important new opportunity for both of these platforms.

Poshmark is also expanding horizontally into different categories such as pets and home and because of their asset light model they can throw shit at the wall and see what sticks.

Set up wise, this is more of a reopening play than a covid play but it is being looked at and valued as if it should've benefited from the lockdowns. Because Poshmark is an E-commerce company, Wall Street has been harsh on them for not growing as fast as some of their ""peers"". Except their ""peers"" aren't true peers as sites like Etsy are more diversified in the products sold on their platform with a heavier weight on arts and crafts and other activities that thrive when people have more time at home. Clothing is not something people look to buy when stuck at home. As the economy continues to reopen and people start working and going out again sales will pick up. This very well may be reflected in Q2 earnings.

Short interest is 30% (4.75M/15M outstanding as of 7/15). I am not looking at this trade as a short squeeze but if shorts do decide to cover the stock could begin to run and run fast.

**The Trade**

Shares are the safest play. There are limited options available on Poshmark with spreads I could drive a truck through. The furthest out are Feb 18, 2022. $65 is the highest strike available. Because of the spreads, uncertainty of when an upside move will occur, and lack of long dated options, I only own shares. Second Quarter earnings are coming up on 8/10 with guidance of $79.0 million - $81.0 million in Revenue and $1.5 million - $2.5 million in Adjusted EBITDA. I am fairly confidant they will beat the guidance they set for themselves but unsure if this will result in a massive move to the upside. I think it could take more time.

I have a fairly high conviction in this trade and am posting to get feedback and thoughts from others, that said Poshmark is only 10%+ of my portfolio and I want to crowdsource my ideas a bit more before I buy options or decide to sell other investments to buy more.

**TLDR**

Poshmark empowers women. This is their competitive advantage. Wall Street doesn't get this.O"

Large increases in monthly selling like this by top executives have been some of best 1-3 month shorts with 100-400% in gains.

Meanwhile wall street and insiders are quietly cashing out billions on you suckers.

Seriously tho, who buys anything they see on SNAP?? Sure the app is fun and a few good dick pic sends were had, but as a business, I'd much rather advertise on FB/TWTR/instagram/GOOGL/AMZN. SNAP is now 10x the bottom of march 2020 crash just 1.5 years ago, pretty extreme for 112% sales growth TTM (that they are spending billions on in software development to achieve).

I think a gap fill to $64 is likely here in the next few months. Lack of buyers post-earnings and the fresh low of $73.50 today looking very bearish. Great way to hedge to the downside if market pulls back again. 

TL;DR: SNAP sept $70p and short shares @ $74"

# Real Estate Play?

Wait... they just take pictures of houses and shet. idgaf. Housing market gonna crash and we're all gonna kiss Burry's ass again. Trash play.

Well... sort of, let's do an analogy.

If stonks go up, who makes money?

1. Bulls
2. The brokers earning commission from you apes

If stonks go down, who makes money?

1. üåà üêª
2. The brokers earning commission from you apes

Matterport is the tool that brokers use. They have contracts with Redfin, apartments.com, vacasa, etc

Listing sites like Zillow and Airbnb also support user uploaded Matterport imaging.

Buy, sell, rent, hotel, BnB, market up, market down, ERRYTHANG!

In other words, they're gonna make money regardless of real estate market.

# Stats:

bigger numbers lead to bigger tendies

total revenue: $26.9mill (+108% YoY)

Subscribers: 331,000 (+500+% YoY)

\# of Spaces under Matterport Management: 5 mill +

Annual Recurring Revenue: $55+ million

150+ countries and counting

# Covid/Recovery Play:

Is it too late to play covid? maybe, but Florida thinks otherwise.

Online shopping/home improvement: Rather than annoying the living shet outta amazon by returning the 9/10 items you just bought, you can virtually place the item in your home and see how it fits or looks.

When you're stuck at home gong crazy staring at the wall, you might plan your next trip. Resorts, hotels, parks, vacation sites. While everyone is stuck at home, these places'll use Matterport to instill as much FOMO as they can to get customers to line up once the pandemic is over.

# Other Streams of Revenue/Applications:

Retail: You ever buy something at Ikea, bring it home, assemble it, and find out it doesn't fit correctly or it doesn't match the fungshui of your living room? Neither have I, but I'm sure someone has. And Matterport can help you see whether your curtains will match that bean bag you always wanted. Aside from this, retailers have instructions from corporate on their store layout and shelving. Matterport will play a big role in facilitating this so that these managers don't have to drive/fly to every city in their jurisdiction.

VR/AR: They have a deal with Face mother f-ing Book. That deal was just for research and AI. You know what else FB owns? Oculus. MTTR can easily enter VR/AR space with their technology to enter the gaming and 'adult' industries.

# Short Interest:

IDGAF about the short interest. They're gonna make bank and that'll lead to me to making bank. I like the stock. and tbh, I'm such an ape, I don't even know how to reliably check short interest. I just like the stock.

# PR:

If you create the world's best invention; you'll still be dirt poor if no one knows about it. The same goes with stocks. Matterport just hired 2 new PR specialists in the past 2 months - a VP of Investor relations Soohwan Kim, and VP International marketing, Vivian Weiying Pan. If you didn't know about Matterport before, you'll know about it now. More people = more investors = stonks going up

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WFvWUJb_E02c7xBqPN92uxmvUjvKC4noNDRJLXGNfUo/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Wednesday AH has a load favorable trades.** $ROKU, $FSLY, $ETSY, $LMND, $BNGO all have an average move of over 10%, and are all set to report on Wednesday. If you‚Äôre looking to gamble, I would personally roll the dice on one of these companies since they have the highest likelihood of providing us with a profitable moonshot which will greatly offset the IV crush we‚Äôll experience. Since they‚Äôre reporting Wednesday after hours, the options for them will be *incredibly cheap* because they will only have one day left before they expire, and theta will have made them close to worthless. **Cheap options, huge potential moves.** What‚Äôs there not to love? The best part is, many of these options are priced inefficiently. At the time of writing, $ROKU has a projected move of 8% but often moves double that. The same goes for $FSLY. These ratios will only get better for us throughout the week as theta does its thing. I‚Äôll likely throw on a couple of straddles right before close on Wednesday.

&nbsp;

- **$LYFT and $UBER provide us with a collateral play opportunity.**  Pretty straightforward play this time around - if you‚Äôre bullish or bearish on either company, you should look to enter an $UBER position BEFORE $LYFT reports earnings on Tuesday. The $LFYT report will likely move both $LYFT and $UBER equally. If we play $LYFT, we run the risk of getting IV crushed, or having a move go against us. If we play $UBER, we‚Äôll reap the rewards if we are right, while also avoiding IV crush. Furthermore, if the move goes against us, IV will inflate, offsetting any potential losses we may experience. **You could also look to do the same with $PENN and $DKNG.** This was just a crude summary, if you wish to learn more about this type of trade, check out my writeup on collateral plays [**here.**](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

&nbsp;

- **Avoid $BABA and $NKLA like the plague.** Both companies are getting hammered due to outside circumstances, meaning that earnings will have very little to no impact on their overall stock prices. $BABA is getting smacked around by the Chinese government, and $NKLA is facing round 8 or 9 of fraud charges. I have no stake in either company, nor do I ever plan to, but I know some idiots will inevitably try buying the dip thinking they‚Äôre Warren Buffet. Do not play $NKLA or $BABA this week.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I haven‚Äôt had much time to review any extra trades given that I‚Äôve been extremely busy this weekend. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.

#Summary and Conclusion

We‚Äôve got a wild week ahead! Lots of large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap companies across many different sectors are set to report, meaning we‚Äôve got some huge opportunities to generate some serious alpha. If you see any appealing plays I‚Äôve missed, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WFvWUJb_E02c7xBqPN92uxmvUjvKC4noNDRJLXGNfUo/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment! If you want access to more trading tools, or have any specific questions or observations you‚Äôd like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links within the spreadsheet or on my profile. **Happy Trading! :)**"

5 months ago, I spent so much time on part 1 and 2 and after posting them, I sadly realized that people are lazy üòÇ Apes don't want to read mountains of DD, They just want a 5th grade level TLDR. This Ape got you, I will try to make this DD a longer version of a TLDR! I'll try to make it concise and to the point as much as possible.(5 hours later, I failed at this objective lol)

**1- Ford's secret weapon unleashed:**

For the last **44 consecutive years**, the F-150 has been Americas **best selling Truck**. In 2019, the Ford F-Series was **second only to the Apple iPhone**, which  raked in **$55 billion**, in terms of **total revenue** generated. The F-Series **generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined**, Just something to think about.

On May 19, Ford has unveiled its EV F-150 after Biden had driven it a week prior. The EV's features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations (Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min ad video). It has all the features crucial for it's **target buyers** (Construction workers, Farmers, Free-lance delivery drivers, Basically hardworking Blue-collar Americans...) and it's **a Truck which actually looks like a Truck.** ‚ÄúFord knows what pickup owners want,‚Äù IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. More importantly, it's an F-150 first, an EV second, Ford didn't abandon the F-150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years.

The reservation now have exceeded 120,000 since it's debut. An important point the CEO mentioned on the call was that **about 75%, or 90,000, are new to Ford, according to the company!** If anything, this indicates that Ford is the runner up for Tesla in the EV competition. almost every car manufacturer can make an EV, but only a few (I can count on one hand) can supply enough cars to keep up with demand with superb price and quality.

Now Ford's EVs are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla for the past 4 months with sales, more on this on #5). The F-150 starts at  $32,500 after Federal tax credit!! Cheaper than any of **""Potential(because they don't exist yet)""** competitors with superior car features. 

It's relevant to mention that Ford's EV sales (counting electric vehicles and hybrids) increased 177% during June, capping off 56,570 units sold so far in 2021.

**As Ford promised, F-150 Lightning will deliver more features, and cost less...**

^(Don't forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs, and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year.)

**2- Ford Rivian Partnership:**

Ford-Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September. It's looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now üòÇ(Ford is 55.64B at 14.18$). Ford has initially invested 500$ million in Rivian, but it added much more of an undisclosed amount with **the most recent news being 902$million in Q1 of 2021.**

**On Jul 23, it was announced that Rivian closed a $2.5 billion funding round,** led by existing investors **Ford**, Amazon and T. Prior to it, they announced plans to open a second manufacturing plant and U.S States started submitting bids on it.

Farley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market. **As more companies continue to invest in Rivian, Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares,** ""but that's not why we invested,"" Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend.

Farley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV-SUV market too **with a Lincoln or Explorer-Rivian car**. He understands that **the first move is the most important one in the EV Game,** and with the Mach-E and F-150, Ford executed it's moves perfectly! Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices, high quality, while maintaining the demand(something which Tesla still isn't able to). Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1.3

&#x200B;

**3- Bronco capturing Buyers of other brands:**

 Prior to the release of the Bronco, it had 190,000 reservations. **66% of the reservations were converted to sales!** Additionally, Farley mentioned in the earnings call that 70% of the 125,000 orders it has are customers of other brands. 

According to Ford, dealers are keeping Broncos on the lot for an average of **15 days!,** with a big chunk of of the buyers coming from jeep. People are killing to get their hands on one. just go on Ebay and see for yourself. Bronco first Edition is going for 6 figures with the buy now being approx 150K$. 

I would understand PS5 scalpers, but that happening with Cars, I never would've imagined. This shows how the demand of this car is insane and why Ford raised it's 2021 Revenue expectation from $3.5 billion, to between $9-$10 billion and they'll probably raise it again in the next quarter. 

&#x200B;

**4- Ford's Governmental Fleet 3D chess Strategy:**

‚ÄúFord clearly has business and government fleets in mind,‚Äù Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said.

Ford revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F-150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday. Called the Lightning Pro, it‚Äôs equipped with a standard battery that‚Äôs good for an estimated 230 miles and costs $39,974, which is the base price for retail F-150 Lightnings.

Ford's vision to lead the EV market has a ‚Äúno-brainer‚Äù component Elon Musk lacks: Targeting business and government fleet customers with new battery-powered trucks and vans. Ford‚Äôs focus on converting Gas fleet buyers to electric models builds on the company‚Äôs existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts. They know that they are already the best with no competitors when it comes to the quality or price of the F-150. They will literally destroy their competitors with this approach.

# 5- Valuation and Price target

Yes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.

$Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple

(Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- outdated)

TSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X

NIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)

GM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X

F - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X

**(Important part starts here)**

As you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.

If you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.

 At that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **üá∫üá∏ ü¶Ö**.

**Ford is ready to dominate the EV market and it's just starting!**

What's poppin' bull gang, I hope you made some awesome money last week! The spreadsheet was spot on for nearly every company, and all of my plays came to fruition! **$MT and $X ended up bagging us anywhere from 300% to 500%, $JETS gave us 1100%, and $SNAP netted us 250% on our strangles and nearly 600% on binary options!** I‚Äôm looking to keep this momentum going throughout this week as well, and with all of FAAMG (I kicked $NFLX out for $MSFT after their disgraceful earnings) set to report, this week could prove to be more lucrative than the last! We‚Äôve got a large variety of trades we can make this week ranging from educated gambles, to good old fashioned theta plays. We‚Äôve even have a couple of opportunities to sprinkle in some collateral plays if we wish! Let‚Äôs get into it! 

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Pinterest is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $PINS has had an average post earnings move of **14%**. The options this week are pricing in a move of *roughly 6%* on both sides of the chain, which is likely going to shrink significantly going into earnings as theta eats away at the contracts. Even though I‚Äôm extremely bullish on $PINS, this trade could honestly move either way, so I‚Äôm personally opting to play a straddle like I did with $SNAP last week. Given that we get a historically average move, we‚Äôll be making some money on this trade. Keep in mind, this trade *is* riskier than the one we played on $SNAP, since the average historical move is smaller. Don‚Äôt over leverage yourself, and don‚Äôt be afraid to turn the straddle into a reverse iron butterfly to reduce your cost basis on the trade.

&nbsp;

- **Over the past 24 earnings seasons, Shopify has gone up nearly 75% of the time!** The odds on this trade are phenomenal, and we have quite a few options for how we want to play it.  If you want to gamble directionally, call debit spreads would be your best bet from a risk to reward standpoint. Alternatively, we can also join theta-gang for this play by selling ATM put credit spreads allowing us to net some extremely nice premiums. If you want an even safer spread, $MSFT also has a similar win-rate (~65%) while having a historically smaller move, allowing you to defend your capital in the event that the trade goes against you. Since both $SHOP and $MSFT report on different days, we can look to make this play twice to ensure we‚Äôre not overleveraged on any given day.

&nbsp;

- **Counterintuitively, $XLE is NOT a good [collateral play](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays) this week!** $XLE actually has a *higher* IV than both $XOM and $CVS, so if you wanted to play oil earnings, you‚Äôd actually be better off rolling the dice on the individual companies. I‚Äôm not sure why this is the case here. Either the MMs are catching onto my bullshit (unlikely), or there‚Äôs some nuances to trading oil that I‚Äôm not aware of.  I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs an arbitrage play you could make regarding the individual price and IV differences proportional to the ETF holdings, but I don‚Äôt have time to crunch the numbers nor do I think I‚Äôd have enough capital to abuse it. Regardless, I just wanted to bring this to everyone‚Äôs attention since this is one of the rare cases where the collateral play puts us at a disadvantage.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I haven‚Äôt had much time to review any extra trades given that I‚Äôve been extremely busy this weekend. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.

#Summary and Conclusion

We‚Äôve got another fun week of earnings ahead of us! I personally tend to avoid playing FAANG stocks in general, so my analysis was concentrated elsewhere. If you see any appealing plays, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment! If you want access to more trading tools, or have any specific questions or observations you‚Äôd like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links within the spreadsheet or on my profile. **Happy Trading! :)**"

As of close of Thursday, portfolio is up $52K in a little over a month of portfolio.

The goal of this portfolio is to generate yearly returns that beat out market returns through a mix of buying calls options, writing covered calls and put options, wheeling, and holding a diversified stock portfolio in industries including banking & capital markets, consumer electronics, internet content and information, solar energy, oil & gas, information technology, aerospace & defense, tobacco, food & beverages, life insurance, software, credit services, and home improvement. Another goal is to collect passive income through dividends and compound that through dividend reinvestment.

As of 07-22, it is up $52K or 10.4% over the last month. Moreover, the portfolio also pays around $7,000 in annual dividends (all qualified dividends), which will be automatically reinvested through dividend reinvestment.

Tech stocks include AAPL, AMD, AMZN, FB, GOOGL, MSFT, and NFLX. None tech stocks include AFL, GS, LMT, LOW, MCD, PFE, PM, UNH, V, and XOM. Options include AAPL 07/30 Expiration covered call with strike price of 137. AAPL 07/30 Expiration CSP with strike price of 136. GS 08/13 CSP with strike price of 365. IWM 01/2022 expiration calls with 214 strike price. QQQ 03/2022 expiration calls with strike prices of 325 and 255. QQQ CSPs expiration 03/2022 and 06/2022 with strike prices of 310 and 320, respectively. I typed as much I as can to explain my positions.

Massive market crash is incoming next week and it‚Äôs going to be worse than the 2008 housing crash! üìâüí•,0,99,2021-07-23 23:27:20,"Now that I got your attention, I‚Äôm thinking there is going to be a (possibly major) correction mid-way next week.

**FA:**

FOMC meeting is on July 28 and they will be, yet again, discussing fiscal and monetary policies. Fed funds rate could remain at <=0.25% or bump up. The rise in fed fund rate is pretty unlikely as JPow communicated that QE slowdown will precede interest rate hikes, but there's a good chance that tapering will be further discussed. US exports have climbed back to precovid numbers, US imports are higher than ever before despite DXY getting slapped meanwhile the GDP target has risen for 2021 signaling a sooner than anticipated economic recovery. Not to mention the continuous MoM CPI climbs in absurd amounts and the US operating at a massive trade deficit, all signal that tapering may start in the very near term despite JPow repeating how far we are from the economic target. However, officials have echoed on numerous fronts, the interest rate is not expected to see a hike until 2023; although, they predict that tapering plans will be announced in Fall of this year, but with everything seeming to go back to status quo sooner than expected, tapering or other bearish monetary policies could be announced and implemented shortly.

Tech earnings week is fast approaching. It‚Äôs unlikely the prices will hold when tech stocks sit at all time highs and the ER forecast for blue chips remain stagnant compared to its previous quarters.

**TA:**

TA says we‚Äôre reaching upper level resistance. Volatility is extremely high on the upside and can trigger HFT or quant funds to reduce inventory. We can expect higher levels of volatility (VIX futures that is only 1 week dte trading at roughly 20% from current levels).

[Reaching critical trend line resistance. Consider QQQ to have a upside of +1&#37; from here at $370\~$371](https://preview.redd.it/2pp016pjbzc71.png?width=1546&format=png&auto=webp&s=3248a4a2286ac3add6b4a7351682104e2ff5a773)

EWT says we‚Äôre reaching the massive correction cycle. It's the same shit when it comes to tech earnings run-up followed by the dump in spite of a decent performance.

Uncertainty creates risk and risk drives fear so the fact that ER release (granted a beat) by the blue chips might not be large enough to justify current prices, or the possible sector rotation that may ensue post ER release, or the possible tapering discussion which may change the macro, or reaching the upper level resistance of a major trend line could scare smart money away from the equity market in the near term. Call it quad witching if you will.

**QQQ ETF weighting/ER Date:** 

* AAPL - 13.39%/July 28 
* MSFT - 10.76%/July 27 
* AMZN - 10.66%/July 28 
* FB - 4.26%/July 28 
* TSLA - 3.45%/July 26

**Study #1 Coca Cola, Chipotle & Dominos Pizza**

All of these boys had earnings this week.

Coca cola beat revenue by a BILLION. A billion. For reference, Coke makes 9 billion a quarter. Restaurants are booming. Inflation has not harmed as much as the media feared. (ex. Oh no big mac costs 30 dollars I won't eat out anymore)

CMG popped 8% on earnings then ran another 8%. Dominos did 14%. The pace of recovery is ***surprising*** wallstreet and stocks are responding. You know who directly benefits from booming sales? Payment processors. $SQ, $V, $PYPL

Square in particular has been punished for buying imaginary money with their own money. Long runway when they report unprecedented growth in their core business, CashApp and payment processing.

**Study #2 Snapchat & Twitter**

It is not surprising that when demand is robust, businesses are spending a ton to capture as much of that demand as possible. Snapchat announced today that they expect to grow 50% YOY. Fucking nuts. Tik Tok is also growing massively but they are not public. Twitter says their ad revenue is growing literally 7x in certain cities. You fucking know it that google and facebook have good news too. $ROKU and $TTD in particular is sitting way way below ATH. 

If my retarded ass can deduce this, you know big boys are already on it. 

Be ware that Fed speaks next week. Volatility should be expected.

Disclosure: Author is FOMOing bigly into earning calls tomorrow and typing this up to hype himself up.  This may be a portfolio eulogy. Going ham into 5~10% otm calls no more than 1 month to expiration. The larger the pre-earning run, the less likely author will hold calls into actual earning report.

**Upcoming earnings**

* Visa ($V) 7/27 - payment processing leeching 2% every transaction
* Google ($GOOGL) 7/27 - ad play
* Starbucks ($SBUX) 7/27 - recovery sales surprise

* Paypal ($PYPL) 7/28 - payment processer leech

Reviewing the top five economies and their case trends -------------------------

Source : Worldometers.info

USA:  new cases curving upward, especially in FL

China:  they lie about their numbers

Japan:  new cases increasing at a roughly linear rate

Germany: new cases growing again, though off of a low base

France:  new cases surging and strong in the numbers, curving up

UK:  new cases surged though showing signs of starting to drop

Keeping your elder family members safe from your infecting them is still a cultural truth.

One political party in a given country wants to make another fail.  One party will weaponize the virus and threaten the other to take action.  This is what leads to restrictions.  Before it was the Democrats shutting down businesses to make the economy worse for Republicans.  Now it is the same, but Repub states will shut down and Dem states will want to keep businesses open.  In another country similar games will play out.

So all the potential economic shut downs are still there.

What is different is that all the technology that was bought to have the kids educate from home, such as tablets and web cams and online meeting subscriptions don't need to be bought a second time so soon.  So the 2nd set of restrictions on the population comes without a sector that gets an economic boost.  The exception is grocery stores and online shopping.

The extra unemployment benefits end on Sept 6th in numerous states, but investors know that and would sell effected stocks sooner.  The moratorium on evictions ends this fall, and so tenants will stop the games and scramble to pay their landlords, taking away their spending money.  If they don't they will get an eviction on their credit record.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

Now to valuations

[https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe)

shows that the Schiller PE ratio of stocks is 38.3.  The .com bubble was the highest it ever got, higher than this level for 2.5 years, and getting to the mid 40's.  Other then that, at no time in history was this valuation ratio this high.

Note also that in 1982 at the peak of interest rates 13 to 14%, the average stock had a PE of 7 to 9.

A book by O'Shoughnessy ""What Works on Wall Street"" studied 40 years of stock market data.  Its results shows that a price to sales ratio is 'the king of value factors', since sales can't be manipulated like earnings can.

[https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales)

shows that this valuation is higher now than at any time charted.  The book suggests that a price to sales of 1.5 is considered a good deal.  We are over twice that level on average.

MSFT = 13.3 ; FB = 10.4 ; AAPL = 7.5 ; AMZN = 4.3 ; GOOG = 8.76 ; NVDA = 25.2 ; AMD = 9.5

These clearly can fall and still be overvalued.

Some have sighted the growth in the money supply, such as M2, as part of what has pushed the market higher.  However, it is important to note that M2 was recategorized in 2020.  So even though you can go to the Mises Institute's site and see articles of big increases in the M2 money supply, much of that is due to the recategorization and strangely the articles omit this but for a footnote.

Inflation ----------------------------------------------

A large part of what we pretend to understand about inflation is the CPI and PCE.

We think that we know that the last CPI reading was 5.4%.  That is above the target of 2% of course when action by the recipe is needed.  This coupled with Powell not wanting to raise rates and desiring to de-prioritize inflation is ""bad enough"" from a stock perspective.  Jim Cramer described Powell as ""having a heart"" in wanting to prioritize helping people back to work.  Recall that interest rates have to be jacked up in response to inflation eventually.  Acting to late makes it worse.  From business school texts, higher interest rates put downward pressure on the value of future earnings.  Thus the forward looking value of stocks drops.

  But I challenge all of you to take the CPI by its percentage components and REBUILD it yourself with online research.  I did.  While the published number was +1.6% year over year at the time, I found no component less than 2%, and most were a good deal higher.  It is easy to find information showing education expenses rising at a +5% annual rate for many years.  Medical costs I found web sites saying +4% annually consistantly over many years.  At the time, only oil was lower than 2% price growth.  Today, with oil back up above $70 a barrel, that is not to be taken lightly.

  Recently the Fed has emphasized the PCE, the Personal Consumption Expendatures index.  Do you find as I do it strange that they publish the 'this month vs last month' number, making it look like small 0.1 to 0.3% rise, and not the more useful year over year number, which would show a larger % increase?

  The National Debt takes no small part in the desire to have inflation be low and keep interest rates low.  But that combination is impossible over time.

  I have been at individual stock investing since 1996 and I have sold most of my stock holdings.  I lived through the .com crash which I took on the chin (with small dollars since I was young and I learned from it such that I was 66% in cash for the crash of 2008.  If you have not been in the habit of thinking about economic impacts, valuations, and questioning what real inflation is, it is certainly time to start.

  The great bull market of the 1980's in the USA was spurred by the acceleration of women entering the work force and the personal computer.  The great bull market of the 1990's was spurred by implementation of the internet, immigration, and foreign economies developing.

  What is the story now?  5G networking is just a faster version of the same thing, but only over shorter distances.  Artificial intelligence is intended to replace humans.  Electric vehicles only reduce pollution after 100k miles according to an article in the WSJ.  I think to move on to much higher valuations we need a big economic story that just isn't there right now."

I‚Äôm traditionally bullish but with the rotation out of meme stocks and back into SPY, there‚Äôs some fuckery afoot.. and this is on a global scale.

Unless your entire portfolio is FB / AMZN / NFLX / GOOGL / AAPL then you‚Äôve felt the pain of watching your portfolio get hammered -3% to -10% daily. I‚Äôm here to provide a slight glimmer of hope that is actually backed up by some fucking fact, take it or leave, I won‚Äôt kick you out of bed for eatin‚Äô crackers.

I don‚Äôt date chicks from China, because that‚Äôs a big red flag (get it?) but I am gonna fuck China and here‚Äôs why:

* **Inflation** ‚Äì say what you want, but it‚Äôs looming. And in theory papa Powell can just keep printing all day long and as long as the $$$ doesn‚Äôt physically leave the fed, then we‚Äôre okay, HOWEVER this leads me to #2
* **Student Loans** ‚Äì September 15th is right around the corner and our commander in queef has a decision to make‚Ä¶ either extend the current relief where no one is paying anything, forgive *some* or *all* student debt, or say fuck it time to start paying again
   *  **It‚Äôs a LOSE / LOSE / LOSE** situation for the market. Extend the relief and the discussion around inflation becomes an even more real thing. Forgive some or all‚Ä¶ all that money that‚Äôs been printed just flew out the fucking fed door faster than the dude I caught banging my wife‚Ä¶. Start paying again, all the ‚Äúsavings‚Äù people have in the market gets liquidated to start paying the student loans and #rugpull
   *  **Also** this announcement isn‚Äôt going to come on September 14th where ByeDon is going to surprise everyone and say, ‚Äúno student loans!‚Äù or ‚Äústart paying bucko‚Äù this announcement should come at the next fed meeting at the end of July or in August‚Ä¶ which will obviously immediately get priced in and impact the market

**How does this tie to China?** Good question

Because the U.S & Europe have pursued extraordinary monetary policy in the last 2 years (low interest rates / other to support economic growth), this has caused a rise in commodity prices; creating an ‚Äúimported inflation‚Äù issue for China.

I‚Äôll go even farther.

**CHINA** is the largest consumer in the world of Copper and Copper prices have hit a **20 year high** with no signs of slowing down. We haven‚Äôt seen these prices in 10 years. I anticipate copper prices to keep rising. Just look at the chart. So as the price rises, so do production costs.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v8hr7paqjlb71.png?width=942&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dd699fd6eec4f27ca8db3b8dfc421ffc820ac0a

Still not enough? Alright while the greenback is getting it‚Äôs dick kicked in by Yao Ming and the world shifts away from U.S. denominated assets; let‚Äôs take a look at China‚Äôs housing market

China is trying to contain this smoking hot property market without capping the prices of the houses, they‚Äôre just requiring people who want to buy houses to put down more of a down payment. Essentially just limiting the financing opportunities. This in turn will just drive the principal price of the house up. So now we‚Äôve got propped up housing prices, people who want the house need to put more down to buy said house‚Ä¶ where are they gonna get their savings? The same place I‚Äôm gonna go to access my savings when I have to eventually pay off my student loans‚Ä¶ the market.

**Okay, I‚Äôm interested‚Ä¶ but what stock do I play?** ***$FXI*** why? Because it‚Äôs the ETF that tracks the top 50 largest Chinese stocks in a single fund. It‚Äôs used to express a single country view‚Ä¶ similar to our good ‚Äòol friend SPY, but more representative of a country.

**TL;DR:** very real inflation threat triggered by student debt decision and rising commodity prices will impact the global markets; more so China due to them holding trillions of U.S. denominated foreign exchange assets and being the worlds largest consumer of copper. rising copper prices create rising production costs. couple that with red hot housing market and more $$ required for a down payment to buy housing, props up the housing price, creates a perfect storm in the Chinese market. 

**position & further proof:** I am long 100x FXI September $40 puts.

And at the beginning of this week - someone laid down a $500k spread on August $40 / $42p (22,500x each). I went out another month just to buy some more time and allows me to keep adding to the position if (when) I want to get bigger.

July 2nd was the first day on the list. That makes July 13 the 7th day on the list. They HAVE to cover some shorts on the 13th day on the list, WHICH IS TODAY.

I would honestly say this is the last day we see -%6.00 and lower and when we start seeing more and more green candles which will TAKE US TO THE STARS.

That's why people pay attention to insider buying.

If the insiders believe this is a bargain stock maybe you should consider buying it too?

Tom Lee believes that the S&P 500 index is expected to continue its upward momentum and may surge 9% to 4700 points by the end of the year.

Tom Lee said, ‚ÄúI think FAANG stocks will be out of yield, which means they will have a glorious second half of the year, not because interest rates will fall, but because these great companies have almost nothing in the first half of (2021). Performance. We believe that if the S&P 500 index rises 25% this year and many of these FAANG stocks rise 5%, then they may rise 20% in the second half of the year, which makes their rating become'overweight'.""

FAANG refers to the abbreviation of five large technology stocks, namely Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google's parent company Alphabet.

At the same time, Tom Lee said that core stocks related to the reopening of the economy will be in the best position and are expected to rise further. ""The core sectors (related to the new crown epidemic) will rebound strongly as they are most sensitive to rising interest rates,""

Among them, Tom Lee is most optimistic about energy stocks. He believes that under the circumstances of economic recovery and high demand, oil supply may shrink, which may cause oil prices to continue to rise.

After my SOFI TA yesterday I had a request for a TA of these tickers and their potential price movement in the near future. Specifically, a visualization and breakdown of stocks that seem to ""keep running.""

See [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi\_soft\_technical\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi_soft_technical_analysis/) for my SOFI technical analysis.

I am applying my strategy as a day trader to see what our long term resistance and support levels are. I'm simply a day trader of three years that has consistently used standard deviations, RVI, and volume on a 6month and 1year time frame to determine my buy/sell areas on stocks, no matter whether I am swing trading or trading intraday. My current trading accuracy is 81%.

\-Easy Breakdown of Statistical Standard deviations - 68% of a stock's price range is within 1 statistical standard deviation of it's average/regression trend (2 blue lines), 95% within two deviations (first upper and lower purple lines), and 99.7% within 3 deviations (upper and lower purple lines), known in stats as the 68-95-99.7 rule. These deviations also function, generally, as true support and resistance levels, with deviations, once crossed, becoming either the new resistance or new support level.

\-ZTS - Moving on news and hype since 3/8/2020. Here is the One Year and 6 Month Deviation Chart - [https://imgur.com/EBtv6RI](https://imgur.com/EBtv6RI)

ZTS has currently broken through all deviation resistance levels over the past 4-5 months however it is now at over +2 Deviations on both the One Year and 6 Month chart which indicates it is entering extremely overbought territory. Both + 2 Deviation Support Levels are $195. Should it crack through that soon, we should see prices back down to the +1 Deviation Support Level or $185. Now is not a good time to enter. The Stock has entered its selling phase and can easily crash a full deviation price swing in one day. Should it manage to continue upward, we could see prices around $205 (+3 Deviations) although this is unlikely.

\-FB - One Year and 6 Month Deviation Chart - [https://imgur.com/CiC0KHd](https://imgur.com/CiC0KHd)

FB has pretty much made it's long-term move for now. It was not able to break +1 Deviation Resistance around 355-358 on the 6 Month Chart. And its +1 Deviation Support on the 1 Year chart is $350, which it broke through pre-market. It is entering the selling phase and we should see prices back around the $321-328 Area, its long-term regression trend, before any deviation support helps to bounce it.

\-AMZN - One Year and 6 Month Deviation Chart - [https://imgur.com/VsKQbhS](https://imgur.com/VsKQbhS)

On Amazon's One year chart, it has tended to trend between +3 deviations, crash to -2 Deviations, then bounce, with most of the action happening between +1/-1 Deviations following the typical sine-wave like cyclical price pattern seen in many stocks. In the immediate future, it is, like FB, statistically overbought, hovering above +2 deviation support levels of $3500 and $3600 which it is likely to break soon and trend back to it's regression price of 3300-3350. Not the time to buy.

\-NVDA - One Year and 6 Month Deviation Chart - [https://imgur.com/HYsy5ne](https://imgur.com/HYsy5ne)

&#x200B;

It seems NVDA has finally completed its run up to +2 Deviation resistance on both charts, as you can see it bouncing off the 1st purple line this week. This indicates a bearish move to the downside after being extremely overbought the last 3 months. Our downside buy area would be between $665-678 and the immediate deviation support at +1 on both charts is $748-756 where it will likely try to hold trend before snapping down to it's regression trend line.

Hope these images help you all visualize price trends of these stocks. Good luck trading today!

1. Compare FB July 2012 through Mar 2013 to WISH Dec 2020 to Present?

Market insiders who drove enthusiasm through the hyped FB IPO and the run up of WISH after its IPO make it their business to punish early investors with eyes on short term gains. They make huge profits on IPO run ups followed by shorting the very same hyped stocks mercilessly.

2. Why is this important?

In the case of FB then and WISH now you see two stocks - one that got punished then and another that has gotten punished recently such their valuation levels made no sense. Both companies had post IPO had very little debt while experiencing rapid growth but their market cap dropped precipitously and in the case of WISH, to around 1.4 x sales.

When valuations get out of whack like that and losses on individual investors force them to sell out of their positions, big investors always jump in to take massive long term stakes in which they reap massive gains.

This then says to me that you should be patient in your investing. You could carefully invest using a number of strategies to make money without losing your position in a long term winner. Here are a few approaches:

a. Average in your largest buys around large institutional investor buys as seen on level II trades
b. Join the shorts with with PUT orders when algorithmic selling or manipulative downward price action is evident
c. Sell LEAP covered CALLs if they are profitable
d. Balance trading on margin to avoid margin calls

Over time all that matters is that your trading account and positions in it are funded and not vulnerable to margin calls. A good early investment will usually prove to be one within two years.

3. What does this mean: Contrast manipulation vs value?

First, understand that in the long run valuations matter. To get the best value an investor should pay the lowest price for a promising stock. When a stock price drops while the fundamentals of the company is improving like WISH who reported 76% YoY revenue growth but fell to $7.52 after hitting a $32.85 high you have to wonder why. Well a buyer at $32.85 now has the worst value given the stock is now worth $11.78. A buyer on the other hand who bought at $7.52 or near about like I did has the highest value especially knowing that the company‚Äôs revenue is significantly increasing.

Second, we as investors must learn to follow the money. Big buy orders that we have seen since the 52-week low of $7.52 has produced massive trading volume. Massive trading volume with increasing price per share and algorithm-based pullbacks are signs of extraordinary long term gains as seen in FB. And, if you go back to AAPL in roughly 2004 and 2005 you see similar price action and volume followed by the enormous gains that APPL has since produced.

Manipulation is to me disingenuous price increase or drops against valuation. At either end whether through hype or unfounded bashing the unsuspecting and inexperienced investor is bound to lose.

4. Why did I deem FB and WISH price drops as manipulation?

When a disruptive technology enters the market and is run up early only to reverse and drop over  50% and sometimes down 90% there to me is no other explanation that big investor pump and dump market manipulation. I do not claim this to be scientific analysis but rather common sense. To make one feel as though their initial investment was a bad one only to later reveal sometimes 200-fold gains is similarity someone telling you your winning lottery ticket was a loser. To me it should be criminal when big investors colluded with unscrupulous Law Firms who file fake lawsuits and post them all over every brokerage site or financial website and paid bashers are employed to drive down a stock price to encourage individual investors to sell their stakes at a loss as I believe is being done in the case of WISH."

WhatsApp Messenger - Blackberry Secure/ SecuSmart enabled for Enterprise.,888,194,2021-07-03 16:26:47,"Blackberry filed a lawsuit against Facebook for Patent Infringement. Technology in WhatsApp Messenger appearntly is Blackberry's tech and Facebook wasn't paying any licensing fees to Blackberry. Both parties settled out of count , Blackberry got a judgement against Facebook and a judge in Germany ordered a hault on WhatsApp use of BB technology which could have affected nearly 80 million users. 

Only the patent settlement Facebook and Blackberry reached out of court recently turned into a patent sale. With a large upfront payment and 7 years of IP licensing tail. 

John Chen CEO said in March that BB entered into patent sale negotiation with North America based tech co and can't disclose more. 

I strongly believe that BB and FB are negotiating not just patent sale but also a partnership agreement. Blackberry will secure WhatsApp Messenger for Enterprise. Blackberry gets free advertising on FB Instagram. 

Patent payout upfront 600 million plus 1.4 billion over seven years in IP licensing. 

Facebook wants to get in on the action and partner with Blackberry. After all it's Blackberry who invented the smart phone and the instant messenger. Judges, lawyers and political figures were using Secure Messenger BBM well before anyone else. They were first to market in smart phones and BBM

Mark Zuckerberg was living in the college dorm even Blackberry enterprise customers were already using BBM and it's only fair that Blackberry finally gets fair compensation for their innovative technology. 

John Chen when asked about the patent sale he said stay tuned. He meant there is very good news coming soon. Don't sell your shares. Hold"

Its valuation is lower than others in this space such as market darling The Trade Desk, while also growing faster.

Large growth prospects and a reasonable valuation, combined with a low absolute market cap, provide a recipe for a successful investment.

Buy potential multi-baggers while they‚Äôre small.



Investment Thesis

One of the core tenets of growth investing is a company‚Äôs relatively small market cap in light of a potentially large long-term opportunity. A small company with a differentiated technology or product in a large market could deliver supercharged returns if it keeps growing.
This may exactly be the case with PubMatic (PUBM). The company operates an adtech platform, has a reasonable valuation, is growing fast, and has the relatively small market cap that growth investors would look for.
I would contrast this stock with The Trade Desk (TTD). While they‚Äôre not exactly competitors, both operate in the adtech space. However, The Trade Desk has the opposite characteristics: while the company also reports respectable growth, it already has a much larger market cap and a high P/S valuation.
Put differently, though, the investment thesis is that potentially PubMatic could replicate on the sell-side of this market what The Trade Desk has accomplished (both as a business and as double digit-bagger on the stock market) on the buy-side.

Company overview

As indicated, PubMatic operates in the adtech space. The company provides a sell-side cloud infrastructure platform purpose-built for digital, real-time programmatic advertising. As such, the company should benefit from general ad spend growth as well as some of the higher-growth areas in this space such as programmatic CTV (connected TV). PubMatic also expects some acceleration tailwinds from the reopening.
In¬†succinct terms:

PubMatic has created a sell-side ad tech platform that leverages data-driven algorithms and tools to help content publishers and app developers maximize the value of their ad inventory.

The reasoning behind such an infrastructure-driven approach is that advertising is inherently data-intensive, and also real-time. Hence, PubMatic can deliver increased value (such as higher revenue for publishers and higher ROI for buyers), and also innovate faster, by controlling the full stack from hardware to software. This also results in a cost advantage.
The alternative approach is using public cloud infrastructure, which only allows for controlling the software stack.
PubMatic also claims it benefits from consolidation of ad budgets on fewer sell-side platforms, resulting in increased market share. This occurs through Supply Path Optimizations or SPOs. As evidence for this trend, PubMatic disclosed that revenue from those arrangements nearly doubled in Q1.

Lastly, to come back to the term ‚Äúsell-side‚Äù. This can be contrasted to The Trade Desk, which is a demand-side or buy-side platform. In simple terms, the buy-side are those who buy advertising inventory, while the sell-side are those who offer ad space, anywhere on the internet. As such, the thesis really is that PubMatic may become (both as company and as a stock) on the sell-side what The Trade Desk has become on the buy-side.

Q1 results

In Q1, PubMatic reported $43.6M revenue, up 54% YoY. In particular, mobile and omnichannel video grew 83%, and represented 63% of total revenue. CTV grew 55% QoQ. Gross margin also increased from 65% to 72% due to increased utilization. This signals a scalable business.
PubMatic‚Äôs accelerated growth over the last year is also evidenced by its increased TTM net retention, which has expanded from 112% to 130%, which is best-in-class for growth companies in general.

Guidance

PubMatic has guided for 33% growth for the year.
While this implies a slowdown, some part of it does seem like sandbagging or conservative guidance: as discussed, the net retention was 130% in Q1, and growth in mobile and video also grew markedly faster than the overall business.

Valuation

PubMatic‚Äôs valuation should be considered compelling. At the stock‚Äôs current ~$40 price, the forward P/S stands at ~10x, which is over 3x cheaper than The Trade Desk. Obviously, the bullish case would be that given that both operate in the same market, PubMatic could deliver similar growth as the former, which would result in both long-term stock and valuation expansion.
Although PubMatic certainly does not yet have same multi-year track record of elevated revenue growth yet as The Trade Desk, this stark difference in valuation arguably well offsets potential execution risks. At least in Q1, PubMatic was growing faster than The Trade Desk.

Risks

PubMatic‚Äôs growth has accelerated since COVID-19, and the company also expects continued tailwinds from the reopening, which should result in increased ad spend. However, a risk would be if growth would slow down to pre-pandemic levels; obviously, the best growth stocks, including The Trade Desk, are able to sustain elevated growth for years.
Another potential risk are some of the recent and ongoing changes in the ad space, including changes in Apple‚Äôs (AAPL) policy and the phasing out of third-party cookies. However, PubMatic reports that the majority of its revenue comes from different identifiers than those two. As such, PubMatic actually views this is a competitive advantage, similar to how The Trade Desk has been¬†boasting about¬†how the Open Internet will prevail over the walled gardens. PubMatic is in fact investing in a portfolio of alternative solutions to the third-party cookie, including The Trade Desk‚Äôs UID 2.0 as well as Google‚Äôs (GOOG) (GOOGL)¬†Privacy Sandbox¬†(which includes the contested FloC).

Note that The Trade Desk and PubMatic are not really competitors but rather partners, as The Trade Desk is a demand side platform. PubMatic says it is integrated with around 100 such platforms.
A last risk I found was that although PubMatic especially touts its infrastructure, the company nevertheless seems to get more mixed reviews (i.e. a lower rating than TTD). This could imply it still has some way to go to truly become best-in-class.

Primer on ads and cookies

This section serves for those who aren‚Äôt all too up-to-date on some of the terms used here.
As I would describe it, the core issues stem from privacy concerns regarding (third-party) cookies and tracking. This is leading to the phasing out of those cookies (now planned for 2023 by Chrome). However, this causes issues for the digital advertising market, which relies on targeted ads to increase their efficiency.
As such, alternative, supposedly more privacy-friendly, tracking solutions are being introduced. One of the most well-known is The Trade Desk‚Äôs UID 2.0. Google, for its part, is backing on a collection of a few dozen of APIs, which it calls Privacy Sandbox. One of those is the controversial ‚ÄúFloC‚Äù, even though it does (more or less) achieve its goal to provide privacy without sacrificing targeting accuracy.
Another point of dichotomy is regarding what some like to call the Open Internet vs. the walled gardens. The latter are the big ad platforms such as Google, Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN).
The gist is that those walled gardens have a privileged position given that they have an enormous amount of first-party data. Hence, they could survive the phasing out of third-party cookies quite unscathed.
Some claim, for example, that it is in Google's interest to phase out those cookies, which could put Google at a competitive advantage as others would lose the ability to serve targeted ads.
However, one might note that this dichotomy isn‚Äôt all that clear. For example, both Roku (ROKU) and Unity (U) (and likely plenty others) certainly wouldn‚Äôt be considered walled gardens among the likes of Google and Facebook. Nevertheless, both companies have said that given their own first-party data, they deem themselves to be quite unaffected by those changes in the ad landscape.
Lastly, given the observation that there are so many alternative tracking solutions being developed, which may or may not conserve privacy, ultimately there may be relatively little tangible changes in the ad landscape. As such, the bottom line may be that the recent rally by the likes of The Trade Desk (due to Google‚Äôs Privacy Sandbox delay) is overblown.

Investor Takeaway

PubMatic offers a compelling proposition, both with its full-stack technology as well as with accelerated business results. In general, the company operates in the growing digital advertising market, and by being at the forefront with its technology and innovation, seems to be well-positioned for market share growth as well.
The company has reported high growth, expanded margins, and a high 130% net retention in Q1. PubMatic is also capitalizing on the latest trends such as CTV, which grew 55% sequentially. While no stocks are risk-free, these are definitely signs that the company is able to capitalize on the growth opportunity in its adtech space.
Just as importantly, compared to other growth stocks I have covered, both the company‚Äôs market cap and P/S valuation are rather low for growth stocks. That implies the risk is reduced, while the potential upside could be significant.
Hence, bottom line is that PubMatic does not even have to exactly replicate The Trade Desk‚Äôs performance to deliver solid or even significant long-term investor returns. As I said about another small company a while ago,¬†Sumo Logic¬†(SUMO): buy potential multi-baggers while they‚Äôre small (and cheap)."

3) almost 80% of its revenues is from ads. Pharma companies will pay tons of money to get a chance to get the attention of these doctors. Most of the pharma companies have sales reps called medical science liaisons who travel geography to do this. $DOCS can help them do that virtually. It‚Äôs like Facebook for pharma companies.

4) major health care providers can use it as a recruitment tool. It‚Äôs like ziprecruiter in that sense

5) it‚Äôs already profitable and can fund it‚Äôs own operations. That is pretty amazing!

6) it sold 23 million shares in its IPO.Out of that a whole bunch are already lapped by institutional investors

7) pharma is a recession proof industry and this company is a great hedge against any form of volatility.

But lately it's been trending green and stocks that I hold are rising dramatically. Like AMD, FB, PLTR.

I have some cash that I want to deploy but I've been waiting for red days as everything slowly continues to rise (except AAPL unfortunately).

Anyone else feel the same? I just want some bad news.

FB and Twitter for manipulating us, and FB likely to loose major revenue due to Apples new privacy options, making it so FB can't track people like they used to on Apple devices, but unsure how Apple changes may affect Twitter.

KO(Coca-Cola) for many years of poisoning us and manipulating us emotionally through their commercials. My put is a bet for world consciousness rising up and throwing off the chains of manipulation by these types of companies.

Not only me but millions of people and huge names like **Shaquille o'Neal, Lebron James, and Arnold Schwarzenegger** since they are all shareholders in the company. The triple threat!!!

I will try in this DD to mention with few words the most important things you need to know and ill try to do it in a way that wont get you tired to read all the post till the end! Clean and simple for you. I share this DD only to show new investors the Deep Value and potential this play brings to the market and nothing else... *After all everyone should search and add his own DD on top*. Who wouldnt like to find $NFLIX early as an investor? Life changing stocks should be found early. Have fun and invest with your own risk to lose or earn! Also **important, not bagholding!**

Lets start the story with an

**Amazing All Star Management Team**:

The BeachBody team includes three former Disney senior executives ‚Äî **Staggs, Mayer, and Salil Mehta**, its chief financial officer. Other directors, officers, and strategic advisors include Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal, Peter Schlessel, Keith Horn, Sheila Stamps, Teresa Miles Walsh, and Martin Luther King III.Dont forget also Sue Collyns. No need to just mention that Staggs ([former Disney COO](https://variety.com/2016/biz/news/tom-staggs-disney-out-steps-down-bob-iger-1201745196/)) and Mayer (previously chairman of Disney‚Äôs Direct-to-Consumer and International and [briefly CEO of TikTok](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/tiktok-kevin-mayer-resigns-1234750556/)) who both serve as co-CEOs and co-chairs of the board are higly valued and insightfull people along with all the others. Also worth mentioning that in the board also joined a member of **GME** board. Lastly CEO of the company is **Carl Daikeler** who managed to raise a company from VHS tapes to a behemoth that has 22 years of presence without debt and clears above 1+ billion in revenues. All star team with all star celebrities along their side each one valuable for their guidance. I will put some links from Shaqs and Arnold twitter along with Ross Gerber twitter who is bullish from Day 1 like he was in Tesla with their support in the company and the well respected Meet Kevin who is well known in Investing community.

**Lets continue with what exactly $BODY brings to the market**:

Well $BODY was a 3 way merger means you have BeachBody, Openfit and Myx Fitness all together.

**BeachBody on Demand Interactive (BODi)**

BeachBody, historically known for their workout DVD‚Äôs and many famous programs (P90x, Insanity, 21 Day Fix, etc), successfully made the transition to streaming On Demand. They are taking it a step further with the addition of BODi, live virtual classes. This additional feature is priced at $20/month on top of BOD which is currently $99/year. (Remember 89% margins on digital subscription revenue). Link to that article [here.](https://tbc-cms-prod-assets.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tbc-cms/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/19060123/BODi-Press-Release.pdf)

**OpenFit PartnerShips**

OpenFit (backed by Lebron & Arnold) recently announced a partnership with Concierge Health, a technology platform that provides health engagement solutions to reduce healthcare costs. Concierge Health has a user base of 150M People, which will now have access to OpenFit and receive credit for completing workouts through the app. (Again, 89% margins) Link to that article [here.](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210609005208/en/Openfit-and-Concierge-Health-Announce-At-Home-Exercise-Incentives)

OpenFit also has a partnership with LA Fitness over 700 physical locations , giving all of their gym members access to the app for $5/month. Link [here.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fitness-international-to-provide-its-members-with-openfit-the-all-in-one-digital-fitness-nutrition-and-wellness-platform-301277399.html)

**Myx Fitness**

A simple google search will show that MYX has the cheapest bike among competitors. Cheaper is obviously not always better, as a lot of times quality will suffer.But in our situation it seems that it is cheaper and better in quality than most of the competition. I have seen mostly good reviews and comments on social media about MYX bikes. The most negativity I've seen were complaints about shipping times, but also that customer service has been very responsive about this issue. A simple search will show you many people that dumped their old bike even it was more expensive for the Myx one. Interestingly, Myx has sold over 27,000 bikes in their first year of sales with the average user completing 15 workouts a month. The attractive pricepoint of their bikes at $1,299 is $600 cheaper than peloton‚Äôs basic bike.

**Nutrition (thats a big one) Shakeology**

Shakeology is a superfood nutrition shake that can be a spark that prompts positive change in your life. They‚Äôve also recently acquired Ladder in 2020, ‚Äúthe sports nutrition company founded by LeBron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Ladder product is NSF Certified for Sport¬Æ, a third-party certification trusted by all major sports governing bodies and verifies that products do not contain any of approximately 270+ substances banned by major athletic organizations and that the contents of the product match what is printed on the label‚Äù

You can do a research on all of these on the official websites for more info.

Lets continue with

**Quick Financial Overview:** 1.1B (est) revenue for 2021, 68% gross margins on that rev (which is better than NFLX, DIS, PTON, etc). Digital subscriptions have 89% margins. 43% YoY revenue increase for Q1. Added literally a million subscribers YoY. 400M free cash on the books upon merger w/ no debt. Also expanding to 10+ countries globally in the future starting with Spanish and French from now. Growth company and also tech company as you will see below in the post. Beach body already has more than 3.3 + **MILLION** paid digital subscribers. We will talk about subscribers, coaches and followers below. All in all, this is a financially solid company with plans for growth and expansion (in an industry that is expected to have a CAGR of 33% by 2027, $59B) which happens to have a few meme-like qualities and dont forget **NO DEBT.**

**2021 Q1 Financials**

Total Revenue: $243M - 43% increase YoY

Total Subscriptions: 3.2M - 39% increase (record high)

(Not an actual earnings report, assumed to be released after merger)

**Q2** mentioned on interview will be even better.

**Future Plans & News**

Here‚Äôs where they‚Äôre really making moves. Carl Daikeler (CEO of BB) and BeachBody has been operating on free cash flow and has been profitable for 20 years. Upon this deal closing, they‚Äôll have what they referred to as a ‚Äúwar chest‚Äù of $400M free cash (with no debt) on the books for M&A, marketing, and expansion.

**International Expansion**

The team has recently stated plans of expanding worldwide to 10+ countries in the near future.

**THATS IMPORTANT**. Lets make a break from facts and discuss numbers of followers and subscribers.

If you check company's website and social media and put all the followers together you will see that they have millions of followers, almost 3.4 million paid subs, thousands of coaches that each one have thousands of followers so again millions of people. Celebrities backing this one Lebron, Shaq, and Arnold together have 70 !!!! million followers only on Twitter, on Instagram they have over 100 million!!!!. Insiders have also thousands of followers, so here its good to say we speak about literally an army of people. **A cult that loves Beachbody.**

Important also is that Carl is a so well organized CEO that knows that BB has thousands of followers so as he mentioned lots of times he has well organized groups and teams in order to connect with each other, in order not to exist many groups on FB or any other social scattered all these people are well organized and managing thousands and millions of people, subs and coaches to connect each other.

Lets talk about

**Tech in Fitness**

Anytime you throw tech into an industry or sector, it instantly becomes more attractive. This is exactly what BB, MYX, and OpenFit are doing. 2020 saw a serious surge of fitness apps being downloaded. OpenFit has good ratings on the app store, 4.9 stars from 15k reviews. (App is also backed by Arnold and Lebron) People like the idea of being connected in their workouts, giving them the ability to compete with friends and strangers alike. There is a YouTube account called Garage Gym Reviews, this guy makes a living reviewing equipment and how that equipment will fit in your garage gym. He recently reviewed Tonal, and spoke on how tech connected fitness will be a huge market going forward. Some people will obviously not be able to afford to build a garage gym, or $3k Tonal, or an expensive exercise bike. This is where a $99/year BB subscription could come in.

What about???

**Future of At-Home Connected Fitness**

Why would people continue to workout from home after the pandemic is completely over? This is a valid question, but I fully believe people will continue to do so. A study conducted by Wakefield Research in July 2020 concluded that 87% (of 1000 participants) who plan to return to the gym say they will continue to work out at home at least some of the time. Links to those are [here](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200817005351/en/The-Future-of-Fitness-Americans-Embrace-a-Hybrid-of-Home-Exercise-and-Gym-Workouts) and [here](https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/blog/home-workouts-future-of-fitness). A survey of 3500 American by *The New Consumer* and Coefficient Capital found that 76% of people have tried working out at home during the pandemic‚Äîand crucially, 66% prefer it. Among millennials, the number is even higher: 82% made the switch and 81% like it more. Link to article [here](https://www.fastcompany.com/90587575/gyms-arent-coming-back-heres-how-youll-work-out-in-the-future).

Say the truth who prefers working at his own pace with his own music and great programmes instead of being next to people especially after pandemic waiting for his turn on the bikes.

Lets see if there is any

**Bear Case**

None. Only thing bears came in mind was something about MLM scheme but i wont discuss it since Kevin and Carl answered already on all their interviews *(Kevin Mayer and Carl Daikeler last interview on Fireside Chat : This is social commerce not MLM company , with influencers and no inventory on them. None intermediators , not MLM model at all.)* plus i wont mention MLM companies that their stocks are 50-100 pps because bears are getting nervous. *(HLF, NUS, PRI)*

Finally most important

**PAY ATTENTION TO THE Short Squeeze (summer lemonade) POTENTIAL**

**Check this image**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[8.8&#37; only public shares!](https://preview.redd.it/unkrgq17gh771.png?width=362&format=png&auto=webp&s=6849de07ad327d6a808d1f44d4fc55147312d165)

&#x200B;

Monday $BODY will have less than 30 milly shares available (around 22-25) for shareholders that makes it a very low float stock. Already buying pressure from retail is obvious. Already many tutes have positions with big names among them **74 total tutes, 65 long only**, 1 short only, 8 long/short with a total of 9 million shares already. As of 15/6 Short float was **20% !!!! in an already low floater**. Check this tweet for proof

[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1404894383728730112](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1404894383728730112)

Add all of the above to the equation and lets see...

The stock already hit 18+ back in February and since then shorts attacked it for several months creating 20% short float on a proven highly profitable growth company and dropping over 50% of its value. Now shares remaining are very low because **most float is locked**. Shorts need aprox. 8 days to cover and they getting trapped more and more every day and while trying to bash the stock everywhere in order to drop the price and get out since the dont have the shares to fight back the pressure. If everyone wants a little piece of this pie as it seems public float will be all locked fast and then ...

Dont forget Monday $BODY rings the bell and will attract more investors and retail plus all the cult behind this company as we mentioned above. This can creat a massive squeeze with shorts covering.

**IMPORTANT-->** Retail shareholders have high conviction and not selling shares, Carl already told that he wont sell even 1 share of his 41%, same applies for the insiders lots of them forgot to mention are unknown **Silicon Valley** investors. If they not selling, I‚Äôm not selling.

**More MEMEish features**

&#x200B;

* $BODY ticker (hard to ignore) [This](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/01/stock-picking-buying-a-winner-is-easy-just-find-a-cool-ticker-symbol.html) article details a study that concluded that companies with cool tickers tend to outperform the market better than companies without. Its summer anyways right?
* Comparison to PTON
* Arnold, Lebron, and Shaq are all confirmed shareholders. Collectively, they have 128.7M followers on IG alone. You can imagine what will happen if they start being vocal about their involvement in the company. Dont forget anything big Diesel touch along with the others turns to **gold**, no need to mention other tickers we all know. Who goes against these guys? Everyone loves them.
* Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs, both former Disney execs, will be staying on the BeachBody team to help with future growth, post-merge. Kevin Mayer played a large role in the success of Disney+, also former TikTok CEO
* 1+ billion revenue that Carl on interview said that we should add one or two zeros in the future on that **without DEBT** at all and with 400m on chest for marketing and promotion.

I dont want to post links to interviews and websites since we all know to google and search. All are available in youtube and www and i dont want to make this thread longer. **The only thing i will say is this DD thread was to put your attention on this company that as CEO mentions along with all shareholders, insiders and celebrities is the Biggest leading subscription Health and Wellness company offering Tech and Nutrition for the masses in the market. Its the PTON for 99% and the Netflix of digital fitness , all words from the all star team proven to turn into gold everything the worked with.**

Some people say $BODY to 0, 5, 20, 30, 50, 100 i wont post or mention any pt but with so low float and so big Short float **everything is doable with volume**. Share thoughts share anything like i shared mine , and also i have to share my memeish feeling of the stock since day 1. Somewhere my eye caught a quote i liked - its better to be in a Meme before it becomes one (unknown - 2021)! First time such an all star team behind the wheel with so many followers behind them thats the fact. Shorts already seems to be in trouble into my eyes. **DEEP VALUE** my fellow apes rangers Ogs whatever you like. Everyone likes the stock it seems in social and you know the power of social media from Kitty.

**Tip---> No pumpers (yet) on $BODY its a pure fundamental - growth - behemoth of a company that offers huge potential to investors in early stages. They target triple digits and they are capable of as a team.**

**Small Update : $BODY rang the bell this Monday 28/6.** But received many messages from people they couldnt find it to buy , thats because most brokers had issues since late at closing bell. From today 29/6 all will work fine. Despite all these issues on first day (that screwed some of the retail) $BODY opened strong and remained strong all day although more shorts piled in and raised SI more! (volume before price) As of today many brokers like IB have no shares available to short!!! Lastly i want to thank you for the feedback on the DD i really appreciate it, and the messages i got especially from people that know $BODY from inside!

Palantir was created for a world that didn't exist yet. A world where information and data would become so large no human workforce could ever be able to manage it effectively let alone, extrapolate insight from. So what's data do? It either sits there, or becomes a parasite on you for companies like google and facebook to target your dollars in the form of user specific ads. This way of utilizing data is indeed parasitic, and Palantir rejects this use of data in everyway possible.

But what if data wasn't used to fuck over your own customers, but instead used to help save them money and resources. Perhaps their lives? Restore supply chains, accelerate cancer research, and help restore the world to (somewhat) normalcy post pandemic. The sophisticated tools required to manage this type of data would have been inconceivable. No one predicated this kind of disjunction. Well. maybe some, but no company that would sacrifice half their revenue in R & D to solve problems of this magnitude they may or may not come to fruition. No one. Except 1 company. Valued at less than 1 billion back in 2010, then up to 9 billion in 2013 and 20 billion in 2015. And as high as 41 billion right before becoming public. Palantir 40x in 10 years is impressive, but its total addressable market would suggest a runaway so large and growing so fast that those returns are far from over. 

How big is this market? Well. Looking at the S-1 Filings it's estimated to be 119 billion. This is broken down into 63 billion in government and 56 billion in commercial. This is less than a fucking percent. How fast is it expanding? Well the S-1 is old news in my opinion of the ""macrotrend"" that Alex Karp says is happening.  

This comes from COO Shyam Sankar himself...

 ""And -- and with our investments in the end-to-end, sensor-to-shooter workflows from space to mud, we're not just going after the roughly $60 billion of government IT spend anymore, we're talking about the quarter-trillion dollars of U.S. DOD weapons system spend in 2020.""

This is fucking huge. And is completely overfucking looked. Everyone is still looking at the S1 filings about PLTR's TAM and its just wrong, it's so far much more now. This is why perhaps that government revenue is actually picking up at a more rapid pace despite it being their main customer base to this date. Government revenue grew at 68% YoY in Q3 2020 and in Q1 2021 it was 72 percent (With US revenue at 83%).

All-in-all I believe that a price to sales ratio of 40 is completely justified. This TAM is most definitely expanding into the commercial space as well. As IBM pointed out, 90% of all data has been generated in the last 2 years alone. This means that the data is growing faster then people can analyze it. This is where software like Palantir will be crucial in the future. What we're seeing with covid is all but just 1 example of how Palantir has been preparing for a future of disjunction. Palantir's investments only exacerbates  the obviousness of the problem the large amounts of disperse data creates. They're putting their money where their mouth is by not only putting half of their revenue into R&D  (561 Million, up 100% from 2018)  but taking whatever's left over into data-intensive business startups that utilize Palantir software. These actions of SPAC investments are probably more or less on Peter Thiel's part considering he's created the Founder's Fund and has a track record of picking innovative companies. This doesn't suggest that Palantir is slowing down and that Palantir simply doesn't know where to put their money, but they're more or less trying to plant seeds in industries and sectors that they are wanting to penetrate. Not only could they see significant returns that startups that succeed bring about, but also an increase in reputation and a testament of Palantir's usefulness in that sector. They want to make examples like BP saving 50 million in the first 2 weeks to potentially a billion a year off using Palantir's software become the Rule and not the Exception to the Rule. Palantir's usefulness is not 'niche' but can be applied across any sector.

I don't want to consider this DD as I barely did any research that I'm sure most of you guys didn't already know. My main point here is the counter argument to Palantir's valuation. And the skepticism surrounding its potential slow down in the future. In my opinion, Palantir and their competitors aren't growing as fast as the TAM and that's why I don't expect to see revenue both on commercial or government to grow slower than 45% in a couple years when the entire commercial sector will start to generate so much data that they'll have to switch to something new then their own built in piece by piece enterprise software that simply just doesn't work. This is the reoccurring problem Palantir has on it's sales side. It's not other software enterprise companies that they mainly compete with, but their own customers that try to build their own systems.  If they can get this much revenue from less than 200 customers (not to mention that the top 20 customers continue to pay 30%+ more for their subscriptions on a YoY basis) then any fear of a slowdown should not be on your mind when deciding whether or not to purchase Palantir stock. 

My main concern for Palantir is ironically how much cash it has. I say ironic because Peter Thiel ripped in Googles cash hoard saying they aren't innovative enough to know how to use their 50 billion cash hoard. Now Palantir only has 2.3 billion cash but there market cap is much smaller than Googles back in 2012 when their massive cash hoard was addressed. (50 billion Vs Googles 270 billion). Now this cash hoard isn't nearly as severe and a drag as google's through the forces of inflation but it does pose some headwind if they cannot utilize it in innovative ways. Now Palantir has invested in 4 additional SPACs that I'm aware of since their ER (Perhaps 5, Idk if the ""partnership"" with Primer includes a PIPE investment) and perhaps we may actually see a decrease next quarter on their cash on hand which I'm not opposed to, as long as its being reinvested in some way.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Palantir may be a multibillion dollar company but the the billions of dollars spent on R&D are just now beginning to pay off as the macrotrends are beginning to point closer and closer to companies like Palantir to be the next solution to the next problems that will plague the world in the not too distant future.

""In June 2007, Szulczewski transferred to Google‚Äôs new office in South Korea and got a lesson in tech outside the Silicon Valley bubble. Koreans preferred search portals that were busy and crowded with information over clean, minimalist home pages like Google‚Äôs. Former Google colleague Mark Rabkin remembers debating the point with Szulczewski when he visited. ‚ÄúI could tell he was starting to think like a local,‚Äù says Rabkin, who‚Äôs now an ad executive at Facebook. The experience would help shape Szulczewski‚Äôs strategy for Wish: He learned to focus on building something people wanted rather than what Silicon Valley thought they should want.""  


Does WISH sell shitty products?  


""Wish‚Äôs open-door policy meant that sales were taking off, but so were quality-control problems‚Äîwhich is somewhat inevitable when you have one million registered merchants, of whom 125,000 are active on Wish each month. By way of context, Amazon hosts an estimated 2.5 million active third-party merchants, while Walmart has roughly 21,000, according to Marketplace Pulse, a New York-based e-commerce intelligence firm.¬† 

To tackle this, Wish automatically culls about 8 million products over a week, or close to 3% of all products available on the site. Most are cut because visitors have scrolled past an item at least 1,000 times and haven‚Äôt tapped on it once. Wish also culls products from merchants who‚Äôve received bad reviews or put up fake reviews. To automatically detect the fakes, Wish‚Äôs engineers trained its software on reviews that were obviously made up. One example: ‚ÄúDid not expect so soon, the owner of service enthusiasm.‚Äù Now the software can identify reviews with similar nonsensical phrases.

Szulczewski seems unfazed by the quality-control challenge, pointing out that sometimes customers themselves are the problems.""We sell 5 million contact lenses a year. Someone's going to sleep in them.""Overall, there is a set of roughly 60 rules. If Wish‚Äôs algorithms see that a merchant has listed counterfeit products or shipped an order with a fake tracking number, they‚Äôll be ‚Äúfined‚Äù $500. Shipping a package with no product spells a potential $10,000 fine. Wish collects around $3 million a month in fines, and it can do that by simply withholding payments from merchants, says Szulczewski. Merchants can also get kicked off the platform, he adds. On the flip side, good reviews can lead to faster payments or a higher ranking in search.¬†

Zhang, who is 6,000 miles away, overseeing operations in three locations in China with 150 staff members, is just as paranoid about being gamed. ‚ÄúMerchants definitely care about making money first,‚Äù Zhang says. The rules and monitoring software don‚Äôt always go down well. ‚ÄúThe merchants look at Wish‚Äôs platform as very robotic,‚Äù he says, meaning there‚Äôs no way for merchants to negotiate a better deal by cultivating personal relationships with Wish staff.

¬†‚ÄúIt‚Äôll never be perfect,‚Äù admits Tung, the GGV investor. ‚ÄúYou get what you pay for.‚Äù But Szulczewski paints a rosier picture. The flywheel of customer data going into Wish will mean more reviews, smarter targeting software and, eventually, better-quality items. Those unbranded smartphones will get better every year, he says, ‚Äújust like our iPhones.‚Äù¬†

**Trade Ideas for CRSR**

* **Beginners**

* Purchase shares and set limit order to sell at a favorable price target. See above for analyst and insider price targets.

* **Advanced**

* Purchase as many round lot shares as you deem if stock price is under $35 or average in if more conservative
* When the stock rallies, sell covered calls at a strike above your cost basis and wait for Eagle Tree to unload shares to take profits. If Eagle Tree does not unload shares and your calls are ITM at expiration, then enjoy your profits and buy back on the next dip
* When the stock sells off, sell naked puts or put credit spreads and take profits on rallies
* Track chart and check moving averages for entries and exits
* Rinse and repeat until CRSR establishes support in the 40-50 range. Once this occurs, re-evaluate position
* Consider taking profits on half or all your shares if you see a more favorable exit during larger rallies  

**My Current Position**

* 200 shares @ 28.49 average cost basis
* 5 Put Credit Spreads for 7/16/21 32.5/27.5 for $1.65 average premium

The parent company of Soho House which contains the Soho House worldwide clubs, Soho Works (read below), Electric Cinemas (these make AMC ones look like fun schoolgirl projects) their own furniture brand Soho Home, and glassware brand Barwell, in addition to offshoot clubs like The Ned in London‚Äôs Square Mile and Scorpios in Mykonos is headed to IPO on the NYSE under the ticker $MCG for a valuation of between $2b to $4b 

Some quick facts:

- The IPO will be overseen by JPM and Goldman

- But ‚ÄòWTF is soho house you retard?‚Äô I hear you ask: They are an exclusive members club for those working in the creative sector (but who also tend to be trust fund kids, bankers masking as art philanthropists - your average blue-armpit-hair Marxist artist isn‚Äôt paying $18 a cocktail but they‚Äôre always packed and getting a rooftop seat in London or New York is near impossible atm

- Their F&B margins are insane 

- Kim Kardashian has been rejected a membership over a dozen times

- haven‚Äôt turned a profit due to aggressive Goldman-backed expansion (see below): this year alone there will be openings in Rome, Tel Aviv, Brighton, Paris and London‚Äôs Strand just opened.

- they have recently made an incredible shift towards turning the membership into a digital socialising network for their members with 7-figure investments into their app alone that has clubhouse like features, noticeboards, video chat, and frankly a more useful social tool than boomer Facebook and other cancerous ‚Äòsocial‚Äô media apps: the idea being that since the members are all vetted (you need a proposer and a seconder to be granted membership) they are much more likely to reach out and socially engage with one a other 

- they have a WeWork competitor called Soho Works which is frankly nicer, cooler and more of a social status catch for trust fund kids working on their ‚Äòstartup‚Äô  than prime retard masayoshi son‚Äôs loss porn brand WeWork

- the principle holders are billionaire Ron Burkle, the founder Nick Jones, and British entrepreneur and CEO of caprice holdings, Richard Caring.

- Goldman Sachs is placing a big bet on the growth of Soho House, with a $770m (¬£560m) loan to further allow for aggressive expansion 

- it‚Äôs so private your wife can meet all her boyfriends there and since photography is prohibited you can still hold your head high in your community 

- Profits at Soho House soared 23% to ¬£31.7m in 2016 revenues up by a similar margin to ¬£273.6m.

- Turnover jumped again in the first half of 2017 by 28%, buoyed by new openings

- They made ¬£293 million (approximately $411 million) in revenues in 2019, about half of which originated from food and drink revenues and 20 percent from recurring payments by members. The rest originated from housewares.

- it‚Äôs very pandemic/crisis proof because of being able to draw down on waitlists, according to the FT: ‚ÄúSoho House has been able to continue its aggressive expansion through a mixture of cost cuts, fundraising and incoming membership fees.

‚ÄúOur membership model is pretty robust through a serious crisis,‚Äù said Mr Jones, who reckoned that the lengthy wait to become a member ‚Äî up to 18 months in some cases ‚Äî put people off cancelling.‚Äù

He also told CITY A.M.; ‚Äòif the business needed more money post-pandemic, it would let in its ‚Äúhuge‚Äù waiting list of 50,000 people.‚Äô

Opening Point
Wish is one of the most under appreciated assets in all of commerce. ‚ÄúWish,‚Äù which has almost every unique, weird, and exciting thing to offer. It has a unique feel to it. Similar to Ebay Vs Amazon. Wish allows you to buy UNIQUE items for a discounted price. I think that the product quality, and delivery time will become better for the consumer over the next 12 months based on recent hires, and partnerships. Wish has a decentralized and asset light approach.  Wish is BARELY a household name yet! 

YOU can sell your products in no time on WISH following a general form and business verification.

1)Wish has a data advantage over its piers. 2)Discovery platforms are hard to design. 
3)Wish has over 100M active users. 
4) 70% of sales don‚Äôt involve a search query 
5) 90% of purchases originate from mobile app. 
6) Merchants gain instant access to 100M+ consumers 
7) Wish Local (local brick and mortar stores are pickup locations for wish products. This is part of their asset light approach. 
8) Wish local gaining transaction. It‚Äôs an extra revenue steam for businesses. 
9) Wish product boost helps promote the product. (Similar to Tinder boost, or bumble boosts you horny fucks)
10) Data, and unique user base is why wish is a great acquisition target

Notable Owners

Peter Thiel owns over 1B in $Wish shares. He is co-founder of PayPal, Palantir, and Founders Fund where he was the first outside investor in Facebook. 

The Downside 
Wish relies on 90% of its sellers coming from China. This becomes a logistical nightmare. Long delivery times and product quality give Wish consumers headaches. 

Closing thoughts. POTENTIAL
IF they address these issues AND diversify the countries their sellers are from (Latin America, Africa, Europe, USA) etc this company looks like it has ALL the potential in the world. It could potentially allow you to sell to the American consumer while being from any country in the world."

>*API*

**Industry attractiveness**

\- RTE adoptions among Twitter, Spotify, Facebook

\- Unverified rumors - Greenroom (Spotify) is built using API

**Market bears misconceptions** 

\- tying API to Clubhouse (Clubhouse sign up has slowed down drastically)

\- tying API to the Chinese Education sector (going through regulation reform, 35% revenue in danger)

**Competitive Dynamics**

\- RTE (Agora business) doesn't use CDN which could provide better communication when networks/sites are down. The problem surfaced during recent Airline & bank websites went down due to major internet failure. Brad Altfest (Agora Director of BD posted a message around how Agora can help bank and airline prevent such risks in the future)

\- Agora's new App Builder - zero coding and suitable for firms looking to have their own branded Zoom Calls.

**Key developments**

\- New partnership with HP. Felt like an early version of ROKU when it first partnered with TV manufactures

\- [Symbl.ai](https://Symbl.ai) can transcript [Agora.io](https://Agora.io) stream into transcripts. A live demo code can be found here

[https://github.com/symblai/symbl-agora-demo-app](https://github.com/symblai/symbl-agora-demo-app)

\- Acquisition of Netless - The White-SDK from Netless is a cross-platform, real-time, interactive whiteboard solution. 

\- partnership with HTC for VIVE to accelerate the adoption of VR innovation in real-time engagement

The market is focusing on what Agora is doing now (Education, clubhouse), I felt maybe it's time to move in and focus on the next round - ROKU-like strategy and invading the mission-critical operations now relying on the internets."

\- Since before the first ape, our fates have been inextricably linked with our poop, and it's about time for a breakthrough in poop technology.  
\- There's a popular saying with holistic medicine types, 'food is medicine'. Food becomes poop. Ergo, [poop is medicine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEQREIDUJ88).  
\- Our poop is entering a new age of technological progress and Seres Therapeutics ($MCRB) is the clear leader in the multi-billion dollar opportunity of poop-based medicine, with catalyzing data coming in the next few weeks. The McRib is back in a big way.

Smart apes also use tools. Having capitalized on their first milestone, [taking 35k to 270k in options](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o2rgii/35k_to_270k_betting_on_literal_poop_in_2020_round/), this formerly broke as shit ape used modern statistical methods to construct conservative quantitative risk models for the next phase of development in poop technology, with the results validating continuing to go full ape mode YOLO on MCRB.  
MCRB is overwhelmingly likely to double to previous highs on new data in a pivotal breakthrough indication (ulcerative colitis), with further long term growth potential in oncology, inflammation, immunity, and more. They are also having an investor day presentation today [here](https://ir.serestherapeutics.com/events/event-details/seres-therapeutics-investor-event).

**Abstract**  
Seres Therapeutics ($MCRB) is a Cathie Wood Approved‚Ñ¢ microbiome therapeutics platform company developing a novel class of biological drugs. Their therapy for SER-109 in persistent bacterial GI infection (C. Diff) is nearing approval after a successful Phase 3, demonstrating that the company can deliver on less complicated applications for the technology and has the process and manufacturing to address more lucrative indications. Phase 2 of clinical trials is a pivotal de-risking milestone and is typically where most of the value of a clinical stage asset is realized. The upcoming readout for SER-287 in ulcerative colitis (UC) represents a substantial growth opportunity for MCRB, more than doubling the potential addressable market size. Published disease response rates were evaluated to construct a quantitative risk model in [PYMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/about.html), which shows a very high likelihood (\~88%) of positive results under stringent assumptions. Prior readout timelines and public statements about results ‚Äúmid-year‚Äù point to announcement in July, gapping share price to ATH (\~38$). The hype cycle may have come and gone on the microbiome field \~2015, but the addressable markets are just getting ready for the disruption and Seres will lead the pack.

**Significance/Innovation**  
If you don't think poop is an opportunity for cutting-edge health care technology, all it takes is constant bleeding out of your asshole to change that perspective. Chron's and Ulcerative colitis are miserable chronic illnesses, and apes are already paying out the ass for approved drugs with unreliable effectiveness. Modifying the gut microbiome is a highly effective 'black box' approach that has had a lot of development in basic, animal, and translational research. Changing gut microbial composition affects multiple disease pathways in a manner superior to current targeted drugs for complex pathologies. In the MCRB trial, 3 groups of 67 patients (Placebo, low dose, high dose) with mild/moderate UC failing standard of care (5-ASA, a non steroidal anti-inflammatory) were treated for 10 weeks and evaluated by endoscopy for response and remission. Placebo and drug effect sizes can be reliably modeled using available data, so risk of failure is well defined, and the company has been consistent on readout timelines of 7-9 weeks after completion.

**The computer says 'YOLO'**  
To model trial success and failure probabilities in PyMC3, I reviewed published recurrence rates in randomized, controlled clinical trials of mild-moderate UC and estimated population means and 95% confidence intervals. For placebo, I used recent trials from a meta-analysis paper [(Jairath 2017)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6483671/), Mean: 88%, 95% CI: 91%-85%. FMT trials are much less consistent in treatment and design further demonstrating need for standardized, approved therapy, so I used a conservative estimate from several studies notably [Costello 2019](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2720727?resultClick=1), M: 73%, CI: 70%-76%. Treated recurrence was taken from prior Phase I SER-287 trial and placebo meta-analysis CI, M: 60%, CI: 57%-63% ([Henn 2021](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7402096/)). These estimates were used to model distribution of patient-level treatment effect for the 67 Placebo and High Dose patients. PYMC3 was used to model the recurrence rate as binomial distributions, individual treated patient Bernoulli trials were further challenged by mixing at a 0.8 probability with 0.1 placebo response and 0.1 FMT recurrence rates.  
After patient-level draws are made for each iteration of the trial simulation, I then address the possibility that the treatment effect is statistically valid (p<0.05), but still marginal enough that analysts shit on it and we don't get our moon mission.  I do this by imposing an additional hurdle of >10% group difference in recurrence to qualify as a pass (e.g., if placebo recurrence is 60/67 (\~90%), treated group must be 53/67 or less to qualify). After hitting the magic inference button a few times and tuning the sampler hyper-parameters, a few key posterior predictions/probability density functions are: mixed patient-level recurrence probability (failure, UC flares up again within 10 weeks, a), total recurrences at the Treated Group level (b), and empirical trial failure probability after applying the 10% cut-off for difference in % remission (c).

https://preview.redd.it/eyyhxwq5zl671.png?width=4989&format=png&auto=webp&s=b146f52c8076f05afc853310e0b714fb6ef375ef

**Business logic**  
Assessing risk also involves understanding the non-public information and decision making behind the scenes. Interim/partial data analysis is standard practice for clinical trials, how a company uses this early evaluation of at the data is highly informative. This part is also a bit of Bayesian logic, but this time we're doing it in our heads. Previously, Seres Therapeutics demonstrated that they will use an early stopping option to discontinue trials that are not likely to succeed (ECOSPOR II), saving them time, money, and effort. They've also never blown their load by publishing a positive interim readout like some companies, choosing not to disclose data from the successful repeat of ECOSPOR II at all. We've long since passed the early stopping point for this trial, so we can conclude that the internal information points towards success. Management has demonstrated they are science-first and don't play games with the stock price by manipulating disclosures. I have extreme confidence in the company leadership and development approach, they have been diligent and systematic about forward progress so far and I expect that to continue.

**Conclusion**  
The risk model is very conservative, a significant proportion of patients could end up non-responders and low-responders and the trial remains a success with room to spare. The risk/reward ratio is off the charts and timing remains the largest source of uncertainty.   
My positions: 200 July calls are good for realizing day-of, 50 August is a hedge against time-line risk and potentially more upside than July if held till expiration. IRAs have shares up to the gills."

o3g0cg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o3g0cg/wish_is_going_places_up/,$Wish is going places (UP),735,316,2021-06-19 21:23:01,"First look at the charts. 

On Friday Wish closed above the 50 SMA for the first time since trading publicly. This is a sign of technical strength and big buying signal. This means wish will show up in more bullish stock screeners and it likely will cause some short algos to quit selling the stock and run for the hills. 

The large downtrend that has been in place since February has now clearly been broken. Last weekend I saw some posts that drew the downtrend line slightly higher and they argued Wish hadn‚Äôt broken out yet and still needs to prove itself. Now, clearly, no matter how you draw the trend line, it has been broken. Not to mention, Quad witching, which included June monthly options expiration, was yesterday which means that wall of expiring options is no longer hanging over the stock. 



The next obvious resistance is around $15 and I expect we head back there this week. Whether we break through without a fight or we stop and consolidate for a while remains to be seen. IMO this thing is obviously heading back to the IPO price of $24, but I personally won‚Äôt be trimming until we get a new all time high over $32. 

As for the fundamentals, they improved this week as well. IMO the way to value this company is as follows: 

Wish management has the following long term financial targets: 

-25-30% (of revenue) Cost of goods sold

-40-45% sales and marketing expense

-8-9% Gen and Admin expense

This implies long term net income margins of 16-27%. Analysts believe they will continue to grow revenue by 20-25% per year over the next several years.

Looking out 5 years to 2026 if we assume conservatively: 

-19% annual revenue growth from 2021 projected $3.2 billion 

-15% net income margin in 2026

-We get $7.64 billion in revenue and $1.146 billion non gaap net income. Put a 30-35 p/e multiple on that and you can see that the fundamentals will be dragging the share price much much higher over time. And the market will be forecasting that net income a few years beforehand and will adjust the valuation higher accordingly. I did a similar analysis with Pinterest in 2019 when they went public on the thesis that Pinterest makes $1 billion in net income by 2024. I heard some of the same bearish arguments back then that I‚Äôm hearing about Wish. And now we see the market expects Pinterest to make $1.30 in EPS in 2022 (1 billion would be like $1.61..)

None of these numbers include this new deal with Prestashop announced earlier this week: 

‚ÄúThrough this partnership, more than 300,000 merchants and brands on the PrestaShop platform will be able to quickly and easily sell to millions of consumers on the Wish marketplace. PrestaShop merchants will have free access to a direct integration module on the PrestaShop platform that connects them directly to Wish‚Äôs merchant dashboard. The module will sync their products and orders between PrestaShop and Wish. PrestaShop merchants will also benefit from a suite of additional marketing and sales support and a number of special incentives.

Wish will enjoy official ‚ÄúTrusted Partner‚Äù status on PrestaShop and will benefit from a special landing page on the PrestaShop platform for merchants.‚Äù

Wish will now have 300K more merchants selling on their platform. This improves the platform by offering new products for consumers and instantly fixes some of the criticisms that wish is just a bunch of low quality products from China. This will also come with MUCH more data for Wish to utilize. And some of these merchants will likely also use ProductBoost (advertising by wish) and Logistics. The Wish landing page link on the Prestashop platform is particularly valuable since it will lead many new consumers directly to wish. 

I‚Äôd like to remind everyone that the large rallies in 2020 for Pinterest and Facebook only occurred after they announced partnerships with Shopify...

edit\* Here's a scratch off ticket:

**Key words to understand:**

**Inflation-** Things cost more, the purchasing power of the dollar is less. You probably already notice that  materials have cost more. Inflation as mentioned by the FEDs is temporary and here to stay, for now. Think materials like stock, people hoard, lack of supply, lumber hits $1000 per 1000 ft. The overestimated inflation is now coming back to to find a midpoint. Because inflation is here we need to take a look at the return on investments.

&#x200B;

>!Inflation short term, it's already here! Commodities are dumping from being over inflated. With inflation being here, better make sure you beat inflation.!<

&#x200B;

**Interest Hike** \- Everyone is talking about whether or not JPOW is going to raise interest rates to counter inflation. By raising rates you would make people spend less because you get more of a return from savings than spending. If people spend less, then demand goes and deflation will occur.

>!Interest rate hikes adjust from 2024 to 2023. More inflation?! Possibly, but the 5 year yields are going up and the 30 year yields are going down. More return on investments for 5 year vs 30 year. What does this mean?! Borrowing short term money will cost you more than borrowing long term money. The 5 year and 30 year. Growth is slowing so you get punished for not growing. With the rates of 5 years going up to pass the 30 year, an economic slow down is suggested. Better make sure you beat that short term treasury rate.!<

&#x200B;

**Reverse Repo-** June just provided the highest reverse repo of all time. Reverse repo is the buying of securities or equities and and promising to only sell them at a higher price. Think stocks now. Where will money go if you are guaranteeing you'll only sell at a higher price.

>!Repos and reverse repos are short term borrowed money. With such high reverse repos, better make sure you beat that increased short term borrow rate.!<

&#x200B;

**TOUR OF CASINO**

You walk into the casino, the thermostat is set at a mild temperature. Maybe a little too warm. The lights turn on. There is suddenly a halt and an announcement that there are table staff changes.

&#x200B;

Let's take a tour of the casino and look at the systems in the casino and see where we are positioned.

**Slots** (>!Dividend Stocks!<): People tend to like dividend stocks because the companies pay you for holding the shares. Dividends generally pay 2-4%. The issue here is that in an economic slow down, companies may see a reduced revenue and the dividend payout might not beat the interest rates. If you get 2% in a savings account, why risk the biscuit for the dividend?

**Roulette** (>!Defense Pharma & Research Heavy Stocks!<): To save money during inflation, there are generally budget cuts to stop spending. This affects the defense sector in many ways. Future grants are generally pulled and R&D is usually cut.

**Craps** (>!ETFs, recovery, inelastic holdings!<): Not sure what to hold, want to be safe, let someone else do it for you. ETFs generally hold some form of dividend stock or businesses that stay flat for stable growth. At times like this where there are still better investments on the table like hiked treasuries, foreign investments, and growth stonks. Who likes watching money burn in ETFs? Talk about .5% fees.

**Blackjack (**>!Meme stocks, trenders!<**):** Memes don't last forever, but we will forever remember the meme. The come and go, that's just the way it is. Big money, small money, no money, doesn't ever want to bag hold. Just here to win it and make a killing. With money moving away from the stock market going out, volume will be a lot less. It's one on one with the dealer. How many hands do you want to play?

**Poker (**>!Growth Stocks!<**):**  So you're telling me growth stocks don't need to spend much on R&D?! YES! Let's narrow down the list that has shown exceptional growth. Got dealt two aces, might as well push everyone else out. Ace 1( Growing Revenue YoY), Ace 2 (Growing footprint YoY)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Which game do you want to play? Seems like the casino is shutting down some of it's services and the others don't have many players.

&#x200B;

**I can't bluff well so I'm going to try the games:**

**Slots** You start playing and accumulate into year 2030. >!You're finally at your breakeven point, the bullmarket starts. Oh the joy of saving and making null.!<

&#x200B;

**Roulette** baby, here we go! Yolo is the only way of life, either get rich or die trying. >!You died!<

&#x200B;

**Craps.** Throw ten darts and land three, win some lose some. It's only money. Time to roll the dice. You start winning, then you start losing. Then you win some more. >!Radioshack bled out by accident. Fuck my life.!<

&#x200B;

**Blackjack**. Man, I don't really want to play alone, let's find a crowd.>! You find a good seat with a lot of players. The table suddenly goes out of service. You panic and rush to the nearest one and go all in. You died.!<

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ah.... you chose (**Poker)**

Not a bad choice. Fun game.

Let's look at what growth stocks there are that are generating great income and expanding the foot print.

There's large caps like: >!SQ, FB, NFLX, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN!<

There's small and mid caps like: >!FVRR, ETSY, PINS!<

There's proven foreign growth investments like: >!BABA, JD, TSM!<

There's semis who can't meet current demand: >!AMD, NVDA!<, >!oops \~\~INTC drank one too many drinks \~\~!<

&#x200B;

14 choices!? So many to choose from! Takes step back. (**over 9000 tickers**)

&#x200B;

**I'll buy the dip, no worries**....  >!who says there will have to be a dip for growth stocks?!<"

[\(ME\) Main Broker](https://preview.redd.it/i4y8dvnjzo571.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89a6733e6aeef02e77ff586745d5e921bd29389c)

I recently made the decision to purchase over $3.53 Million of the stock $MOMO. By now you must be aware that I am a ""Contrarian Compound Value Investor"" and my goal is to buy $1.00 for $0.50. In other words, I love buying assets. I tend to shed away from speculating and like to stick to facts, after all, numbers never lie. (Unless, of course, you are a Chinese company cooking the books and deceiving investors.) MOMO is a Chinese company, so this would be my only concern...but to be honest I don't believe this company would change things to extreme levels. They are practically the ""Tinder"" or ""Bumble"" of China. They also provide live content via great apps on mobile which makes them a mini-facebook live type. In other words, I believe they are too big and well known to put their reputation on the line. They are very popular and many users make a living off them. The bulk of revenue comes from live streaming where users donate money and tip users, then momo takes a small fee.

**Why has it crashed?**  
The first struggle they faced was a decrease of users, this caused some panic amongst investors, and it's what started the first selling of the stock. Right after, we got hit with COVID-19, and the worldwide pandemic slowed many apps down like Tantan this is a dating app so people weren't using the app trying to meet up and date others. it also affected other businesses within it which all caused the second wave of selling, the third wave came in when the overall market started to crash which caused more panic, and then finally there was an even further dropping in the stock which took it to new lows since the peak when Chinese stocks got hit with a possible ban from US market. I don't want to get too much into it all but because of all this fear, because of all these problems that's why we have this opportunity to come in and buy it up cheap. This is where my ""contrarian"" mindset comes in. When everyone is fearful, be greedy. When nobody is looking, when no one cares about it, and when no one is giving it the attention I want it. You see the goal is to buy a skirt in winter for cheap when no one is buying it, to sell them for more during summer when the demand is high. *P.S they have recovered their users and are breaking user highs again.*

**What do the numbers tell us?**  
Again, I don't want to get too much into it but they have a strong balance sheet. From when I bought the stock their market cap was at $2.97 Billion, $532 Million of that is held in cash. Another, $1.2 Billion is held in short-term investments. That's a total of $1.74 Billion just in Total Cash & ST Investments. let's not forget this company is profitable... their total debt is $754.1 which can easily be paid. This leaves them at Debt/Eq and an LT Debt/Eq of only 0.32 which is a great ratio. You typically want it under 0.50. (As a value investor) This is also a tech stock, which usually trades at a higher multiple on their P/E side. This stock can easily trade 20-30 times on P/E. In other words, we can see this stock trading upwards of $40! I don't usually use this model but even looking at the DCF it gives it a value of $ 20.52. While it trades at $15 as of this post. DCF based on FCF is at a higher $28 per share. I see no sign of bankruptcy here either.

**Takeaway?**  
They are very undervalued, this is a typical contrarian type stock. The balance sheet is strong. I believe they will turn things around within operations and business and it'll slowly start to gain attention. More people like me, retail investors will start to notice there is value here and over time start bidding up the price. Smart money owns this under $16.

**MOMO Summary:**

We are early in the commercialization of LEO and $ASTS is at the vanguard.

Inside of SpaceX, most investors rest their hat on the value of Starlink, which will provide FIXED-POINT broadband to customers, albeit at very high costs and with unclear quality.  They value is at $40bn+.  This equates to $200 per share for $ASTS, by way of comparison.  So there ""is a there, there"" in terms of what we are playing for here.

Just like Facebook found out after it's IPO, the real market is and always will be in **MOBILE**. Starlink cannot translate to mobile unless you intend to haul a trailer behind you with a satellite dish.  See below for an artist rendition of Starlink's mobile solution vs. ASTS' actual mobile solution - your existing handset

&#x200B;

[Haha - let's get back to business...read on](https://preview.redd.it/g1qny0og6k571.png?width=918&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6899104fbe13f6bf1e69417ade25940a9aee38b)

$ASTS AST Spacemobile has re-imagined what's possible after the significant cost disruption in satellite launch, which has allowed it to marry two key innovations to provide satellite connectivity to A REGULAR MOBILE DEVICE:

&#x200B;

1. Because launch costs are just a fraction of what they used to be, $ASTS is launching satellites 10x as large as those of traditional satellite phone satellites. This allows the satellite to do the work, not the phone
2. By innovating with software, $ASTS can make the satellite connection work with existing LTE      networks by only working with the carriers' ground terminals to compensate for the Doppler effect; importantly, ASTS works with any normal phone without requiring any modifications

Here is the overview of the **FACTS**

**PRODUCT:**

‚Ä¢ ASTS is building the first-of-a kind and **only** space-based cellular broadband network that is **direct-to-device**; a consumer‚Äôs existing handset will work with ASTS‚Äôs service in tandem with traditional terrestrial mobile service - ASTS also works with IoT enabled devices

‚Ä¢ The constellation utilizes low and mid-band frequencies shared with partners on a non-interference basis; ASTS does not use mobile satellite spectrum but instead delivers service over spectrum allocated for terrestrial mobile use

‚Ä¢ ASTS utilizes high throughput backhaul to terrestrial networks

‚Ä¢ The service will eliminate coverage gaps, is compatible with all phones, provides broadband data speeds, and is accessible via one-click on a user‚Äôs device

**MARKET:**

‚Ä¢ ASTS is targeting the large mobile 5G market, specifically in markets where terrestrial infrastructure (e.g. towers) is less developed

‚Ä¢ ASTS is a beneficiary of the following secular trends: i) falling launch costs, ii) high smartphone penetration, iii) broadband demand iv) 5G IoT proliferation

‚Ä¢ ASTS cites 3.3BN people who are covered but not connected to cellular broadband and another 700MM people who are not covered by existing networks and not connected

‚Ä¢ Key regional opportunities include India, Africa, and Equatorial regions

‚Ä¢ The service is well-suited for low/medium density sites as well as for emergency back-up during natural disasters

**MANAGEMENT:**

‚Ä¢ CEO Avellan holds 18 patents and was the founder of Emerging Markets Communications (sold for $550MM in 2016)

‚Ä¢ The deep executive ranks include executives from Orbital ATK, Globecomm, NASA, and Maxar ‚Ä¢ The team has 161 scientists and engineers, 34 of whom are PhDs

**COMPETITION:**

‚Ä¢ ASTS competes with high-cost legacy providers, including Iridium ‚Ä¢ Legacy satellite providers require unique handsets for users to connect

‚Ä¢ ASTS also competes with the build-out of standard terrestrial 5G mobile equipment ‚Ä¢ Competitor Lynk advertises a similar product but appears significantly behind both with respect to commercial, financial and technical milestones

**OTHER:** Investors include Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, and Samsung; all of whom recently invested in the Company's latest financing.  The Company's own coverage banker at Barclays QUIT his job to join ASTS.  The dogs are eating the dog food.

**TIMELINE:**

‚Ä¢ April 2019 ‚Äì BW 1 was launched (the test satellite), validating system architecture and proving they could connect a mobile phone to a satellite and connect to an LTE system  ‚Ä¢ 2H 2021E will launch BW3, which is a scaled version of the constellation satellite ‚Ä¢ 2H 2022E/1H 2023E first commercial launches of 20 satellites for Equatorial coverage, with 110 satellites by YE 2023 and 168 satellites by YE 2024

**ANALYSIS - THIS IS MY OPINION, AND SUBJECT TO DISCUSSION AND DISAGREEMENT**

‚Ä¢ ASTS is an exciting event-driven story stock with open-ended upside that is cemented in reality by proven entrepreneurs, significant industry backing, and *bone fide* strategic agreements in place that address key commercial aspects of the business

‚Ä¢ Management funded the seed capital for the business, highlighting their confidence and ‚Äòskin in the game‚Äô

‚Ä¢ Targeting mobile 5G is a ‚Äò**big idea**‚Äô that augments that excitement generated by fixed-broadband players such as Starlink while addressing the cost accessibility issues that are likely to be present in developing markets

‚Ä¢ The stock benefits from a dynamic where it cannot be disproven, leaving investors free to speculate and discount key assumptions, including service penetration among partner carriers and ARPU

‚Ä¢ The investment set-up is favorable since a high capital intensity space venture is poorly suited for private markets, yet requires the capital available in the SPAC market ‚Äì the set-up is not a ‚Äòfoist‚Äô by private market investors onto unsuspecting retail investors but instead a legitimate capital raising exercise to fully-fund the project and remove financing risk

‚Ä¢ With 1-year lock-ups on existing investors and PIPE investors, there will be limited free float in what amounted to a ‚Äúpublic Series C‚Äù financing

‚Ä¢ Given future CAPEX, Wall Street banks will see a large future banking opportunity and likely initiate favorable coverage on the Company

**RISKS:**

‚Ä¢ While the *BlueWalker* satellite provided proof-of-concept, there are questions around whether ASTS will work at scale when the constellation is deployed

‚Ä¢ Users might experience significant battery drain on their devices when using the service, reducing appeal for full tower placement

‚Ä¢ Realized user penetration and ARPU remain uncertain as well as the ability to raise future capital for full system deployment at prices that avoid excessive dilution

‚Ä¢ ASTS will depend on capital markets to fully fund its growth and is susceptible to potential funding risk

**INVESTMENT CHECKLIST:  Good hygiene to make sure something can make money as an investment**

***BUSINESS MODEL***:  ASTS will receive a 50/50 revenue split with its carrier partners including Vodafone and AT\&T; given its large, fixed cost base, the Company expects to generate 90% asset-level EBITDA margins that provide significant operating leverage and cash flow

***GO-TO-MARKET:***  In-place binding agreements with carriers provide ASTS with access to >1.3BN existing customers without having to independently market to or acquire customers (or directly bear the cost of churn) ‚Ä¢ Phase 1 will target key Equatorial regions and cover 1.6BN people; subsequent phases expand into Europe and N. America ‚Äì the total system will require 168 satellites by 2024

***DEFENSIBILITY***: ASTS has 750+ patents as well as a first-mover advantage ‚Ä¢ Commercial progress reinforces the Company‚Äôs technical lead in the market

***CAPITAL***: ASTS is capital intensive and subject to capital availability to complete its full system ‚Ä¢ Once the constellation is complete, the Company benefits from extreme operating leverage and should have extremely high cash flow conversation

***TRACTION***: ASTS appears to have extraordinary commercial partnership traction, however, it is yet unclear what end-user uptake the usage will be ‚Ä¢ Technical traction was ‚Äòproved‚Äô by the April 2019 launch of the *Bluewalker 1* test satellite

***FINANCIALS***:  With a market cap of \~$1.8bn, the company is expected to generate >$1bn of EBITDA by 2024 based on 168 satellites launched, 27MM total subscribers, with an ARPU of $2.50 per user

Below are projections:

When thinking about a hypothetical valuation, I pro-forma the numbers and apply a multiple in-line with the tower companies.  I treat depreciation as a real cash expense

**TECHNOLOGY DETAILS**

***OVERVIEW***: AST & Science (‚ÄúASTS‚Äù) has designed a large aperture satellite system to provide ‚Äòdirect-to-device‚Äô service to normal phones

***BOOMBOX IN SPACE:***  ASTS‚Äô satellites are \~10x bigger than the norm because they are essentially cell-phone towers in space. With a 900-square meter array, the system is a large **‚Äúloud‚Äù** system that can connect with a regular mobile phone. Traditional satellite phones ‚Äúlisten hard‚Äù whereas ASTS simply produces a loud signal to connect to regular mobile phones

***SOFTWARE:***  ASTS‚Äô system does not require a special chipset on the phone because of its proprietary back-end software system that allows for interconnection to existing terrestrial spectrum and telecom networks. The ‚Äúmagic‚Äù of the technology is the back-end software that allows the system to utilize terrestrial spectrum, seamlessly interconnect over existing networks, and talk directly to an LTE system; ASTS is 6G forward compatible

***BACKHAUL***:  Once the signal is collected from a handset, ASTS sends the data back on B-Band satellite spectrum to a ground gateway system. The phone-satellite connection is native to the carrier‚Äôs terrestrial spectrum

***CAPACITY***:  Each satellite can handle 1.2MM GB per month; extra capacity can be added by directing additional satellites at an area

***WHAT DO WE KNOW***:  What has ASTS done to prove its system?

o *Bluewalker1* proved the RF could close (e.g. the power was sufficient to connect a normal phone) and that an LTE connection was achievable utilizing ASTS‚Äô ‚Äòmagic‚Äô software; ASTS launched a handset into space with the satellite on the ground to cost-effectively check an important element of technical diligence. *Bluewalker1* allowed for end-to-end connectivity testing, which has been reviewed over the last 1.5 years

o *Bluewalker3* (2H 2021 launch) will be a scaled version of the system, which will de-risk components and demonstrate the full technology. BW3 will allow for software debugging to tune the full system

***RISKS***:  Most of the risks are timing risks. For instance, *Bluewalker3* could spur the need to tune microns, which could delay the system deployment by months. The troubleshooting required will be the beam forming in patterns to maintain a connection while managing handoffs

A launch vehicle delay could delay the testing by 60 to 90 days

***BENT PIPE***:  The satellite itself is not complex ‚Äì it is bent pipe in the sky; most of the design relates to distributing power. The satellite itself is not involved with processing or routing

DISCLOSURE: I own 500,401 shares of common. Yes, this is a huge position. You only live once...invest carefully and with great vision.  To avoid accusations of being a shill, below is proof of my position.  I'm grateful for the moderators working with me so that I can meet the requirements to post!  I have a new appreciation for the depth of validation they require.

I don't want to test my luck, but I have a bunch of cool memes to share later...made them while passing those long, cold days when this stock seriously sucked.

&#x200B;

**Summary**

* Dog owners love their dogs.
* Before $BARK, there was no company that was able to deliver the full spectrum of products that dogs need **under one universally trusted** brand.
* Most dog brands exist in their individual silos, i.e. just food, just toys, just sticks, etc.

&#x200B;

It started as a monthly dog toy subscription service. Since 2020, it has added new divisions in order to be the go-to brand for all products your dog will ever need.

* Barkbox has created a loyal base of 1.8 million subscribers,
* Low churn rate of 5.4% --- and has expanded into other products to maximize the value of this consumer relationship.
* Thanks to it‚Äôs recent IPO, the stock has a warchest of \~$427 million to further boost its growth.
* **Vertically integrated, they make their own stuff which is why gross margins are high**

&#x200B;

My thesis is that Barkbox has created a noteworthy sticky brand - and will see substantial growth through it‚Äôs multi-pronged approach at monetizing it‚Äôs client base.

* Most recently, Barkbox was added to Amazon‚Äôs subscription boxes landing page. This is a new development. More info about this can be read [here](https://www.pymnts.com/subscription-commerce/2021/third-party-subscriptions-amazon/) and why it‚Äôs so important.
* With over 50% of the e-commerce market on Amazon, Barkbox‚Äôs new inclusion into Amazon subscription will boost it‚Äôs existing revenue.

&#x200B;

**The Opportunity**

* $36.9 billion is estimated to be spent on food in 2020
* $19.2 billion is estimated to be spent on supplies/otc medicine
* $29.3 billion is estimated to be spent on vet care

[During covid, an estimated 11.38 million US households have gotten a new pet.](https://todaysveterinarybusiness.com/pets-appa-survey-covid/)

* Petcare market in the USA is more than $50 billion and will continue to grow.
* Pet industry is mostly dominated by brick and mortar retailers.
* The pet market is in the early stages of innovation and is brimming for something new.

According to[ PYMNTS.com](https://securecdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Subscription-Commerce-Conversion-Index-November-2020.pdf), ¬æ of US adults - 182 million consumers, subscribed to at least 1 subscription service since last July. Nearly 50% of consumers who signed on for a new subscription since the pandemic began intend to stick with it even after the pandemic is over.

Members of the management team have been featured in Fast Company‚Äôs list of ‚ÄúMost Creative People,‚Äù and Forbes ‚Äú30 under 30‚Äù, among other accolades.

**Omni-channel Distribution**

* Barkbox has built an impressive brand, and it collaborates with retail partners in addition to selling directly to consumers.
* It‚Äôs distributed by major retailers such as: Target, Amazon, [Costco](https://dogoday.com/2021/02/04/costco-barkbox-collection-is-back-and-its-super-cute/), Walmart, and Petsmart
* It does joint collaborations with brand such as [Bluestone Lane](https://bluestonelane.com/barkxbluestone/), and even [Anheuser-Bush](https://barkpost.com/life/bark-budweiser-7-pack/), among many others, such as the [NBA](https://www.barkbox.com/themes/NBA).

&#x200B;

**Barkbox has over 1.8 million annual active subscribers.**

In an investment deck for the popular App Acorns, BarkBox was mentioned as having one of the biggest subscriber bases, alongside big brands such as: NYTimes, Dropbox, Peloton, and Spotify - due to its impressive subscriber base.

&#x200B;

**Competition**

Barkbox has no true competitors. Most brands exist in their own individual silo, i.e. just food, or toys. Other competitors like Chewy, are marketplaces.

$HIMS is a consumer subscription based model, that seems to be a good peer for comparison purposes. Due $HIMS recurring subscription revenue model, it is a good comparison for discussions. Based on $HIMS valuation, this would support $BARK trading in the $15-20 area.

For general purposes, I have included a comparison of other pet related brands.

CHWY - Chewy

FRPT - Freshpet

TRUP - Trupanion

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Risks**

No DD is complete without thinking about the bear case.

Most recently, Chewy, a competitor of $BARK, reported profits but warned of labor shortages and supply disruptions.

Even though $BARK is vertically integrated, it is likely that it will have the same labor and supply disruptions, as all businesses are facing.

Shortly before it‚Äôs IPO, $BARK was accused of selling a chew stick that killed a pet. There is no evidence the chew stick was responsible.

* Instead of ignoring the allegation, Barkbox immediately addressed it via social media, and said it was working with the manufacturer to look into the death.
* Barkbox immediately stopped distributing the item.
* Their emphasis on ‚Äúdoing the right thing,‚Äù speaks loudly to their ethos, and means we can trust them to do the right thing and continually expand with their consumer base

**Market Reaction**

* Buy rating, and $16 PT from Cannacord Genuity analyst Maria Ripps.
* Buy rating, and $14 PT from Jefferies
* The stock IPO‚Äôed at $10, and has slowly risen and is at $11.35 on 6/15/2021.
* Fidelity owns 8.3% of $BARK, which is an impressive sign of their confidence in the company. In addition they ANCHORED THE PIPE!

&#x200B;

**Investment Highlights**

Barkbox is a real company, with real revenues. The team has demonstrated it can execute. As investors, the goal is to find the next big thing. Without a doubt, as Barkbox continues executing in many of it‚Äôs new divisions, it will become a highly coveted gem.

* The pet category is big and growing
* This is a digitally focused brand, which is doing both DTC and collaborating with major brands for increased exposure
* It uses data, to improve the subscription experience and to personalize the box/product for its clients - STRONG RETENTION!
* It can continue to accelerate growth by introducing new products, cross selling, and adding more channels.

&#x200B;

**Business Model:** Barkbox will continue to grow it‚Äôs subscription services direct to consumers, in addition to distributing its products with retailers like Amazon.

&#x200B;

**Defensibility:** Barkbox has an impressive 1.8 million base of recurring consumers, and is considered one of the biggest subscription services.

&#x200B;

**Capital:** Thanks to it‚Äôs recent IPO, it is flush with cash

I love the stock.

I am incredibly bullish still. 

Here is my new position.

I liquidated warrants, when I saw the commons come down, I felt there was more opportunity to size up.

Realistically you won‚Äôt go wrong holding CLOV considering it will probably trend upwards - albeit more slowly - throughout the rest of the year. But that‚Äôs not what we do here, especially as we watch the feds print money. So, real degens need to find the next big thing. Fortunately it seems like there are a few solid picks swirling around, one of them being WELL health $WELL $WLLYF. 

WELL is one of the top providers of digital health services and is severely underrated considering its insane potential for growth. there are a couple key points making this so appealing. 

#1 Billionaire Investors. 
With direct investment from the 30th richest man in the world, Li Ka-shing, WELL has been buying up the competition with multiple 9-digit Acquisitions this year positioning WELL as the largest operator of digital health clinics in the country. In a space with such high barriers to entry, political power is king like we saw with Clover.

#2 NASDAQ listing. 
WELL recently announced their partnership with renowned law firm Fenwick & West, which helped companies like¬†Facebook,¬†Amazon,¬†Cisco, and¬†Coinbase¬†with their IPOs.¬†This is important because WELL‚Äôs equivalents in the US are currently trading at much higher multiples making this a unique opportunity to catch the rocket before it leaves."

but the fact that much of the loaned money goes into stocks

which artificially drive up their value. (This is known as ‚Äúasset inflation‚Äù. No wealth is being created here, the numbers are just being unnaturally propped up by the money printing)

So it's imperative that you take profits. I know diamond handers won't ever sell, but if I can reach one poor soul to wake up, and to put their profits into assets that will hold it's value.

And if you just prefer stocks, even putting them in say, companies that will be around 20 years from now would be far less risky, such as Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft ect.

The alternative is to completely chance it and see how long you can ride this bubble, but the odds are totally stacked against you. You will never be rich this way.

Good luck"

Personally like both of these companies but there's a lot of things happening right now that makes me feel like owning WELL is the smarter move.

Mostly the fact it's owned by the people, not the suits. 

Not to mention WELL has a 5x ahead of it before it catches up to CLOV market cap. 

Short interest is also pretty high on WELL and they announced a NASDAQ IPO in Q4 of this year with the group who did FB, AMZN, COIN, etc so it feels like a chance to get in before the IPO which is rare... Fundamentals are there, technicals just need to catch up."

Sector: Technology

Industry: Consumer Electronics

Market cap: [1.13B](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VUZI?p=VUZI)

Vuzix is engaged in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of augmented reality display devices also referred to as head mounted displays (HMDs, but also known as video eyewear or near-eye displays), in the form of Smart Glasses, and Augmented Reality glasses. Their Augmented Reality wearable display devices are worn like eyeglasses or attach to a head worn mount. These devices typically include cameras, sensors, and a computer that enable the user to view, record and interact with video and digital content, such as computer data, the Internet, social media or entertainment applications. Their wearable display products integrate micro-display technology with advanced optics to produce compact high-resolution display engines, which when viewed through their smart glasses‚Äô products create virtual images that appear comparable in size to that of a computer monitor or a large-screen television. Vuzix's offered products are M series Smart Glasses, Blade Smart Glasses and other Augmented Reality Products. 

**FINANCIALS**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/c3ti8rur3l471.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=34bc91ac94ae2222d80509ff6bf28a79a9a101f9)

Sales of Smart Glasses products for the year ended December 31, 2020 rose by 107% over the same period in 2019, primarily the result of stronger customer demand for the new M-Series models, which were not available for sale for the entire comparable period in 2019. Sales revenues from the M-Series Smart Glasses were $8,406,623, a 112% increase of $4,432,628 over the prior year‚Äôs comparable period. Total M-Series unit sales increased by 109% for the year ended December 31, 2020 versus the same period in 2019. Revenues of Blade Smart Glasses decreased by $240,747 or 14%, primarily driven by lower average sales price as compared to 2019.

Sales of OEM Products, and Standalone Waveguides and Display Engines were nil for the year ended December 31, 2020 versus $951,570 and $152,499, respectively, in the 2019 period primarily due to not receiving new orders.

Sales of Engineering Services for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1,500,287 as compared to $673,151 in the 2019 comparable period. The revenue recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020 for engineering services was primarily a result of several waveguide and display engine development projects which commenced in the first and second quarters of 2020. The majority, all but two, of these projects were completed and delivered in 2020. 

**BULL ARGUMENT**

Augmented Reality Smart Glasses enable the wearer to see computer-generated information, graphics or images projected into the real-world environment or upon an object that the user is observing. Thus, whether in the warehouse, on the factory floor, or in the field, users wearing Augmented Reality Smart Glasses may access a manual, tutorial, or image that is connected to the task at hand which will assist them in completing that task, while also viewing their current surroundings and nearby objects. Additional possible applications of AR-enabled Smart Glasses include hands-free alerts, messaging, location and context aware information and social interaction.

Vuzix has developed their own intellectual property portfolio that includes [patents](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/vuzix-corporation), over 22 years of manufacturing know-how, software, proprietary processes, materials and equipment to create high performance waveguides, and near-eye display products. It can be argued their waveguides and compact display engine technologies are a key differentiator for enabling next generation Augmented Reality and Smart Glasses hardware for the enterprise and consumer segments because they will ultimately allow Vuzix to make HMDs nearly indistinguishable from regular eyeglasses.

Key growth areas for Vuzix are the enterprise, medical, consumer electronics, OEM, defense and security markets. They are addressing most of these markets by developing and selling their own finished products and building a growing eco-system of software and services internally and with their value added resellers, developers and end customers. Another potential channel to these markets they are developing includes supplying mass production of waveguide optics and display engines to select third parties to use in their products. Vuzix recently announced they will expand their Augmented Reality surgical product presence to [support shoulder, knee, and spinal surgeries](https://ir.vuzix.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1895/vuzix-smart-glasses-expand-ar-surgical-product-presence-to). 

**BEAR ARGUMENT**

Vuzix has incurred net losses since inception and may continue to incur losses. They reported a net loss of $17,952,172 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a net loss of $26,476,370 for the year ended December 31, 2019, and a net loss of $21,875,713 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Vuzix has an accumulated deficit of $162,694,983 as of December 31, 2020.

They operate in a highly competitive market and the size, resources, and brand name of some of their competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than Vuzix. Some competitors include: 

* Samsung Electronics Co.
* LG Electronics 
* Epson
* Sony Corporation
* Microsoft Corporation
* Oculus/Facebook
* HTC Corporation
* Snap
* Lenovo
* Google
* Magic Leap

Many of their competitors have substantial market share, diversified product lines, well-established supply and distribution systems, strong worldwide brand recognition, and greater financial, marketing, research and development resources. Additionally, many of these competitors also have substantial competitive advantages such as: 

* longer operating histories
* the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products
* broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners
* access to larger established customer bases and known branding
* greater resources to fund research and development and to make acquisitions
* larger intellectual property portfolios
* the ability to bundle competitive offerings with other products and services

**CONCLUSION**

I have a hard time pulling the trigger on a long-term investment with Vuzix. With their current financials and competitors, I feel this is a better day/swing trade opportunity if played correctly. The volatility is where I like it for those types of trades.

Most downloaded e-commerce app in the world for last 3 years. Expected revenue for 2021 is $3.2 billions and revenue is up 75% compared to last year. 

It is on right track and they have moved into logistic and that will help profit margin in the near future. They are employing technologies such as machine learning to help their customer needs and as they wean from the traditional marketing on Facebook, profit margins will improve even more.

With current market value of approx. $6 billion and 2 billion in cash, Enterprise Value is only 1.25 times the expected 2021 revenue.

So why Mr. Market is pricing this e-commerce company at such dirt cheap level? It can‚Äôt be because of the fundamentals as company is very strong as indicated above. 

So what‚Äôs going on? I think it is due to merciless short sellers attack for past 4 months which has draw down the price from $32 (February 2021) to $8 until last week. With volume increasing, short sellers will have to cover their short positions sooner rather than later and stock price will move to $40 level. 

In my personal opinion just hold on to your stocks as short sellers are grasping the last straw."

If there is ever one stock which facilitates the gambling marketplace for mobile games and trading at reasonable valuation, it‚Äôs none other than $SKLZ. This one stock can make your dream of becoming a millionaire come true with huge upside in the upcoming years 
Skillz ($SKLZ) is the publicly traded e-sports platform where millions of players compete for cash prizes. The games literally look like shit but people play for money with a fee to enter the tournament for the chance to win real money. 
As the payouts are huge, most of the users are addicted to this platform and spend an average of whopping 60 mins on their platform. As a matter of fact, Skillz currently ranks above Facebook, TikTok and YouTube on the average length of time its users spend per day on their platform as per their investor presentation.
Key considerations for investment 
1.	Trading at valuation of $8.9B. Super cheap when compared to a total TAM of $175B across the geographies (Source: Investor presentation for TAM)
2.	FY2020 reported revenues of $230M (>92% YoY growth). ~376M by 2021. $550M by 2022 (Source: Company filings & consensus estimates)
3.	Lead by Andrew Paradise (impeccable track record AisleBuyer acquired by Intuit; Double Picture acquired by MPA). 
4.	They just went public by the same guys that took Draftkings $DKNG public, Jeff Sagansky and Harry Sloan; Continuously  supported by Cathie Wood who only looks for investments with disruptive innovation & higher return potential (>10x)
5.	2.7M Monthly Active Users; 1.9 million paid entry daily tournaments; GMV of $1.6B (Latest 10Q quarterly report)
6.	Differentiated Business Model: Although Skillz‚Äôs end market is mobile gaming, its model differs vs. traditional mobile game publishers. To start, Skillz operates a competition-based, multiplayer platform that drives engagement through competition. Skillz players submit to tournament entry fees, while mobile game publishers generate the majority of their bookings through in-app purchases and typically monetize less than 5% of the playing population, in addition to advertising. (Source: Company filings & Investor presentation)
7.	Take rate of ~15% and an impressive 95% Gross margin. Adj. EBITDA to be positive by 2022. Contribution is already positive & expected to reach $245M by 2022E (Source: 10-K, Investor presentation & consensus expectations)
8.	Growth! Growth! Growth. Competition is now closed for submitting game by developer for NFL. NFL with its massive following of 100M people worldwide shall sponsor the game to the fans & guess what people who download the game shall be on-boarded on to the Skillz experience & some of which will become members on the platform. Huge cross-selling opportunity within the rapidly growing user base.

9.	Acquisition of Aarki to broaden SKLZ‚Äôs footprint: $150M acquisition of Aarki, a technology driven marketing platform shall give access to advanced Machine Learning algorithms to be augmented by Skillz‚Äôs deep first party data. Aarki‚Äôs reach of ~465 Million monthly users will extend Skillz‚Äôs player acquisition capabilities
10.	Another lever for growth! Google‚Äôs PlayStore news shall increase the growth in terms of user base growth across 15 countries which is a huge revenue booster (expands the TAM by at least $15B as mentioned in the investor presentation)
11.	Bottom-line: With expected sales to be ~$550 million in 2022 (~60% CAGR), very high gross margins (~95%), zero debt, an enormously growing gaming industry, an extremely diverse user base, and higher user engagement on the platform makes it a no brainer buying option in 2021


Also remember that INDIA NFL and NEW GAMES are ALL DISCOUNTED from they projections! On the last earnings call the CEO Andrew clearly mentioned that SKILLZ only puts out projections for games already launched. 

Synchronous games are in final stage of testing - Synchronous means live PVP gaming which opens up an entire new stream of gamers !

EDIT : forgot to mention.. 70% of the free float is SHORT!!!! That‚Äôs more than $AMC or $GME"

[https://www.fool.ca/2021/06/09/is-a-short-squeeze-on-the-cards-for-well-health-stock/](https://www.fool.ca/2021/06/09/is-a-short-squeeze-on-the-cards-for-well-health-stock/)

I've said it before, and I'm saying it again... 

WELL Health is lining up to be the next CLOV. 

WELL Health Technologies (WELL) (WLYYF) 

*  20%+ Short Interest
* Raised $305M priced 30% above market led by the 29th richest man in the world. 
*  JP Morgan and RBC extended credit lines to over $500M combined
* Aggressive M&A activity that caused no dilution which now puts them as the largest clinic provider in Canada and expands footprint into the US through CRH Medical. 
* Nearly $500M in revenue with $100M in EBITDA 
* Fenwick & West Engaged for a NASDAQ IPO in Q4 of this year - Fenwick did literally every big name from FB and AMZN to COIN and is extremely exclusive. Likely that they selected WELL. 

By no means am I saying CLOV is a bad company I really like them both but WELL just seems like a situation where the market hasn't caught up to the fundamentals and I think it's just a matter of time now. 

I mean look at this... A year of consolidation while the company has exponentially increased the business offering. Time for the chart to do the same üöÄüöÄüöÄ

CLOV was up 85% today and had volume over 732M. The reddit army has taken charge and sent CLOV to truly to the moon. 

I want to share what I think is lining up to be the next CLOV... 

Still largely under the radar is Vancouver based WELL Health Technologies (TSX:WELL) which also has significant short interest, strong fundamentals , and billionaire backers. They just completed a $206M acquisition of ‚ÄúMyHealth‚Äù now making it the largest private clinic operator in Canada.

Just prior to that, the company recently announced the $372.9M Acquisition of CRH medical which significantly increased WELLs footprint in the US... This is where it gets interesting. Not only did JP Morgan extend there existing credit line to CRH medical by USD$100M to $300M and RBC provide a C$200M secured credit facility for the recent ‚ÄúMyHealth‚Äù acquisition.¬†

But the company legit partnered with Fenwick & West to assist with a NASDAQ IPO in Q4 of this year.... Fenwick client base is Facebook, Amazon, Cisco, and recently COIN... We are on a launch pad waiting to take off. 

Jumping into the charts now... WELL has consolidated for a year while they have exponentially grown the fundamentals of the business. Just recently they blew through every moving average.

RSI is still below 60% and heading in the right direction - Stochastics finally hit that oversold zone and have started to aggressively turn bullish. 

&#x200B;

Today we saw the stock find new support on the 50day SMA for a strong close.

I think it's very likely we see this breakout of its consolidation period tomorrow and find new support above 8.50 which would set it up for a potential Squeeze/Run into new ATH.

The sky is really the limit here as the company approaches $500M in revenue with Positive EBITDA and a NASDAQ IPO on the horizon. I think it has the potential to be 1 of 2 things. 

1. The next CLOV as it has high short interest and all the same if not better fundamentals
2. A smart diversification tool (Geographically & Financially) for everyone that just made Huge gains on CLOV."

The DD here is purely looking at WISH as a pure value play and doesn't include any short-squeeze related information.

# Business

To keep it simple,

1. Wish is a global e-commerce platform that facilitates transactions between buyers and sellers.
2. It allows sellers to list their products on Wish and sell directly to consumers.
3. The merchants on the platform primarily offer ***unbranded products that are deeply discounted compared to the alternatives. Most of the merchants/products are from china.***
4. They target customers looking for value goods people with annual income < 75,000 USD, plenty in US and Europe regions accounting for 90% of customers.
5. Wish does not stock the products themselves or manage returns.

# The Team

1. *CEO* [*Piotr Szulczewski*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piotr_Szulczewski) *a former Google Engineer*
2. *Exec chair - Jacky Reses (known for Square and works with Bill Ackman at Pershing square)*
3. *CTO - DannyZhang (Ex- Yahoo, ATT)*
4. *Best in class Technology team of engineers mostly from Facebook and Google*

Hunky dory there are so many e-commerce platforms why is WISH special ?

# Value Proposition

Looks at some of the stats here

[Activity Snapshot](https://preview.redd.it/hp99fuab85471.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&s=14a48935ccd3b4142a9070ac354568d30eab0c10)

WISH platform connects over ***100 million monthly active users in over 100 countries to over 550k global merchants***. Their main motto is to give users an affordable, personalized, and entertaining shopping experience leveraging their in house data science and marketing technologies.

# Value Proposition to Wish Users

The platform excels from the rest by making e-commerce

**Affordable -** Offer unbranded products to value conscious customers at deep discounts

1. **Accessible -**  built as a Mobile first platform for access across the world in 40 different languages
2. **WISH Local -** Partner with 50,000 brick and mortar stores, use them as pick up facilities and also allowing the stores to list their products on the platform

The standout features of the shopping experience

1. **90% of user activity occurs through Mobile App**
2. ***Discovery Based***  **- 70% of the sales on the platform do not come from a search query, meaning the user doesn't come to the platform to buy something that's on his mind but rather ends up buying a product browsing through the platform liking a deal**
3. Their marketing programs are top notch and they use big data technologies and AI in their approach to make it highly personalized. They look at facebook, instagaram, emails and messages to customize their recommendations. ***ok most of you that have seen The social Dilemma on NFLX. you got it.***
4. user experience is engaging and entertaining by having highly personalized feeds. on an ***average users spent over \~ 9 minutes a day*** on their platform in 2020

# What's in for the merchants in addition to being able to sell their products ?

1. access to 100 mil monthly users across 100 countries, digital presence for their stores
2. Through **ProductBoost,** they are able to market their products by paying WISH as ad revenue. **This is very similar to a TinderBoost feature. 30% of merchants use this feature**
3. WISH charges and offers logistics ensuring consistent delivery experience boosting their sales.

# Revenue sources

1. **Core Marketplace** \~ commission on the products being sold on the platform
2. **ProductBoost** \~ marketing ad dollars coming from the merchants
3. **Logistics** \~ providing logistics support to the merchants and getting paid

# Cost and Expenses

They are spending truck loads of money on user acquisition and marketing costs juts like any other early stage e-commerce player. In the long term they expect to spend 40%\~45% of their revenue in this area

&#x200B;

[Expected to be 40&#37;\~45&#37; going forward](https://preview.redd.it/vdxe4acke5471.png?width=393&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5dcbbfe8af527a2dc171ef2febb2a126481c6e9)

# Oppurtunitues Ahead

1. 43% of headcount involved in R&D related activities. Huge opp to drive efficiencies at scale
2. 10,800 wish power users and influencers to market the platform, selected based on their social following, this would heavily propel the customers and merchants growth
3. with covid-19 easing across the world, logistical nightmares would be eased
4. Further scaling of Wish local to bring in more brick and mortar stores on the platform
5. Adding new product categories and higher value products as needed by customers
6. increased spending domestically in US due to monetary easing and stimulus
7. Very solid base of long term customers, look at the chart showing the life time value of the users  from the time they started engaging

https://preview.redd.it/02p5clfaf5471.png?width=458&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d21e4c0151bb62c784714e92477f7fb7a88133a

# Valuation

WISH , still not profitable with an EBITDA loss for Q1 2020 in the range of -60 million equals \~7% sales.

The company doesn not have any financial debt, has \~ $1.5 to$ 2.0 B in cash.

**Looking at their price to sales multiple, the stock is at a heavy discount compared to its peers**

**As of close today,**

|Platform|Price to sales ratio|
|:-|:-|
|ETSY|11.6|
|SHOP|44.44|
|SFIX (stitchfix)|3.844|
|BABA|5.579|
|Avg. Price to sales of 75 Retail (online) sales, data from A.Damodaran from NYU stern|4.52|
|WISH|**2.861**|

with a modest price to sales multiple of 5x, the stock should be trading at \~$24 to be modestly valued compared to other E-Commerce firms.

***TLDR***

*WISH is an undervalued stock play, heavilty discounted compared to its peers. Any price below \~$15 is a joke.*

*I do not care about short interest, Gamma Squeeze but if it helps then bring it on. There were multiple rumors in the past that it's being acquired by Amazon, e-bay. I see institutional intrest to be coming back into the stock.*

*Not selling a single share (1,000 shares at $10.56 avg) until it hits \~45. Might as well hit 60 if there are more WISHes from here.*

**Positions or ban**

Where everything is low quality, and cheap. Rolex? $5. Gucci bag? $5.

&amp;#x200B;

Does this sound appealing to you? No. Well, that may be because you're not one of the brainless zombies scrolling through social media 16 hours a day. WISH targets ads towards this audience in hopes they will download the Wish app, once inside the app, they get access to your Facebook account to get key statistics about you. They then cater your product stream to you. It's a game at that point, for you to find the one thing that ISN'T trash on Wish's app, and get a huge discount.

For **107 million monthly users** this is a very fun and addicting game.

This ticker is currently **down 67%** of its IPO price in just about 6 months. Why?


It's all short-term negatives.

**1.) Negative user growth last quarter.** This is now starting to rebound with the country opening back up, because $WISH's biggest demographic is lower income individuals. Jobs are opening up again, expect a big rebound.

**2.) New business venture of providing logistics for its merchants.** Because of the new investment into this area, the margins for their logistical foray are slim. As this venture scales though, so will the margins. This is a big deal. Think how Amazon has their own delivery vehicles. It serves as a double positive. If you see a WISH van driving down the street that's free advertising while simultaneously providing logistical services.

**3.) Recent earnings was not stellar.** Take a look at the first 2 bullets again and you have your reasoning. Short term detriments.

&amp;#x200B;

So you mean to tell me because of very short term, consequential actions - WISH should be **down 67%** from IPO? You mean to tell me that an e-commerce stock should be trading a **1.6X forward sales** (growing at a rate of 20+% YoY), when the **average forward sales for an online retailer is trading at 4.5X???**

&amp;#x200B;

Wish should easily be double what it's currently valued at, based on sales alone.

I'm here to show you that BB is still massively undervalued. I **really** like this stock, so below I've consolidated some of my favorite DD, with links at the end if you'd like to read more.

# Products & Customers

* BlackBerry isn't just a phone company any more. They provide best in class cybersecurity.
* BlackBerry's most notable product is QNX, an RTOS with several applications. [Read here for more.](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le53ol/comprehensive_guide_about_bb_and_how_it_shall/)
* In December of last year, Amazon announced a multi-year global agreement with BlackBerry QNX and developed IVY, a cloud-connected smart vehicle data platform. IVY allows automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data and create actionable insights from that date. It's possibilities are endless, and I highly recommend reading more on Amazon's initial announcement.
* OK, so what the fuck does the point above mean? It means that **right now, electric vehicles are a gold rush, and BlackBerry is the one selling picks and shovels.** Through Amazon, IVY is going to become an integral part of the EV process.
* The market is sucking the dick of EV manufacturers, but EV production is low margin and low scale. **BlackBerry IVY is data monetization, which is high margin and has unlimited scale.** Within a few years, BlackBerry will be making much more than the auto manufacturers they're partnered with.
* Blackberry QNX is used by 23 of the world's top 25 electric vehicle OEMs.
* BlackBerry targets more than just EVs though. They also have or are developing products for healthcare, financial services, government markets, energy, gas, oil, and smart grid connected transportation.

# Cybersecurity Leader

* BB offers best-in-class security, safety, and reliability. 18 of the G20 governments are customers, and they are the only software company to attain various security certifications from the US Govt.
* Ransomware attacks have begun to impact American businesses like never before. Today, the commerce secretary stated ransomware attacks are here to stay, and that businesses should plan accordingly.
* You know that oil pipeline that was taken out by DarkSide ransomware and caused oil shortages across the southeast U.S? That wouldn't have happened if Colonial Pipeline were using BlackBerry. Something tells me companies won't be making that mistake in the future.
* According to Frost & Sullivan Research, BlackBerry addresses 96% of cyber threats, and 77% of Fortune 100 financial companies use BlackBerry software.

[Here's a list of BB Certifications obtained in 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/qey899yxnp371.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=f51e571ce7afcaf17126b2c168cb3f7a37343c35)

# Some Basics and Fundamentals

* BlackBerry has an \~$8bn market cap with $1bn+ in yearly revenue and $800m in cash.
* Since 2016, the number of QNX products has grown from 50 million to 175 million.
* BB owns \~38,000 patents worth approximately $450 million.
* BB recently won a lawsuit against Facebook. I am unable to find the details, but most estimates are for between $1bn - $5bn total, paid over the course of a few years. BlackBerry's current market cap is only $8bn...
* Blackberry has a strong customer base of critical infrastructure already, and their pivot from hardware to software means continuous subscription revenue.
* **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as competitor Crowdstrike -** **who it outperforms** **- it would have a stock price of $83.** That's just taking into consideration one aspect of it's business model.
* [Vanguard has doubled their position since Dec 31/2020.](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lzw0pn/vanguard_is_bullish_on_bb/)

# TL;DR: üöÄüöÄüöÄ BB is going past the moon and into Alpha Centauri. This company is so much more than a meme stock or a short term squeeze - it's a life changing opportunity. When BlackBerry starts getting IVY revenue, $20 will look like a joke and you'll have to explain to your wife's boyfriend why you didn't get in under $14 when you had the chance.

# Positions:

* 2000 shares @ $11.20
* 50 1/20/23 $40c
* 50 1/20/23 $25c
* 10 1/20/23 $10c
* 20 6/11/21 $30 covered calls

# BIG EDIT:

**I was asked about the bear case for BB. It's important to understand the risks of investing, and I'm not so in love with this stock that I'm blind, so here's the bear case:**

* A lot of investors have been underwhelmed by revenue so far, and BlackBerry missed their expectations for Q4 2020. But it's worth noting the reason for buying BlackBerry right now is that when IVY revenue starts rolling in these concerns will wash away. It's a longer term play, similar to Palantir.
* The bull case assumes CEO John Chen's estimate of being able to get roughly $500m for their patents is correct. If they get less than expected for that side of their business, or keep the patents and aren't able to monetize them in a meaningful way, that would be less than ideal.
* The Facebook settlement could end up being more like 500m than the 2bn+ that's expected.
* They could be passed in the cybersecurity field before they are able to leverage their current best in class service. This one is really unlikely considering how many other companies have tried to make products equivalent to what BlackBerry has - and failed.
* EV companies could end up making their own OS and data services to resist IVY adoption. Several are trying (Tesla always comes in this conversation as an example), but from everything I've read none have managed to make as safe and comprehensive a system as BlackBerry.

So, *if* IVY doesn't get adopted, they're no longer the leading cybersecurity company, their lawsuit is for less money than expected, and their patents are actually worthless - then BlackBerry is only a little undervalued instead of incredibly undervalued.

**Here's the most meaningful bear case right now though, and how the bulls can beat it:**

There seems to be a lot of upward resistance. Establishments, institutions, etc. are all convinced BB is a failed phone company stock worth $10. When it rises, large financial players short (because they believe they can buy back for $10 or less), buy puts, or just scalp to try and capitalize on the volatility which in turn creates a lot of resistance and breaks momentum.

I don't think there's any conspiracy, I think the big players are just incompetent. These are pretty normal pullbacks and reactions to a stock that's gaining so quickly. The problem is that those big financial players I mentioned (as well as a lot of people on WSB) don't understand *why* this stock is so desirable. They just think it's a meme stock that's being pumped and don't understand the potential of: A) Becoming an essential step of EV manufacturing; B) Being best in class security during an age of ransomware attacks. So instead of getting in and riding the momentum, they create a self fulfilling prophecy of pullbacks.

**The bulls can win the same way we've won in GME and AMC - by buying and holding. Continued days of large volume will completely fuck the bears who started taking huge short positions last week, leading to even bigger price movement. Buying shares or LEAPS and being patient is the way to play it and win big.** The bears win when bulls waste all their capital buying FDs that have no chance of finishing ITM or when they see a dip and paper hand their shares. It's funny to watch people freak out at a $2 dip when they easily could have just hedged that with a deep OTM weekly covered call. **Buy** ‚û°Ô∏è **Hold** ‚û°Ô∏è  **Yacht**

Regardless of the resistance that exists at the moment, there will come a day when big finance starts racing to get in on BB - and they'll pretend they were right all along. We've seen it constantly in tech stocks over the past few years. WSB can just expedite the inevitable by getting in on BB while it's still incredibly cheap."

After Friday's action, the conclusion is no, but let's look at the chart and see what's going on.

What happened on Friday:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x2wmukqxbp371.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=01459ffc0e98d47ef446f563fcf853f0fff36af1

The first real red day in 2 weeks lost support at the $14.50 USD mark but also had reduced volume. Can't win them all. We should consider this pullback extremely healthy and does not interfere with the overall bull trend as we were exceeding the Bollinger bands for 5 straight trading days. Exceeding the Bollinger bands is considered to be a strong indicator of volatility, and I strongly believe we have more volatility to come. I would also assume traders were taking their anywhere from 60%-100% profits off the table.

We did not bounce back up to the $24-$33 range as I expected on Friday, but again opinions are like assholes. Everyone has one. I believe that range is easily accessible still through this coming trading week.

Signs that make me bearish:  
\-1D chart RSI is still quite high but is reaching back into a healthy range.  
\-Lower volume Friday. But the overall market was low and red so I'm not too concerned.  
\-Gap to be filled on the chart. \~$11.56-12.30. Usually, gaps do get filled on charts but not always in the short term.  
\-Loss of the 14.50 support. On the hourly chart we had a small bounce in that range on Thursday after the massive opening and slightly recovered, a bounce again just after open on Friday but ultimately failed for the rest of the day. This is a volume issue and many taking profits/losses trying to swing trade.  
\-Possibility of reaching $12.10, if that fails next stop is probably \~$11.30

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nvjhe4fybp371.png?width=1811&format=png&auto=webp&s=817de62d8aedc2eacb1a9bcbbb5e3ac73bf1a80e

These are the bearish signals that I can find and are important to note but again the overall bull trend still exists on a daily, and when in doubt zoom out is the motto. One bad day does not mean you have a bad life.

Signs that make me bullish:  
\-We ended the day inside the top end of the Bollinger bands and they appear to not be contracting yet on the daily chart.  
\-20 DMA and 50DMA have just crossed. This is called a golden cross and the 200DMA is now beginning to slope upwards.  
\-Large amount of strength in the $13.00 range. If you look back at the hourly chart above where we ended Friday you can see where it is flat in comparison to on Wednesday. This shows strong support in this range and will be a powerful foundation to build a cup and handle formation. This range was also significant in the previous run in January

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qj063yzybp371.png?width=1868&format=png&auto=webp&s=703841beac1005b97a1849c19ddc18187fee799f

\-Still a large following and people interested in $BB this weekend across forums, subreddits, and media. #1 ticker on WSB Thursday and Friday.  
\-Largest open interest of stock options is $20 USD.  
\-Put/call ratio still relatively low  
\-Small short shares available (Squeeze is in the realm of possibilities again)  
\-RSI looks healthy on the hourly for a dead cat bounce at open  
\-Currently, one of the best plays technically speaking but also fundamentally for the long term (1-2 years+).  
\-I have confirmation bias because cybersecurity is a massive growth market. If you didn't hear, JBS is the world's largest supplier of beef, and got hacked might actually cause a shortage of beef in the supermarkets or a large squeeze in beef prices. Go long on beef and cybersecurity.  
\-Institutions are still accumulating. Remember, around 48% of BB is owned by institutions and insiders. This is massive. One of the largest companies with large institutional ownership is Microsoft at \~70% or Facebook with an %80. We aren't that far off with a much much lower share count.

If the share price goes down significantly tomorrow I'll post another update, only because if the share price goes down with such a small amount of short shares available I believe this will only be tightening the slingshot further that would rocket $BB's share price to the $30s.

Things that we need to continue to look for:  
\-High volume  
\-Amount of posts and articles about $BB on Reddit, commercial websites, and other forums  
\-News or statements from $BB. One piece of news that's significant could be the catalyst to a moonshot.

This week's price target remains the same as what I wanted on Friday. Anywhere $24-$33USD.

Take care, and stay healthy. Go drink some water, please."

What I love here is that the story keeps getting better and better by the day and so do the technicals...

Literally today the company announced another acquisition

Short volume is also decreasing significantly... and I assume the available shares to short are decreasing a lot meaning the cost to borrow is increasing (maybe someone could confirm that?)...

Short Volume summary:

Technicals are also looking very strong. We are seeing the same 3-4 month consolidation period that we saw before the prior ATHs -

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q912k26i32371.png?width=1342&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e7f1cda44856259a7dd4d06a08d84b19ce39796

Apr - August 2020 before the stock went from $3-$8.6 // Nov 2020 - Feb 2021 before it went from $6-$10 // and now we are in another consolidation period... With the fundamentals getting better and better by the day and the chart holding it's ground I still think it's lining up for the next major move.

Since the market has re stabilized in the last 2 weeks the chart has gotten even more interesting. Take a look at this massive bull flag forming on the 10day 30min. Pay attention to the RSI as well... Back above 50 now.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/shbufyhk32371.png?width=1346&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ad73009f13ff978a2495d4f2af88ec2ab3b281

Now without the lines to keep it clean. Look at that 200day SMA support. It's now found support on the 20day SMA and is breaking through its 50 day... Very important it broke these levels. Bulls are winning.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6k6x23im32371.png?width=1344&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e56ebd40497e55ad19ba3e3032d0dda5a2ca5b8

Short term price action is super bullish. Broke through all major moving averages and is now trying to break out of this range.

&#x200B;

If the historic timeline is accurate (which it seems to be lining up with) then I'm super excited to hopefully watch this come out of its consolidation period over the next few months.

If you really zoom out (Weekly) you can see we found our support over the last 3 weeks. Take a look at the hammer we are forming this week. Literally one of the most basic bullish reversal signals. Not to mention the stochastic & RSI are extremely oversold but showing some bullish divergence.

nqxmty,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nqxmty/the_weekly_dd_corsair_gaming_crsr_rise_of_the/,The Weekly DD - Corsair Gaming (CRSR): Rise of The Gamers,124,12,2021-06-03 06:02:22," The video game industry has taken off since the pandemic and is expected to reach a value of \~**$290 billion by 2026**. How does this compare to the global box office industry? From 2019 to 2020 we saw revenues shift in the following:

**2019 -> 2020**

*Global Box Office*

\~42 billion (all-time-record) -> \~11.5 billion

*Gaming Industry*

\~152 billion -> \~164 billion

That‚Äôs right, in 2019 (pre-pandemic) the gaming industry was already over 3.5x the size of the box office entertainment industry and over 14x in 2020\*. Gaming‚Äôs 2020 growth outperformed the growth of both movies and sports combined ([source](https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/video-games-2020-revenues-outpace-movies-sports#:~:text=A%2520new%2520report%2520from%2520MarketWatch,both%2520movies%2520and%2520sports%2520combined.)).

There is a shift in the ecosystem from gaming for fun to becoming more of a social event, ie: hanging with friends *while* playing video games for the hobbyist gamer, and streaming for the professionals. Gaming, once thought to be an activity for the young, has proliferated through all age groups and demographics. In 2020, 64% of all American adults (214.4 million people) played video games ([source](https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/15/esa-ceo-64-of-u-s-adults-are-gamers-46-of-players-are-women-older-people-are-playing-more/))

https://preview.redd.it/mhmyyow5dx271.png?width=1172&format=png&auto=webp&s=30ab577faef9b2abdd438edf9162b5e372a76063

&#x200B;

Check out evolution of streaming platforms since the Pandemic. Out of the top 3 competitors (Twitch, Youtube, Facebook) Twitch was the clear winner here with users streaming and revenues jumping significantly. This massive expansion of total addressable market (TAM) is most likely a one time occurrence, but the gaming industry is still expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of roughly 11% moving forward.

**eSports**

Another beneficiary of the gaming industry boom, which is not talked about enough nor well-understood by many, are eSports. Essentially, eSports are gaming competitions that offer cash as prizes and draw YUGE crowds. The eSports industry alone is set to surpass \~1.1 billion in revenues in 2021, a 14% growth from 2020‚Äôs \~950 million. To put things in perspective some of the top eSports events compete with the US Open Tennis and US Open Golf tournaments where the winner takes home *millions* of dollars.

**Enters Corsair Gaming (CRSR)**

What is Corsair Gaming (CRSR)? They are a designer and manufacturer of high-end gear for all things PC gaming. They offer four different segments of products, almost all of which have 5-star ratings on Amazon.

&#x200B;

1. PC peripherals: keyboards, headsets, mice, mousepads, chais, etc.
2. Streaming equipment: green screens, capture cards, microphones.
3. PC components: almost anything outside the graphics card that can be found inside the PC tower (the big metal box that the computer is made of).
4. Gaming PCs for those that don‚Äôt want to self-customize their own.

**Corsair - Outlook**

With the rise of gaming comes new opportunity for CRSR to expand its sales. In 2021, the PC gaming market was estimated to be $45.5B with \~50% of all gamers using a PC to play video games ([source](https://fortunly.com/statistics/video-game-industry-statistics/)). This creates a very opportune market for those who can provide value to the PC gamer.

The target market who purchases peripherals are a passionate, well-researched group with access to many other brands. Therefore, only a well-liked (and popular) brand can succeed in this market ([source](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/gaming-peripheral-branding-data-brands-consumer-research/)). Thus, the market advantages large incumbents over smaller up-and-comers. Their brand value is also obvious in the premiums that their brand allows them to charge. Their gaming components and systems products, which they are currently the market leader, demands an average of \~40% premiums compared to their competitors! This means their products cost 40% more, on average, than their competitors and they are still out-selling them.

**Final Thoughts**

Given the rapid growth of the gaming industry boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic, CRSR is on track to capture a large segment of this growth and expand its business as a result. However, CRSR is not expected to have any massive shifts in its business nor do their growth strategies include any drastic changes to their current strategy. Corsair is a premium brand with solid market penetration. Although they may not experience the same explosive from 2019 to 2020, they are in a great position to remain a market leader in a fast-growing industry.

**Positions:** None right now, but I've sold puts on CRSR over the last 6 months. Will be selling again on next red day."

npdb1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/npdb1j/z_will_disrupt_most_aspects_of_the_industry_that/,$Z will disrupt most aspects of the industry that has one of the biggest addressable markets (TAM),151,80,2021-06-01 05:02:59,"I am in the daily thread way too much and I have heard many times that many folks would like to see more quality DD on non-MEME stonks.  I stated a couple weeks ago that I was going to do one on Zillow.  I was able to stop shit posting just long enough to give this a try.

I will include some numbers and links to most everything I lay out in this post, but much of will be anecdotal along with just how much I personally think of the company overall and how I use it. I am not a TA guy personally but do like trends.  

$Z is ubiquitous to real estate (RE) as is $GOOG to search and $ZM for video conferencing.  It has grown and become a part of pop culture https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEfsaXDX0UQ I am also in the insurance business and the top search result anytime you enter a physical address in Google the $Z listing for the property is the top result and we can glean any information needed to be3 able to do an accurate home insurance quote.  With the shortage in the housing market, people and families moving more, and the work from home trend continuing, $Z will be at the forefront of the change and disruption that I believe will only accelerate at a pace that will surprise many in my opinion.  

The first disruption I will cover is $Z Property Manager.  From my own personal experience, it is the greatest thing to come along.  I have moved houses in the same city 6 times in 10 years, was in the lake cabin market for many of those years along w having 5 rental properties.  First, the marketing alone from $Z has provided the best and most quality applicants for the rental units.  $Z simultaneously puts your property on $Z, Trulia, and Hot Spots.  Craigslist is nonexistent in this space now (at least in my area) and while $FB marketplace is decent; it does not come close to competing w $Z.  Last 8 tenants have all come from $Z marketing.  It does not stop there either.  Once you get an applicant $Z rental manager allows you take applications, accept applications, and once accepted set up all payments electronically ‚Äì all online and seamlessly.  They will even screen applicants for public records, credit, and criminal history.  The lease process is so simple using your own documents and easily insert data, initials, and signatures wherever needed.  $Z is now charging (monetizing) the marketing of rentals and I have no doubt they will be able to do so more for all facets of the rental process and I would not blink an eye as long as it is reasonable.  Mobile app is easy to use for all parties from my experience.  Customer service has been top notch on the 3 occasions I have had any questions. https://www.zillow.com/rental-manager/

The numbers have been fantastic.  $Z acquired it‚Äôs closest competitor Trulia in 2015 https://www.inman.com/2015/02/17/zillow-trulia-merger-closes/ $Z is coming out of the hyper growth at all costs phase of their business and is now actually making revenue while at the same time still plowing billions back into their business and growing sectors and disruptors at an alarming rate.  $Z current share prices is $117.32, off 43.6% its 52 week high of $208.11.

$Z reported 4th Q 2/10/21 and absolute blew past any and all expectations.  My rough research had $Z moving from about $164 to $194 on this report and it had ran up nicely up to earnings.  In my opinion, it then sold off after this in the general tech sell off that started very close to this reporting date.  I wont list all the numbers here, but here they are for you to peruse https://investors.zillowgroup.com/investors/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/Zillow-Group-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results/default.aspx

$Z Q1 2021 earnings report was another beast of a report in my opinion, especially the EPS of $.44 beating expectations by 83% https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/zillow-group-zg-q1-earnings-revenues-beat-estimates-2021-05-05

I believe in addition to what is laid out here, that $Z will disrupt how RE is transacted in the future w iBuying division https://blog.qualia.com/spencer-rascoff-zillow/ , but not only that $Z could disrupt the appraisal industry and mortgage industry in the future as well.  I believe all these sectors need to change and that $Z will be the lead agent to do so.

$Z share price has not been this low since Dec 2020, it looks like it has consolidated to me and ready to run and never look back.  TipRanks has an analyst price target of $172.62, an increase of 46% from current share price https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/zg/earnings-calendar YahooFinance! has a 2.2 buy rating and a price target of $184.56, representing an increase of 57.3% over current share price  https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/Z?p=Z&.tsrc=fin-srch

Obviously, there is way more information out there and analysis then provided for in here, but I wanted to do a DD on something I believe in that isn‚Äôt mentioned on WSB much that I have seen and I believe has tremendous long term viability and growth ahead of it.
Don‚Äôt ever invest based on what some dude on the internet says and I have been long in $Z for a long time and plan to only grow that position:
Sold some shares over a week ago to buy a LEAPS Jan 2023 $100 strike and have 50 shares.  Plan is to sell CCs over the LEAPS at some point and to pick up more shares/LEAPS.

I have been compiling this long enough and time to go grill some steaks.  Good luck!

Every single article is about how he tweeted at papa Musk and how he thinks that the company is the worst thing since he dropped his glass eye into his cat's litter box.

He doesn't think that Tesla will implode. He doesn't think it's a failing company. He just sees the reality, which is that all of their profits/revenues are way in the future.

Let's just say you win a time-delayed lottery and get $1,000,000 in 15 years. Not bad! Now let's say you won the same lottery in Venezuela in 2005. It's not even worth cashing the ticket.

It's the same deal with companies. Growth companies, however promising, have most of their expected profits in the future. Those profits have to be discounted by the **interest rate** to be turned into todays dollars. In other words, it doesn't matter how much money Tesla is going to make in the future if interest rates surge today. Well... it does matter... it's just worth a lot less.

So how does this relate to the Burry bet? You just have to scroll down a few lines on his 13F filing.

Burry has almost as many GOOG/FB calls as he does TSLA puts. Around \~$330MM of them. Why does this matter? These are big tech companies that are actually printing out metric shit-tons of profit today.

Interest rates stay the same but big tech goes up? Break even. Big tech goes down? Break even. Interest rates rise? Burry makes more money in a year than all of your wives boyfriends combined.

TL;DR:

The Burry TSLA short isn't a bet against Tesla, it's a bet on interest rates rising (AKA inflation)."

Forget that Blackberry is a phone company. Blackberry is a growth late stage start up that utilizes the logistics and patents of an old phone company

Black berry‚Äôs forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let‚Äôs start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It‚Äôs essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars‚Äô software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla‚Äôs self driving cars, they‚Äôll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It‚Äôs confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It‚Äôs cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That‚Äôs $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

This stock is a deep fucking value"

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy."

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

My positions: ~$21k Western Digital, ~$6k Seagate"

**In short, they are still growing on most segments, the CEO does smart acquisitions (usually at a bit of a premium).**

\--The Business--

Microsoft is a technology titan focused on commercial and industrial applications with software and solutions such as Office 365, Azure, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, Linkedin, Windows 10. They also provide platforms for developers via Visual Studio Code and Github. A smaller segment of Microsoft are their devices and their games division powered by Xbox.

**--Next Moves: Healthcare Applications--**

The healthcare sector is characterized by massive bureaucracy¬†and opportunities for growth. It is one of the rare sectors where real future growth is possible by innovation. Microsoft has established itself as a corporate and industry suite, but now it seems that they are taking their whole Eco-system and moving on the healthcare industry.

This is pure speculation, but it can be one of the boldest moves yet, as healthcare facilities, operations, education, training, quality control are large complex systems that can benefit from the tools and services that the company offers.

We have seen Microsoft positioning for a certain client type and taking over most of their business. As the opportunities for growth in the corporate sector decrease, Microsoft might just turn to one of the most complex industries with high barriers¬†to entry and large upfront investment costs.

On 11 April 2021 they entered into an agreement to acquire Nuance Communications for $ 56 per share, or $19.7 Billion. Nuance is a cloud and artificial intelligence (‚ÄúAI‚Äù) software provider with healthcare and enterprise AI experience, and the acquisition will build on our industry-specific cloud offerings.¬†This is effectively their foot in the door to the healthcare industry.

**--Value--**

I think that the company is trading around its intrinsic value, with potential for growth in the future. There is inflation related market risk that can push down value, but with proper management and pricing flexibility they can at least sustain current value levels.

Microsoft solidified the cloud for the corporate & business sector, and decreased the risk of their sales by adopting a continuous subscription model for most of their services.

Their business model seems to be growth trough innovation as they are positioning themselves precisely in segments where innovation is lacking and are integrating those segments within their high-barrier to entry, complex systems.

\--**Product Breakdown--**

AZURE:  The backbone of the productivity suite for most of the western corporations 

Office:  Stabilized revenues for essential business tools

Windows 10:  Declining bloatware built upon old architecture 

LinkedIn:  Well positioned, profitable social network with long-term commuted¬†users 

Dynamics/Viva:  A major competitor for CRM/ERP market-share¬†with potential for innovation 

PowerApps:  The future tool for cutting operating expenses and bureaucracy¬†for companies 

Devices: Uncertain potential for a better experience for Windows users. Augmented reality done right with industry application

GitHub, VS Code:  The platforms that will keep MSFT on the cutting edge of development tech

Gaming/Xbox: Large but risky potential for growth if the devices and games are improved

Microsoft has a wide and complex set of products and services which can be understood as cost cutting tools for businesses, system architecture utilities, productivity and effectiveness tools. 

They have created a well-thought off interconnected Eco-system that is nothing like the company was even five years ago.

It is now apparent that they are well positioned as a market leader for industrial and business applications and will further solidify their position in the future.

\--Competition--

We are already witnessing the convergence of competitive advantages between the technology titans of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and it is clear that all of them are fighting for market share in similar technologies and industries. 

It seems that every company is fighting for their specific industry positioning within technology. For example, Facebook, Microsoft and Google all experiment with Virtual Reality tools such as Google Glass, Oculus Rift and the HoloLens Headset from Microsoft. However MSFT seems to be the most successful as it is positioning for industrial, military and hybrid workspace applications for the headset - the others had less luck in the consumer/gaming sector application of VR.

Google, Amazon and Microsoft are likewise competing for cloud dominance, where Amazon AWS is positioning as a cost effective player for developers, MSFT is positioning as a stable and secure platform for companies and Google is positioning as an advanced cutting edge option for new technologies and companies that are able to scale.

The last example is between MSFT and GOOGL where they competed for the use of virtual conference apps driven by the new hybrid work culture from the pandemic. Both of the competitors had a variant starting off, MSFT had Skype/Teams, and Google had Hangouts/Meet. It is evident that Microsoft had the right approach with Teams and took over the commercial sector for online communication. Side note, Skype is a drain on the Microsoft brand since the appearance of the pretend close feature. It is irredeemable and should be retired.

DISCLAIMER: I do not own a MSFT position, I am planning to go long on MSFT next week.

This material is for educational purposes only.

**TL;DR:** Civilians can trade with high leverage (over 6x) in risk-based portfolios (or portfolio margin accounts). There is no magic to it, and the risk can be LOWER than trading at 4-6x using directional leverage (CFDs or Total Return Swaps). Using net credit option trades to do it increases the difficulty and requires time spent actively in the account every day the market is open. The charts show you how bumpy it can be day to day. More on this below.

**Introduction**

Three weeks ago I posted something similar about chasing convexity and using risk management (specifically, hedging) to increase leverage in a portfolio margin account. I did not expect the smart questions and comments I got then, so this is Part Three (these posts started over a year ago). I will provide a summary of pros and cons from trading using this approach as I am moving to new things. It is unlikely to post about it anymore, the topic is exhausted as far as I am concerned.

**Prerequisites**

This is a list of phrases to research, the best I can come up with while writing this post:

option pricing

option strategies

dynamic hedging

portfolio margin

TIMS margin

margin stress test

risk convexity

weighted vega

option market makers strategies

long term short term capital gains tax

You also need to be comfortable with macro economics, financial analysis and valuation methods, monetary and fiscal policy, SEC/FINRA/exchange rules and goes without saying, you need to use portfolio margin.

**Core trade concept**

You need to think of cash and volatility as assets. When you make a trade, you swap assets (stocks, options, futures, FOPs, indexes, cash). You can be long or short assets.

Your portfolio has to be designed in such a way it is ""balanced"" at spot. Search ""delta neutral"" as a proxy to grasp the concept.

Research ""long short strategy"". That should give you examples of balancing a portfolio.

A lot of hedging strategies (and a market maker specifically, delta hedging) are about protecting the PnL.

I look at my account from three angles:

1. PnL
2. Risk (margin requirements)
3. Tax liability

There is no freely available opportunity to structure a trade in the public markets where all three are protected from downside risk aka ""free lunch"". In order to get value from this post you need to accept that first.

You can however focus on two out of the three above, and disregard or postpone dealing with the third.

My personal priority order has always been Risk, Tax Liability, PnL. As long as you don't need to realize losses or are forced into liquidation, PnL volatility can be ignored. This is easier said than done - you need mental game and conviction to handle the drawdowns.

In summary, to achieve high leverage and low risk while chasing convex returns you will experience stress and delayed gratification. This is the price.

**Application**

You must do fundamental research (analysis) and identify assets that have relatively high share price, are marginable, experience high volatility and have a deep, liquid option chain available for you to trade. It is essential that you choose something with a hard floor on value (NAV > zero from an accounting point of view).

Examples: $SPY, $TSLA, $SQ, $GOOG, $FB, $MRNA etc.

An options straddle (buy a call and a put contract with the same strike and expiration) is the simplest example of a positive convexity risk profile. You can use the put/call parity formula C - P = S - K to define a convex trade including long and short options across the term plus a position in the underlying. For extra benefit, you can try to define the options structure in such a way it's net credit (you collect more premium from short legs expiring worthless than you pay for the long legs).

The long/short aspect of the portfolio comes from exploring the concept of being long the underlying and short the same using options (synthetic short, risk reversal, ratios etc). Since you are not focused on delta hedging (being market neutral) at all times, the profit comes from having a view on the underlying direction (for example delta positive for a bull view).

The leverage is the result of managing risk. Think of finance as the ""art of pricing risk"". When you add a position to your portfolio margin, it will increase you collateral requirements if you take on more risk or decrease them if you achieve the opposite. Leverage is just a number - the ratio between the gross position value and the net liquidation value in mark-to-market terms of your positions. One dollar of liquidation value in assets can in my case controls almost 30 dollars of market exposure (long+short).

If you got this far you should have understood already that this leverage is not linear. Nor are your potential returns if the position has positive convexity like I am showing you below from my account (screenshots from my Interactive Brokers TWS interface and the FundSeeder connected account).

**Pros**

You can use this approach to build a bigger position that you would normally control in the market. The dynamic adjustment (hedging), cost of transactions and time commitment plus the margin cost (I am paying approximately 22bps above the 10Y treasury note rate at the time of writing) must be factored in.

You have a certain amount of delta hedging around spot...but as the account becomes larger and more complex, the tradeoff between the three components mentioned above is more obvious. There will be move volatility in your PnL than in your underlyings, at times. This is actually a **con**.

If any of the underlyings you have exposure to moves aggressively up or down, you profit from it more than 1% for each 100bps move (convexity). If it trades sideway, you should be able to get a some net credit from your premium writing.

**Cons**

Any trading strategy works until it doesn't. For example if rates go up, or volatility across the market goes down, this loses its effectiveness and operators have to adapt or experience low performance or losses.

A position using both stock and options which capture different levels of implied volatility across the term has to be entered over time. Liquidating the account, extricating yourself from the daily management can be a complex project with unmitigated risks (if market moves aggressively while unwinding positions).

Same applies to margin calls - while the broker usually does a stellar job trimming down your positions to bring the risk down, it does not have the mandate to open new contracts. Letting them run unsupervised in a high leverage setup can mean dealing with a small crisis now in the wrong way can set the scene for a massive blowout at the next one, maybe in the next minute.

The skill, time and mental game requirements make any succession planning difficult. Finding a buddy to take over for you can lead some to posting at length on public forums.

**Conclusion**

The charts are speaking for themselves. High NLV volatility, massive recent drawdown (but no realized losses). If trading tech (I call them controversial) stocks like me, it's worth putting the past couple of weeks in context. The broad index is fine. All the high beta tech stuff that has no multiple support is getting wrecked. Hedge Funds long, retail long, ARKK long. Mix of unwinds and shorts pressing coupled with exogenous factors like Prime Brokers tightening control after the Archegos disaster are just amplifying the noise. Fiscal and monetary policy is accommodating, but the new tax policy will have an impact on high risk assets even if not enacted. Fed and Treasury working well, pay attention to what they do not what they say (Daily Treasury Statement, FRED, H.8).

Reopening the economy is the current theme. The supply chain disruption playing on the front month of commodity futures prices is expected, but you want to apply critical thinking when you hear the argument for ""inflation"". Another phrase to google and do deep research on. Mainstream media is not the ideal place to get financial education.

This is it.. written in a single go... I'm not selling a strategy, I am not an educator, I am sharing because explaining things, scrutinizing the HOW and WHY are the best ways I know to invite critical thinking and overcome your blind spots.

Massively thankful to WSB and Reddit for giving me the chance to meet some amazing people and learn so much along the way.

Reading this won't take long and you can go back to using your lunch breaks to give discounted blowjobs next to the dumpster to support your ""grind.""

I am here to talk about my two favorite plays at the moment which you've either forgotten since reading it in the post title or you're just too retarded to know the tickers. It's fucking Academy Sports and Clean energy. If you just spat out your fresh semen and crayon lunch then pop an Adderall and try to decipher the symbols on your screen that make up the English alphabet. If you need help download a synthetic voice text-to-speech program and have it read to you. If that still doesn't work, you are actually retarded and should go seek immediate help. Clip your helmets chin strap and text your wife's boyfriend to come pick her up this time so you don't get distracted by the moaning and macaroni noises in the bedroom.

First one, Academy Sports. Most of you unwashed neckbeards probably haven't stepped foot in an Academy Sports store because it promotes doing things outdoors. You'd just waltz around feeling guilty for gaining another 40 pounds during Covid and purchase a DD sports bra for your ""girlfriend"" even though the cute cashier knows you reek of desperation, she can even smell it with her mask on. It's okay because your card is going to be declined and you'll shamefully walk out while the repulsed cashier attempts to scrub your Cheeto dust and dandruff from the nooks and crannies of the card reader.

Academy Sports is an American sporting goods store chain. We are all well aware of the effects that Covid had on retail during 2020 and know it's been a total shit show. Academy reported earnings on March 30th and somehow, these motherfuckers blew the roof off.

 ‚Ä¢ Fourth Quarter and Full Year Comparable Sales Increased 16.1%

 ‚Ä¢ Fourth Quarter Gross Margin Rate Expanded 420 basis points over Q4 2019

 ‚Ä¢ Full Year Net Income Increased 157.2% over 2019 to $308.8 million

How did they do it? I have no fucking clue. Their e-commerce sales increased by a cool and modest 60.7%. Where the fuck did this demand come from? Looks like you guys were sitting around in your moldy basements jerking off to some other retard's gain porn while too ashamed to post your loss porn, and Academy Sports was out there busting loads on faces and you just wait on your knees and take them to the forehead, eyes wide open. (Makes no sense, you sick fucks act like getting sperm in your eyes is something you can add to a resume since you ""watched a lot of kids"") Anyways, here's an excerpt.

""While many of our categories benefited from the COVID-19 crisis, several of our key businesses such as licensed apparel, team sports equipment, apparel and footwear and back-to-school were adversely impacted and should return to normal this year. In addition to each of these businesses driving sales growth, they are all margin rate-accretive and should drive a return to a more traditional mix of sales. Fourth, we will improve our management of several seasonal categories where there are not worldwide inventory shortages, but where our initial inventory buy in 2020 was not enough to meet the strong demand. This year, we have modified our planning and allocation on products like grills and water sports to support additional sales compared to their normal trend line.

As we begin 2021, we are confident that we can continue to deliver strong results because of our incredible team, the continued development of our key initiatives, and the stronger, deeper relationships we have built with our customers. The company is providing the following estimate for fiscal 2021. Comparable sales are forecast to range from up 2% to down 2%. This is an 18% to 14% increase on a two year stacked basis.""

Okay great, so people bought a lot of workout equipment. Who cares? What you semen suckers fail to understand, is that some guys were able to find a woman that is attracted to them in a way that they will ACTUALLY have sex with them and sometimes that results in kids. Those kids have been at home all fucking year and their parents want them out of the house so they can fuck on the kitchen table again. Ding ding, those rusty gears in your seemingly empty head are starting to grind. Yes wow, vaccines are starting to become mainstream and everybody is pent up at home with their crotch goblins. Enter every single recreational sport available. Beyond boosts in kids sports equipment that we will probably see (this part of my DD is literally just my personal social media feed where everybody on Facebook and Instagram is doing anything in their power to get the kids out of the house and bragging about it) we are obviously going into outdoor season. That means camping, vacations swimming and other things people with active and healthy lifestyles do. Academy Sports has it all. Tents, grills, coolers, clothing, swimsuits, fishing gear, canoes, sleeping bags. Do me a favor, walk into an Academy Sports store and look at the demand for yourself.

I obviously expect that Academy Sports will continue to exceed expectations and I am not the only one. Show me another stock with a 100% buy rating and if you're too lazy, type in ASO on Robinhood and look for yourself. Now I'm going to get into the most interesting part. ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts. blew away earnings during a pandemic and has amazing financials and a healthy balance sheet. It's kind of weird that it is 9th on the most shorted stock list when every other company on that list looks like it could use some adrenaline shots or life support. ASO was previously the most shorted stock on the market a few weeks ago. If I had a guess, it looks like shorters realized they shorted a company that didn't deserve to be, and they want to cover before wallstreetbets gets a sniff of it. Oops, it's too late now.

Dick's Sporting Goods is trading at a PE ratio of 14 and has a short interest of 16%. Academy Sports is sitting at an SI of 33.62% and a PE ratio of 8. Seems a little bit fishy to me and smells like a ripe vagina is wafting the room. What could these large funds know that we don't? Hmmm.. let's try nothing and the fact that they were hoping to capitalize on another seemingly Covid ravaged retailer. (Does this remind you of anything else?) I am not going to sell this to you as a short squeeze because those only happen when you have a very tight float on a company where buyers start jumping in droves while short sellers are already underwater in their positions. Also interesting because at the end of March it went from around $24.50 to around $32.00 and the price hasn't gone below $28.39. Also of note, the average 10 day trading volume for ASO is 1.584M. The entire float is 40,436,703 shares with 33.62% of the float shorted, leaves you 13,594,583 shares short. That gives you 9 days to cover with average volume if they did nothing but buy and were the only ones doing so. Do what you will with that information or go do the math yourself. To me, it looks like some retards with a lot of capital put themselves in another bad situation. (Most recent rating from a JP Morgan analyst moves it from $32 to $35. If you're comparing companies in the same sector, who would you prefer to make your long AND short bets on? Operating income of Academy Sports at 129M in 2019, 222M in 2020 and 424M in 2021 with a smaller PE ratio, or Dick's with 445M in 2019, 409M in 2020, or 741M in 2021 and a PE ratio twice that of the former?

I already know you little asshats get mad when you see a DD on a stock only after it's up 150% for the week, but this is one of those times when this post was made while the stock is down 3% for the week and up 10% for the month.

I do also want to give some credit to /u/XionTG for the predictions below that he made a month ago. They turned out to be spot on, even though he got a lot of flack in the comments.

Predictions:

My Target Prices

First short-term target price: $30 by 5/1

Second short-term target price: $60 by 7/1

(You can see his original DD here but I will warn you degenerate retards that this DD is from the r-investing crowd so don't pucker your asshole up too tight or your heads might explode and your balls could drop).

Next one, CLNE (Clean Energy)

""Clean Energy is changing the way the world fuels its vehicles. Reducing pollution from the transportation industry is an important goal for our nation, and we at Clean Energy know just how realistic and attainable that goal is with natural gas fuel.

Moving forward in our thinking as well as in our vehicles means a safer, healthier planet for all of us. This change is happening. Natural gas is abundant and economically viable and is increasingly being adopted as transportation fuel by countries around the world.""

Hmmm, I can't even begin to imagine what type of political administration or historical time (notably marked by unprecedented climate change) when a company providing an alternative to diesel, especially one that is clean and readily available, could POSSIBLY flourish. I was a truck driver for some time and pumped over $500 dollars of fuel into my semi each day. Looking over the finances, fuel prices accounted for 20% more than the cost of the 2 drivers to work over the road on a weekly basis. Fuel is generally the highest percentage of operating costs in the freight transportation business. We are set to enter into a period of economic recovery and anyone with half a brain synapse knows freight transportation is at the heart of industry. Not that this is entirely related, but Amazon just posted a round of earnings that once again, exceeded expectations. Amazon's sales increased by a modest 44 fucking percent. Why does it matter? Shut the fuck up and keep reading. ""[Clean Energy] signed an agreement with Amazon to provide low and negative carbon renewable natural gas, as 27 of its existing fueling stations and another 19 new or upgraded stations."" Yeah you read that correctly, Amazon sales blow the fuck up and they have found a place that they can cut operating costs and it just so happens to be through a partnership with the only other company that has the infrastructure to support them in this endeavor. It goes without saying that the current administration is going to be pushing for renewable and clean energy harder than your wife threw you out of the house when her boyfriend showed up with a bottle of lube and his extra thick cock ring.

Also noteworthy.

""UPS Makes Largest Purchase of Renewable Natural Gas Ever in the U.S.

Seven-Year 170 Million Gallon Equivalents Purchase from Clean Energy Fuels Corp. Will Reduce GHG Emissions by More than 1 Million Metric Tons."" Go look at their press releases if you want to see their other partnerships.

I have attached another DD done by /u/twenty98 about CLNE that was well done. We also know that /u/NrdRage made a very good DD as well so go read it because I'm not going to retype it and in any way attempt to take credit for their work. I am not sitting here saying I love the stock, to be honest, I love the company and what it does. Reducing emissions in one of the industries with an oversized carbon footprint is a home run for me. Just as Tesla and electric vehicles are the future, alternative fuels will fill the gaps where batteries cannot support. 

I don't really care what you spray paint huffing STD riddled idiots do, but in my opinion, both of these companies look like they have more potential than the current share price is demonstrating. CLNE is up 5% for the week and down 22% for the month. For those that figured out MVIS, CLOV and all the other bullshit, the time to buy into something isn't after it's up 120% in two days and Cramer mentions it. Find assets at a less retarded entry point. Good luck and go back to whatever smooth brained moron shit you were doing before seeing this.

That's the end of the post and that's all I got for you. Now you can return to the act of holding your wife's hair while she goes down on your neighbor! Thank me later.

As of 4/29/21, CLOV opened at $11.22 and closed at $10.17 with previous closing price of $10.50 (-3.14%). Clearly, our positive momentum was beat down hard yesterday. This was most likely due to two possible reasons:

* The market displayed a bearish sentiment in general against the medium/small/micro market caps while most of the large market caps was up (ex. FB) which explains why DOW, NASDAQ, and S&P 500 were all up by EOD.
* MVIS crashing hard which caused a ripple effect of panic selling across popular stocks like CLOV, AMC, GME, and MNMD.

&#x200B;

[Daily chart of CLOV](https://preview.redd.it/byclt37gzaw61.png?width=3766&format=png&auto=webp&s=156907323ac0c10051c6051276d9d110e5c4640c)

**Fibonacci retracements:**

Looking at the chart above, Fibonacci retracements clearly show that we failed to cross over the 38.2% resistance level of $11.14 due to the reasons described from the previous paragraph. The 38.2% resistance level will be crucial heading into today's trading session (4/30/21) as crossing over the resistance level would mean we have a high possibility of testing the next resistance level of 50% at $12.34.

If we continue a downward trend today (4/30/21) and go below the support line of $9.65, the 23.6% level will be shifted from being our support to a new resistance level. And of course, that's not a good sign since it would signify that there's a chance for us to reach back to the next support level of $8.53. Based on the historical trend, CLOV has been consolidating at around $8.53 and have been using $8.53 as a major support to bounce off so if this downward trend continues to spiral down, I would expect to see a bounce at $8.53 mark and rally back up.

&#x200B;

**Elliott Wave Theory:**

Based on the Elliott Wave Theory, with yesterday's candle, it seems like we are heading into wave 2 which is a corrective wave. Today's price action will confirm whether we are officially heading towards a wave 2 or not. If today's price action confirms that we are in wave 2, I do NOT expect to see CLOV dipping further than $8.53 based on the explanation provided from the Fibonacci section and expect to see a bounce and reversal pattern to wave 3. In contrast, if today's price action shows a positive momentum, this will be a bear trap which means shorts will get fucked even more.

With wave 3, I expect us to smash past 61.8% resistance level and face a major resistance test at $15.77 area. Wave 3 will be a key area for us to see how far our upside really is, but just know that if we smash past the resistance at $15.77, we will be able to test for 52-wk ATH price of $17.45 again. And if we cross over the 52-wk ATH price, sky is the limit for us and we are all going to the moon.

As for the other waves (wave 4 and wave 5), expect to see an eventual healthy pullback from wave 3 and literally launch off to the fucking Mars by wave 5. I'm going to guess that wave 5 will most likely occur after the Q1 Earnings which is May 17th. That would mean that we will see wave 2 and wave 4 happen within the next 2 weeks. So, expect our journey to the moon to be a bumpy ride but know that the chart is absolutely bullish for the take off.

&#x200B;

**Other:**

* Golden cross pattern detected on the daily chart, highly bullish sentiment.
* RSI is centered out. Depending on today's (4/30) price action, we will find out if we are still in bullish sentiment or heading back to bearish sentiment based on RSI.
* Daily MACD chart is still looking bullish as MACD line is still above the signal line, reinforces the idea that we are still in the bullish phase.
* Triple bottom and we've bounced off every single time, another bullish sentiment.
* All around we are still seeing a lot of bullish indicators. Let's hope that yesterday's price action was a bear trap.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

All this speculation is contingent upon continuous increase in the volume level and buying pressure. Expect a bumpy ride, but based on my TA, we are primed to launch off hard. So, go tell your mom, your dad, your family relatives, and your friends to buy CLOV and hold instead of becoming paper hands and panic sell because if we hold, we are all going to the fucking moon.

**Tl;dr: We are going to the fucking moon, don't be scared of the setbacks and don't panic sell.**

P.S. Please let me know if you guys liked my TA and I might regularly post a TA DD on this sub!

\*EDIT 1: I forgot to say that this is not a financial advice. This TA DD is purely based on speculation and has many contingent factors in order for the speculation to be held true. Please invest into the stock at your own risk. I'm a fellow ape who just wants to see tendies for myself and for everyone else."

Fundamentals & Technicals look 5-Star. Split would add jet fuel. DD below.,126,116,2021-04-30 03:13:36,"Technically it looks like a 5-star set up on a chart heading into their earnings today. Been in a channel for 8 months. Sitting at ATH's right now waiting for a reason to break out. A big earnings beat sends it higher or a split sends it higher. I bought calls before the split rumor so that would just icing on the cake.

Anyone who thinks mega cap companies can't break out look at FB, up 7% today.

I follow lots of hedge fund guys on Twitter and they're all sharing the same article of this hedge fund guy Bill Miller saying AMZN will double in Barron's and they're all just waiting for a reason to send it higher. [https://twitter.com/JGreenwald86/status/1385585022585954311](https://twitter.com/JGreenwald86/status/1385585022585954311)

If there's an earnings beat then over the next few weeks analyst after analyst will trip over each other upgrading their PT's which'll also send it higher. Analysts don't downgrade AMZN. They either keep their previous ratings or they upgrade. [https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn/forecast)

If we get any kind of good news Thursday AMZN will have $4k+ upside in the next month. $5k upside in the next 2 months.

I've done a lot of time doing DD on this and I think it's a rate 5-star situation so I wanted to bring it to the fam. ü¶ç Haven't pitched an idea here before cuz this is the first really 5 star risk/reward bet I've found.

I think calls are the move since we're either in for sideways or üöÄüåï.

As for the Split rumor, if it's true it would be huge. [https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1386734121607745544](https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1386734121607745544)

If there's a 6 to 1 or more split I bet we see +10% tomorrow even on average earnings. If we get an earnings beat plus a split then we're talking a once in a lifetime move for a biz their size - maybe 50% gains in the 1-2 months. **Last time it consolidated this long the leg up was +100% and took 2-3 months**. If they don't have numbers that get them there they will likely play the Split card. They know they need a breakout after the last 8 months and with a new CEO. Their last earnings was actually amazing but the stock didn't go because of the Bezos news. A big reason its stalled is the fact that it's 4k freaking dollars. A split means retail can jump in on shares & call options.

A split isn't needed at all though for a break out. **Keep in mind the split rumor isn't priced in. It popped 0.8% when the rumor broke and then settled back down later the same day.**

The last thing that needed to fall into place was yield expectations for the next month and Powell's meeting yesterday should help in that regard.

I'm thinking **June 4 @ $4,000 strike** for price / expiry.

**Going to war in t minus 30 minutes.** Would love to have fam beside me. What say you?

*Obviously not advice I just really like the stock.*"

I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

This week, more so than others, is extra spicy, with all of $FAAMG (I kicked out Netflix for Microsoft after their disgusting showing last week) reporting alongside loads of other mega cap companies. There is a *stupid* amount of money to be made this week, for traders of all skill levels and styles.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades, I've enlisted the help of my buddy /u/laseryellow and [**compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Enphase fucking MOVES! On average, the magnitude of any given move for it is 15%**!!! An awesome play here would be a long straddle, or reverse iron butterfly. You don‚Äôt know which way it‚Äôs gonna move, but you do know that wherever it does, it‚Äôs gonna fly.

- Although a relatively young company resulting in less data points, **Pinterest also moves with similar magnitude**. You could consider doing something similar on this ticker as well if you think these premiums are better.

- At the opposite end of the spectrum, we‚Äôve got stocks that *dont* move whatsoever during earnings season. The IV on these tickers is unreasonably jacked up for no good reason, so we can look to *sell* options on them to amass a small fortune. **Sirius XM, General Dynamics, CME Group, etc, all don‚Äôt really move, but the options are priced as if they are going to anyways**. Use this to your advantage.

- **Over the past 25 earnings seasons, Shopify has gone up nearly 75% of the time**! If you want a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù gamble, selling ATM put credit spreads would net you some *insane* premiums. BP also follows a similar pattern, clocking in at a 68% beat-rate, allowing us to make this play one two separate days, ensuring we‚Äôre not over-leveraged.

- Lastly, **Microsoft also follows an extremely similar pattern, clocking it at a near 70% winrate**. It‚Äôs IV is considerably lower than the other two however, so one may want to use standard call / debit spreads in this case as they are pretty cheap relative to the stocks price and implied move.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 60 fuckin‚Äô companies, theres plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll hit up /u/laseryellow and continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**"

Check out the top 3 ones with the fastest growth of followers over the past month.",188,37,2021-04-28 03:35:56,"I‚Äôve been collecting data on the number of followers on corporate pages of the companies in Twitter, Facebook, Instagram over the past 3 months. In addition, I also analyzed the website‚Äôs traffic and the popularity of the company's website search request in Google to see if followers on social networks are converting into leads and to take a more comprehensive look at this situation.

I don‚Äôt have statistical confirmation of the connection between the number of followers of the brand in social networks and a positive effect on the stock price, but according to the simple logic - this definitely can affect it. If people are interested in a product and what the company does, they will follow it in the media and become its customers. Sooner or later, this will be reflected in the company's profits and quarterly reports, so do not underrate this data.

You can find the resulting list below, hope you‚Äôll find this information useful:  


**1. XPENG INC. ($XPEV)** \- Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer. The most dynamic growth of followers in Twitter and Facebook.

**2. WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION ($WDC)** \- computer hard disk drive manufacturer and data storage company

By the way, they are quite active in hiring new people - 700 open job positions with 24K employees - an indicator of the company's healthy growth.

**3. SUNRUN INC. ($RUN)** \- solar panels and home batteries manufacturer. Here you can see the sharp increase in the number of Facebook followers.

Furthermore, the guys are actively expanding their staff, and their traffic has been steadily growing for the last 4 months. Of course, all this in the complex was reflected on their revenue - take a look at the last graph.

Cisco, one of the world‚Äôs largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand. 

Cisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could ‚Äú...\[take\] another six months‚Ä¶‚Äù for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware. 

The effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW‚Äôs Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, ‚Äú...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter‚Ä¶‚Äù So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.

The United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders earlier this month to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.   
Meanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC has announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang‚Äôs plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap. 

The increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reports earnings on Wednesday. Analysts are looking for the technology giant to post earnings of $0.98 on revenue of $77 billion after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple‚Äôs first product showcase of the year last Wednesday, and the company‚Äôs announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it‚Äôs iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat. 

Microsoft will report earnings Tuesday. Analyst estimates place earnings around $1.78 per share over $43 billion in revenue. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft‚Äôs cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector."

An exciting week ahead of us, here is my weekly newsletter which I share every Monday to help prepare you for the week! Feel free to DM me and happy trades!

**Week of 4/19/21**

The S&P500 opened Monday 4/19/21 at 4179.80, just below the previous close of 4185.67 on Friday  
4/16/21.

Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) prepare to square up over the social media platforms controversial  
tracking of consumer data. Facebook, which generates a large portion of its profits from targeted advertising, is known to collect consumer data to deliver the ads it believes will be the most successful. Apple has been in the process of developing what it calls ‚ÄúApp Tracking Transparency,‚Äù for its devices and announced in January that the feature will be included and enabled by default on all new Apple operating systems. The technology, which was tested publicly in summer of 2020, will prevent applications like Facebook and Instagram from being able to collect user data. Facebook has begun preparations to sue Apple, who is currently in the midst of a lawsuit over App Store payments for the popular online game, Fortnite.

Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke on the issue following statements from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg citing Apple as their, ‚Äúbiggest competitor.‚Äù Tim appeared committed to continuing to roll out the technology, saying, ‚ÄúTechnology does not need vast troves of personal data, stitched together across dozens of websites and apps, in order to succeed. Advertising existed and thrived for decades without it. And we‚Äôre here today because the path of least resistance is rarely the path of wisdom. If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform.‚Äù

Apple will hold its first product showcase of the year tomorrow, 4/20/21. The technology frontrunner is suspected to unveil our first glimpses of consumer-grade Augmented Reality technologies. The product showcase comes on the heels of a great month for the emerging AR industry, which was just the subject of a $20 Billion military contract with Microsoft. Apple is up 0.86% on the market open.

Emerging fitness company Peloton (PTON) traded down 5% on the open following federal regulators warnings against treadmills sold by the company. The Consumer Product Safety Commission released statements April 17th warning parents of children and pet owners to exercise caution after the death of a child who became wedged underneath the machine. At least 40 incidents of injury related to the machine have been recorded since its release.

Reports of Google (GOOG) using foreign tax loopholes to evade taxes have emerged. The company reportedly used the ‚Äúdouble-Irish,‚Äù loophole to funnel over 100 Billion in profits through Ireland and into Bermuda in 2018 & 2019, allowing the company to collect the profits free of U.S. taxation. The loophole was addressed and abolished by the U.K. in 2015, however the nature of the change to legislation still allows companies established before it‚Äôs passing to exploit the loophole. A spokeswoman for Google indicated that the loophole is no longer being used by the company, and that the U.S. taxes avoided by using the loophole would have amounted to approximately 80% of all taxes levied against the profits.

The September 2020 agreement to merge NVIDIA (NVDA) and ARM Ltd. is currently in limbo as U.K. regulators have released statements intervening in the acquisition. The merger, which was negotiated by NVIDIA and SoftBank, is worth approximately $40 Billion. The intervention was released this morning, 4/19/21, and carries with it the stipulation that a full federal investigation be conducted and completed by the end of July 30th, 2021. The state of the deal is uncertain as markets await a press release from NVIDIA.

JP Morgan (JPM) has displayed considerable interest in funding a new professional soccer league in Europe. The European Super League, which was announced on Sunday by a dozen of the world‚Äôs largest football clubs, will be established to rival the current European Champions League, and will consist of 12 of Europe‚Äôs leading clubs, mostly from Spain and the U.K. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan confirmed in an email that it would be involved in funding the league, but the amount in which JP Morgan will be contributing is still unknown. JP Morgan posted earnings of 12.61 last week and was up 0.5% on the market open.

Just wasted a few hours of my day writing this. I have shit to do

**Why meta analyses of financial forecasts are not binary:**

A famous argument for why Financial Analysts/Traders/Stock pushers are frauds or don‚Äôt know what they are doing is that they are barely correct out perform a coin flip in terms of the ratio of correct predictions on total predictions. While I do (most of the time) stand in the same camp of believing most analysts/stock pushers are frauds/don‚Äôt know what they are doing(at least the ones who have public followings), I don‚Äôt think this is a fair calculus or argument. I will explain why. 

**Binariness:**

First off we need to define what I mean when I say Binariness. In this scenario, meta analyses will determine a prediction by being Right or Wrong by some determining metric. This metric most of the time will have some sort of dependency on time and a uniform timeframe for all the predictions(*i.e given a prediction date t1, did the the prediction come true by t2‚ûùt1+3months?*). Being fair, they will take this statistical flaw into account and take and compare different t2 values( *t2‚ûùt1+3weeks,  t2‚ûùt1+6months,  t2‚ûùt1+next quarter, etc)* but I want to exclaim that the issue is that the predictions are NOT analyzed independently, when they should/need to be. 

**Why were they wrong?:**

So first off I want to clarify that predictionsCorrect/predictionsTotal is the correct calculus, but the way we quantify each variable is wrong. This section will clarify the steps need to quantify WRONG predictions CORRECTLY. Let‚Äôs assume an analyst deemed a prediction wrong, lets analyze their decision. 

**Direct contradiction of the prediction:**

Let‚Äôs say(lots of assumptions but it is important to get the point across) that we have a    

prediction that says ‚ÄúStock x will go from $15 to  $30 by next year because of good 

earnings. ‚Äù and by t2 stock x is $21. The stock price obviously did not meet the price prediction but why not? Did x have good earnings? Did they have bad earnings? In both of these specific scenarios, the predictor SHOULD be wrong. They might have been right about having good earnings but they were not right with the price prediction(so only ¬Ω legs were met). If they had bad earnings then this was a direct contradiction of the prediction(0/2 legs were met). 

**Missing leg of thesis:**

Elaborating on the above example‚Äôs outcome where ¬Ω legs were met, it is important to   
 ask why this leg was missing? Did the predictor take this leg into account and disregard   
 it? Did they just not think of it? Either way, it is important for any predictor to think of all 

variables, outcomes, and sensitivities that their thesis can be impacted by. In either of 

these cases, the predictor deserves to be wrong. 

**Black Swan Event:**

But what happens if an event happens that NOBODY could have predicted given the 

available data? Now defining something to be a black swan event can be pretty subjective 

at times. For example, a TSLA bear might not define the event when Elon Musk broke the Cyber Trucks window causing the stock price to fall as a Black Swan Event because they probably hold the thesis that their cars are shit and that their prices targets priced this in. A TSLA bull would probably defend themselves by saying that this WAS a black swan event. I‚Äôm not going to go into detail on whether these arguments are valid or not but I want to bring light to the option of throwing the data out since it is inconclusive. 

**Thesis has not been satisfied:**

Now lets say an analyst is doing a meta analysis on another analysts predictions and like I said before, they take all their predictions and compare them for some constant t2 without respect to the predictions actual thesis. What happens if the the prediction has an underlying assumption that is either WAY before t2 or WAY after t2? Now the prediction will appear wrong(or right) but the underlying test is flawed, skewing the score. If the predictor says ‚ÄúStock x will go from $15 to $30 by t2‚Äù but the analyst is comparing this outcome to t3 where t3 != t2, now you have a bad metric. 

**Devils advocate: Why were they right?**

I don‚Äôt think I need to elaborate this side of the coin as they are  mirrors of the above but 

obviously we need to cover all bases and want to make that explicit. 

**Bayesian Statistics:**

This whole essay is swimming around the idea of Bayesian Statistics, or Bayes Theorem of conditional probability: 

P(A|B) =P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)

This says the probability of event A GIVEN that event B is true is equal to **(**the probability of event B GIVEN that event A is true**)\*(**the probability of event A happening**)** all divided by **(**the probability of event B happening**).** Now, I won‚Äôt continue with the maths but I want to get across that this is the framework that should be used when quantifying a correctness metric. A metric that scores an outcome with respect to its thesis happening. After basing each right or wrong on its underlying factor, you will receive a bayesian approached ratio of totalCorrect/totalPredictions. 

**Conclusion:**

Hopefully this made sense and hopefully you learned something. I‚Äôm not going to proof read this either because I need to go to the gym and finish my day. I got caught in writing this because I took a bunch of adderall and didn‚Äôt see where the time went. Fuck

**TL:DR**

Don‚Äôt trust all articles that say ‚Äú\[Your fav analyst\] is only right 50% of the time!‚Äù. Many people who try to discredit an analysts outcomes are not using the correct metric in order to determine correctness."

For those following today's race in Baja in which Lordstown Motors entered a souped up version of their EV truck ""Endurance,"" hopefully you're already trying to figure out what to do with your positions Monday at open. For those who didn't follow the race,  despite what Lordstown released on Facebook and Twitter, it really can't be viewed as anything other than a disaster. 

The truck's battery gave out at mile 40, at which point the driver (who is apparently a janitor or security guard at LM) veered a mile off course so they could recharge. The truck sat not moving for around two hours before taking the wrong route to get back on course and finally deciding to just turn around and drive back to the start via the highway. 

Honestly, that's not the worst part.  Lordstown posted a video to Instagram showing the truck in action during the race.  It was *ahem* ...underwhelming. My 68 year old mother would have passed them on the shoulder in her 10 year old Chevy Malibu and flipped them the bird for driving like a bitch. One of the biggest concerns many have had about this truck is that having the motors in the wheel hubs versus mounted to the body would cause serious issues on bumpy terrain and lead to the motors being rendered inoperable when you hit a pothole. The video of them driving Miss Daisy though the Baja desert did not assuage these fears for me.  Perhaps it did for others. Perhaps I'm overreacting. 

I had hoped to see them go balls to the wall.  Announce their presence with aplomb and say ""Here we are, America! Come get yours off the line in September!"" At least then if it broke down (like literally 50% of the entrants in this race), you could at least say ""Hey, we went for it.  We've got some things to work on before next year's race, but the truck is still a winner."" Instead, they drove it like a 90 year old who is driving for the first time in their life five minutes after smoking their first fatty. And they still broke down 40 miles into the 250 mile race. Really disappointing. 

So, positions. 

200 shares @ 11.95 average that I expect to lose value as I will continue to hold long term. 

15 4/23C $13
25 4/23C $12
25 4/23C $10
10 4/23P $8 

The options were stupid and overly optimistic, but I bought them as lottery tickets hoping that Lordstown would push the truck to the limits today.  They didn't. 

My only source of hope right now is that this market makes no sense.  Maybe they'll shake this off and spike Monday. Should have joined the theta gang and sold some covered calls of my shares.

Edit: more embarrassment.  The other EV in the race,  lovingly nicknamed ""the shitbox,"" which is nothing more than an old 4runner mated with a damn Nissan Leaf is still going strong and on pace to finish under the time limit."

`Heutagogy - self-determined learning, is a student-centered instructional strategy that emphasizes the development of autonomy, capacity, and capability`

`Pedagogy - the method and practice of teaching, especially as an academic subject or theoretical concept.`

Roblox is fundamentally an education company that encourages students to learn modern-day equivalents of typing on a computer. These skills involve things like learning how to code, develop art, or strong communication skills. =

# Purpose

To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here. WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts can crush Wall Street analysts at places like Morningstar or M-Fool. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation or cooperation.

* Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**
* How do we compare social media incentives? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**
* What really is customer service? **(GameStop DD Complete)**
* Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(Kansas City Southern Rail DD Complete)**
* What are elements behind US lagging industrial sector? **(Autodesk DD Complete)**
* Do we understand the consequences of STEAM education (Science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics)? **(YOU ARE HERE)**
* Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? **(Cloud Compute DD in Progress)**
* How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sharing my writing. I‚Äôm not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.

# Video Games & Heutagogic Learning

It appears clear these days that video games are the most dominant form of media. This is because the video game industry can better access and more aggressively capture our high-barrier entry need for adventure and journey. Other industries compete with this element but ultimately place their customers in the spectator's seat. For example:

1. The short stories on social media like Snapchat, Instagram, Youtube, or Twitter.
2. The hero tales created by Disney or Netflix.

&#x200B;

[Gaming as the leader in entertainment or media](https://preview.redd.it/xms6g6ksvpt61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=e84e0655c99280e464931f3da513e33404fbdee6)

One must remember that the attention-economy fundamentally depends on on key metric: **engagement**. It is no secret why organizations like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, or even Tesla have further intersected with gaming in aggressive maneuvers in recent years as a result of this economic condition. Gaming is a big winner of the attention-economy and often sits at the frontier of new economies.  When looking at age, gaming or other medias can be the shortest path to reaching new or lifelong customers. It is a lucrative and difficult position to acquire or maintain.

&#x200B;

Think of it historically; during the first iterations of the web, many customers were fearful of putting credit-card information online while online gaming companies have ventured into selling branded debit cards that sold to children and youth that otherwise did not have access to banking. Roblox takes this nature a step further by effectively defining and supporting Robux-to-fiat economy as the lifeblood of the company.

&#x200B;

[First generation fintech and banking services](https://preview.redd.it/72qme0crxpt61.png?width=353&format=png&auto=webp&s=cadb26b801c61afe73a8a96cb16a0024c66e316b)

I‚Äôve discussed internet media, user incentives, and their distinctions in a previous DD involving Pinterest. To highlight one of main ideas:

>""An internet forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. In my view, it ranks like the following list, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:

1. Google is fueled by customer‚Äôs need for answered information.
2. Online video games are fueled by a customer‚Äôs need for adventure.
3. Reddit is fueled by a customer‚Äôs need for community.
4. Pinterest is fueled by a customer‚Äôs need for ideas.
5. Facebook is fueled by a customer‚Äôs need to connect.""

In this DD, I would argue that gaming is one of the most comprehensive applications of internet forums that can encapsulate all of the needs above and dig deeper into the ideas that drive it.

&#x200B;

[The investment incentive: low barrier to entry & decentralized game development](https://preview.redd.it/hmibns2pzpt61.png?width=1303&format=png&auto=webp&s=a08c1a1680665d6f9272f3cff8ab19bb68f3f3ed)

I typically do not like to assert authority on a subject when I write DD, but I feel that in this case it is necessary due to an enormous complexities behind education technology, what's wrong with it, and what needs to be corrected.  In short, my view is that video games are one of the most powerful ways to engage students in a meaningful and long-lasting education, ranging from social to reading skills.

&#x200B;

[Heutagogic learning](https://preview.redd.it/rq9dxj9yzpt61.png?width=591&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4fbe53adde74b85313ca4dca53077e14de64983)

Online games fulfill a similar shortcoming that traditional medias fail in regards to adventure or journey.  In the same fashion, education and the art of teaching generally stutters when the student remains a spectator for too long.  What gaming achieves as an education service are all the critical requirements of a healthy STEM education:

&#x200B;

1. The ability to inspire curiosity and confidence.
2. The ability to deeply engage.
3. The ability to produce imagination or creativity.

Some of us may scoff about this, but there is a lot of truth to this sentiment that I believe many would agree with. For many early online child gamers, skills like typing quickly, bartering, multiplying, reading comprehension, or the desire to pursue arts originates from our time spent engaged by video games.

This is the goal and nature of heutagogic learning. This nature extends to adulthood, as many of us experienced this phenomenon while learning about advanced financial instruments for the sake of ""learning the game""  of stock market investing. We spend time scowering through forums and generating a community no different than that of popular online games.  Many of us have even acquired generational knowledge as a result of this media condition. We have met the proper requirements and incentives for a STEM education at scale.

[Andragogic\/Heutagogic learning at scale](https://preview.redd.it/gplo1bx41qt61.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=715bae2a0ff447bd5d21569bcac401c636c69dae)

I could talk length about this subject alone, but simply put, the world is not quite ready to accept such an idea. Games are still seen as entertainment, but it typically evolves each generation. In my generation, three societal transformations occurred:

1. It stopped being weird to purchase in-game cosmetics.
2. The idea of watching others play video games was normalized.
3. E-Sports became popular and inspired a new economy.

&#x200B;

[Second generation online gaming](https://preview.redd.it/4bt555i62qt61.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c281084802f3ff72cb8143b40761bde4fa9e5ed)

Some of these resistances are interesting when you look at it from a simpler lens. Why was it weird to watch others play video games online, when it was seemingly normal to watch someone play Dance Dance Revolution in an arcade or an older sibling progress through a game? Why was it strange to purchase cosmetic goods where we spend a large percentage of our time in digital worlds? Why was it bizarre to see dedicated players compete at global levels when gaming and online access became a worldwide normalcy? Usually there is no good reason for the psychological resistance to change.

Yet here we are, playing and learning effectively one of the most popular mobile games in the US.

[STEAM pedagogy for architecture, engineering, or construction](https://preview.redd.it/b57peu7j2qt61.png?width=2782&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e6ce51e01691091ff6dbeee88ff1dad985a2ff7)

With that idea covered, I want to transition to examine one of the leading pedagogies in US education, which is the inclusion of arts in STEM, known as a STEAM pedagogy.  It may not be immediately clear why the inclusion is such a drastic change to STEM, but one should consider several factors:

1. STEM education standards are poor with low engagement (a societal problem)
2. Good science and engineering requires confident students (resisting imposter syndrome)
3. STEM requires creativity and imagination (critical thinking requisites)

&#x200B;

[Game development, code, or design](https://preview.redd.it/556dqhnp3qt61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6b4a2ac6c89a435890fcd01210026208aae9337)

What an arts education does is fundamentally produce new language and learning skills that are actively applied in a STEM education. Typically speaking, arts is also far more engaging to youth while traditional STEM learning models can carry less obvious inherent incentives.

However, slowly but surely, we are beginning to see students who seek to learn digital art, coding, investing and other STEAM-derived interests that can transition into other branches of STEM as a result of incentivizing the desire to learn these skills.

A young Roblox game developer is only a short path away from finding a passion in architecture or cloud computing. This strategy is not new and has had success for organizations like Adobe, Microsoft, Autodesk, and other technical skills. These are largely andragogic forms of learning, or adult-centered educations.

&#x200B;

One of the most significant accomplishments of the inclusion of Arts in a STEM-centered education is the inversion of a question that afflicted many classrooms for generations:

>‚ÄúWhy do I need to learn this?‚Äù

It turns out, the answer is not

>‚Äúso you can become a scientist!‚Äù

but to provide an environment that encourages and incentivizes a proper learner's mentality

>‚ÄúI need to learn this, so that I can create that.‚Äù

&#x200B;

Engineers and scientists are simply disciplined creators no different than an artist or performer. However, there are significant and clear barriers to entry to STEM-based and Arts-based learning. It is far more pragmatic for a child to inspire creative behaviors with a canvas, skateboard, or instrument while the barrier to entry for engineering practices may be far less accessible.

Some of this is partially a consequence of time, where there has been less knowledge transfer on writing software vs. writing prose and some of these barriers have compounding consequences at the socioeconomic level.  For example, there is a large disparity in big tech hirings, and such consequences can carry over to other multi-trillion dollar industries driven by infrastructure and Green New Deal policies.

&#x200B;

[Socioeconomic consequences in education support](https://preview.redd.it/t2mh2ikz3qt61.png?width=987&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ed2aadf47bb21e36d44864efe58303c20119d74)

Another huge barrier to entry to STEM is simply the fact that many students do not believe in themselves or have not been encouraged to imagine that they are capable of achieving success in subjects like mathematics and science, so there is an enormous amount of undue self-filtering in the field. Learning how to dance is a far more engaging practice to a child, while learning how to code in some developer environment without the proper incentive may seem pointless. Organizations like Roblox can and are changing the equation for some students.

You may be at a loss at this point, but it's worth taking the time to simply ponder on this and what it means economically for Roblox. The language used here is directly aligned with the language used in the Roblox S-1 registration document:

1. Inspiration mentioned 9 times.
2. Create and inspiration mentioned 75 times.
3. Engagement mentioned 160 times.

This language is particular due to the game identifying with its original iteration, Interactive Physics, an education game that launched in 1989.

>""The story of Roblox began in 1989 when our founders, David Baszucki and Erik Cassel, programmed a 2D simulated physics lab called Interactive Physics, which would later go on to influence our approach to building the groundwork for Roblox. Students across the world used Interactive Physics to see how two cars would crash, or how they could build destructible houses. In starting Roblox in 2004, we wanted to replicate the inspiration of imagination and creativity we saw in Interactive Physics on a much grander scale by ushering in a new category of human interaction that did not exist at the time.""

# The Roblox Vision

>""We focus our business on our developers, creators, and users, and acting in their interests in the long-term may conflict with the short-term expectations of analysts and investors.""

&#x200B;

[EBP - Engagement Based Payouts started in 2020](https://preview.redd.it/z63prfzr6qt61.png?width=467&format=png&auto=webp&s=faad3efe3a156c1f26e4adadefb20346466bb37e)

Understanding the nature of modern-day cloud computing and its future direction will allow investors to understand the paths that Roblox will take. The fundamental theory of this economy is that a customer's data is an increasingly tangible asset. The way that I like to examine the economic output of this industry is by two core economic elements.

1. The value of work generated by machine-to-machine transactions (network output).
2. The value of data and services generated by human experiences (customer input).

[Serverless computing - network service architecture for real-time and powerful apps.](https://preview.redd.it/wl88yq547qt61.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&s=618f6be99e0b7cc157065b4505cb82d7f89d5e36)

There are many organizations that capture the essence of this industry. Organizations like Square and Zoom will provide services that we're all familiar with, but we often forget the under-hood-details that exist and govern the infrastructure of these companies. What cloud computing organizations have realized is that as our engagement with platforms increases, the value of our data and needs becomes increasingly tangible. Our needs for financial technology or property rentals have resulted in regulatory or social challenges, which we typically refer to as ""disruption"". The disruption is rooted in the fact that our data is an authentically tangible good.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vpzpov6deqt61.png?width=845&format=png&auto=webp&s=0128b3dd2ee4912161dbfc99c9d312b8f57f9b6c

&#x200B;

This idea that our data and time spent on digital platforms is the central hypothesis behind creation of the robux system that Roblox lives on. There are many things that Roblox needs to accomplish in the near to short term to achieve long-term profitability and the leadership seems to have a clear vision on how to achieve that:

1. The company will continue to redistribute its wealth back toward its developers.
2. The company will aggressively invest in education sectors to incentivize students to learn valuable skills.
3. The company will support wildly successful games as a way to create a long-term identity for Roblox (like popular Nintendo games)
4. The company will continue to invest in its cloud platform and eventually develop its own hardware platform to reduce its expenses.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jr21jf1b8qt61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8175cc302d2be55fe0e446f0b78dc71d6f1d4956

The reason that I'm certain of this is because the organization needs to accomplish the following incentives and financial feats:

1. Reached a large enough audience in order to maintain long-term relevancy.
2. Produced and support games that create enough incentive to join the platform.
3. Created enough incentives for developers to produce quality experiences.

&#x200B;

>""Roblox has a vibrant economy built on a currency called Robux, which can be purchased through the Roblox Client and website. Users can also acquire Robux through a monthly subscription to Roblox  
>  
>Premium. Developers and creators earn Robux by selling access to virtual content. Developers can also earn Robux by driving engagement of Premium subscribers through an engagement-based payout system. When Premium subscribers spend time in a developer‚Äôs experience, that developer earns a prorated share of the user‚Äôs monthly subscription fee. Engagement-based payouts incentivize developers to invest in the engagement of their experiences. Roblox allows developers and creators to convert earned Robux into the real-world currency of their choice through our Developer Exchange Program.""

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h95ts6pt8qt61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0406e17772f8f302bfdc4beb4eee288509e07440

In my view, Roblox's 2020 premium payout system will be one the biggest shifts in media as it has many potential outcomes that we aren't fully implemented yet. This is the nature of certain powerful architectures like computing more data at the edge or leaning on services like Fastly, Amazon Fargate, or other serverless/back-end platforms. Roblox is no such stranger to this and I would say that they certaintly have a vested interest in pushing these kinds of interactions.

Some uses cases of engagement-based payouts are repeatable to other platforms, where organizations like Reddit could easily implement similar financial logic if they discover that Reddit Subscribers spend the majority of their time to a small concentration of subreddits. This already exists to an extent, where users represent engagement through coin-sharing and reddit emoji placements.

Another example, if a high-quality education game were to be released on Roblox, where the developer agrees to redistribute their earned Robux to schools in need, then Roblox has achieved an economy where a student who is spending time learning has resulted in the improvement or construction of other learning facilities. This is also reflective of the idea that data is increasingly tangible.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bb9j3yj7aqt61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=8308e21dd05757fa74928a26560f665d0d61bf12

The possibilities with an engagement-based payout system are enormous for Roblox and produces added value to the ideas behind things like virtual concerts, streams, or other experiences that aren't fully realized in the gaming sector. For example, what is the economic consequence of children having a safe environment to attend concerts of their favorite artists? At the same time, the Robux payout system is a non-trivial distance away from creating applications of other alternative currencies like exchanging Robux with other digital assets like VBucks, tickets, or block-you-know-what-based applications.

&#x200B;

Another core element to Roblox's financial future is to ultimately secure its means of distribution. As it currently stands, the biggest expense to the Roblox platform is the fee processing it must agree to when it comes to doing business with organizations like Apple, Microsoft, Google, and other payment processors like Visa and Paypal. One way to reduce these costs and increase profitability is to develop products akin to the Nintendo Switch or Oculus platform. This idea is not too far away given the nature of Roblox's business, which has an enormous amount of various types of games that would be well-suited by Roblox partnerships. Overtime, the value of Apple or Google's distribution power weakens as the company cements itself into public consciousness.

&#x200B;

The company has alluded to this idea with an April fool's joke in 2019, with a console known as the imagination-powered Robox:

>"" At Roblox, we‚Äôre continuously exploring new and innovative ways to bring our platform to millions of people across the world. Just as we‚Äôve expanded onto phones, tablets, the Xbox One, and virtual reality, we believe that there‚Äôs an even greater potential just waiting to be unlocked. A new way to experience all your favorite Roblox games. A new way to connect with your friends. A new way to make your dreams a reality in stunning, 8K ultra-high definition graphics and at greater than 120 frames per second.  
>  
>Welcome to a new era of interactive entertainment. This is **Robox**.""

# Conclusion

There was a lot of ground to cover here so let's briefly review. Gaming is arguably the best form of media in the attention-economy where Roblox identifies itself at the intersection of education and digital media development.

A significant portion of the education sector is focused on STEAM pedagogy which aligned with and supported by Roblox goals long-term. Roblox is able to leverage cloud computing to disrupt traditional models in gaming, education, financial technology, and imagination markets.

At first the market didn't like it and on the next trading day the stock lost 10% (panic mode, loss porn and so on). However within the next 2 trading days BB has regained all its $ in a quick reversal. I'm here to tell you why.

This is a followup to [my OP.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/mhi3ev/blackberry_earningscall_were_actually_bullish/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) 

^(Quick note to the Mods: I believe my OP is about to bring new original content to the discussion and hopefully will be eligible to live its life as a post.)

**Portfolio Patent Sale (big $$$)**

Quick refresh: the stock fell because the revenue came below expectations but straightaway the company said it happened because they are currently negotiating the sale of a portion of their patents specifically related to ***mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking.*** Consequently they had to voluntarily limit the monetisation of these patents during Q4.

The points I would like to investigate are: for how much $$ this sale could go, how likely this sale is to happen, who could be the buyer and when could it be completed?

***First the money.*** CEO Chen during the call: *we will report a one-time gain of a reasonably big number, followed by a tail of up to seven years.* He also confirmed the yearly revenues for Licensing are around $250m. And that BB owns 38,000 patents. I will simply use these numbers with a DCF to estimate what that ""big number"" could be. Before I proceed I would like to emphasise that CEO also said: *we believe that the completion of the transaction will be beneficial to our shareholders* (if it happens).

Assuming a 10% discount rate and 7 years of revenue life, we have $250m current year, $227m next year, $207m (...) to $141m for the final year. For a total of **$1,339bn.** That's quite a pleasing big number but let's be careful nonetheless: we don't know the size of the portfolio being negotiated and the payment is expected to be initially a lump sum  + 7years of tail royalties. So they could tweak it a bit.

With a 15% discount rate we get **$1,196bn** and at 20% **$1,081bn.** Another way to look at it: if we consider that they would sell only 75% of that side business and we discount it at 10% we still get a number north of a billion $ (consistent with CEO comment: *it's a major portion of our portfolio*). So money wise should the sale indeed happen we are looking at an one time cash flow of $1bn to $1.3bn. Not too shabby for a $5bn market cap company with already $800m cash in its hands (yes they could have momentarily circa 40% cash to mkt cap ratio).

***Is this really happening?*** There is a high probability it would maybe 80% but it's not cleared yet. To get to this conclusion I listened twice to the conf call to try to decipher the clues. Whenever CEO was talking about the amount he sounded as if that part was near completion (*will be a big number* and *the majority of the deal will come in one-time early, but there is a tail that goes on*). Although he also stated that *the company has not yet reached a definitive binding agreement and negotiations are ongoing.*

The main hurdle might be the regulatory review of the transaction as the big boss mentioned that in the most conservative scenario: *we assume that negotiation and regulatory review continue for the first half* (of FY). A sentence that directly leads me to believe that the buyer could be a major company.

***Big money buyer:*** if there is a lengthy regulatory review it might be because the potential purchaser could be in a position to infringe antitrust laws (NB: antitrust laws were created by Congress to preserve competition among businesses and prevent any one business from dominating a single industry and building a monopoly). 

Speculations are ongoing that the buyer could be Facebook. It's honestly hard to say but that's the name with the higher odds at the moment. Just to recall BB sued FB in 2018, claiming the social media giant was using BlackBerry inventions in its messaging applications. Then they settled the dispute in January 2021 over patent royalties for terms that weren‚Äôt disclosed. You see the analogy here. By the way during the conf call this settlement was never mentioned and we still didn't see the financial repercussions in BB accountancy.

That said it could very well be someone else from North America, which leads us to the when.

***The timing of the sale*** is honestly hard to guess but again let's refer to the CEO comment that in their most conservative scenario the discussions could continue during H1. Subjectively I tend to believe that it would happen sooner rather than later because 1. they are losing money by restricting their Licensing every day that goes by and 2. it was *the* major statement in their whole conference call. You can arguably think that you would release this kind of communication when negotiations are very advanced. If I had to bet I would say it's a matter of a few weeks obviously subject to the regulatory approval.

**The Transformation**

By now unless if you've been living on Mars because that game rocket took you too far, you must know that BlackBerry is no longer an handset company. They excel at cybersecurity, they are deeply involved in the automotive industry including EV thanks to QNX and they are coming big hand in hand with Amazon to bring IVY to the world (October early release and Feb22 full product).

If and when they sell that side portfolio to a potentially big name you can expect all financial and traditional media to report the transaction and to emphasise the renewal, the rebirth of BlackBerry as an Internet of Things, Cybersecurity high-margins long-duration Tech company.

In terms of communication they have just started and they are about to splash the cash to continue on. John Chen is quite excited about it: *you will see us being more aggressive, in fact we ran an ad today Intelligent Security everywhere, an ad today. I just saw it on the New York Times and so we're just going to step-up in both people and spending and resources to go after the market and it is a huge, as you know very well, it is a huge market and no clear winner at this point.*

He later added that: *we have a reasonably large number of hires mostly in sales and marketing.*

***IVY is not priced in at all:*** there is no other way to say it. At the current BB valuation investors are totally ignoring the potential of IVY, probably because they don't understand it. Let me go straight to the point.

*BB and AWS said the new intelligent vehicle data platform, called IVY, will compress the time to build, deploy and monetize in-vehicle applications and connected services across multiple brands and models, making it easier for automakers to collaborate with a wider pool of developers to accelerate development of apps and services.*

The goal is to establish IVY as a standard platform across the auto industry, as Apple and Google have done in mobile phones through their iOS and Android platforms. This way IVY could be the equivalent of the App Store but for all mobility platforms whether EV, autonomous driving EV, air drones, rockets (SpaceX already using QNX) etc. The end uses are potentially limitless and most of the current discussed applications are under NDAs. Once they start to pop out, the picture will get clearer and clearer.

Similarly to what Apple did back in the days, BB has started an IVY Fund with $50m in it + $100K AWS credit for new startups willing to develop a product on IVY. Let's also not forget that the deal was approved by Andy Jassy in December who later got upgraded from AWS big boss to Amazon CEO. We can reasonably imagine that he values IVY as a potential disruptor and Chen sees it as a *significant growth opportunity.* Initially thought to hit the market in 2023, the early release will be available as soon as October 2021 (again the market is sleeping on this advancement).

One quick word on the cybersecurity part of the business: BB and CRWD have roughly the same yearly revenue (I will leave it to the experts to discuss how comparable they are). One company has $5bn market cap and the other $44bn.

**The Bear Case**

If the sale doesn't happen at all that's gonna look bad and hurt financially. Still according to the call, *full year licensing revenue will be in the region of $100 million* (if the sale fail) vs an usual $250m per year. As mentioned throughout that's because they are limiting the Licensing revenue while negotiating. Cybersecurity growth, QNX and IVY will still remain in play but more as mid and long term catalysts. They would still push for sales and marketing but the blue sky scenario obviously implies the receipt of a billion $ in cash in exchange of their accessory patents.

*Definitely not a recommendation to buy, hold, sell any security. Besides I have no knowledge in IoT, programming, software etc. I can only read.*

*Disclosure: long BB shares and June 20C and 15C (in that order).*

**TLDR:** BB is selling their old business patents probably for more than $1bn to a big player in order to focus on their new business model - cybersecurity, IoT, QNX, IVY - and come back like what's up."

Here is why.,902,238,2021-03-29 22:48:29,"First of all, let's take a look at  the commercial side of its business. Currently BP and Airbus contracts are responsible for 20 percent of the PLTR's revenue and some analyst think that such high-concentration is bad. However, they said the same think about PLTR's government work when the stock debuted. In short, they said that it is very worrying that PLTR generates such a high-percentage of its revenue from the U.S government and tried to convince investors to value PLTR not as a soft company, but as a defence contractor. I am glad that I did not listen to them at that time and bought the stock at 10 dollars, cuz my thinking was that if the fcking U.S government values the PLTR's software so highly it is extremely likely that commercial businesess will do the same. Do you get where I am going? If Airbus and BP are paying the company more than 100 million dollars combined per year, then that means that PLTR's software is extremely efficient and if used right, could potentially safe customers hundreds of millions dollars of expenses or lost revenue. If you want more confirmation about how important the software could be for the business, have in mind that when partnering with the U.S agency of disease protection, there are rumours that as early as January 2020 Palantir was able to build confidential  models  that showed the potential for a rapidly rising outbreak. Palantir then rushed in mid-February to recall staff from abroad and order them into a four-week quarantine. Now imagine if you knew about this as early as PLTR. March puts for the win.

Even forgetting about the software and PlTR's growing revenue, let's take a look at some other factors that can't be measured by financial modelling. Currently PLTR is the only company in the world that is in talks to receive Impact Level 6 certification from the DoD. That means that PLTR will have access to classified information. Yeah, that is the kind of information that if you share with unauthorised personnel you go to prison for commiting treason against the state. Furthermore, the marine that participated in the operation of killing Bin Laden said in his book that PLTR soft. was instrumental in the sucess of the mission. To top it off , PlTR lobbyist include figures like retired Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Terry Pau and ex- US State Secretary  Condoleezza Rais and the new Director of national intelligence in the Biden admin- Avril  Haines a former employee. Well, I think that we can say with great certainty that PLTR has become extremely important for the U.S government operations. If history has taught us anything, if the U.S government values something , it will not shy away from spending millions of taxpayers dollars to keep it afloat. But it as not only the U.S government. PLTR has won numerous contracts with government agencies of other countries like the British NHS and PlTR's head of operation in Israel- Hamutal Meridor, served as senior director of Verint, with deep ties to Unit 8200.   Unit 8200 also called Shin Bet is an Israeli Intelligence Corps *unit* of the Israel Defense Forces responsible for collecting signal intelligence (SIGINT) and code decryption. 

If you are still not sure about PLTR's importance maybe you would like to know more about who is behind the company. Peter Thiel is a cofounder and the current largest shareholder. Yeah, that is right-Peter fucking Thiel. This guy  was a business associate with Elon Musk in Paypal, he was the first investor in Facebook and a mentor of Zuckerberg and is a close friend of Chamath. He also bankrupted Gawker, cuz they had the audacity to leak the news that he is homosexual. Many people believe that he is one of the most well-connected men in the world and it comes at no surprise that he is a member of The Bilderberg group ( conspiracy theorists believe that these guys control the world) . I forgot to mention that his nickname is King Midas, cuz everything that he touches turns to gold. 

Palantir's other cofounder and current Ceo- Alex Karp is also a pretty interesting guy to say the least.  He is a juris doctor from Stanford University, and a doctorate in neoclassical social theory from Goethe-Universit√§t, Frankfurt, Germany. He is also a regular participant in the Davos economic forum. Oh, he also actively practices Tai Chi and Quidong. Yes, this guy actually studied the blade, how could you not trust him?

To sum it up, I will use Alex Karp's own words:  ‚ÄúWe are going to deliver the world‚Äôs best software with the world‚Äôs most efficient way of delivering it. Investors will decide what that‚Äôs worth to them. And I think you‚Äôll find in a number of years that there will be a consensus: Palantir is a truly special software company that is arguably the most important software company in the world.‚Äù -Karp the day they went public"

So here's my part to hedging and why YOLO might be fun but a little bit more care when investing can help you to buy the dip and profit greatly!

## Why Hedge?
It's always tempting to go all in on one very promising bet to take the most profits possible with the available bankroll. Always hitting the perfect timing for entry and exit consistantly is impossible, period. And it's even more complex than buying at the lowest point and selling the peak.


Aknowledging this fact is vital to understand why hedging does not only reduce the risk to the portfolio but in the long run leads to a higher return on investment.

This guide uses $100k as a baseline not because that's what everyone has, it just makes the math a little easier to read.

For convenience I'll use a price of $100 per share of your favorite stock.

## Imagine this scenario!
Your favorite stock has been doing well so far. Excluding events such as GME recently with factor x2 swings within a week or two minutes of trading, such as last wednesday, are more of an exception. But let's say it's been doing exceptionally good with +20% in a brief period of time. 

If one has put 100% of its portfolio, $100k -> 1000 shares, into that stock the total value of this portfolio would now be $120k.


And now a market correction hits, pushing the price down 30%.

Some quick math (100%-30%) * $120k = $84k puts the portfolio value down -$16k in total.


Hedging in general would have cussioned that a lot. Let's use 20% of the portfolio for hedging and the 80% (800 shares) for your favorite stock.

The runup: $20k+(80%*$120k) = $116k

The dip (after rebalancing, discussed later): (80% * 116k *(100%-30%)) + (20% * 116k) = ~$88k, a dip of -$12k.


The hedging decreased the profits from +$20k to -$16k and the dip from -$16k to -$12k.

But that ""rebalancing"" is key here and makes all the difference.


## Rebalancing
If your strategy is to use 20% of your portfolio for hedging those 20% might represent different dollar amounts with time. After that runup from $100 per share to $120 the value of the hedged portfolio was $116k.

Initially $20k were used to hedge, now those $20k represent only 17.2% of the $116k. To get to 20% again some shares need to be sold in order to rebalance the hedge to $23k.

Stocks after the runup: 80%*$116k/$120 -> ~773 shares (27 sold, started at 800)


But the same goes for the dip. Now those $23.2k represent 26% of the portfolio so you'll have to buy the dip to get it down to 20% again. So to rebalance you'll ""have to"" buy shares for $3.2k. 

Total stocks after the dip rebalancing: $3.2k / $85 = 38 shares (811 shares in total)


Since you're bullish on that stock you and I both assume the price will bounce back. But this time you'll have more shares than before, giving you an edge over the plain YOLO.


Briefly:

### Whenever the stock goes up, this strategy takes some profits without ever exiting the position.
### Whenever the stock drops, this strategy buys the dip but never goes all in

## When to rebalance
That's not easy to answer. If you're asking r/investing folks monthly is more than enough but we're not investing in super stable low volatile ETFs here.

My rule of thumb is to rebalance when the planned allocation exceeds 10%. Want to use 20% for hedging? If your hedge goes below 18% or above 22% a rebalance could make sense. Since we're on WSB here people might hit 10% swings every single day and that's WAY too often.


So rebalancing maximum once per week and only if the allocation is off by 20% (so 16% or 24% with a 20% hedge) could be a sensible strategy.

But you'll have to see what works for you. Rebalancing too often means paying the spread every time for both the hedge and the bet and that adds up.


## What can be used to hedge?
There are a lot of ways to hedge but as a rule of thumb everything which is pretty stable can be used. Low volatility, tried and tested in the last few corrections and recessions.

You should, however, still be able to quickly liquidate your hedge. This puts most if not all physical hedges out of the question.

### Options

Options are the most powerfull hedge but are a lot more complex and won't be covered in depth here. It also throws off the math above a bit but can be used very effectively. 

Books have been written about using options to hedge and a short summary would probably confuse more than help. I _highly_ reccommend reading ""The Greeks and Hedging Explained"" by P. Leoni for that.


Very, very briefly and basic: You can use a PUT, preferrably a bit OTM (10% is common), to hedge your massive bullish position. Worst Case you'll lose 10% plus your premium which can vary wildly (Don't do this on GME. Just don't it's way to expensive).

### Currency
This is the easiest hedge. Just leave some cash in your trading account without it being allocated in some stocks.

### Precious Metals
Precious metals like gold and silver won't yield much returns if any but they usually go up when the stock market goes down. This will help you have the cash on hand you need to buy the dip.

I don't reccommend buying physical metals as a hedge since the spread is massive, taxes are much more complicated and finding a buyer can take some time.

There are some theories on several funds not allocating 100% of the metal in vaults so if you're afraid of that Sprott not just promises to have that metal, they check regularly and prove it. Symbols are PHYS for gold and PSLV for silver.
### SPACs (No, really!)
SPACs are very interesting! They have a hard floor at $10 per unit (units contain a share and a fraction of a warrant) because they are required to have that amount of cash per unit issued at hand.

That's not just a pinky promise, those funds are monitored. They have two years to akquire a company or they get dissolved, distributing the funds or $10 to every shareholder, whichever is higher.


So why SPACs? Those funds yield some interest and if they do find a company to akquire the stock price may go up a lot. 50%-100% are not uncommon and using them as a hedge is almost riskless.


What to look out for / type into google: Near NAV SPACs.

### Stocks or stock based ETFs (not very good)
You _can_ use less volatile stocks or ETFs as a hedge but when the entire market goes down they will go down, too.

So if you want to hedge against a market-wide correction they might be the wrong hedge.

If you really don't want to miss out on general market growth and only want to hedge against a correction on your favorite stock but not the entire market, say right before earnings, stocks may be useful.

I really don't like stocks as a hedge but if you really want to, some infrastructure / telecommunication companies (Not NOK or BB, they are too volatile due to WSB publicity) could be stocks to use here.

### Inverse Funds
Thanks to u/A_KY_gardener for brining these to my attention! Inverse funds don't exist for every stock or index but they can be used as a hedge on these, too. 

Basically whenever whatever they invert goes up, they go down and vice versa. 


They are a bit awkward to use since they're inherently as volatile as their underlying stock/index, but whenever the entire market goes deep into the red they're going to shine bright and green, offering some tendies to buy the dip.



There is one boring reason you can use them, depending on your local tax law, and that's to create losses on paper. If you bet both long on a stock or index and the same amount into these inverse funds then one of them will be up roughly whatever the other leg is down. If you realize the losses in the end of december then you'll have realized losses but unrealized gains going into the new year. That can delay the taxes to pay and you get to gamble with that tax money. 

## TL;DR
Want to buy the dip but don't have any cash left? Well then your hedging sucked and you should read this guide again.


## Afterword - Hedging and Hedgefunds; know the difference!
### Hedgefunds bad
Yes.
### Hedgefunds hedge?
They used to. Hedgefunds used to protect cash by utilizing complex financial instruments.
The goal was to protect the cash, not to increase it.


This has changed. Now they're exclusive to the ultra wealthy and trade anything and everything to beat the market.

Art, stocks, weather, insurance, whatever. 


They do hedge their super risky bets but recently it's become clear that these hedges are by no means allencompassing.
### The shorting meta
You've seen kids build sandcastles and other kids coming around, give that castle a kick and it's all gone.


Imagine that's a company being built in years or decades and some piece of bad news leaving the company in shambles. They might be rebuild but that's going to take time.

Since both the buildup and the teardown can be used to make cash and it's much, much easier, less risky AND FASTER to damage a company than spotting a good company with great potential.

That's why hedgefunds love shorting so much and why they talk about them identifying fraud so much, _""They're the good guys""_ and all that. Once they have spottet a target they'll dig up any dirt they can find or otherwise make sure the company is viewed as a bad investment to profit greatly.



Found some wrong information? Please let me know and I'll edit it in with the appropriate credit!

Any questions are very welcome but finding the time to answer them in depth could take a while.

Hello fellow degenerate gambler! May I introduce you to the Pretty Decent Crew's newsletter for the trading week ending on March 19th?¬†

First things first, I'm going to keep using the sorta-kinda-gold-but-on-a-computer and banned tickers as recommendations because they make money. If you don't like it, find a different newsletter and I'll keep napping on my piles of virtual cash sitting in my¬†SPAC¬†bed. This is my return from ban by WSB for it and most of those degenerates are better at making memes than they are at investing so I guess I kind of had it coming. Sooooo here we go again!¬†

We're going to pick up right where we left off with some serious consideration of the wants/needs of people who are leaving the pandemic lockdown with hopes and aspirations of having a good time again. We got Carnival Cruise lines for a smash hit a few weeks back and we're going to find more (full disclosure: I'm definitely going to play them again). Our other acknowledgement is that virtual cash is tearing right now. That isn't going to stop. Grab a ticket for the tendie train and ride it until the wheels fall off. If you're not in already, just get what you can. Imagine you're buying and holding a super special magic version of SPY shares.¬†  
CRWD - 3/19 $220c  
My weekly pick is going to be CRWD. They've had a terrible week/month and are sitting $53 under their 52-week high. They've been wildly successful at beating earnings and continuing to improve their per/share outcomes. Here is the deal, everybody loves a good ramp up to earnings report, but the earning report itself could screw everything up. My take is this: the stimmy is getting delivered and they're going to beat earnings while trading at \~80% of ATH. Will it return to ATH? Doubtful. It will more than likely take a serious upturn and hopefully push for $220. I'm going to grab the $220c for 3/19 and hopefully dump within a day. Maybe before the earnings even deliver...¬†  
CCL - 7/16 $40c  
I have to do it. The goal is open season for ALL adults in the US by May 1st. Give that 4 weeks and we're looking summer travel dead in the eyes. We all know your redneck cousins in Nebraska are excited to get back on a boat for fake vacations to the carribean. They've got Facebook posts to catch up on. I'm looking at the July 16th $40c for movement back to $10 under their pre-pandemic numbers ($30 under ATH). As always, do NOT hold these when you hit your profit goal %. Dump that¬†  
NVDA - 5/21 $610c  
Here is the wild card for you. Nvidia is trading at $100 under ATH and their progress as a companies shows absolutely no signs of slowing down at all. Given the landscape, they've had a terrible month, but the company is not only solid, but they're increasing demand with the need for GPUs related to mining. The 5/21 date is paired along with the earnings report that will happen then. We all know they're going to produce an insane amount of profit and when that hits, we're going to cash in big time.¬†  
SNDL - 3/19 $1.5p  
If you're a real degenerate gambler looking to get yourself high blood pressure, play this one with me. Sundial Growers delivers earnings after close on Wednesday. We all know the future legalization of marijuana is going to make them a huge company, but right now they're trash and we all know it. They're the penny stock of weed companies. They've had a GREAT week leading up to earnings. I'm going to wait until the end of the day Tuesday or Wednesday to watch it go up more. When it hits $1.50+, I'm going to grab some puts. Here is the delicate part: it doesn't move much at all in comparison to those option prices. So what we're going to do is grab $1.50 puts for 3/19 that are already almost ITM. Then hold those babies when they flop on earnings. Full disclosure: this is an absolutely STUPID play, but it's going to be hilarious if it works.¬†  
Good luck this week! May the power of J-Pow be with you in Tendie Land.¬†

Plus, it may also explain why this is probably one of our greatest strength.I'm myself diagnosed Asperger myself and have spent years researching on the matter as I needed to understand why I couldn't feel and think the way my friends would.

SO...

# What is Autism and what is its prevalance in humans?

&#x200B;

**Autism Spectrum Disorder**\- Autism is a [developmental disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disorder) characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#cite_note-DSM5-3)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism)

\- ASD manifest in different forms and degrees. It can be low, mild, severe and isn't always manifesting as a severe mental disability.[https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/autism-spectrum-disorders](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/autism-spectrum-disorders)*eg:* [*Asperger's syndrome*](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/mental-health-aspergers-syndrome) *is on the milder end of the* [*autism*](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/default.htm) \*spectrum. A person with Asperger's may be very intelligent and able to handle their daily life. They may be really focused on topics that interest them and discuss them nonstop. But they have a much harder time socially.

&#x200B;

**Prevalence**

\- About 1 percent of the world population has autism spectrum disorder. ([CDC, 2014](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html))

\- Prevalence in the United States is estimated at 1 in 54 births. ([CDC, 2020](https://www.autism-society.org/releases/cdc-releases-new-prevalence-rates-of-people-with-autism-spectrum-disorder/))

\- More than 3.5 million Americans live with an autism spectrum disorder. ([Buescher et al., 2014](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-09/autism-costs-more-than-2-million-over-patient-s-life.html))

\- Prevalence of autism in U.S. children increased by 119.4 percent from 2000 (1 in 150) to 2010 (1 in 68). ([CDC, 2014](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html)) Autism is the fastest-growing developmental disability. ([CDC, 2020](https://www.autism-society.org/releases/cdc-releases-new-prevalence-rates-of-people-with-autism-spectrum-disorder/))

\- Prevalence has increased by 6-15 percent each year from 2002 to 2010. (Based on biennial numbers from the [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html))

\-  25% of 4500 children showing ASD symptoms participating in a study were not diagnosed and didn't know know they're affected. [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aur.2255](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aur.2255)

\-  ASD can be seen on brain MRIs, ASD brains physically developed differently.¬† [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3081653/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3081653/)

# ""Ok that's a lot but not all of us here have ASD... Even if one 1/54 or 1% of us on here did, how could this be proven and mean anything anyway?""

Well, the pourcentage of ASD apes on here is likely to be **higher** than in those studies... Why?

**Social Media Use and Happiness in Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder**\*""Social Media use by adults with ASD, specifically Facebook use in moderation, may enhance well-being and may be a protective factor against secondary mental health concerns common in this population"".In a 2013 study\*[*,*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563213000708) *researcher* ***Micah O.

**Social media use among adults with autism spectrum disorders***The purpose of this study was to examine patterns and social‚Äìemotional correlates of social media use in adults with ASD. Participants completed self-report measures of social media use, friendship quality and quantity, and loneliness.* ***The results indicated that the majority of participants (79.6%) used social networking sites (SNS)****, and that the most commonly cited reason for using SNS was social connection. Adults with ASD who used SNS were more likely to have close friends, and those who used SNS for social engagement reported closer friendship relationships.*

If you do some research, you will see that there's many other studies explaining why social medias are one of ASD favorite way to connect and communicate.

Maybe it would be interesting do a pol to see who's diagnosed or feel like being misdiagnosed here...

# ""Yeh ok but what's the link with GME or the stock market then?""

That's where things get interesting...There are hundreds of studies out there showing that **reward pathways** of autistic people are altered and therefore their social¬†relationships but also their **relationship with money** is totally different than the TD brains.

**Reward Circuitry Function in Autism During Face Anticipation and Outcomes***The aim of this study was to investigate reward circuitry responses in autism during reward anticipation and outcomes for monetary and social rewards.* ***During monetary anticipation, participants with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) showed hypoactivation in right nucleus accumbens and hyperactivation in right hippocampus, whereas during monetary outcomes, participants with ASDs showed hyperactivation in left midfrontal and anterior cingulate gyrus.*** *Groups did not differ in nucleus accumbens responses to faces. The ASD group demonstrated hyperactivation in bilateral amygdala during face anticipation that predicted social symptom severity and in bilateral insular cortex during face outcomes.* ***These results add to the growing body of evidence that autism is characterized by altered functioning of reward circuitry.*** *Additionally, atypical amygdala activation during the processing of social rewards may contribute to the development or expression of autistic features.*[^(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-011-1221-1)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-011-1221-1)

**Risk-Aversion and Rationality in Autism Spectrum Disorders***Risk-aversion and rationality have both been highlighted as core features of decision making in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). This study tested whether risk-aversion is related to rational decision-making in ASD individuals. ASD and matched control adults completed a decision-making task that discriminated between the use of risk-averse and rational strategies. Results showed that overall, ASD participants were more risk-averse than control participants. Specifically, both groups made similar choices when risk-aversion was the less rational strategy but* ***ASD participants chose more rational options than control participants when risk-aversion was the most rational strategy. This study confirmed that risk-aversion is a core feature of ASD and revealed that ASD individuals can switch their decision-making strategy adaptively to avoid negative consequences.***[^(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-018-3616-8)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-018-3616-8)

**Reward system dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders**\*‚ÄúParticipants with ASD showed the expected hypoactivation in the mesocorticolimbic circuitry in response to both reward types. In particular, diminished activation in the nucleus accumbens was observed when money, but not when social reward, was¬†at stake, whereas the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex were hypoactivated within the ASD group in response to both rewards.\*¬†***These data indicate that the reward circuitry is compromised in ASD in social as well as in non-social, i.e. monetary conditions,*** ***which likely contributes to atypical motivated behaviour.‚Äù***[^(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3682440/)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3682440/)

**Trait Autism is a Better Predictor of Empathy than Alexithymia***The study found that having more autistic traits is associated with lower empathy ‚Äì even after factoring alexithymia into the analysis. In fact, the study provides some of the* \*\*\*best evidence so far that autism is definitely linked to lower empathy.\*\*\***Autism and Reactions to Provocation in a Social and Non-social Context**[^(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-019-04257-w)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-019-04257-w)*Compared to Healthy controles, individuals with ASD showed similar externalizing behavior in the social context.* ***In the non-social context*** *(meaning non physical environment)* ***reactions after provocation were enhanced relative to non-provoking situations.*** *The findings implicate that the context is an important influencing variable when comparing individuals with ASD to HCs after being provoked.*

See where I'm going?

# ""Ok but it still doesn't mean you wouldn't give up at some point?""

ASD mostly characterised by Restrictive and Repetitive behaviours. We get even more obsessed when it comes to things we enjoy and distract us... or rather keep us in focus.

And what do ASD love more than everything? Yes Cramer, that's exactly what we like, the stock... because we love video games!

**The risk for pathological video game use appears larger in adults with ASD compared with TD ('traditional') adults**[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/)

**Video game use in boys with autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, or typical development***Boys with ASD spend much more time playing video games than do boys with TD, and boys with ASD and ADHD are at greater risk for problematic video game use than are boys with TD.*[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23897915/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23897915/)

**Video games from the perspective of adults with autism spectrum disorder**The most frequent all-time favorite video game genres were Role-Playing (31%) and Action-Adventure (19%).  *To the moon, right?*[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563215003581](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563215003581)

# ""Mmmmmh... but if all of this is just a game to you, you'll still end up turning off the console when you'll realise you might not get what you want?""

Nope, not really... the funny thing about ASD RRBs is that we are excited by the reward anticipation itself, not the reward. As long as the adversaire isn't down its knees giving up, we won't turn off the console. Plus, the thing we'll miss the most and regret while being millionaires is the entertainment and excitement itself.

**Common alterations in sensitivity to type but not amount of reward in ADHD and autism spectrum disorders**\*'The results, while not supporting hyposensitivity to changes in reward amount in ADHD and ASD, do suggest that both groups are generally less motivated in settings where social as opposed to monetary rewards can be earned.'\*[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21223259/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21223259/)

**Money motivates in autism, attention deficit**'*They also perform better when the reward is greater: for example, 15 cents rather than 5, or comments such as ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a star‚Äù as opposed to ‚ÄúWell done.‚Äù'*[https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/cognition-and-behavior-money-motivates-in-autism-attention-deficit/](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/cognition-and-behavior-money-motivates-in-autism-attention-deficit/)

I've lost a link to an amazing study showing that ASD individuals were more generous when it came to sharing their monetary reward with other participants compared to control. If anyone finds it, please post it in the comments :).

# Conclusion

Hedgies can try manipulate the ASD apes we are with FUD or any other techniques; ASD brains won‚Äôt react. We don't show improvement with hours of therapy not using reward as stimuli. And our stimuli here... well they are trying to take it away from us so all it does is increasing our obsession and make us buy more.

Anyway, I have no idea if all I just put together makes sense or is accurate but as having ASD, I'm relating to all of these facts 100%.

I also understand that there might just be only 10 of us with ASD here, as well as there could be 100k  but if you are not ASD and call yourself autist, make us proud with your diamond hands!

There's one thing I'm sure tho, it is that I love you all beautiful apes.

See you on the moon with unlimited crayons and video games.

**TDLR**:  CEO of UWMC, who won Bball national championship with Michigan State,  went to war with RKT. RKT responded by buying naming rights for Michigan  State BB team. New name ""Michigan State Spartans presented by Rocket  mortgage....

Alright so I have  been a long time holder of RKT and have played with UWMC. With Billions  being delayed I have more free time to watch real life.

**Step 1:** Mat Plays for Michigan State.

So  Mat was a walk on that made the team. Not that  there is anything wrong with that. He put in his dues, practiced against future NBA stars, and got himself a National Championship ring! So that is  sweet who does not want one of those. Mat is a loyal alumi and donates  lots of money. Link to his Forbes article on running his company like  Michigan st BBall [https://www.forbes.com/sites/robdube/2019/05/27/what-playing-for-a-national-championship-winning-basketball-team-taught-this-ceo-about-leadership/?sh=2b26e2107c91](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robdube/2019/05/27/what-playing-for-a-national-championship-winning-basketball-team-taught-this-ceo-about-leadership/?sh=2b26e2107c91)

Link to his 37M donation to Michigan State.[https://twitter.com/DanWetzel/status/1357424044677738503](https://twitter.com/DanWetzel/status/1357424044677738503)

**Step 2:** Dan Gilbert also goes to Michigan State....

So Dan Gilbert founder of Rocket companies also went to Michigan State. He is also a loyal alumnis.

**Step 3. Gauntlet is tossed down.**

Mat  hops on facebook live (looking high as hell... good for him) and tells  all his clients ""it us or them... ARE YOU ALL IN"" and has his clients  sign a contract that they will not deal with RKT. (None of my links will  post)

**Step 4.**  Buy the thing your enemy loves. (Art of War chapter 97)

Dan  Gilbert decides to throw his money bags around. After all what good is  having ""Fuck You Money"" if you dont use it. So what does he do. He goes  and buys the naming rights for Michigan St basketball team. So now every  time Mat looks at the thing he loves, the team he won a championship  with. It says "" Spartans presented by **Rocket Mortgage""**

Edit!!!! - Apparently they will not be fully named. https://www.freep.com/story/sports/college/michigan-state/spartans/2021/03/12/michigan-state-basketball-rocket-mortgage-sponsorship/4665634001/

‚ÄúThe sponsorship adds to a donation war between two of the nation‚Äôs leading lenders. Mat Ishbia, a former MSU basketball player who is the CEO of United Wholesale Mortgage, donated $32 million in February to the athletic department. Gilbert and his wife, Jennifer, gave $15 million to have a pavilion at Breslin named after them and contributed to the university‚Äôs Detroit Scholars Program and the Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities in 2016‚Äù"

Lets start at Roblox itself.
150 million active users mostly children which is growing by circa 40 million per year.
By monetizing in game items they create most of their revenue.  

Pros
1 Obviously a growing game community

2 potential for growth and generating new forms of income through the game in various ways.

3 huge market sentiment as for obvious reasons 

4 Directly listed on the market.

5 if u buy now and it will continue to rise u are happy and if u dont buy u will feel like you missed out.

6 in game item buying creates obligation.
If u potentially spent 100s of dollars on a character most likely u gonna keep on doing so and keep playing it.
7 ARK bought it.

Cons,
1Its a game. Its not facebook its a game.
And as you are investing in a game u can naturally think of some risk of investing in it on a longer term as of now its still growing. But this is really important to take in account it can simply get outdated kids might jump over to a new game for whatever reason. To say this is still big in 5 years from now is impossible to say also and mainly for next.

2 Mainly children play it. Because of their main community consisting of children it makes it hugely volatile and unsure in the future if this game fails in anyway to hold the attention its game over. Kids dont give a shit about all the money their parents spent. Pshylogical aspect they do care about their character 

3 they are still losing money although this should change and is not that dramatic and weird for a relatively new company.
U need to think of the constant developing to the game that needs to happen to keep their community intrested and happy. Although that is a good thing its also a continous high expense which will not go away.
The reason they are going public is to raise money for this sole reason developing. See CEO interview.

4 direct listing for unknown reasons they chose to do so. I personally think they did so because they are a bit cash short. Anyway direct listing meant for sure a higher trading price which is not weird at all and says nothing on first trading day. Also keep taking market sentiment in account. Me you your momma your daddy.

That ARK bought it says nothing but that they see some future in it. this move might be long anticipated and unknown whos involved and ins and outs. Remember that it did not went IPO.

Please dont buy because of somebody else rationalise yourself and suit your best tactics and research and if that happens to be the same thats ok then atleast u thought for yourself and are more sure of your next steps.

The strategy for me.
In my opinion this is going on a downtrend to potentially 55 range before moving back up.
I will at least wait a month and see if any downtrend unfolds if it does not, i will buy only if there are clear bullish signals.

Thank you for reading if u did so and i hope it helped you with your tactics.

This is the way.
Love and wealth to all."

This post is an attempt to bring some context to some of these price targets. 

Consider the fact that, even if GameStop's market capitalization briefly reaches $2T, it still will not be the most valuable company in the world (that title will remain with Apple). **At a market cap of $2T, shares of GME will be worth $28,680.** At a share price of $10k, GameStop's market capitalization will be  \~$700B, less than those of companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple.

Now, from the perspective of fundamentals, it doesn't make sense to compare GameStop's market cap to those of the companies just mentioned. However, in the context of a short squeeze, it seems like a reasonable comparison, especially in light of any evidence supporting the possibility that GameStop will briefly become the most valuable company in the world. And that possibility is quite plausible. 

Remember that Volkswagen became the most valuable company in the world when the price of its shares spiked in the midst of a short squeeze in 2008. You might say, ""Well, maybe market caps were more uniformly distributed in 2008, so the bar for VW was lower."" Ok, fair point. But at the peak of the VW short squeeze, VW attained a market cap of \~$420B. According to The World Bank (see [https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD)), the total market cap of all listed domestic companies worldwide was $32.27T in 2008, and $68.65T in 2018. So at the peak of the VW short squeeze, VW accounted for roughly 0.42/32.27 = 1.3% of total market cap. In 2018, 1.3% of total market cap was $0.013\*68.65T = $893B. **At a market cap of $893B, GME shares will be worth $12,806.** And this is a conservative estimate, since the current total market cap is considerably larger than it was in 2018.

TL;DR: The price of GME shares could reach anywhere from $12k to $28k. Obligatory  üöÄüöÄüöÄ."

This is a company with a strong founder/CEO, huge network effect & ecosystem MOAT, a large and attractive young user base that could propel it to become the next ""Facebook,"" and, for those who appreciate healthy fundamentals, strong and steady topline revenue growth as well as positive cash flows.

Roblox will open at $45, based on its recently fundraising round valuing it at $29.5B.

I believe that its fair stock price (sell target) is $80. Below is my quick analysis:

\- The average first day gain of tech IPOs in 2020 was 82%. That would value Roblox at **\~$82/share.**

\- Here's something unique about Roblox's financials. **While its revenue in 2020 was $924 millions, its 2020 revenue bookings, which contributed to its actual cash flows from users who bought a lot of Rubux, was double that at $1.9 billions.** Further, while the company didn't report a profit, **it had a very positive free cash flow of $524 million** due to its high $1.9 billion of booking. This reminds me of Amazon's beautiful model of free cash flows which propelled its rocket growth over the year despite seeming unprofitability.

\- Given Roblox's unique high billing compared to its revenue, **I decided to take the average of its revenue and billing (Average of $924M and $1.9Bn = $1.4Bn) to apply comparable companies' multiples to.**

\- **Its closest comparable companies are Unity and Facebook (at the time of IPO in 2012).** Unity is trading at 36x trailing 12 month revenue but had negative cash flow with a much less attractive business model. Facebook, another company built on strong network effects, traded at \~28x trailing 12 month revenue and 100x its trailing 12 months earnings at its IPO in 2012.

\- If I apply Facebook's 100x TTM earnings multiple to Roblox's $524M free cash flow in 2020, I get \~$52Bn of market cap or **\~$80 in stock price. Facebook, at the time of its IPO, traded at >220x trailing 12 month free cash flow.** Unity had negative free cash flows in 2020. Hence, one could argue that the 100x free cash flow multiple is reasonable if not conservative.

\- If I apply 36x TTM revenue multiple from Unity today to the average of Roblox's revenue and billing at $1.4Bn, I got \~$50Bn in market cap, **or $77 in stock price.** If I apply FB's 28x at its time of IPO, the stock price would be \~$60 but the market also generally traded at lower multiples back in 2012 plus Facebook's valuation grew tremendously after IPO, **so Unity's revenue multiple is more applicable for today's market.**

**Highs:**

**- Strong founder CEO:** David Baszucki is one of the most visionary founder CEOs with both solid leadership chops and a strong product vision.

**- Huge network effect and ecosystem MOAT:** Roblox has a beautiful business model, a hybrid of subscription and marketplace. The ecosystem it has created over a long time has a highly defendable MOAT. Fueled by strong cash flows, the company is also continually investing in its ecosystem.

**- A large captivated young user base - an envy for Facebook + opportunities for international growth opportunities:** If you are hunting for the next Facebook, it will never look like Facebook. Half of the kids in the US are on Roblox and it's rapidly expanding internationally! Zuckerberg is constantly paranoid about losing the next generation. Here comes Roblox!

**- Potentially huge advertising revenue opportunities.** Roblox is still at the early stages of exploring advertising revenue opportunities given its huge attractive user base. This can be huge.

**Risk:**

**- COVID's fading:** As COVID fades, people may go outside and spend less time gaming. However, looking at Roblox' steady YoY growth even before COVID, it seems that COVID was simply an accelerator but not a game changer."

Roblox made $923.9 million of revenue last year 2020 - but reported a loss of $253.3 million....

Roblox is NOT currently profitable.

Paying the Roblox content creators 30% of revenue is $277.17 million (almost what they posted as loss, which is fishy), but leaves $696.73 million of revenue.

So let‚Äôs try to figure out Operating Expenses...

7 executives according to https://corp.roblox.com/people/ - whom are reportedly very well compensated. But I think the website is out of date, or skimmed on purpose - I‚Äôm a tech infrastructure guy and I know of Dan Williams hired at Roblox in 2017 (moving from Dropbox, before that Facebook) to tackle their infrastructure issues - https://corp.roblox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TechCrunch-Ron-Miller-How-Roblox-Completely-Transformed-its-Tech-Stack.pdf More on him and the infrastructure later.

So this site says that they are up to 26 executives- https://craft.co/roblox/executives

Ok, let‚Äôs low ball at $3 million a year each exec (unknown bonuses) (https://fintechzoom.com/fintech_news_roblox/heres-how-much-robloxs-executives-and-cofounders-make/ ) minus $78 million = $618.73 million revenue.

They currently have 960 employees. https://www.barrons.com/articles/roblox-sets-date-to-go-public-through-a-direct-listing-51614036401

953 non exec employees. Some are in China, some make more than others. Majority have a Silicon Valley engineering salary, benefits + perks - let‚Äôs estimate and say those 953 employees average a cost of $300k a year. That‚Äôs another $285.9 million in employee wages, leaves us with $332.83 million left of the revenue for 2020.

$332.83 million estimated left in revenue plus the reported $253.3 million reported loss for 2020 is still $586.13 million left to cover.

Data Center + migration costs. Back to Dan Williams. His purpose was to reduce the infrastructure costs by moving everything they could off of AWS and Windows servers. AWS cloud provider costs + running everything on Windows servers with a cost of license per server - is fucking expensive. My best guess and hope for investing is that this cost is what got rolled up into the $253.3 million reported loss for 2020. This meant setting up 5+ year contracts with Data Center and POP co-location providers (point of presence, where the Comcast, Verizon, etc ISPs hand off their internet traffic). Roblox wouldn‚Äôt have the FB type cash to build their own data centers, so you are talking about $30k a month lease per site. At least 8x Data Centers in the US with 1-3 POPs per DC. ~24 contracts at $30k a month = $8.64 million a year. Similar costs in China, maybe - I dunno the network layout there or how things go with dealing with Chinese government, hence the deal with Tencent.
The cost for populating these Data Centers and POPs with hardware, and performing the migration is the upfront expensive part. Buying the server hardware, buying the network equipment - paying for your own network transit instead of leasing from AWS. Heavy upfront costs, but much much cheaper in the long run than AWS bills.

But I cannot figure anything that would add up to $586.13 million, even if they were giving blank checks and made subpar deals with vars and vendors where everyone got a very hefty cut to make things happen fast and smooth. I also don‚Äôt know what existing contracts they might have had to break / pay off to go the route that would be best going forward.
I‚Äôm gonna rough estimate $150 million on infrastructure equipment and another $150 million on contracts and vendor costs. $586.13 million minus that very rough $300 million brings me down to ~$286 million of costs unaccounted for (again, almost their reported loss - still fishy).

And I doubt they have been able to move all of their services off of AWS - which means they still pay AWS bills, and depending on what services those are - they could be hefty bills.
I do know that if Roblox had planned better from the start - they wouldn‚Äôt even be going public. Optimized servers and back end code on free Linux distos, even running on a cloud provider - would be profitable with their volume. Look at Steam...

So, long term:
Roblox has almost 300 open job positions https://corp.roblox.com/careers/ between US and China. They are pushing hard to expand into China through a ownership partnership with Tencent (look them up if you are not into gaming). They are actively working to right the ship and they have hired high level executives and engineers who have past experience producing results for other Fortune 100 companies.

I spent this time to look into things I was questionable about and still the $253 million loss on ~$1 billion revenue. I didn‚Äôt fully answer my own questions, but got a reasonable explanation for myself.

I‚Äôm not selling my GME or rest of my folio to go RBLX - but I am going to go in with what I‚Äôve got tomorrow am. I‚Äôm a high risk, short term profit guy - so that‚Äôs I‚Äôm betting on. But this could still be the direct listing IPO that tanks after opening. After looking deeper into the rockstars on the Roblox team, and typing all this shit up on mobile - I like the upside."

# The Roblox IPO Is Coming March 10. Here Are 2 Things Investors Should Know

## Roblox stock is well-positioned to grow over the next few years.

**Roblox** was supposed to go public in 2020. Then the explosive trading debuts of **Airbnb** and **Doordash** forced it to rethink those plans.

If Roblox had proceeded with its original IPO plan, it could have left serious money on the table, just like Airbnb and Doordash did. And since the main point of an IPO is to raise capital -- not help institutional investors make a quick buck -- there might be a better way to do it.

And there is.

## Going public via a direct listing

After postponing the IPO, Roblox raised¬†$520 million from investors in a private funding round. The deal gave Roblox a $29.5 billion valuation -- [up sevenfold ](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/1-chart-showing-robloxs-12x-valuation-increase/)from a year ago.

Next, Roblox announced its plan to go public via a direct listing. This [route](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/01/spacs-vs-direct-listings-key-differences-investors/) could further save Roblox money on underwriters' fees while still taking the company public.

Roblox will finally make its market debut on March 10, trading under the ticker RBLX. But before rushing in to buy the stock, here are two things you should know.

## Roblox's money-making machine

CEO David Baszucki and Erik Cassel founded Roblox in 2004 with a vision of connecting people through immersive virtual worlds. On Roblox, users create games and play games created by other users.¬†Initially, Roblox had a user base of several hundred people. Today, more than 36 million users play and interact on Roblox on a daily basis.

There are two crucial parts to Roblox's business model. The first part is the gaming platform on which users (developers and gamers) build and play games. Here, 7 million developers are building what Roblox calls ""experiences"" -- games, virtual items, and worlds. Thanks to Roblox's tools, it is easy for even children to create exciting games using Lego-like blocks instead of code.¬†

With 18 million experiences available to choose from, Roblox can easily attract new users and retain old ones. And as more users join Roblox's platform (and spend money on those games), developers are incentivized to create more engaging content -- drawing in even more gamers.

But that's just half the story.

When users enter Roblox, they usually invite their friends to join them. Then those friends invite *their* friends, and so on. With endless experiences to choose from, this virtuous cycle sustains Roblox's network effect. Sound familiar? That's how [**Facebook** grew](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/07/28/proof-facebook-inc-has-a-moat.aspx) into what it is today.¬†

And because these games are not ""just"" games -- they are *Minecraft-*style worlds with plenty to discover -- Roblox's users spend lots of time on the platform. Even users who aren't gamers stick around just to hang out with each other. Like Facebook, Roblox is a social network.

Backed by the sheer size of its community, Roblox has managed to carve out an ecosystem with its own rules, economy, and currency. Users don't have to pay to play most games on Roblox. But they can buy and spend Robux -- Roblox's in-game currency -- to upgrade their avatars with accessories, clothing, or special powers.

To generate revenue, Roblox gets a 30% cut on user spending. The rest goes to developers on the platform. It also earns a commission when developers convert Robux into real dollars. So far, all this has worked out well for Roblox. Revenue grew 56% in 2019 to $488 million. In the first nine months of 2020, revenue grew even faster -- rising 68% to $589 million.

## Roblox is just getting started

COVID-19 was a turbocharger for Roblox, [just like](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/06/3-top-video-game-stocks-to-buy-in-october/) it was for many other video game companies. Roblox's daily active users [jumped 97%](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/01/why-is-everyone-talking-about-the-roblox-ipo/) year over year in 2020 -- the fastest rate of growth ever. Many of Roblox's users are still new, but will likely become more engaged over time. As they discover great games to play and immerse themselves in Roblox's many communities, they will naturally spend more Robux.

Roblox is also targeting international markets to grow its user base further. It has invested in automated translation technology and a regional compliance system that will help developers reach a bigger global audience. It is also working with **Tencent Holdings** to grow its business in China, the world's biggest video game market.

Beyond gaming, Roblox's potential dramatically widens its addressable market. It aims to evolve into what it calls a ""human co-experience"" platform where people can come together to play, learn, and work. For example, Roblox could host virtual classes, alongside graduation ceremonies, corporate meetings, and concerts in the future. Moreover, as its social network grows, Roblox will become even more attractive as a marketing tool. In fact, major brands like **Netflix** and Marvel have already introduced¬†branded content onto the platform.¬†

For Roblox, all these opportunities represent potential growth engines -- and a bright future. While it is unlikely that all of these ventures will end up being a runaway success, some will, and that will be enough to keep Roblox growing fast for many years ahead.

## It will be a volatile ride ahead

2020 was the year of the red-hot tech stock. Popular names like **Square**¬†and **MercadoLibre**¬†are trading at steep valuations after rising 240% and 180% last year. Newer tech IPOs like **Unity Software** and Airbnb have more than doubled from their offering price.

Roblox will likely get a similarly warm welcome, along with a high IPO valuation. That's understandable, given Roblox's track record of rapid growth -- as well as the potential to sustain it for many more years.

Still, that's no reason to leave caution to the wind. Investors should not overpay for a stock, no matter how great its prospects look. Also, Roblox is running at massive losses, and this may be the case for years ahead.

It's not unusual for [high-growth companies](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/growth-stocks/) to invest heavily to fuel market-beating growth. But a loss-making business *and* high valuations make any stock extremely vulnerable to a market correction. And given how [shaky tech](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/these-2-tech-giants-pulled-the-nasdaq-back-from-th/) stocks are these days, Roblox won't be in for a smooth ride.¬†

Roblox may be all fun and games. But its stock won't be for the faint-hearted."

&#x200B;

1. OIL calls / shares -- sell end of summer / beg of fall. Generationally cheap --- with re-opening AND constrained supply due to all of the green initiatives, we should see a major runup of oil prices.
2. FINANCIAL calls, in particular I like WFC due to cheap calls. It was in the 50s before COVID reared its ugly head.
3. BABA - beat down by Xi's cockhammer but still absolutely dominant in China. It's the best undervalued tech name (even better than FB in my opinion). BABA also is heavily invested in the China start-up ecosystem, so should do well even with more-than-expected regulation (which I find unlikely)

**Why I like these plays:**

These plays should do well in all 2021 environments.

* Inflation fears due to overstimulus? Oil and financials will do great while BABA, given how cheap it is, will be flat.
* Inflation fears overblown yet reopening moves forward? All 3 should do extremely well.
* New COVID strain renders current vaccines useless -- BABA will do well and oil/financials will be flat. This is just unlikely to happen, boyz. Even with new variants things will continue to open up.

The only way to lose money is if we have a zombie apocalypse.

&#x200B;

**Positions**

1. WFC:  June 50c or 45c and sold 4/16 puts to pay for the calls. 1000 shares.
2. BABA: 710 shares -- no options as I don't have a good thesis on WHEN it will moon.
3. XOM, OXY, CPE, MRO, MPC -- various shares and options with different strikes from next month through August. Also selling puts to pay for the calls. 200k into it overall.

**TLDR: UWMC is better than RKT and I think it's better for both the short-term traders and the long-hold investors.**

I have read a lot of great analysis of their financials all over Reddit recently so I won't bore with too many details but the high altitude view goes as follows:

* Went public with a $16B valuation based on ONLY three quarters of 2020 (9.5X multiple on adjusted income)
* In Q3 2020 alone they did $1.45B in net income (which means their Q4 reporting towards the end of April is going to be massive!)
* At today's price the dividend yield is over 4% annually!  Ex-dividend date is this coming Tuesday, meaning if you're going to buy do it BEFORE Tuesday March 9th
* It was announced this week they'll be included in the Russell 1000 and Russell 3000 Index beginning March 22nd which means EXTRA buying necessity between now and earnings

**For the semi-retarded members here this means tons of net buying between now and March 22nd because of INDEX INCLUSION, DIVIDEND BONUS, and EARNINGS RUN-UP!**

&#x200B;

Now, as a realtor I'd like to add some professional analysis here and I'll touch on RKT briefly too because they're being compared a lot due to sector similarity but their models are totally different.

&#x200B;

1. It doesn't matter what mortgage rates are, mortgage originators always make X% margin on every loan they sell. **What matters is the number of purchases and refi's (ie how many widgets they sell)** Nationwide there is a MASSIVE shortage of housing supply because people are simply not moving which means when things return to ""normal"" we'll see 1X, 2X, 5x, and in some markets even 10X the number of homes being sold which translates to the same number of new loans being originated.  **Profits are way higher on new purchases vs. refi's so while nobody is turning refi's down their marketing dollars are spent generating loans on new purchases.**  Anybody who tuned in to UWMC's final sales call of 2020 for their national reps heard their **CEO Matt Ishba talking about how they'd spend the money they'd get from going public and he was all about RELATIONSHIPS**.  Relationships with realtors particularly but also with other real estate spheres in influence (insurance agents, title companies, etc)
2. **RKT has great market share but realtors hate when clients consider using them because they frequently take way longer to close a loan** than what is considered normal (3-4 weeks right now). Originators like the salespeople working through UWMC have a major competitive advantage against Rocket and others because they close deals fast! That is all that matters to realtors and realtors are often the person that is pointing people in the direction of the lending option.  **RKT may get a lot of market share for refi's (the lower profitability loans) but UWMC is poised to get a growing share of higher profit new purchase volume**, especially as supply of homes for sale (new and pre-owned) increases to meet demand).

Now, anybody who has either considered selling a home recently or buying a home recently knows this but for those not in those categories the real estate market is insane right now!  Think ""*Melvin Capital scrounging for GME shares to cover their shorts in the biggest gamma squeeze cycle ever*"" insane!  Mediocre homes are selling for over asking price within days of hitting the market and buyers are FOMO'ing hardcore into paying these escalating prices.  ***That's a great thing for sellers but doesn't do anything good or bad for UWMC holders.***

&#x200B;

**THIS IS WHAT MATTERS FOR UWMC INVESTORS:**

**As inventory increases** (*which it will because in some states Covid made it near impossible to sell*) in 2021 **and as prices become to normalize** (*causing more people to want to move because it won't be insanely expensive on the buy side*) **the volume of high profit loans for new purchases will increase**.  Again, it doesn't matter if interest rates go up a little, it's not like they're going to double.  Interest rates are at all time lows [as seen here from Freddie Mac](http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/pmms30.html) and that isn't going to change for years to come.

UWMC pays a regular dividend, is about to announce an insane Q4 on or around April 23rd, and since they're the largest originator of loans in the country they will absolutely see a rising price moving forward into 2021.

**Short-Term Traders:** Best bet for you is to buy slightly OTM April or May calls.  Personally I'd buy May calls but with the intention of selling them during the earnings run-up (if that happens) and/or holding them through ER if the run-up isn't significant enough due to the market's overall vibe right now.  Buying May calls gives you extra insurance which I like but degens should stick to April and save the premim.

**Long Term Investors:** At current prices (between $9-10/share today) if you're not buying now than there is no helping you.  I've bought at levels as low as $9 and as high as $12 and I'm comfortable anywhere in that range.  I don't think a price of $16-18 by year's end is unreasonable once the company has steady quarterly growth figures for bigger investors to buy in with.  I believe we'll see over $20/share only if the market as a whole starts humming along and only if local home sale inventory returns to 2019 levels and I'd guesstimate that is 50/50 shot.

**TLDR Again: Tons of net buying between now and March 22nd because of INDEX INCLUSION, DIVIDEND BONUS, and EARNINGS RUN-UP in April!**

**Again, this is just the bull thesis.**  I think a few decent bearish points have been made elsewhere that I can get behind but most have to deal with mortgages being unsexy or the company being young and untested.  Well....

Edit 2: Adding this [amazing article](https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/2021/03/04/united-wholesale-mortgage-ultimatum-rocket-companies/4578357001/) where the CEO of UWM, Matt Ishbia, walked into the room for his Facebook Live broadcast to UWM's brokers, unzipped his pants, whipped his thing out, smacked them around a little bit, and zipped back up and dropped the mic.  **TLDR: He told UWM loan officers that effective Mid-March they must decide whether they'll keep working with Rocket OR United Wholesale Mortgage because working with both would no longer be an option (this will hurt RKT, not UWMC).**"

After a long hiatus (banned for mentioning a SPAC that went from 10 to 60 back to 24, and AMC before it was 1 billion in value). I have returned for the next big opportunity. Honestly there are a few with the recent route in the market, but here is opportunity #1 in my opinion based on technical and internal financial information.

Alibaba ticker BABA: But OP, china risk, and regulation, and it‚Äôs down 26.25% from its high of $317.14! STFU and keep reading:

[Alibaba Group Holding Ltd - ADR (BABA : NYSE) Stock Price & News - Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/BABA:NYSE?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijpci4gZfvAhUaGVkFHT4EDsoQ3ecFMAB6BAgGEBo)

Yup that‚Äôs why I love the company. Alibaba posted better than expected earnings beating on top and bottom with growth YOY 36% yeah that‚Äôs amazing. Because fundamentally nothing has changed. It‚Äôs current P/e is an amazingly low 25.93x yes, a company growing 30% YOY is trading below its growth rate and further the sector average P/e is 49.18x Now I know we are fucking retarded here so based on basic math BABA is valued at half of its competitors. That‚Äôs a buy signal alone as if it can reach the same valuation; get ready: it doubles from this price.

But OP China is going to regulate big Chinese tech! No, China wants to be the leader in tech and can‚Äôt afford to cut the legs from its largest most profitable companies. The recent ‚ÄúNEWS‚Äù on the clamping down of its tech companies is in my opinion noise. Think of it this way: When FB was fined in the EU they fined FB $122 Million dollars. Ouch. (But not really because: day do be rich doh! FB is in a similar BABA spot in the USA I like it too) China‚Äôs fine to Alibaba? 76k [China Fines Alibaba, Tencent Unit Under Anti-Monopoly Laws - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/china-fines-alibaba-tencent-for-flouting-rules-in-past-deals) Yeah‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a serious reprimand‚Ä¶ This is classic China manipulation of their publicly traded companies to reduce the price before they rocket higher. They do this very often in the penny stock area of the market. This time they just went bigger. ANT ipo? Still on, they just are requiring higher cash reserves for the lending arm. What does that mean? It means that the loans provided by ANT will have better backing and will be less likely for default. Further ANT deals with digital money and the people‚Äôs republic of china government has already said they are looking to Alibaba to help roll out with a digital yuan. See what‚Äôs going on here? China is publicly reprimanding a company that it is actively working with to bring in the future. [MYbank, backed by Alibaba's Ant Group, joins China's digital yuan pilot (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/mybank-backed-by-alibabas-ant-group-joins-chinas-digital-yuan-pilot.html)

Ignore the noise, ignore the ‚ÄúSmart Money‚Äù they have a time horizon of 2 weeks. We have the time horizon of DIAMONDS!!

My position is 6 BABA 280p sold short at $61 I also have 5 credit spreads 290/300p

TL:DR BABA could double based on its current valuation and the fact that it continues to grow, is picked by government to work on digital currency roll out and its low P/e"

While everyone was crying about the market taking a shit and RKT crashing ([I was crying too](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx7mlz/rkt_12k_114k_17k/)) it was announced ZNGA acquired a game studio, [Echtra Games](https://venturebeat.com/2021/03/03/zynga-acquires-diablo-co-creators-echtra-games-in-expansion-to-pc-and-consoles/), whose creator and his team played a pivital role in Diablo/Diablo II. They were acquired with the goal to help Zynga move into PC/cross-platform game play. I think this is a promising acquisition with lots of future potential and is just [one of many planned for this year](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/zynga-q4-earnings/).

The CEO of Zynga also spoke at a conference with Morgan Stanley today. Below are some excerpts he said during the call that I found interesting .

&#x200B;

**Well known established global IP + data driven iteration + proven game mechanics =** üöÄ

>We like to learn from what we've done before. And in the case of Harry Potter that was a big element of it. One of the things that we learned was we needed an intellectual property in a world that was appealing to a much larger audience and a much more global audience, so that a lot of the cool game play features that we had could reach a bigger audience. So we combined a new IP with some proven mechanics that we'd been messing around with. And then we tested it for a very long period of time and test markets. That's really the structural difference between mobile and console.  
>  
>In mobile, you can really test market something to remove a lot of the introduction risk. And so with Harry Potter that was something that we did as we went into whether it was Australia or Canada, we were testing very specific elements of what makes for a successful game. Does it retain? Does it engage? What's the conversion rates? Does the UA scale against what the cost of acquisition is? And so, we thoroughly put Harry Potter through its test marketing phases. And what we're really excited about was first and foremost the reception from fans was phenomenal.  
>  
>We saw - the ratings were very strong. The Harry Potter fans were raving about it. It went really viral. We did some fun stuff with Zayn Malik. And it really had really a lot of nice momentum out of the launch. But then when it started to hit weeks 14, 30 and beyond, all the testing that we had done about what were the retention rates engagements, we were exceeding them. So it was actually really positive to see that the test marketing worked and that was a critical part of the success here.

The Harry Potter IP is a money machine. If you can integrate the game mechanics that get people to continually make micro transactions, or spend hours playing, combined with a raving fan base of an established global IP, imo this is going to print money for them.

The Harry Potter game was [launched on Sep/23](https://investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-launches-harry-potter-puzzles-spells-worldwide). I think we could see a lift in revenue in the coming quarters from this game.

&#x200B;

**2 Upcoming Game Releases in the First Half**

They're targeting 2 new game releases in the first half ""Puzzle Combat"" and ""FarmVille 3"".

**On Puzzle Combat**

>So as we think about releasing Puzzle Combat in the first half, I wouldn't necessarily set the expectations that this is a theatrical movie model where it's - a Marvel movie that comes out at summer and it's got this huge spike. That's not at all the model here, right. We're in this for the long-term. This is a marathon, not a sprint. And so, we're going to be releasing the game, see how it settles in and then very methodically start acquiring based on what we're seeing in the dynamics and the metrics.

**On FarmVille**

>And, there are a lot of fans that have tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of people had played FarmVille over the years. And when we think about all of those fans and what their expectations are and how to bring them into a new experience, we‚Äôve doing a lot of testing. We‚Äôre also running a bunch of FarmVille games right now, whether it‚Äôs Country Escape or Tropic Escape, which has a very big fan base and they love the game.  
>  
>And so it‚Äôs a little bit more complicated to navigate some of the pre-set expectations, but what we‚Äôve done is really build out a terrific new experience and experience that is unlike LA. It has things that are familiar to people that have played FarmVille in the past, but it‚Äôs got a lot of unique new elements to it, and a new look and feel that feels very modern and very cutting edge for what we believe mobile games really are these days.

Puzzle Combat is more of a long play, and I like these types of strategies mixed in with shorter term plays. Zynga seems to have a healthy balance of this, which I really like.

What I think Zynga does well is tailoring their games to the fan base. I think FV3 is going to be a fresh reboot of the beloved game by its fans with new elements to keep users engaged.

&#x200B;

**Expansion into cross-platform gaming**

As mentioned, they acquired Echtra to boost their expansion into cross-platform gaming. Unrelated to the acquisition, one of the first cross-platform titles later this year will be Star Wars Hunters.

&#x200B;

>Yeah. I think if you take a step back and look at the industry overall, some of the largest franchises in the world right now are cross-platform, and they‚Äôre free to play in many cases with seasons passes and things like Fortnite, Pub G, Engine Impact, a lot of people have been talking about how the console developers getting into mobiles the thing. Well, I think that door swings both ways. I think mobile developers can actually step into the cross-platform mega franchise part of the market, because of a few reasons.

&#x200B;

Regarding the team they acquired:

&#x200B;

>I think the last point I‚Äôd make on cross-platform is that. We‚Äôre just getting started in this. So the acquisition of Echtra is really a key one for us, because ultimately game quality is a function of game team talent and leadership. And when you look at these guys, they‚Äôve worked on RPGs for up their whole careers. They‚Äôve worked on Diablo, they helped to create Torchlight, which is a fantastic IP and the action RPG category. They‚Äôve actually published games cross-platform. It‚Äôs a team less than 50 in San Francisco right near our shop.

I think if the launch of Star Wars Hunters goes well in the second half of the year then I think it's possible we see a nice upward movement on the price.

&#x200B;

**Becoming a first party ads platform cutting out third party platforms like Google/Apple**

&#x200B;

>...mid-point the last year, we started looking at the fact that we were one of the premier advertisers in gaming. All of our games are enabled for IAP and IAA. But between the time that they saw an ad and they ended up in our game, we had it was kind of opaque, right. We worked with other parties ‚Äì other third particles or use other third-parties like, Iron Source or Unity app and Google, Facebook, and the third-parties were handling a lot of the information and a lot of the acquisition. And then we looked at our first party data asset, which is the data that we were generating around what a player was doing inside of our games.  
>  
>And that was tremendously valuable, but we were missing that piece of it. And so when we looked at it, we said, wait a second. If we do a couple of things here, we can capture the 15% to 30% we‚Äôre paying partners right now, just to manage the exchanges. We would get more information about what‚Äôs hot, and what‚Äôs not at the top of the funnel in terms of what‚Äôs appealing? What‚Äôs not appealing? What companies or products are doing better and why? We would be able to creatively optimize our products better. We ended in a post IDFA world that would all become first party data. The big issue with privacy is what is one party exchanging to another party about an individual, right? But if you enter one network and you have a good exchange of what your permissions are, you carry through that whole process in a high fidelity way from a data standpoint.  
>  
>And so when we looked at it from multiple directions, we're like, wow, we can margin expand, we can pick up more efficiency in our UA dollars and in our advertising business. We could grow our advertising business faster and we could generate potentially a competitive advantage and information superiority, just knowing more about the players coming into our walled garden or into our platform than the next guy.  
>  
>We felt like this was something that we could go after. We went through a very diligent process of breaking down what these look like. And we found that some of these components we could build, some of these components we need to partner on and in addition to that in ad tech, there's a lot of - there's really a lot of vibrant companies and opportunities out there to potentially partner as you've seen from recent development.  
>  
>So when we think about where we were as a company, we were a mobile pure play developer and publisher and we felt that that is a really valuable company, but we thought that we could become an even more valuable company by building out our platform by starting to grow our total addressable market by getting into consoles and PCs, and then leveraging this unique asset and hyper casual to really supercharge the platform as well as get us into a place where we're seeing more information coming into the top of the funnel and then converting them into players and ultimately payers.""

This really sticks out to me. Zynga was 1 step ahead from the new pivot by Apple/Google on stronger ad tracking privacy. They're becoming the ads exchange where companies pay for displaying ads in games. This also gives them an advantage on learning what's working for others and apply that to their business model.

Positions: $27k with various calls throughout the year. I think they could have a great ER to justify a new target price from analysts, so went with a higher strike price after their next ER.

I have a trade dispute with my broker and they are claiming that the primary market didn't open until 9:43 am and trading options a few seconds after that at a price of $297 which is when I could sell. However, I show on NYSE and Gamestop's investor relations that the opening price was $354.

I was up and active in the pre-market watching the price and when open happened I was unable to sell my options until \~15 minutes later. I saw volume on the ticker during those times and the price of the options change on other brokerage platforms.

If anyone knows of any website with historical options trade information or at the very least can corroborate what I saw (maybe even trade data) I would greatly appreciate it. The dispute is for a large sum and I don't want to have to go FINRA arbitration.

**Edit: Due to my low karma I am unable to directly reply to the comments. I want to assert that they are trying to say that the NASDAQ did not open until 9:43 AM EST and I believe that to be false based on other brokerage price action (Robinhood/Webull).**

&#x200B;

**Edit 2: I did some digging based on** u/meta-cognizant **suggestion of marketchameleon. I downloaded the options transaction log for 01/27/2021 and to my surprise my brokerage is 100% absolutely correct which blew my mind. Options did not start trading until 9:43:52 AM.**

&#x200B;

**TLDR: Brokerage was correct and options activity was not started until 09:43:52 AM EST on 01/27/2021.**"

Let's talk fundamentals, because fundamentals are what we should speak about and I am more of a fundamental player than a technical one. And fundamentally, Marc Benioff has kept to and maintained his 20% YoY revenue growth. The last three quarters, especially, have been gigantic in terms of earnings, as Salesforce has significantly beat Earnings due to the pandemic boost.

Furthermore, margin expansion also beat expectations. Furthermore, what that means is that when revenue growth inevitably dips below twenty percent sometime in the next few years, margin growth should keep earnings growth above 20 percent well in the future. Margin expansion should be helped by WFH after the pandemic, as Salesforce reduces workspace to accommodate (something it has mentioned it will be doing).

The acquisitions that Salesforce has made, while perhaps too generous, ensure that there is retention of top executives because they buy in. It also allows for upselling, and that's huge for us because like, like Microsoft, it can keep you within its ecosystem. As customer retention is above -90  percent-, this allows for sticky customers... And this will likely continue to grind higher.

Furthermore, Salesforce dominates the SFA space but only has 30 percent of the market in a highly fragmented and still growing space.

Salesforce's projected acquisition of Slack was a very large drag, and the general selloff of the tech sector has provided a huge downward push unto Salesforce. I think that critics have been proven wrong about Benioff's prior acquisitions, and that acquiring companies always suffer a short term drag to their stock before gaining upward momentum because of it. Slack's earnings are tomorrow, and should definitely beat last quarter's EPS which was positive. I expect that Slack will have an amazing quarter, much as other WFH companies have had, and that will prove to be a positive catalyst on Salesforce Stock.

Analysts have a consensus price target of 270.75. Morningstar has one at 265. The price right now is a touch under 206. That's huge upside, and a positive catalyst could cause an upward explosion in the stock. It doesn't even have to be micro, but macro, with passage of the stimulus bill which congress says it will pass mid march. Heck, even a  more micro focused easing of tension regarding interest rates would cause a significant upward momentum. Salesforce is oversold.

I bought 3 March 19 calls to allow them to print, and I also have 14 shares.

Zynga (yes, the FarmVille one) has had a solid year. They‚Äôve shown good profit and have a strong outlook for 2021. When they‚Äôre compared to competitors they‚Äôre undervalued by about $5 per share depending on the day. They hold solid market share, and have agreements in place for strong properties (Harry Potter and Star Wars to start). 

I‚Äôve been reading some speculative rumors that Zynga has been having some discussions about being acquired by a larger company. I‚Äôve seen arguments Snap has a standing agreement with Zynga for gaming, and Facebook will, at some point, need to work more on diversifying. Both want need to expand into new realms of revenue and buying a profitable company with a growing user base would be a solid move.  However, I want to throw an idea out there that Apple could have a good case to buy Zynga to bolster their own somewhat feeble (for Apple) gaming division both on mobile and on devices like the Apple TV.

There is apparently a new TV coming out, but at what point is that device pointless when a lot of TVs are coming with Apple software native to the TVs OS?  To me, the logical expansion is to make it a more gaming friendly console and a good way to do that is to add a suite of games by buying the dev. 

On mobile the draw is more so to cut out the middle man and add Zynga profits to their own. Zynga also owns rights to some great properties and has a close competitor to Fortnite coming out. This would help Apple fight Fortnite its self and the messy battle that that is turning into.



I put some money on $ZNGA for these reasons. If not Apple, someone might snatch this one up before WSB decides to YOLO it like $GME"

lu46g7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lu46g7/jfrog_frog_dd_a_great_software_company_with_a_lot/,üê∏üê∏ JFrog $FROG DD - A great software company with a lot of room for growth. üê∏üê∏,17,48,2021-02-28 11:20:57,"# üê∏ is getting ready to leap.

This is my first DD post so I would appreciate any feedback and criticism of assumptions I am making here. But I thing that JFrog is setup for a good run in the next few months and here is why.

# What do they do?

Their main product is JFrog Artifactory which is a universal repository for software binaries (runnable code) and it also serves as a mirror repository - local copies of Open Source Software. They also offer JFrog X-Ray that scans those Open Source libraries for malware/vulnerabilities). This is one of the most critical cogs in the software sausage factory, Artifactory is comparable to a walk in refrigerator, with the mirror repo it adds the loading dock, with X-Ray it also helps to ensure food safety.

**You may have heard of the Solarwinds attack and if you have been following it heard that it is described as a ‚Äúsupply chain vulnerability‚Äù attack. In my professional opinion, the toolset JFrog offers is the best available to combat this kind of threat and will stand to benefit from the need to increase cyber security.** That is why I am very much a Bullfrog üêÇüê∏. If there is interest, I will do a deeper dive into this aspect at another time but for this initial one, this is the huge surge in demand for their capabilities and the need for going beyond the basics is my thesis why this company is positioned to do very, very well going forward.

# Company background

They were founded in 2008 and there main product has been Artifactory ever since. It has only 1 direct competitor with similar scope, Sonatype Nexus, but Artifactory is better and cheaper. Sonatype started as a plugin for Artifactory that does something similar to X-Ray before X-Ray existed, then they copycatted the Universal Repo, so JFrog hit back with X-Ray. I have used both of these products over the years (since 2013) and I have worked in environments without, Artifactory improves developer productivity a lot and it secures company Intellectual Property.

Their product is used by most of the Fortune 500 companies. This includes **Google, AWS, Microsoft, IBM, and Facebook. These companies trust this product to keep their crown jewels (the software that runs their entire companies) safe**. That should tell you something about how good it is. They have over 90% renewal rate of their customers.

They acquired Shippable in 2019 which basically lets them offer the whole sausage factory. Though the area where this competes is very competitive with some very good products that are Open Source.

Their focus lately has been on offering a SaaS model to complement their on prem offering and make adoption easier. This should also grow their revenue a lot because it will make it easier to buy the total package instead of just the most basic.

They went public in late 2020 but it was very low key since they came out the same day as Snowflake.

# Financials

I am including a couple of Comps here based on the segment they operate in. Atlassian (TEAM) makes Jira, Confluence, and Trello which are used by most software teams for managing requirements and agile software Team collaboration. I picked them as a comp because I view them as a developer productivity tool that you need around the same time you start needing Artifactory. Crowdstrike (CRWD) is another best in class cybersecurity company that comes into play as you are in operations protecting and detecting threats as your application is running.

* As a high growth software company, unsurprisingly their GAAP earnings are negative. Surprisingly to me though, they are very minor and they have even had 1 quarter of profitability.
   * FROG: -$0.1861
   * CRWD: -$0.4763
   * TEAM: -$4.9355
* Their market cap
   * FROG: $4.9 B
   * CRWD: $47.8 B
   * TEAM: $59.4 B
* Their forward P/E Ratio
   * FROG: 615
   * CRWD: 771
   * TEAM: 173
* They don‚Äôt have any long term debt
* Their current ratio (short term assets/short term debt) is 5.3
* Their margin is over 80%
* Revenue is growing 44% YOY

# Ownership

65% owned by insiders and institutions

Most of that ownership is insiders because there are only 5 ETFs (including an ARK Index Fund) that own it.

Their final lockup was just released on 2/16 after their earnings and insiders have through 3/13 to sell before they go back into lockup. This is similar to what happened with Palantir recently, but it seems like most of them have sold what they are going to sell.

# TL;DR

They have a great product and have cornered a growing market they invented which has high barriers to entry. They are well managed and have good financials as well.

# Positions

420 shares and 61 options, I am planning to get 8 more options on Monday. If you haven't guessed yet, I like the stock. You can check my post history to see some YOLO posts from earlier this week. I will post another update when I am fully loaded with 420/69 to ride this üöÄ

My EOY price target is at least $100/share from the current price which is at $53.49 on Friday.

This is one of my first posts and am going to try to make this a weekly thing to help you apes and autists out. 

Hedgefunds and asset management firms have these analysts preparing all these market forecasts all the time. I feel like us apes could come together to defeat the hedgies by putting all our thoughts together and getting a sense of how the market might look like in the near future. So we can get tendies! Who wants tendies? I want tendies!

Please note this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. I am just an ape. This is purely for education purpose. Please consult a financial advisor not me.

You all must be wondering, what the hell is going on in the market lately? Why are stonks down? Where are my tendies?

Well Apes, apparently there are these things called bonds. JPOW sells these things at auctions and people buy them! Can you believe it? People actually buy things other than stonks.

Lately these bond traders have been very worried that things are getting back to normal! There's $1.9 trillion on its way and that means tendies! Tendies for everyone! And that means prices of things might go up. And if that happens then Fed might have to raise interest rates to keep the prices from getting out of control!

These genuis bond traders have ultra paper hands and they were expecting rates to rise in 2023. But they are afriad they might go up in 2022! Oh lawd! Have mercy.

If interest rates go up. It means stonks go down! Witchcraft! These bond traders are scared and pooping their pants. No one is buying, which is driving the prices of some of these bonds down. means yields are rising! Rising yields oh no!  Everyone is panicking and cashing out.

So bond traders are all looking at JPOW like what you gonna do. You gonna keep running that printer or stop? JPOW is like. Whatever YOLO. But bond traders are not convinced. They feel like JPOW like a cheating boyfriend is lying and will probably backstab them and raise rates.

So bond traders don't wknow what to do. They are panicking. Scared and running around like chickens without heads. All this fear is spreading into the stock market and people are selling their stocks.

Stocks are down! Stocks are down! Stocks are down!

So what's ahead? Well Feb's job report is out on FRIDAY. If the numbers look good Thats Bad! Good means bad because it means things are getting back to normal. No! Bond traders don't want things to get back to normal. If numbers are bad Thats good! Because that means less risk of higher rates.

Good is bad and bad is Good!  What in the world is going on?!?

Well - All you need to know is JPOW is speaking on Thursday. Everyone will be watching. If he says something stupid... Stonks will go down. So lets hope he doesn't say anything stupid. Job reports out on Friday. If report is good then more red! 

Also - Expect some more red if bond traders panic a bit more and drag the stocks down. If there is fear in the market then fewer insitutions will buy stuff. Apes are still buying. So keep buying and keep holding those diamond hands. Don't paper hand! Hold Strong! Let the insitution paper hand. If we keep holding. The market will stabilize in the next week or so. If we buy that means more tendies.

All the best Apes. Just remember, expect turbulence ahead. But it will pass in a week or so. As soon as those stimulus cheques hit the streets, there will be tendies! Glorious tendies.

Apes:  
What is Queen Cathie doing:   
Investors took out $1 billion out of her funds last week. People are pancking. Queen Cathie is staying calm and Diamond Handing (Bought): Palantir, Twitter, Square, Paypal, Signify Health, Baidu, JD, Tesla, Spotify.

Unfortunately none of them were available, so I‚Äôm stuck with my fellow smooth-brained apes.  Hopefully our individual brain cells can work together to answer my question:

Is there a possibility that the dips of every major stock on the market could be caused by shorts selling to cover GME?

I ask because prior to GME rising, the prices of FB, AMZN, AAPL, NFLX, GOOGL, TSLA, and almost ever other big boy on the market dropped despite the DOW closing at record highs.  I‚Äôve never seen that before.  I‚Äôve owned AAPL for the last six years and I have never (and I mean NEVER) seen the stock drop $2-$3 consecutively for this long.  AAPL has been one of my safest and most consistent investments, so I‚Äôm a little surprised.  Especially since they just posted over $100 billion in revenue last quarter.  It doesn‚Äôt make sense.  Almost every ticker on my watch list is down by a lot.  Of the 40 tickers currently on my watchlist, GME is the only one in the green.  

Thoughts?

My humble street Cred: When $BB was undervalued (\~7$), I wrote a [DD(click me)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kb6exy/the_fallen_berry_will_be_reincarnated_as_a_bb/) literally preMoon Launch and made the Forest grump BB meme! So, I hope this gives me some Retard street credits!

**So Let's start!**

Right now, we are in a bloated market with some insane valuations, inflation fears, and recession nightmares... So intuitively, the plays which would make most sense(withstand all of these) are undervalued stocks(rare gems) in an overvalued market!

I introduce to you **(Ticker: $F) FORD üá∫üá∏ ü¶Ö.** The all American car manufacturer which withstood every recession since 1920's... The company which our government treats as a favorite child! The car manufacturer which produced most American cars ever, and finally the innovator which employs one of the greatest PR firms and R&D teams. **I know, I know, you may say WTF??!! FORD?? GTFOH boomer!! Hear me out till the end and you'd be surprised.**

# FORD IS STORMING THE ELECTRICAL VEHICLE MARKET AND THEY AREN'T FUCKING AROUND!! (Veni, vidi, vici)

Yes, you read the tittle right!! Not only that, but also they are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EV cars to compete with TESLA). After years of development, this year they came out with **Mach-E.** An EV car which has a starting price of $35,395(After Federal Tax Credit which still applies to Ford EV's (indicates great government connections)) and easily rivals a model Y when it comes to value. It's way cheaper and has relatively comparable features.

As The Verge's Sean O‚ÄôKane perfectly said: ""I don't think people should underestimate just how important the Mustang Mach-E could be. The Mustang branding makes it instantly familiar and the design is striking enough that it gets noticed right away without being so out there that it's uncomfortable or weird or alien. **It's the kind of car that in a couple of years, if enough of them are on the road, it can really make people take notice and think about buying an electric car in a way that the I-Pace or the Audi e-tron or the Chevy bolt never have or will. I think Ford is tapping into something only Tesla** really does well right now with the Mach-E, which is trying to mix that modern design with increasing ubiquity in a way that could make people feel like they're missing out on something, much like the **effect a new iPhone can have.""**

# What about production, constant need for innovative technology in EV's, and the need for other models?

**Production(keep all of the following in mind because a Tesla comparison is ahead):**

Ford produces around 5.5-6 million cars per year, it's the second biggest US car manufacturer. They know the in's and out's of the car production market and have top tier international connections^(1). Additionally and more importantly, they have the government in their pocket.

Ford has **active** production facilities in Turkey, China, Romania, Spain, India, Canada, Germany, South Africa, Thailand, Russia, Taiwan, Argentina, England, Venezuela, Mexico, Brazil, and Slovakia^(1)(arranged by size). But, I'm not here here today to talk about that. I'll be focusing on the EV car production.

Ford has already produced 10,000 Mach-E's and they delivered 5,000 of them to dealers. In addition, They are planning to produce 50,000 Mach-E's this year. While this number may seem minuscule in comparison to the six figure production number of their gas vehicles, it's an impressive start in the EV market. By comparison, this year so far Tesla has rolled out and sold just 14,100 of its electric SUVs, the Model X. And back in 2017, the EV manufacturer was able to produce only 1,764 of its popular Model 3s in the first six months of production. The following year, however, Tesla delivered more than 140,000 Model 3s.  While Tesla had a slow start, it certainly has caught up in filling  customer orders. In 2019, it‚Äôs averaged sales of 12,500 Model 3s a month or about 150,000 cars a year. While Ford won‚Äôt be able to match this years Tesla Sale numbers **initially**, it looks as if it‚Äôs off to a strong start. (Source: Motor Biscuits).

Another point to keep in mind, Other carmakers haven‚Äôt had as an impressive showing as Tesla in EV production, either. Jaguar sells a¬†mere 200 I-Paces a month. The Audi E-Tron, a plug-in SUV, is averaging about 600 sales a month. As for the Chevrolet Bolt, its sales numbered about 13,100 to date this year. The Chevy EV‚Äôs first year saw only 23,000 produced(Motor Biscuits). and please don't get me started on Chinese EV BS... Bottom line is, aside from Tesla production numbers in the EV space, Ford is the next runner-up after Tesla.

**What about international production and sales?**

Ford to go all electric in Europe by 2030! It intends to spend $1 billion to revamp a factory in Cologne, Germany, where it will produce EVs using a Volkswagen platform(Biggest car manufacturer in Europe).  This new strategy involves phasing out gasoline-powered vehicles in favor of electric power. The automaker expects to have **all commercial vehicles made by Ford in Europe be electric by 2024.** Two years later, it expects **to have converted its entire lineup into electric or plug-in hybrids.** Gasoline-powered commercial vehicles will still be offered for sale in Europe after 2030, Ford says. However, the automaker currently sees electric models accounting for two-thirds of its European sales.(source: Tech Crunch)

**What about Asia?**

Ford announced Jan. 27 that its Mustang Mach-E SUV **will be manufactured by Changan Ford for customers in China.** The Mustang Mach-E will start being produced there later this year as it looks to tap into China's electric vehicle (EV) market. Remember that China is the world's biggest car market with more than 20m vehicles sold each year. (BBC)

**What about government support in production?**

Ford CEO calls on U.S. government to support EV batteries, charging(Headline on Feb. 24 Reuters). He outlined the automaker‚Äôs plan to develop electric platforms for its top-selling trucks, vans and SUVs. What happened after that? Biden ordered for a review of US supply chains for vital goods such as large capacity batteries and semiconductors! In addition, he signed an executive order to amend the Semiconductor shortage. It seeks 37$ billion in funding legislation as a shortfall of semiconductors has forced U.S. automakers and other manufacturers to cut production.(Reuters)

**Innovation and Technology:**

Ford and Google to Accelerate Auto Innovation, Reinvent Connected Vehicle Experience (Feb. 1) [(Ford link)](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html). Ford and Google came together in **first-of-its-kind partnership** to create unique services and capabilities for Ford and Lincoln customers, and to **accelerate Ford‚Äôs transformation plan.** They are working on data, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) innovations. As part of this new, **six-year partnership,** millions of future Ford and Lincoln vehicles **at all price points will be  powered by Android, with Google apps and services built-in.** In addition, Ford and Google have established a collaborative group called, Team Upshift, that will push the boundaries of Ford‚Äôs transformation, unlock personalized consumer experiences, and drive disruptive, data-driven opportunities.

**What other EV models are they working on?**

in 2019, the Ford F-Series was second only to the Apple iPhone, which raked in $55 billion, in terms of total revenue generated. The F-Series  generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined, which added up to $40 billion, Just something to think about. The F-series is their most successful car and they are planning to release the new EV version of it soon this year. After that, They will move to electrify almost every model one by one.

# Valuation and Price target (~110$ = 429,000,00$M market cap)

Yes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.

$Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple

(Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- some are outdated)

TSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X

NIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)

GM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X

F - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X

**(Important part starts here)**

As you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.

If you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.

If WSB adopts $F, it can raise it be the next (110$+)  EV play in the industry. At that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **üá∫üá∏ ü¶Ö**.

Ford has always put the American people over money and has provided so many American jobs for the last century. Ford is a well known American brand and it's deeply ingrained in the American history and culture. I'm proud that my grandfather used to work in Ford(ME) and had great memories in there. In my opinion, the strength of this brand will continue on and it will rise from the ashes like an American bald Eagle**ü¶Ö** after a forest fire.

**TLDR:**

1- All American, highly undervalued stock.  **‚úÖ** **üá∫üá∏**

2- They are ready to dominate the EV market. Targeting mid class with high quality cheap EV's. **‚úÖ**

3- Have the government support. **‚úÖ**

4- Have a strong international factory presence for production. **‚úÖ**

5- Strong PR, Research and development teams with a 6-year google partnership. **‚úÖ**

**MY Price Target: 110$ TICKER:$F**

ls93m8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls93m8/lots_of_upside_with_upwork/,Lots of Upside with Upwork,13,17,2021-02-25 23:29:32,"I posted something similar in r/stocks so I apologize for any redundancy for users of both subs.

Upwork released earnings on Monday after close. Not only did they beat consensus but they raised their guidance rather significantly. More notably, their CEO said that the trend in usage of the platform does *not* seem to be a feature of the pandemic - rather, usership will only go up as we enter re-opening.

For those that don't know, Upwork is kind of like Uber for the gig economy. Economists have been saying this is the future of the job market for years. Say what you will about valuation being stretched (that hasn't seemed to matter the last decade or so), they could be poised to grow massively over the next decade. There is a positive feedback loop as more people adopt the platform. The same way that using Uber, for example, makes you more dependent on using Uber, so does using Upwork. Millennials and Gen Zers have shown a clear desire for career flexibility, which only adds to the bull thesis.

For the sake of this post not just being propaganda, the bear thesis is that it may be overvalued, and that a bigger social media enterprise could build a similar type of platform. To the first, I say maybe, but look at Tesla. To the second, I say, if adoption of the platform is/continues to become significant enough, anyone trying to replicate it will be too late to the party. For example, Facebook has a marketplace now, and have for years, yet eBay is still alive and well, and actually thriving.

This is not financial advice.

Big F to all the palantards, took quite a while to reply to everyone

About GME I still don't know what to do today. A part of me says ""fucking sell and cash out"", the other part is thinking: what if this gets to "" the thousands"", like the CEO of Interactive Brokers said it could have happened on the first squeeze if they didn't restrict buying the stock?

I'm in a Robin Hood group on Facebook and the sentiment is all for AMC, almost noone supports GME, most of them hate it. And I think this is good cause it makes me think that most of GME hodlers already left Robin Hood. So this time their tricks might not work again!

Thinking rationally: I'm up few months of my salary so far and it wouldn't change much to me, so I guess I'll just hold and buy the dip (I hope there will be one at the opening)! You think about your financial situation and behave accordingly, don't listen to anyone

Finally, about PLTR, I closed the position. I liked a DD I red here yesterday and I'll be buying it back in 1-2 weeks at 25

ls3ktz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls3ktz/unity_for_the_crazy_or_for_the_tanks_game/,Unity - for the Crazy or for the Tanks? - Game Developer POV [$U],45,58,2021-02-25 18:26:22,"So, here I'll gonna bring **my worthless POV on Unity**, but first of all - a 1 minute background:

**Unity is a game engine, which is the most important infrastructure of game making** \- before game engines appeared, game developers had to calculate every stupid pixel on the screen by themselves, then a lot of wrappers appeared (OpenGL, etc) and after that the game engines. The **game engine allows the developer to connect the code, graphics, music, physics, and basically everything together.**

Most of the large companies develop and use their own game engines. But as far as I concern, the only public, known, large and practically adopted by developers are Unity and Unreal Engine (we'll back to that shortly).

&#x200B;

Let's get back to Unity:

As a game developer (also ML/DL, but who cares), I've used many frameworks and game engines for more than 15 years, hell, I even used ""dark basic"" when I was young, and I can say that **Unity is the only time I felt at home**.

Now **I know you don't give a shit about my experience, so let's talk business**.

**The GOOD stuff:**

Unity solves one of the major problems of native growth in game making and that's a FULLY CROSS PLATFORM ENGINE, that means that I can develop once, and **my stupid stuff would work PC, Android, iOS, Xbox, Playstation, Virtual Reality, Web..**. You got the idea...That work of being cross platform is INSANELY HARD, which means there is a huge leap to create a competing product. Even the best open source game engines have a very limited amount of devices they support, which means that as a developer an open source game engine might be a risk for me in terms of growth and future support.

TL;DR 1:  **Cross Platform**

Unity got a huge asset store, which is a crazy source of revenues from stupid developers like me, that means that even if I'm totally not profitable - Unity might have some revenue from me without investing a penny or a minute of support team.The huge asset store makes it very easy for new developers to do their first steps in the platform, and like Maya vs 3DSmax or Nikon vs Canon - the first one you've touched is gonna be the only one you'll know.

TL;DR 2: **Easy step in, huge asset store, revenues even from non-profitable games**

Next, the future. Game industry is growing and we all know it, but what Unity got that it would outperform the market? Glad you've asked, they got everything.Unity supports Machine Learning infrastructures which can be connected easily to many application - well that's too general right? So let me put it like that:3 years to the future, self driving cars are more and more popular and... regulated. When you regulate it you also have to test it - digitally. Unity is one of 2 (!) game engines that practically gonna be available for that task.Virtual Reality is also a trend - guess how most developers develop for it. Also it might enter the movie industry and stuff like that.

TL;DR 3: **Tons of ""room to grow"" - VR, Algorithms and algorithms testing**

As I've mentioned, Unity got only one real competitor - Epic - which got  Unreal Engine that does basically the same. Epic are not public but hopefully will, but currently Unity is just the only exposure to this kind of product. If I had to choose, I would just put my Happy Hippos on both.

TL;DR 4: **No publicly traded competitors**

Lastly, Unity can grow without a single phone call. There is no major difference for Unity to support 1K users or 1M (just like Google or Facebook) - if we compare it to companies like TTOW, Nintendo and even Xbox-Microsoft and Oculus (Facebook) - they all had to invest ton of money for content creation and physical platform making.

TL;DR 5: **Unity have to spend almost 0$ for each new user**

&#x200B;

**Now for the BAD stuff:**

Unity price was very high, how much high? At the pick Unity passed EA (!) in terms of market cap. That's high.

It's currently at 35% discount right now, and it still might considered high - but do notice it's around 50%-60% more than IPO day (PLTR fore example is already multiplied - I think they were out on the same day).

TL;DR 6: **High Price (whatever that means...)**

Another bad thing - Unity had relatively bad quarter - their revenue went up but they earnings were still negative... Why is that? Well... first of all they've **donated something like** 750,000 shares, which is like **80M$** \- that's exactly the margin they needed to publish a profitable quarter - you know what that means for the next one...

TL;DR 7: **Last quarter was good revenues but bad earnings - mostly due to stupid reasons**

As I've mentioned, large companies generally use their own game engines, that's a lot of money the currently Unity miss.

Lastly, Epic might go public sooner or later, it won't be a surprise if $U would go down some percents at the same day. But for the long run, ETFs would buy both of the stocks (like ARK/ARKK did with Unity) and that would bring the price up.

TL;DR 8: **Their only real competitor might go public sooner or later**

**That's it, if you survived everything tell me what you think.**

For me I think I'll just buy the dip and hold forever since the growth is crazy and the world just getting more and more digital but please do your math since no one know what's gonna be.

Disclaimers: **I know nothing about nothing. I'm not an investment advisor and don't take any advice from me - or in general don't just listen to a random stupid guy on the internet and all that, read about it yourself.**

**I'm just a developer that enjoy and know to appreciate the platform and its cross platform abilities for my game.**"

# Quick Thoughts

**Inflation is not as much of a concern as people think**

Look, I've talked about inflation risks for three weeks now and this is old news at this point. Right there should be your biggest clue that those risks are priced in but I can give you more reasons.

But first, let me be clear on one point : This is a long term risk, not a short term one. The market will not crash tomorrow nor in the coming months but it can decrease the growth of the stock market. Or in the most extreme case cause a bear market or a crash.

But it seems like there are some confusion on reddit on what inflation we're talking about. So read this 10 times :

*The Inflation risks are not on consumer prices but on the stock market.*

Read it again! Again I said! And keep reading it because I'm sick of reading posts about that. Those risks of increase in consumer spendings are WAY overblown and frankly non-existant.

This is because the average consumer didn't receive much money from the government in the last year. And the little money he did receive, he used it to either buy stuff that he would have bought anyway or buy stuff for leisure purposes. ""*But have you seen Amazon's revenue?*"" you might say. ""*Yes, I've seen it*"" I would reply. Part of this revenue growth was due to AWS (their cloud business) and people being online more than ever during the pandemic, so server costs ballooned! 

But I grant you that : there was a big increase in consumption (on e-commerce especially) BUT it was mostly due to people being stuck in their home : they didn't travel, didn't party or anything like that, so they used that excess money to buy stuff online. Also, they were pretty bored at home and buying stuff was a few clicks away so of course they'd buy useless stuffs. There were other stuffs that impacted consumer spendings like people moving outside of big cities and making their home more confortable to live in (because you know, they're stuck at home).

So, when countries reopen, this trend will probably slow down (although it's setting a shift in consumer spending from brick-and-mortar stores to e-commerce but that's another story).

And with the [US exports increasing during the pandemic](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/exports), the dollar increases enough in value to offset potential inflation risks.

So yeah, this inflation was never really a concern, but now let's talk about the stock market inflation concerns that most institutions were worried about.

The concern is as follow :

> FED buys bonds and gives money to companies, banks and hedge funds. Hedge funds and banks put this money in the stock market. Stock market goes up artificially thanks to all that money. Companies use this to compensate for missed revenue. Their financials don't look so bad because of all the money given to them. But, nothing is organic, everything is given by the FED and this might create a giant bubble that's ready to burst.

Ok, so a few things about that :

- The stock market being stretched is nothing new, it's been a bubble ""ready to burst"" for a decade or so.
- The tech sector did very well without the need of quantitative easing.
- The actual thing you should worry about is not a market crash or a bear market but rather a *reduced growth*. That's why value stocks went up or flattened these past two weeks when growth stocks plunged. Most companies will increase in value but since a much bigger growth was priced in for growth stocks, their stock prices went down. By the way, that's why Tesla's stock price went down, that had nothing to do with its 1.5bn bet. 
- And for the concerns regarding all this money given to companies, there's not that much to worry about. When the economy recovers (in my opinion slowly from end-2021 to mid-2022), companies will generate revenue organically and as the economy gets better, MoneyPrinterMan will *progressively* reduce his bond buying program and *slowly* go on phase 2 of his plan : actually combating the inflation if it becomes a concern by then. 

There might be a correction at some point but hedge funds still have a shit ton of money to invest. And they're not going to keep it in cash when we have a massive bull market like that.

And I'll finish this rant by quoting our great savior Mr. MoneyPrinterMan Powell :

> Fuck your puts.

Also, there's [an article that explains this very well](https://www.im.natixis.com/en-ch/markets/post-pandemic-inflation-risk-2021).

Ok now let's talk about Powell speech for a minute.

**Powell talked. Investors were not impressed**

Summary of the speech tuesday : Hey bulls, nothing new, keep buying!

Seriously, that's it!

He said he will keep buying bonds at the current pace because the economy has still not recovered as much as he would like. 

He said that the inflation concerns are overblown.

Then senators asked about racial inequalities and Powell basically said ""wtf I'm just the chairman of the FED not the fucking president."" (I'm paraphrasing a little) Although he aknowledged the problem, he didn't give any solution because well as he said it very well, he's ""not the fucking president"" (again paraphrasing a little ;)).

The Senator Kennedy asked ""*Do you think we ought to go Catwoman on the budget and actually look for savings there?*"" (yes he actually said that, I'm NOT paraphrasing here). Powell said he didn't know the reference (and frankly I don't fully understand what that meant either).

[Link of the video and transcript](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/ux2lCF7KhCxCaP893gBjj6a3vD6H8wjZ47XZ56eLOD_bCvbSROyURMo4XtKOMy8-K2LB3wZ87l89r0ELEMVOJYvebgU)

He also talked about unemployment rates and that... Ah! That was pretty interesting. But today's recap is already long enough. Tomorrow, you'll get my ""quick"" thoughts on that (spoiler alert : it's not quick).

**C3.ai is a must buy more than ever!**

This is a short one because I've talked about this company in a previous daily recap. So I encourage you to read it first.

But now, I think this is the best time to buy the stock as it went down a lot recently (it's a growth stock and all growth stocks went down the past week or so). 

But there's something that you might know : Chinese competition in the Big Data Analytics space was and is still going strong. The Chinese government is tracking everyone down which generates a lot of data, the chinese government gives chinese companies carte blanche on all fronts even if they become monopolies. And they do.

[Here's a paper written in 2015 on how big the industry is in China](https://www.afcdud.com/fr/transport-afcdud/387-bigdatachina.html). 

But something might change that. I really don't want to talk politics here so let's make it brief : Trump went hard on China and planned on continuing that way and people thought Biden would not go as hard. But turns out, [he follows pretty much the same strategy](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/business/economy/biden-china.html). There's more detail to it, I encourage you to read the article and be informed on the situation.

So, this *might* be the moment where chinese companies get a big hit. They will probably get the same treatment as american companies and their big advantage will disappear.

Anyway, so my point is this : My DD on C3.AI still stands and the potential regulation on China gives you another reason to buy (long term).

**Here's a list of luxury brand companies**

2 days ago, I wrote that companies selling luxury goods *that hold their value* are hot right now. Here's a curated list of companies that I think will benefit the most from people buying luxury goods :

- Watches of Switzerland Group (it had a good run but it still has a lot of potential and it's a better bet than the others imo)
- Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA
- LVMH
- Ralph Lauren Corp

Also, [a good article that talks about that](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-23/-unstoppable-luxury-stocks-remind-some-investors-of-u-s-tech).

# Quick Update on my portfolio

Last week I was cash gang up until yesterday where I bought spy calls expiring in June. I fucked up my timing, I bought them 2 hours before market open because I didn't know Powell was talking yesterday. Averaged down by buying calls at open as well. I think now the inflation concerns are priced in. The worse case scenario is NOT though but there's a very small probability that inflation will actually create an economic meltdown.

I expect to keep my calls for at least a month or two. But I will revise my plan if the situation changes (and I will update you anyways).

Fundamental explanation of what blocking tracking actually means: 
https://www.techrepublic.com/article/safari-for-ios-14-and-macos-11-how-to-prevent-websites-from-tracking-your-moves-online/

Signs that desire for early adoption is high: 
https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/prevent-apps-from-tracking-you-across-sites-ios/

Apples self-claimed results:
https://searchads.apple.com/

ios14 is proclaimed to fuck small businesses, marketers and e-commerce. That is the single biggest Zoomer and Millennial workforce collective in America. With this change, businesses can no longer target any iPhone user after they‚Äôve visited their website while using the trigger of the ad that they visited the website.

Ie, you visit a red shoe page. You forget about it. Tomorrow you see an ad for a red shoe.

Or, you look at concerts online in Austin. Then you get distracted and don‚Äôt do anything. And then you get an ad for a discount to a concert the next time you‚Äôre browsing.

No more ads like that with ios14. That is dangerous because 80% of the digital marketing budget is devoted to remarketing and retargeting efforts (across the entire industry)

So, that‚Äôs concerning to me because while we can convert customers that have visited the website of Our company and that knows who we are, we make 9.7x what we spend on ads. But, with raw new first time interaction we see a return of .43x. This update will essentially fuck all the small businesses that have put in the time to build their marketing structure around Facebook, and even more so removes the ability for e-commerce to use this as their primary driving factor as e-commerce has an even worse initial introduction return but retargeting they make bank.

Simply put, all ads have to be written like you have no idea who exactly you‚Äôre talking to beyond a few details of their interests. You lose all ability to check if they are interested or even know about your company based off non-Facebook interactions. With this, Facebook interactions aren‚Äôt even valid anymore due to their far right audience consuming a 76% majority of their usage, you result in clients that are legit fucked. So you have to limit your buyer persona a ton and in turn your average ad cost will be raised significantly as it has for the last year as costs have eclipsed an all time high of being ~400% higher than last year.

All in all, you‚Äôd now spend $15000 for the same thing you would‚Äôve paid $900 for previously (unless you‚Äôre part of the .00001% of FB advertisers). Due to the increased costs of Facebooks bottom line but also because of all these other factors combining to make it harder to even find the person you want, much less be given the time needed to convince them.

While tracking isn‚Äôt the nail in the coffin, the further downsides of Facebook remove further value. This isn‚Äôt about Facebook though. This is to show that Apple is making an incredibly, multi-industry impacting move with an attempt to bring Facebook to a 0% market share of iPhone users.

Why the fuck would Apple do this? They would never hurt their brand. They would never make a dumb money decision. They are the biggest company on the NYSE and that didn‚Äôt happen by making off the cuff decisions nor did that happen because of a ‚Äúprivacy play‚Äù Apple has realistically taken as much of the market as they can while touting privacy as their primary benefit to buy an iPhone.

With this Facebook filed an antitrust lawsuit that is literally going to create a War Between Giants. This very well may be the single largest business brawl ever seen. The number one most valuable company in America that‚Äôs geared to fight the number four most valuable.

What does that mean? Well typically, Apple will stay hush-hush since they aren‚Äôt making the move for publicity or branding. That‚Äôs not what happened this time. Instead, as soon as Apple was asked for a comment they stated they‚Äôd be fighting it.

Following this, Facebook sends out an email at 3:00am talking about the impacts this will have on all Facebook advertisers. They were burning the midnight oil and they decided fear was the best way to motivate the Facebook advertisers. Fuck Facebook for that tbh.

Well, Facebook has a secret solution. They can basically bundle an internet browser into Facebook and just serve the ads through there. Suddenly, they can track you again because suddenly you are never technically leaving Facebook. This is sketchy as fuck and is a simple one-line fix for Apple to again remove this ability. Like a game of cat and mouse as Apple plugs Facebooks bullshit side skirt attempts.

Additionally, Apple doesn‚Äôt historically allow skirts as you can see in the most recent time Apple denied a product that competed with a market they are in: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation and this move was super controversial. 

Want another example? Maybe a high profile one? Well Apple said fuck Epic Games and went for the jugular when they straight up removed Fortnite and all Epic Games products from the App Store. They straight up murdered another billion dollar company and Apple didn‚Äôt even get scratched. Literally said ‚Äúfuck off, you can come back when you will pay your bill‚Äù

Apple didn‚Äôt care. They were going to get their money whether the company or retail investors cared. Apple is going to get paid when you‚Äôre on their platform.

But currently Facebook pays Apple $100 a year to list their app. That‚Äôs it. They don‚Äôt get a cut of ad share. Nothing. So Apple can monetize these small companies making millions but can‚Äôt take a cent from the fourth largest company in America. That‚Äôs not something they‚Äôre gonna be chill about especially as Facebook continues to damage their own reputation. You‚Äôve seen Apple swing once with ios14 and you‚Äôll soon see Apple swing with punch two.

But before punch two could even happen, Facebook files an anti-trust lawsuit and tries convincing their advertises with that 3am email to support the lawsuit. Uh oh. Must be hot in the walls of Facebook.

So why would Apple finally pull the trigger?

Because for years they‚Äôve been building a secret digital marketing ad delivery platform. Where‚Äôs it been tested? In the App Store and they are currently sitting at a 50% conversion rate on average. That means one of two people that see an ad, download the app from that ad.

That is fucking crazy numbers as Homeer is currently sitting at 3%. That‚Äôs a  16x difference. That means we could theoretically pay 16x less due to the difference in their ad delivery model or potentially see 16x the amount of impressions.

What‚Äôs the difference that makes Apple so different? They don‚Äôt want to spend your whole budget unless they‚Äôve found the perfect person. With Apple, you can set a maximum budget of $10,000 a month currently. Facebook currently has small e-commerce shops spending multi-millions a month. In the App Store, there is a ton of money left on the table currently but that‚Äôs not the juicy bit here. The juicy bit is that for the last years they‚Äôve been testing and building this platform while also updating all user experience with Apple products. Finally, Apple has reached 100% control of the apps found and used on their phone, but what they don‚Äôt control is the ads inside those apps.

The five obvious big plays here.

üëâ Mobile game ads

Game ads have become a meme about how bad they are. Additionally, they are essentially the very last item that can give Apple a bad look while also largely deceiving the users of iPhones. You know how bad they are. An additional upside to this is that not only does Apple look better as a whole, but this is before you consider that suddenly small businesses would have access to an even deeper level of targeting.

Imagine now, I know my perfect client is 34, has two kids and plays candy crush before she goes to bed. Well finally I can run ads under that scenario without having to go through some shady venue while also maintaining the trust aspect.

üëâ Ads for kids

Finally parents can prevent their kids from seeing unregulated ads. Honestly, I can‚Äôt give example of revenue benefits here but this does help early adoption and public support a fuck ton.

üëâ Safe for work toggle

Finally, we can have not safe for work ads for those that opt-in. Alternatively, this would function as SFW only but this is again, just another public perception possibility.

üëâ Apple News 

Now, Apple has been going hard after news apps for the last year. Why would they do this? Because they have Apple News but it‚Äôs not monetized by Apple currently. Again, they have third party providers displaying ads that Apple gets zero share of.

But oh don‚Äôt worry, soon Apple will finally monetize all of their software because they have ads running in every platform imaginable.

üëâ Privacy

Another major benefit is that we can deliver high quality ads as business, will get better ads as consumers all while maintaining the fine line of quality and privacy.

Now, ignoring all of that, Apple has seen a moving average growth of 50% YoY for the last four years. They have a solid growth path with products and for the last two years they‚Äôve built their cloud platform to not only consume massive amounts of data, but also process that data. Just look at how they can now search through all of your photos instantly and show you them instantly without a single bit of that photo data being physically on your phone. They are geared to the fucking tits on software innovation and no one even cares.

To put it in perspective, Apple introducing an ad delivery platform with 50% avg. conversion rate would be like the day Steve Jobs announced the first iPhone.

Secretly for years they‚Äôve worked towards this moment and they finally swung first in a fight.

Even without ads I fully expect them to hit the target of $165 by the end of the year while reaching $220 safely at the end of 2023.

Realistically, business adoption will take at least 8 months before Apple sees enough profit to even recoup the cost of the lawsuit, but this would be the single largest business pivot ever seen in the world.

So if Apple goes from a product business to a software business what does that mean for their value? Let‚Äôs look at Stripe since we have recent data and we know what they‚Äôre doing has the same kind of user life-changing benefits.

Stripe does $450 million in revenue. They were just valued at $115 billion. That‚Äôs a P/E ratio of 255%

Currently, the P/E ratio of Apple is 34% so not only do I expect them to land in the high middle range of the two, I also additionally expect never before seen returns for an ad company. Not because they have the largest audience but because they can genuinely show your ad to the exact person you want.

From a business perspective, digital marketing is entirely about quality over quantity when it comes to potential consumer eyes and this would be the very first ad platform to operate with this ideal.

Finally, Apple is currently underperforming and is trading on rumor of a bullshit electric car and is sliding, all while literally no one on the internet has considered the idea that they‚Äôre doing all this because they‚Äôre introducing an ad platform that will soon print billions of profit within months of releasing.

Now finally we can cover the aspect that we don‚Äôt have to try and time them developing and releasing this. They already tested it, got crazy fucking results and no one bats an eye. Everyone is so consumed by Facebook they totally missed the play Apple just made.

There‚Äôs a major war brewing and it‚Äôs only begun. But we‚Äôve all watched the idea that all media is good media be proven true as Robinhood received 3.5 billion in funding during the biggest retail investor controversy in modern day. Regardless initial interaction, Apple investors don‚Äôt get scared by that. Apple investors are Apple investors because they know they will bring hell to earth before they accept not getting a cut of the money.

This company is down on the month incredibly and there has never been a better time to buy Apple IMO while being prepared to hold for about 8 months for potentially a massive, massive payout. This is not an option we will sell quickly. This is a weather the storm and wait for the announcement to set into reality.

Disclaimer that this is pure personal intuition and this idea came from nowhere but my ass and Facebook sent the email literally Monday so this is as hot off the press it can be.

All this to say, people like targeted marketing both businesses and consumers but not when it‚Äôs in Facebook hands. 

What company in the entire market is most trusted to do right by the consumer while delivering an incredible cost at likely a higher cost to those paying while also maintaining 100% of their self-made market? Apple.

Edit: due to an awesome fucking user we now know they are hiring a massive amount of jobs for their ad platforms: https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/search?search=Client%20Partner%20Manager-%20Search%20Ads&amp;sort=relevance&amp;location=united-states-USA

lr1l80,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr1l80/pltr_extensive_dd_part_2_what_makes_it/,$PLTR Extensive DD Part 2: What Makes it Disruptive/Valuation,423,118,2021-02-24 10:42:56,"Yesterday I posted a lengthy DD on Palantir Technologies ($PLTR), where I went in-depth on my evaluation of the firm's history, its financials, and why I believe the naysayers are wrong (Link included here:[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq8rw4/i\_think\_pltr\_is\_invincible\_rn\_and\_in\_the\_long\_run/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq8rw4/i_think_pltr_is_invincible_rn_and_in_the_long_run/) )-i do recommend reading this first, this post is meant to be a follow-up/supplement to my liking of this stock.

But I wanted to go more in-depth into just why I find this company so special and unique. As I mentioned in my DD last night, I am just a 19-year-old college student, not an investment banker or hotshot market maker, but I believe the information I have ascertained about Palantir by just scouring the web distinguishes it from any company on the planet (but we'll keep it strictly to the software industry in this DD).

What is truly unique about Palantir's software (Gotham, Foundry, Apollo) is how collaborative, scalable, and advanced it is. Let me break this down: Palantir's software is COLLABORATIVE b/c it meshes the company's clients' data into a mega cloud. For example, the LAPD, BP, JP Morgan, and top law firms all upload their data onto Palantir's cloud, where they can get insights into efficiency, efficacy, and receive suggestions from the advanced software on how to improve their venture (these guys are all PLTR clients btw), and particularly useful for say, defending an embassy or managing a supply chain.

Now, just to get it straight, there is no data/cloud that can come ANYWHERE close to the insights and knowledge on what Palantir has.  You might often hear from Wall Street research analysts/CNBC shills who complain that PLTR has too many rich clients (big companies/gov't). But I think what boomers don't understand is that building your foundation amongst the biggest fish in the sea is quite the ADVANTAGE, not a weakness.

Let me use an example from our beloved Cathie Wood and her firm Ark Invest's large position in Tesla extremely quickly (I promise). When asked about how she felt about Tesla's performance in the autonomous driving space compared to competitors like Waymo (owned by Google), she commented last year that **having a vast collection of data** would separate those who succeed from those who attempt. As a reference, Tesla cars all transmit self-driving data back to the firm, which comes about through the many Tesla owners who drive all over the world. On the other hand, Waymo is committed to private testing stages only, which is shallow-minded b/c it doesn't have access to trial data on say, congested roads.

Back to PLTR. The reason I bring up the Waymo-Tesla-Ark example is to highlight just how many clients PLTR's revenue base represents, and how impactful that is on a company's growth, scalability, and ultimately, the *success of their product*. But I mean when you think about it, Palantir's clientele is the **ENTIRE GLOBAL ECONOMY/SOCIETY**. Go to the *Financial Times*, and try to find me an article that doesn't talk up Palantir's greatness in the U.K and their work helping NIH. EU members like Greece/France also use it for COVID vaccine tracking. Palantir has contracts with the Japanese/South Korean governments. Palantir has notably helped the U.S. catch infamous cucks like Osama Bin Laden to Bernie Madoff. Quite the diversity!

The reason for that entire BJ to Palantir right there is to illustrate just how extensive this scale is. Not only is all this data accessible RIGHT NOW to all these clients to collaborate on Palantir's platform, but is comprised of the single most dominant and sustainable institutions/enterprises in the world. No matter how the political winds blow or how the global/domestic economy winds up, you can count on 3M, the DoD, Ferrari- to name a few- to continue seeking ways to scale, grow, expand, and Palantir certainly is the way.

This gets back to another central, bulletproof thesis surrounding Palantir. Who are its competitors? Who can do what Palantir does? 

Let's start with Snowflake. All credit to their talented team, Warren Buffett, and their gang of bulge bracket banks who underwrote their IPO and cheerlead the stock on media outlets on the daily. But for lack of a better word, their software just isn't *dope* enough. I mean the UI contrast speaks for itself, but the intelligence is what matters here. Yes, data warehousing is no joke and is certainly a scalable business, but what kind of innovative insights can you draw from just essentially a digital warehouse that doesn't add any value? All Snowflake really is is Salesforce dressed up in pretty bells and whistles. Really makes me question Buffett's whole commitment to ""value.""

[C3.AI](https://C3.AI) at least has me interested. It seems like a real knock-off version of Palantir based on what I can ascertain from their public materials, but so what? A bunch of washed-up junkies from Oracle think they can lead the transition to AI? Compared to a company that was seeded in 2003 specifically to work with the CIA and other intelligence agencies after 9/11 (PLTR also called the ""gold standard"" by these agencies according to *TechCrunch*), why waste your time in [C3.AI](https://C3.AI) or Snowflake? Don't even get make me started on Splunk, IBM (who conceded they suck by signing on w/ PLTR last week), or MSFT.

And while we're at it, let's talk about valuations to drive the point home. According to the *Financial Times,* PLTR is valued at a $48B market cap and is trading at 34X 2021 estimated sales. To start, yes that is very lofty, even after accounting for the recent sell-off due to earnings/lock-up fears. But I'll pick on my prime targets, SNOW and AI, if we can even call them competitors (we'll be nice). SNOW has just under an $80B market cap, but is trading at 80x 2021 estimated sales! AI is trading at a $15B market cap, and is trading at 70.5x 2020 estimated sales!! That's fucking crazy, and Buffett should sell SNOW immediately if he cares about value (or he just doesn't understand technology).

Since the whole speculation is going to be about earnings in the next few years, let's talk about that. As I mentioned in my DD yesterday, PLTR reported EPS of $0.06/share on a non-GAAP basis, which is TRIPLE what the street predicted!! But thanks to a $100M stockholder compensation expense, the GAAP basis was a loss of $0.02/share, and Wall ST took the opportunity to AMBUSH PLTR. 

If you understand how business development works, these incentives are necessary in the early stages of a company. How else do you expect to attract top talent to the company and incentivize existing brains to stay? But as you grow into your valuations, like PLTR will, why do you need to do it? (PLTR has essentially promised 30% + growth for 5+ years, and earnings are on the way this year thanks to their earnings report). Who does Apple need to incentivize to stay? Wall St is simply trying to make something out of nothing.

I also mentioned PLTR was a direct-listing yesterday, unlike any of these other names here. If you don't know what that means, basically PLTR didn't have its IPO underwritten by banks or pay them massive fees in the process. So equity research, investment banking, asset management, and other areas of lucrative finance have no incentive to talk up PLTR (just Jeffries it seems for now).

And this is what I mean. Again as I mentioned yesterday, it happens with all megacap tech companies. Think about it as evolution. Facebook. Apple. Tesla. Google. Microsoft. These guys weren't oversubscribed by the money makers either, nor were they cheaply valued either. But by the time the robust top line translated into earnings, these firms were worth hundreds of billions of $ with the snap of your fingers, which is exactly what will happen with Palantir (we are already seeing this- their institutional ownership nearly doubled from 12% in January to 21% right now).

This is what I want you all to think about. As a disclosure, I am very long PLTR (you can view my positions on yesterday's DD), but irregardless of whether you will invest in it or not, read about Palantir Technologies. This is the company of the future: able to tailor its cutting-edge technology to all the intricate challenges the 21st century projects: climate change, further space exploration, geopolitical/nuclear tensions, renewable energy adoption, inequality, police reform, and so much more, while providing a platform for all these parties to collaborate and improve. Given the world is an ever expanding place, and the dominant players are already seated at the table, I could not feel more relieved or excited than to have all my chips in the one waiter who will serve them all.

\*\***This is not financial advice. I recommend you read up on PLTR, pour through its financials, and hear more from its CEO, Alex Karp, and Chairman, Peter Thiel- then make your own informed, balanced, intelligent, rational decision. Without a doubt, this will be** ***the*** **company being discussed in the decades to come, and I just want to expedite the conversation now.**"

Recently, we‚Äôve seen a little turmoil in the broader market that has scared some growth investors, and I do think there is some justifiable fear.

A lot of folks are going to tell you this is a great discount on names like TSLA or PLUG, and I certainly don‚Äôt disagree with them- I just want to have all my bases covered.

Now we have seen some structural shifts in the broader market. The 10-Year shift up to 1.35% is a noticable tick up, and this is something all of us ü¶ç have to be wary of.

As much as I like discounts, when the market prices in tighter money, the Fed will have to listen. I believe Uncle Jay will continue to have the market‚Äôs back, and I think the 10-Year should be capped at roughly 1.5-2%. We‚Äôll see how this develops, but the bottomline is these forward-looking growth giants are going to get CRUSHED if they miss expectations.

And well, if technology continues to be a deflationary pressure through innovation as we all expect, then üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ regardless and we can cap the discussion here.

So here‚Äôs where sweet good PLTR comes into play. I really, really like how they delivered earnings last week. Didn‚Äôt REALLY disappoint: beat earnings on a non-GAAP basis and had 45% annual top line growth.

But that‚Äôs not even the kicker for me. The fact that PLTR leadership is essentially guaranteeing at least 30% growth over the next 5 years (read the earnings call transcript), which will look like an absolute bonanza if rates actually start to go up.

Now, the thesis is that growth firms‚Äô future profits are less valuable today if rates start to go up, which would not be great for big growth names like PLTR. But then here‚Äôs the thing: it would absolutely WRECK mega tech growth like FAANG or the EV/battery state field.

Let‚Äôs go back to earnings. Karp and the PLTR team are essentially setting the bar very low, telling investors to sit back and expect ONLY 30% growth for 5+ years. (For boomers, they realize this is fucking crazy btw).

Essentially, if there is any surprise to the upside, which is totally reasonable with a disruptor like Palantir, and this thing will be worth hundreds of billions in the blink of an eye.

But think of how all these great stories came about. Tesla in 2017-2019. Facebook in 2012-2013. Apple in 2008-2009. These tech stars never had a straight shot up, and the same goes for PLTR.

They faced the same problems. I‚Äôm only a college student, but I remember for as long as I have been alive from skeptical financial analysts that Tesla was gargantually overvalued and didn‚Äôt have the cash to survive in the EV market.

I watched as a kid as some whiz built up a social media platform from his dorm room, but Wall St attacked him for wearing a hoodie to his IPO. Not only did they not think he could expand his platform from PC to mobile, but they questioned how its cutting edge technology differed from Myspace and Tumblr, and wondered if he could ever scale ad revenue. 
He shore could.

Yes, PLTR is overvalued. What isn‚Äôt? Snowflake trades for 80X estimated sales. C3.AI trades at 73.5X its 2020 revenues. Salesforce, Splunk, and MSFT ain‚Äôt cheap. 

(For reference, PLTR is trading just under 37X 2021 sales, which is lofty, but looks reasonable compared to these other names that have way higher multiples and much less sophisticated/scalable software).

And if we look at it... PLTR was profitable by roughly $0.06/share if you take out a stockholder compensation expense that otherwise would have left them with $100M+ in operating profit. 

Is it profitable? PLTR has 70% fucking margins. How are Finance pricks not creaming over this??? You want high margin/earnings- this is it right here, man.

But no, no, big bad overvalued Palantir want to pay executives/advisors/shareholders extra money. Bad. Bad- I say they worth $20 in equity research reports and on CNBC instead, but still load up behind the scenes ü§Æü§°.

Fuck the shills who say Palantir can‚Äôt continue robust growth or be profitable. (I am looking at your trend-seeking bots Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley).

On top of that, yes their revenue base is dominated by gov‚Äôt clients at roughly 52%, but let‚Äôs pause and realize this is a good thing. I mean... i don‚Äôt want to get too political here, but broadly, you‚Äôre a fool if you think the Dod, DoJ, or CDC/NIAID are cutting back anytime soon, if not looking to HEAVILY EXPAND given the monumental threats we face- geopolitical foes like China, Russia Iran; climate change; police reform; EV adoption/renewables more broadly; 5G and cloud/quantum computing, i really could keep going (amongst all of them, these agencies have dozens of contracts with PLTR worth hundreds of millions of $).

Not too mention PLTR also has massive contracts with numerous EU members and Asian allies like Japan/S. korea, but there‚Äôs honestly so many positive examples about how scalable this beauty is both domestically and internationally.

And let‚Äôs take what Cathie Wood said the other day on CNBC: roughly along the lines that some of the greatest innovations come from the military. I think we can point to the WWW as a pretty decent example of that.

Given PLTR traces its roots to the CIA‚Äôs venture capital arm and loading up on national security contracts with all the intelligence agencies after 9/11, I feel pretty confident that this lengthy history will continue providing much value in revenue AND earnings to PLTR, especially if rates starts to rise.

Furthermore, the cross that bogged Tesla, Apple, FB, and pretty much every mega cap tech company is restraining Palantir right now. The Street wonders if they will be able to continue locking down corporate clients, which it has been rapidly expanding in recent years.

The answer is yes. But Wall St doesn‚Äôt want you to think so at the moment. B/c PLTR was a direct listing, they weren‚Äôt underwritten by investment banks, and thus don‚Äôt receive the same financial shilling that names like Snowflake or C3.AI LITERALLY PAY FEES TO analysts/associates at bulge bracket banks to shill like a damn used ‚Äò98 Honda Accord (and that‚Äôs exactly what these other SAaS names are compared to PLTR)

But we always double down on our convictions. If you have seen Palantir‚Äôs demos, read its financials, or listened to their CEO, then you know the potential of this company.

I believe in people. I believe in Peter Thiel and his track record. I believe a guy who founded PayPal with Elon Musk, seeded Facebook when no one else would, and decided to seed PLTR w/ the CIA (when no one else would)- yes, I believe he knows what he is doing.

And I believe he is capable of finding talent like Alex Karp and collaborating with him to build an absolute behemoth.

As a conclusion, can someone give me a firm answer on a company that can actually compete with PLTR in terms of solving a complex issue like tracking down Osama Bin Laden or expanding a niche industry into international markets??? And if your only comment is on valuations, see Snowflake (quite the value investment Mr. Buffett ;).

For disclosure, I am very long PLTR and am simply sharing my thoughts. This is not financial advice. And as always, do your own reading/research, but these are the frank sentiments of a PLTR believer.

Now with the lock-up fucking history, PLTR TO THE MOON üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

The fundamentals are all there: a cutting edge tech unicorn with robust sales, earnings on deck, and unparalleled potential.

The ownership from institutions is otw as well. We all know Cathie Wood has tripled down in the last week, and recently, big banks like JP Morgan are confirming previous stakes in PLTR.

This is FB/GOOG in the waiting, but I believe it will soar like Tesla. Indeed, the monetary policy conditions right now are extremely conducive to mega cap tech companies getting grounded EXTREMELY FAST, see this provoking WSJ graphic on the topic 

(https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-tesla-made-it-to-the-winners-circle-11613739634?st=pkrws73wwocvyo8&reflink=article_imessage_share)

I think PLTR‚Äôs days in the $20 range are numbered. One can hem about valuations all day, but tell me why obsolete Snowflake is trading at 80X sales, and we can have an intelligent discussion.

If we (the market not WSB) believe Tesla, Snowflake, and Shopify are not a joke, than PLTR is grossly UNDERVALUED. I have to imagine smart money isn‚Äôt too far behind my thinking."

# Quick Thoughts

**Europe and the Stability and Growth Pact (ok this one is a bit boring)**

[The Stability and Growth Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_and_Growth_Pact) is ""*an agreement, among the 27 member states of the European Union, to facilitate and maintain the stability of the Economic and Monetary Union*"". The goal is to monitor members of the EU and to make sure of their fiscal stability. If the country's deficit or debt is higher than a certain limit, the other members will give recommendations on policy actions to correct this. 

In 1997, at the inception of The Stability and Growth Act, the same limit was given to every state members and that was not very flexible. In 2004, they've reformed it to have limits specific to each states.

This is still not very flexible. A country might have a ""bad year"" and based on this model will still need to take corrective actions even if there was no problem to begin with. Some countries' debt and deficit are cyclical and highly variable while some are pretty stable. And sometimes, a big event might put countries in the red zone and they can't do much about it (\*hum hum\* the pandemic \*hum hum\*).

So, knowing all that, Europe decided at the beginning of the pandemic, to suspend those rules as they didn't make any sense during this context. And in the coming weeks, Europe will decide whether to extend this suspension or not.

This is a key event for countries like Italy or Greece but really mostly Italy. So let's talk about Italy.

**Italy might recover??! (Not clickbait!)**

Italy's budget deficit reached 10.9% of GDP in 2020 and IMF expects it to go down to 7.5% in 2021.

As for their public debt, it was at 157.5% of GDP in 2020 and is expected to rise to 159.7% this year.

If the Stability and Growth Pact was still in place, the EU would basically ask Italy to cut costs anywhere it can at this point because there's no way Italy will ever repay its debt. And EU wants that knowing full well it's the worst course of action for Italy's sake. But Italy and the rest of EU have different objectives : 

- Italy wants to recover (duh!) and hopes for a restructuration of their debt.
- The rest of EU sees how fucked Italy is and wants to help them but at the same time wants to make sure that this doesn't bring the whole EU down in the process.

Right now, the Stability and Growth Pact is suspended and Italy is set to get 200 billion euros from the EU's COVID Recovery Fund. It's crucial that Italy uses that money wisely. There are a lot of things going for them though :

- Draghi is now Prime Minister of Italy. He was president of the ECB for 8 years, and before that chair of the Financial Stability Board and Governor of the Bank of Italy for 5 years. So regarding finance, let's say he knows his stuff.
- Also, Draghi has a very big... majority at the Parliament which will let him do basically whatever he wants.
- If he manages to prove himself capable of creating growth in a economically declining country, then EU will be much more open to give them more money.

[Italy however decided to relax their pandemic restrictions](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20210201-restaurants-and-museums-reopen-as-italy-relaxes-coronavirus-curbs) which is being criticized by Health Minister Roberto Speranza and the WHO. While this can indeed increase the number of cases, so far the number of new cases stabilized at 12k per day (7-day moving average) in february. 

So if you need your gambling fix, you could go long on the Italia 40 index or you could stay on the sidelines and wait to have more informations on the matter. Or you could just not care at all, I wouldn't be offended.

**Home Depot earnings play**

Let's see the key points of last year :

- Their revenue was at 33bn in Q3 of 2020.
- Their net sales increased inside and outside of the US by roughly 18%.
- They expect to have slightly less revenue in Q4 of 2020 and Q1 of 2021.

My prediction is that, as countries reopen and all the constructions put on hold are resuming more and more, their revenue will beat expectations tomorrow.

My short-term and long-term bullish thesis :

- people are using their money for esentials only and if you've started big renovations before the pandemic it's pretty necessary to finish it. 
- a lot of people work from home and plan on continuing to do so so. That means they will need to upgrade their home in the near future or already upgraded it.
- some people are moving outside of the big cities and buying homes in smaller cities. This increases the number of renovations in the US.
- the Stay-At-Home situation makes people buy more stuff to improve their confort at home.

While some of this is factored in the price, I think investors are still pretty conservative and you can see it in the price action : it's flat since august last year.

So, today, I will buy some shares. If you want to increase your risk, you can make a small bet on this earnings and for the long term bet, you can buy calls expiring in 6 months.

... Or you could just wait and see what happens, I would not be offended.

Ok Bye!

lpfh2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpfh2l/pinterest_is_your_express_ticket_to_the_moon_in/,Pinterest is your express ticket to the moon in 2021. Let me explain.,197,88,2021-02-22 12:53:19,"Hi there. first time posting any DD on here. Please keep your insults gentle. TLDR at the bottom. (play monthly calls at the money and reap benefits)

Pinterest recently jumped due to a strong Q4 ER. Here's what they stated about their 2020

>The company stated that there has been a **35% year-over-year increase in the number of monthly boards created**, including a 44% increase in beauty, a 95% increase in women's fashion and a 36% increase in home decor categories.

Literally, the entire report is a bull's wet dream. Seriously, just read this yourself. https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/pinterest-pins-to-report-q4-earnings%3A-whats-in-store-2021-02-02

Rather than making this post a cliff notes of that let me tell you briefly in my own words why PINS is going to go bananas. 

1) PINS advertisements hide in plain site.

I recommend creating a profile quickly, w/o ad blocker, and give a quick scroll on your home page, or search for something you might think about purchasing or doing later. I think you'll be surprised at how many ads are in your results but also how well they blend in. **why does this matter**

2) this means better conversion rates.

Conversion rates are how advertisers can tell if their ROI is worth it to advertise on a platform. PINS conversion rates are no doubt excellent (we don't have data on this bc it varies from brand to brand) and will continue to be because of the large amount of data they have (they are a god damn search engine, after all. you may have heard of other search engines with excellent ad targeting)

3) PINS is apolitical

this is an advertisers (and users, honestly) wet dream. PINS isn't banning politicians on their platform, and youre only exposed to the political BS you CHOOSE to see. 


4) they have a **GROWTH** mindset

they're not dumb, they understand what makes them money. more active users, more money being spent on the platform in SOME fashion.

to do this, they are dedicated on increasing their MAU (monthly active users) which has already increased 35% as stated above. They're also expanding much faster internationally, for whats it worth. (so if you have bias against the platform because you or nobody you know is on it, think bigger than that.)

they've also begun collaborating with Shopify, which still has a ton of potential in already very smooth shopping experience. (try to replicate a shopping experience on PINS, you will be surprised at how it acts like amazon in this sense offering you different suppliers and options from varying sources)

PINS is just different, and their executives eyes are on the prize. I'm a believer in their goals to increase the bottom lines that will increase their revenue, and I'm all in.

PS - did I mention Cathie Wood is holding a large stake of PINS in her ARKF fund? She holds over 2 million shares in her ETF, making up 3.65% of the fund. https://ark-funds.com/fintech-etf

Pinterest Is Unique Among The Social Media Giants

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pinterest-unique-among-social-media-211705148.html

> Brian Feroldi: The way I think about Pinterest evaluation is this. The ARPU [average revenue per user] number is the most exciting thing. I think Pinterest can at least 5X its average revenue per user, like at least.
> 
> Brian Withers: That would be half of Facebook.
> 
> Brian Feroldi: Yeah. It would still be [only] half of Facebook. How many users could this platform get? It just added 120 million in the last year. So they're at just under half a billion. Could they get to a billion? Facebook has three billion. Could Pinterest be one-third as popular as Facebook?
> 
> If you can buy that argument, could they double their user base and 5X their average revenue per user? That will be a 10X growth in revenue. Is that realistic? I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility.
> 
> Pinterest is a $50 billion [market cap] company. How about this for a comparison? Snapchat, 91 billion. Which platform do you think is more monetizable? Which platform do you think is more niche? If Snapchat is worth 90 billion, I think Pinterest is worth at least 200 billion.
> 
> Brian Withers: As they grow that revenue, that's significantly scalable. They're going to drop more to the bottom line.
> 
> Brian Feroldi: Their gross margin is 82 percent and rising.
> 
> Brian Withers: Yeah, already.
> 
> Brian Feroldi: So, bullish. [laughs]
> 
> Brian Withers: I couldn't tell, Brian, I'm glad you clarified that.

There is so much information out there to confirm the Bull Bias on PINS that it keeps me up at night. I tell everybody I know about this stock. Assuming this takes off it's probably going to Dox me to many I know.

TLDR - PINS is generating stupid cash from advertisers (for being a great search engine and place to shop) because they are increasing their user base at a strong healthy rate, and are dedicating to making sure the train doesnt stop.

Background: I have more brokerage accounts than I should. I use RH only to test retarded high risk/reward trades.

**My reasons for leaving**    
1. After the hearings, it's clear to me that RH has nothing more to offer to its clients. It will side with their handlers. *""If you don't pay for it, you are the product""*.    
2. Selectively blocking trades is not right on my playbook, whether it was the clearinghouse or whether they get punished for it or not. Their action on selected stocks successfully broke their momentum. Not fking nice.   
3. If their excuses are true, they were undercapitalized. Who wants to be with the losers?    
4. The automated selling of expiring options 1 hr before market close is not acceptable. I want to play my FDs until the bitter end. Huge swings happen at the last minute. Why trade with a brokerage that controls you?    
5. The app is so addictive and the easiest to use of them all, but you get the least information possible as you finalize your order. I found myself placing stupid bets right after making money on the ones that I carefully planned the day before when I was not influenced by the app. Some executives at Facebook and other social networks don't use their own products because they know they are designed to be addictive. You can't help it.       
6. This is an external factor, but a guy died because of conflicting information from the app, a margin call that should not have been sent, and the inability to reach customer service on time. Not cool.


**My reasons for not leaving**    
1. As a reminder that we have power as traders.   

This is not financial advice and you can do whatever you want with your money. I don't care if others keep using RH, but I'm bringing this up for discussion because it has material impact in how we trade, it influences the markets and our ability to do better for ourselves. That I care about.

So here is my final residual balance: $4.20

Updating my thoughts on PLTR from earlier this afternoon, but I just wanted to share an interesting case study from Facebook‚Äôs IPO back in 2012:

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/id/49824482

TLDR: FB and PLTR have many similarities in that they are cutting edge companies that disrupted the entire tech industry. The similarities are eerie: FB had a bearish lock-up period, just like PLTR.

Now, FB was off 40% from its IPO as the lockup approached (PLTR is up triple, but strangely ~40% off the highs), nevertheless, there is much skeptism with PLTR as there was with FB in 2012.

People wondered whether FB would be able to transition from PC to mobile... the Street questions if Palantir can secure a stable corporate client base. There‚Äôs worries about the lock-up expiration with PLTR, just like with FB in 2013 (see the link).

But here‚Äôs the whopper: I don‚Äôt believe this lock-up will be nearly as bad as ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù speculates. Sure, certain directors @PLTR might sell some, but why would they kill it all now? There‚Äôs too much potential.

Cathie Wood reaffirmed her support forholding this bad boy for 5 years by DOUBLING her stake yesterday. You‚Äôre a fool if you think Alex Karp and Peter Thiel are thinking much differently.

This negativity is overblown. Perhaps we see $25 on PLTR, but think: how much lower can we go? We are stuck at a $50B valuation right now, compared to $80B for boomer-based Snowfuck ($SNOW). 

A software that looks like COD (yes Call of Duty)-Gotham Foundry (bad ass name btw) that can prevent terrorist attacks and catch Osama Bin Laden??

A predictive AI that can help manage supply chains and forecast growth/risk? A tech wizard that helps oil companies strategize how best to transition to the renewables era?

Name me one damn company that does any of that, much less ALL of it and stores the data on a mega cloud for proprietary/client computing?

If you feel queasy or unsure, just ask yourself: who else does what PLTR does? A mega, all-seeing, AI mastermind that can solve problems across defense, technology, financials, and energy? 

Certainly ain‚Äôt POS C3.AI or Spermflake. By the way- those other names are wayyyy more *overvalued* than King Palantir.

So I‚Äôm personally doubling down and buying more shares/calls tomorrow. This is simply the greatest firesale engineered on a looming corporate giant in financial history, and we retail investors & enthusiasts are chumps if we sit this one out.

This isn‚Äôt a short squeeze or a big short or any other financial gimmick. This is just about markets recognizing talent, and as more retail investors (us strong ü¶ç) and institutions (who are currently üåàüêª on PLTR) get in, $PLTR will send it to the next dimension.

POSITIONS (very highly requested): https://imgur.com/gallery/pldEQsP

UPDATED (2/18): WOW! Mama Wood just bought 5.3 million more shares TODAY, adding it to her flagship ETF $ARKK for the first time. Feeling ballsy enough to say the lock up is over and to Mars we go. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

BUY BUY BUY

Reload, double down, do it all!

This is the firesale of a lifetime on the next Google/Facebook. On days like today, you BUY PLTR with a take-no-prisoners attitude. 

Considering Cathie Wood doubled her PLTR stake yesterday, I don‚Äôt feel too fucked in the head.

Reloading on shares and $40 calls, and if this corrects to $25, Wall Street will be asking me to do some pretty ridiculous DCAG trades.

Conclusion: PLTR üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ, hold forever!!"

Lots of words below, so here‚Äôs the TL;DRs, Table of Contents, a self dox, and position disclosure before my DD.

**TL;DR #1**: After watching Demo Day twice, I am blown away at how much Palantir‚Äôs products have matured in the last 6 years since I left Palantir. I find the new UX far superior to offerings from GOOG, MSFT, and CRM. Apollo is absolutely incredible, and it‚Äôs going where no clouds have gone before‚Ä¶ from Humvees to nuclear submarines. Lastly, it is clear to me that PLTR has invested heavily in best-of-class administrative tools to improve the speed to deploy Palantir. Bottom line: I fully understand why IBM gave up fighting Palantir and is now selling Palantir Foundry to IBM clients.

PLTR when I left in 2015 versus the Palantir I saw on Demo Day:

[You've come a long way baby.](https://preview.redd.it/fuvi00aejph61.jpg?width=1182&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d993cff432e6b8f49b6728ac4d180cbbb2979080)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #2:** IBM just surrendered to PLTR. In the words of POTUS, this is a‚Ä¶

# Big.

# Fucking.

# Deal.

To put it politely, IBM and Palantir don‚Äôt have a very good past relationship. So the fact that IBM is now pushing Foundry means one thing: Foundry is so unfuckwithable that IBM was losing numerous contracts to Foundry-wielding competitors and IBM had no choice but to swallow their pride and cut a deal with Papa Karp.

* First they ignore you.
* Then they laugh at you.
* Then they fight you.
* Then they surrender to you and sign a deal to slang Foundry to thousands of clients in 180 countries.
* Then they send your shareholders tendies for decades.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #3:** Regardless of how ‚Äògood‚Äô or ‚Äòbad‚Äô the 2020 earnings are tomorrow, I find the news from early 2021 to be an incredibly strong signal pointing to an eventual $250B+ market cap for Palantir ‚Äì BP renewing their enterprise deal, Rio Tinto and PG&E signing a new enterprise deals, AT&T aggressively hiring for Palantir skills, and 2,500 IBMers now pushing Foundry to clients all over the world, etc. IE the tea leaves I'm reading point to strong growth in 2021 and beyond.

It's also worth mentioning that many of the new commercial clients have some of the most difficult and complex supply chains in the world.

If they‚Äôre in, I‚Äôm in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #4**: Eventually, institutional traders will comprehend the immense long-term value of ~~Planeteer~~ ~~Planter~~ Palantir and the stock will join the PFAANG club (though I vote that we rename it the FAAPNG club).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Because there are so many shills, pumpers, and bullshiters on WSB these days, I‚Äôll self dox myself. I‚Äôm Jason Payne. I joined Palantir in early 2007, when it was a few dozen geeks with big dreams, and left in 2015 to become the CEO of [Ada Diamonds](https://www.adadiamonds.com/) (hence my username).

I joined Reddit to do an official [AMA on laboratory-grown diamonds](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8pb8d5/i_grow_diamonds_i_make_custom_jewelry_with_these/) a few years ago that hit the front page, stuck around, and have absolutely fallen in love with the Reddit community. Thus, I want to give back to my fellow Redditors with a bunch of words and a few pictures to explain Palantir from the perspective of a former employee.

You may think that I‚Äôm a Palantir sock puppet given how my bullish I am in this DD. I‚Äôm not. Turns out I have a DD-writing fetish. Don‚Äôt kink shame. [Here‚Äôs a couple of my prior DDs](https://medium.com/@Jason_Payne) on De Beers, Tiffany & Co., and the FTC.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Positions or ban:** At the current PLTR share price, I hold a Keyser S√∂ze position - I could sell out this week and simply walk off into the sunset. But I‚Äôm not going to. I have yet to sell all of my unlocked 20%, and I plan to mostly diamond hands my soon-to-be-unlocked 80%, with a decade long diversification plan to exit my concentrated stock position, regardless of earnings tomorrow.

Why? I like the stock, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#1) Praise & Constructive Criticism for Demo Day**

Existentially, Demo Day was incredibly impressive. This thread with u/namingisreallyhard, u/DentalFox, and u/jamauer sums it up:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d0p7dwzijph61.jpg?width=526&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9caa7b51ca8f7c2315988eda62f4afa7f30f7b07

Four things stood out to me:

**Superior Design Language to CRM, MSFT, and GOOG:** Palantir has a completely different front-end user experience (UX) than my time at Palantir, that I saw for the first time on Demo Day. I find it practical, beautiful, and efficient.

The design language is called Blueprint Javascript, and it‚Äôs built on React, a modern web development platform that Facebook built. Big ups to Palantir for open sourcing BlueprintJS, meaning that anyone can use it: [https://blueprintjs.com/](https://blueprintjs.com/)

Blueprint is a UI toolkit for web development of complex data-dense interfaces for desktop applications. Compared to the cartoonish UX of Salesforce‚Äôs Lightning, the flat UX of Google, and the rigid UX of Microsoft Office, I would much prefer to work in Blueprint all day.

I struggle with how spread out Lightning is by default and really appreciated how dense the Blueprint inerfaces are without feeling crowded. Getting that balance right is really difficult.

**Deep Investment in Deployability**: Administrative tools are the unloved stepchild of enterprise software. No-one buys the backend system, so minimal investments are typically made to build the backend tools to run the software.

Salesforce still hasn‚Äôt ported their admin tools from their clunky Web 1.0 Salesforce Classic to their more modern Lightning design system. Google‚Äôs back end admin tools suck compared to their client facing tools - Gmail, Calendar, AdWords, etc.

The admin tools that Palantir demoed appeared far better than what I use every day to run my Salesforce instance. I bet I could do most tasks in Foundry 40-75% faster than Salesforce.

**Migration from ‚Äò*****Find the Terrorist*****‚Äô to '*****Cheat Code for War*****':** When I was at Palantir, the primary use case for Gotham was link analysis to find the bad guy. Gotham has clearly evolved from that mission to a far broader set of missions.

Another Redditor described Gotham as ‚Äòcheat code for war,‚Äô and I think that is spot on. That‚Äôs why Palantir has won so many different logistics, mission planning, command and control, etc. military contracts recently, including the Space Force

**DoD IL-6 SaaS Approval:** Palantir moving to IL-6 approval could be an entire massive DD on its own, but I‚Äôll keep it short. It‚Äôs a big fucking deal to get Apollo running on classified networks, and Palantir is far ahead of the other big SaaS players in this approval:

https://preview.redd.it/hl1j7wwkjph61.jpg?width=1314&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4dc190a30dc75e8d66bcd6c8ab74cb42472137d

Now that I have fanboied on Demo Day I want to be critical of the presentation style of Demo Day. I‚Äôd give the presenters a C+ at best. I found it rushed, confusing, and difficult to follow. I had to watch it twice to fully absorb the content, and I‚Äôve given 500+ Palantir demos in my lifetime! My constructive criticism:

* Slow down 15-20%
* Err on the side of a simpler, more approachable lexicon
* For the love of God, stop reading from scripts. Use bullet points
* Handoffs were way to abrupt. Take a deep breath between presenters for us to get prepared for a new topic
* Get better microphones and Snowsound panels for future presentations
* Get a professional public speaking coach involved in rehearsals

I‚Äôm not alone in my take on Demo Day. Here are a few unprompted DMs I got from random Redditors on the presentation:

>*¬∑ I don't know if it is just me, but I genuinely felt like I was watching a haphazard presentation that didn't really do justice nor capture attention in a lucrative way*  
>  
>*¬∑ It lacked charisma and charm, and it felt cobbled together like a group project by university students*  
>  
>*¬∑ I was watching the demo day presentation, and left feeling underwhelmed. It may have been impressive to someone who is in the industry, but from someone outside of it, it all sounded greek to me.*  
>  
>*¬∑ I felt like the Gotham team was clearly the A team and Foundry needs better presentation skills.*

I know my last PLTR DD made the rounds at Palantir, so here‚Äôs a direct message to those behind Demo Day - if everyone told you that you ‚Äò*killed it*,‚Äô you \*really\* need to find someone in the organization willing to speak truth to power.

\_\_\_\_\_

**#2) Why Palantir is a Diamond Fisted Iron Man Suit**

One of the Demo Day presenters made an interesting comment that stuck with me: At Palantir, we build Iron Man suits, not robots.

No, Palantir does not have a skunk works program building flying mech suits (AFAIK).

Palantir builds *cerebral* cyborgs, not *physical* cyborgs. Palantir‚Äôs products create a symbiotic relationship between human beings and computers to better solve *cerebral* tasks, not *physical* tasks.

&#x200B;

[Iron Man. Cerebral Edition.](https://preview.redd.it/77xps5ipjph61.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb3acbee813e27ca69f7b94c9158fba44c6e142a)

If you have not watched Demo Day yet (or you rewatch it), listen for how many times they say the words ‚Äòdecision‚Äô and ‚Äòdecision makers.‚Äô

Why a **diamond fisted** Iron Man suit? Palantir just closed an enterprise deal with Rio Tinto, who is the 3rd largest diamond producer in the world. So Rio Tinto will be using their PLTR-powered Iron Man suits to dig for fistfuls of diamonds on multiple continents.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**#3) The True ROI of Palantir**

Palantir is really expensive. No question about it.

But you know what‚Äôs more expensive than Palantir? Bad Decisions. Being wrong is really, really expensive. See the Airbus 380, Microsoft‚Äôs market share of cell phones, the Golden State Warriors drafting Todd Fuller over Kobe Bryant, shorting GME in early January, and BMW/Mercedes/Lexus‚Äôs dismissal of TSLA.

The true ROI of Palantir is substantially better decision making across your organization. Even a moderate improvement in decision making creates deep fucking value for an organization.

For example, Airbus claims that Foundry helped them improved the speed of A350 production by 33%. There are 5 million discrete parts in an A350, and the Foundry-powered decisions led to a 33% improvement in production. Palantir doesn‚Äôt make that claim. Airbus makes that claim. That‚Äôs absolutely bonkers and that‚Äôs why this is no surprise:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ns8wcvvsjph61.jpg?width=675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fb13831b6f18b58f53fa5131f6543e950e8569f

The BP renewal and the new deals (PG&E, Rio Tinto, Fiat, etc) prove u/petroduct is right. If you have complex logistics, you should have Foundry.

Say that Palantir improves the quality of decisions made at United Airlines by 6.9%. How much will the UAL stock appreciate over the next decade? If Palantir helps Rio Tinto improve decision making by 4.20%, how much will their bottom line grow by 2025?

Below are a few excerpts from United's Director of Technical Operations on how they use Foundry. This is just scratching the surface of how an airline can use Palantir to improve operations; however, if each of these models/decisions are incrementally improved, even a little bit, the value to United is fucking deep.

The entire blog post is a great read if you want to go deeper on Foundry: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/)

>*\[minor edits for brevity\]*  
>  
>*The return-to-service model recommends which specific aircraft to return at which time in the future and how to utilize our available maintenance capacity (internal & external) to ensure they‚Äôre airworthy when we need them. Since we don‚Äôt know when air travel demand will recover, the models need to account for slow recoveries, fast recoveries, and everything in between.*  
>  
>*Our optimization models consider when ‚Äúbig events‚Äù (airframe checks, engine overhauls, and landing gear overhauls) will be due, along with the cost of those events and the available maintenance capacity to complete them. The models also incorporate other factors: parts availability and cost, available technician hours at each maintenance station, ability to secure supplemental maintenance lines at external MRO providers, aircraft-specific mechanical reliability and on-time performance, and even the quality of the in-flight products (seats, Wi-Fi, entertainment, power outlets).*  
>  
>*The team is also helping optimize the cycling of active and parked aircraft whenever we have surplus planes available to fly, which ensures regulatory compliance with the maintenance program, minimizes operating costs, and enables our Tech Ops team to be very intentional about balancing our operational objectives ‚Äì do we want to fly the most reliable aircraft, the lowest cost aircraft, or the aircraft with the most time left until its next major maintenance event?*

&#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#4) Muthafuckin‚Äô Clouds in Nuclear Submarines**

Toward the end of the Apollo demo, one of the presenters offhandedly mentioned something that caused my jaw to hit the floor: Palantir will be deploying Apollo on US Navy submarines.

IL-6. Clouds. In. Nuclear. Submarines.

As someone who has installed and managed Palantir servers in server rooms all over the world, I can‚Äôt state how huge it is that the US Navy is approving the Apollo modular cloud architecture to be deployed on some of their most sensitive and expensive assets.

The fact that upgrades to the entire fleet can be managed like upgrading an AWS server?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mvmtqwdvjph61.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef22d9c598c63b3bd4e488b8439bc4082ff9f5ba

\_\_\_\_\_

**#5) Does it Matter that Palantir Needs FDEs at Deployments?**

One of the favorite arguments of the Palantir bears is that Palantir is an unscalable, overvalued services company that should have the same P/E as Accenture, Booz, BAE, etc. The bears say that Palantir only has a handful of clients and can‚Äôt scale. In my mind, the quality of the admin tools show on Demo Day and the IBM partnership announcement eviscerated that argument.

When I was at Palantir, it was a bitch to build and manage deployments. From what I saw on Demo Day, Palantir is now easier than Salesforce to deploy. I say that as someone who has written tens of thousands of lines of code for Salesforce (Lightning, Apex, SOQL and Visualforce).

Eventually, Palantir will have the same ecosphere of 3rd party developers that deploy and manage instances of SAP, Salesforce, Microsoft, etc. but that will take years to fully mature that ecosphere. Eventually, Palantir will have robust certifications for various skills and tasks to manage Palantir deployments.

But in the meantime, Palantir's Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) will continue to directly manage deployments. Given how much progress Palantir has made on the tools to improve the efficiency of the FDEs, I no longer worry about the scalability of that team.

Say that three utility companies all buy Palantir ‚Äì PG&E, ConEd, and Entergy.  Palantir invests 4 years worth of FDE time in PG&E, 1 year in ConEd, and none in Entergy.

* PG&E improves decision making by 10% and does a massive enterprise deal with Palantir to deploy to every part of the organization.
* ConEd improves decision making by 2% and does a moderate renewal for a few specific teams.
* Entergy bungles their deployment and actually makes worse decision as a result. They do not renew.

Assuming \~$500k/year all in is the cost for a good FDE at Palantir, we're talking about small up front investments that return bigly for PLTR in the long run as those deployments are extended like the BP deal.

To put it another way, when you think about Palantir deployments in months or years, the FDE overhead is spooky. But when you think about those deployments converting into decade long *operating system for XXXXXX* deals, the FDE overhead is not significant.

Also, to be honest, there are very few people with TS/SCI security clearances that even know what React is, much less how to write code against it, so in some of the more sensitive use cases for Palantir, I think that FDEs will be the way for a long time.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#6) Should you YOLO on PLTR?**

I‚Äôm not going to give anyone financial advice, but I do want to point out a few things:

PLTR is not a meme stock. Palantir is not a small-cap that can move bigly because, a bunch of furry quadrupeds gathering on internet messaging boards collectively decide that we like the stock.

Palantir is a bunch of wickedly smart people building Iron Man suits for the largest, most important organizations in the world.

Many of the larger institutional investors still don‚Äôt truly comprehend Palantir and the medium term public valuation may not properly reflect the present and future value created by Palantir. I have no idea when the analysts will finally get the value of PLTR.

A lot of historically successful investors think PLTR is extremely overvalued. They may be right.

A lot of historically successful investors have massive positions long PLTR. CathThey may be right.

So my crystal ball says PLTR may go up, down, or sideways for longer than you can stay solvent or interested in Karp memes.

Regardless of the ticker, if you YOLO, please YOLO responsibly my friends, and for the love of god take some off the table if/when you‚Äôre fortunate enough to have green dildoes in your accounts‚Äì whether your gains are from PLTR or any other stock you happen to like, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#7) My Appreciation for the Palantir Team**

I do want to take a moment and say to anyone who has been a part of building Palantir over the last few decades: what you have built is incredible. Thank you. As an American, thank you. As a stockholder, thank you.

Enjoy your tendies, you‚Äôve earned them my friends.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#8) How I Play My Lockup**

Regardless of how the markets view the earnings report tomorrow, I‚Äôm largely HODLing my remaining Palantir shares, as I think Palantir is in a class of it‚Äôs own, lapping the competition like SpaceX and Tesla.

I do have a professional advisor and we have prepared tax-optimized divestment strategies for a number of scenarios, but none of those scenarios involve paper handing out of my remaining position, regardless of a good, bad, or ugly response to the 2020 earnings report tomorrow.

Why would I sell now if I believe that FAANG-like is growth coming over the next 10 years? Why would I sell when I think Palantir in 2021 is like Mercedes F1 in 2014 about to go on a worldwide domination over the next few years? Also, with the shares finally unlocked, I can borrow against them for the first time.

I've already responsibly taken enough off the table pre-IPO, so I‚Äôm not in any rush to sell. My first substantial limit order will be at a market cap of \~$100B with a ladder up to \~$250B. So I‚Äôm skeptical that I‚Äôll sell any more than 5% of my remaining shares this week.

That‚Äôs my $0.02 on Demo Day and some of the recent news.

So long, and thanks for all the tendies. See ya at the restaurant at the end of the universe PLTR gang!

This has been the biggest weekly inflow since March 2008.

In 2008, after big inflows into the stock market happened, the stock market crashed. Most well-structured conservative portfolios lost one-half of their value. Momentum stocks lost 80 - 95% of their value.

BofA‚Äôs gauge of market sentiment-- the so-called Bull & Bear indicator-- is approaching levels of extreme bullishness, which can trigger a sell signal that hasn‚Äôt been set off since January 2018, according to the note.

Fed knows of the inflation spike and they will have to react



S&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio

In Yale economist and Nobel laureate Robert Shiller‚Äôs book Irrational Exuberance, he introduced a price/earnings ratio for the S&P 500 that averages inflation-adjusted earnings over the prior ten year. Today‚Äôs Shiller P/E multiples are the highest they have been in two decades. 

Dot com bubble: 44
Today: 35 


Warren Buffett‚Äôs favorite valuation metric, a simple ratio of the total U.S. stock market capitalization to annual gross domestic product, effectively gives market watchers a reference point for current prices.

The current stock market value of $42 trillion, compares to annual GDP of $21 trillion. One year after the dot-com bubble popped, Buffett said the unprecedented highs should have served as a strong warning signal. ""If the ratio approaches 200%‚Äîas it did in 1999 and a part of 2000‚Äîyou are playing with fire,"" said Buffett.

Current Buffet Indicator: 195%
Dot com bubble Indicator: 159%


Margin debt balances have exploded on Wall Street, recently hitting an all-time high of $778 billion‚Äînearly 37 times the $21 billion investors held in March 2000. However, the more important metric to focus on is margin debt to cash in customer accounts. It‚Äôs currently at 72% more debt than cash, versus 79% at the peak of the dot-com bubble. Speculation is contagious


Among stock market indicators the put/call ratio measures the weekly volume of put options, which are purchased when investors think stocks will fall, divided by the call option volume, contracts purchased by bullish investors


Currently the put/call ratio is 0.4, nearly identical to the 0.39 it registered in March 2000, at the peak of internet stock buying mania.


S&P market-cap concentration is at an all-time high, making index-tracking funds, which represent trillions of dollars in market value, extremely vulnerable to swings in just a few companies. 

Today, the top five‚ÄîApple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla and Facebook‚Äîmake up 21% of the index‚Äôs total market capitalization, even more than the 18% of market value commanded by the five biggest in 2000, when Microsoft, Cisco, General Electric, Intel and Exxon Mobil were on top. 

Is this it? The end is near?

The quality of WSB in the past was always that people tried to make money. Some people tried to make money by being really smart and others were just absolutely degenerate or thought they found an ""infinite money glitch"" on RobinHood. But all of them had the GOAL OF MAKING MONEY. That also meant, all of them could admit they were wrong when they lost money.



If I see a post titled ""Here's why I hold XYZ"", then I expect that the post has some reasoning about why XYZ will make me money. I do not expect an argument about MuH eViL hEdGe FuNdS that **blatantly admits** that there is no profit motive in holding XYZ.



**That's why I propose to extend the ""No Politics"" rule to all posts/comments that are about holding /promoting to hold a stock without the motive of making profits.**

An acceptable post from the frontpage right now is https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljck0s/why_i_am_super_bullish_on_gme/, which talks about shorts needing to cover and that will make money from GME.  Might be wrong, but it's making money.

This campaign has been largely led by large hedge funds. Without S&P inclusion, the story might have ended there with hedge funds trying to escape with their profits and leaving retail the bag. However, S&P inclusion presented these hedge funds with a much better option to close out their positions while also riding the stock down. The shares that hedge funds no longer wanted began to be picked up by passive funds leading to selloffs by the active funds which pushed prices to this level.

With passive funds holding the bag, the hedge funds which lead the rally seem to be attempting to push the price back down through a reverse gamma squeeze^(2).

No retail trader is buying 1m+ in deep OTM puts, this is an attempt by hedgies to push the price down.

We can also see this from the massive shift in options volume. $190B of calls open interest and over $250B of puts open interest, a massive put skew. This is especially significant because ""To put it in context it is equal to the combined $AAPL and $AMZN bullish skew or if you‚Äôd rather to the combined  $BABA, $FB, $MSFT, $GOOG and $WMT combined."" reflecting extremely bearish sentiment in an very very bullish market.

Once the reversal begins there will be nothing stopping it as OTM puts get less and less OTM. There are no shorts left to be squeezed and the bag holding passive funds which are largely barred from holding derivatives will have no way of rebalancing the options skew.

From his wiki

 ‚ÄúChen became CEO of Sybase in 1998.[12] As Sybase had been a strong competitor of Oracle, but had become a ""dead company"" after failing to enter the market for enterprise applications, as Oracle had. 
Chen and his team proceeded to reinvent Sybase as an ""enabler of the 'unwired enterprise'"".[12] In so doing, Chen and his team led a re-invention strategy that that led to the turnaround of the company into a profitable mobile device producer,[13] valued at $6 billion in 2010.[12]
Sybase achieved strong financial performance and shareholder returns under Chen's leadership‚Äù

Synapse‚Äôs story sounds familiar to blackberry‚Äôs. 

Chen‚Äôs done this before successfully and blackberry‚Äôs direction since losing the smartphone market has been successful and undervalued imo 

Now they‚Äôve shook hands with Facebook and settled their dispute and shook hands with Amazon to develop and market software for cloud-connected vehicles, obviously the future for the automotive industry. Their security is industry leading at the moment, it‚Äôs not just automotive ...etc etc etc there‚Äôs lots of DD been posted explaining in detail 

I just thought it‚Äôs not bad having a CEO that‚Äôs successfully transitioned a ‚Äòhas been‚Äô brand before (and raised its stock)  on top of the  currently undervalued services they provide 

I‚Äôm hoping bb‚Äôs price settles back down to around $6 again and I‚Äôll buy more and go long

I know these are difficult times for this sub and it‚Äôs almost impossible to post something solid which is not about the current meme stocks.

Instead of jerking to some porn i did some research on PLTR and want to share my DD with you. This might be a longer text for your love dopamine level so maybe you should grab some your Adderall before.

The following text might you give your eyes aids since English isn‚Äôt my native language. I will try my best.

**Palantir as a Company ‚Äì the beginnings**

PLTR was founded by some people and one of them is Peter Thiel who worked alongside with our holy papa Elon at PayPal. As a payment-service they had concerns about money laundering and founded PLTR to tackle this issue early. The CIA also funded PLTR (they are always funding stuff like this ‚Äì Siri as example). This actually might be the reason why people think that PLTR is a company which aggregates data and do data analysis for the government‚Ä¶.but this is not accurate and not correct at all if you see the big picture. I will explain this point later.

You retard still reading? Nice here some rocket emoji‚Äôs to pump your dopamine and keep you happy. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Let‚Äôs start with the DD

First of all my POV is looking for a midterm to long term investment in PLTR. My valuation considers PLTRs current state and predicting from now on for the next few years.

&#x200B;

* **1. The Management**

Before I start with the product I rather start with the management. You can sell the nicest thing in the world. I can guarantee you that the product definitely won‚Äôt be considered as the nicest thing after a while if you have a shitty management (Intel). With Peter Thiel on the leaderboard we got a competent asshole and CEO is Alex carp (co-founder) Peter Thiel is well known and Alex Karp is one of us. He yolod his heritage into some business and become a chad. Seriously tho, I trust Peter and if Peter holds on Alex since Decades so do I. Peter proved so many times how cunning he is and showed how to pick adapt problems early and create solutions.

&#x200B;

* **2. PLTR Business model/ products**

Before we understand how important PLTRs products are we have to understand that we are simpeltons who don‚Äôt have any business with PLTRs. We create data. We don‚Äôt fuck with it. We creating with using our phones or working in the office. Only a few of us may working with accumulated big data. PLTRs customers‚Äô base isn‚Äôt neighbor Joe or Aunt Nancy. The products they offer are not even for midcap companies they are more designed for whole industries and governments. That‚Äôs the reason why their products aren‚Äôt so tangible for many people.

PLTR basically offers systems to big companies/governments which import their data into these systems. PLTR doesn‚Äôt sends workers to the client to collect data and analyse it. They sell platforms. They got 2 Products called ‚ÄúGotham‚Äù and ‚ÄúFoundry‚Äù You may think wtf is this guy talking about? Let me explain it in 2 examples:

First example is Syria with Gotham. It was impossible in the country to know who the good guys are and who the bad ones are. I know u muricans only know yourself and the rest of the world is the ‚Äúrest of the world‚Äù for you. But this wasn‚Äôt so simple in Syria you had many factions with different intentions and some of them were allies and some of them were enemies. The lack of information or the ability of recognizing and sorting these information‚Äôs are crucial in a war. PLTR solved the struggle with creating a map which provided resilient information for the marines so they can operate safely. Civil problems over there could also be fixed.

[https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/)

Actually what the John Hopkins University does with the covid numbers and the map, is some sort of what PLTR offering with their solutions. There are rumors that the tracking of Covid and the vaccination will be done by PLTR.

In their S1 Form PLTR describes it this way

‚ÄúGotham, our first software platform, was constructed for analysts at defense and intelligence agencies. They were hunting for needles not in one, but in thousands of haystacks. And they did not have the software they needed to do their jobs. In Afghanistan and Iraq, soldiers were mapping networks of insurgents and makers of roadside bombs by hand. Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps U.S. and allied military personnel find what they are looking for.‚Äù

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406\_11](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406_11)

The second example is about ‚ÄúFoundry‚Äù and it‚Äôs directly from the S1 File of PLTR (page 121)

‚ÄúAn Airbus A350, for example, has five million parts and is built by hundreds of teams that are spread across four countries and more than eight factories. Companies routinely struggle to manage let alone make sense of the data involved in large projects. Foundry was built for them. The platform transforms the ways in which organizations interact with information by creating a central operating system for their data.‚Äù

Both of these systems solving big issues with less effort. The arms industry as example would took billions for drones and stuff in Syria for the same job. The important fact is that PLTR does not spend so much resources for new clients they only have to provide access and support for their services and the client feeding the ‚Äúmachine‚Äù with data.

The key point is to understand that PLTR benefits very huge from economy of scales. This is very important since their costs for additional revenue is basically flat while the profits growing exorbitant with new customers. They offer a software and platforms and not kind of services where they need man power. All they do is working on their platforms and improving it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **3. PLTRs big issue during the last decade**

Peter Thiel was a great supporter of Trump and funded his elections campaign. The market thought that when trump wins then PLTR will get all the government (especially military) contracts.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html)

But this didn‚Äôt happened. Peter got cucked by the huge authority apparatus in pentagon. These dudes loves bureaucracy and they do it for a good reason. If you retire from your job in pentagon you usually get a high paid luxurious position at Lockheed, Raytheon or Bae Systems to make additional free money for your retirement. Many thousand people working in pentagon just to select and buy stuff for the government. They spending billions of dollars for purchases and then PLTR came around and said like ‚Äûlook guys we can do this job for a few millions instead billions‚Äú. Of course the arms industry was pissed and the pentagon boomers helped them out. PLTR got constantly scammed from boomers and didn‚Äôt get the contracts. This was also the ‚Äûswamp ‚Äûtrump was talking about.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army)

A fun fact to this matter: Before James Mattis got summoned as the Defense Secretary of the USA he was a general in Afghanistan. He ordered services from PLTR despite the fact the pentagon was against it. But the marines praised PLTRs software and valued it over the trash they used to know from the defense/arms industry.

Even with a James Mattis as the defense secretary, trump as president and regardless that PLTR does it better and cheaper than the arms industry, it wasn‚Äôt possible for PLTR to get the government contracts.

[https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373)

[https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/](https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/)

How it‚Äôs ended? Well Peter‚Äôs wife doesn‚Äôt have a boyfriend because Peter is the fucking boyfriend of their wifes. All ended at the court and PLTR won. All this injustice ended at the court. The judgements on these cases are true circuit breakers for PLTR. Not only because PLTR spent shit tons of money for law suits. The lawsuits were perfect uppercut hits on the arms industry and they ended some fraudulent behaviors and ‚Äûbest practices ‚Äûin the government

[https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/)

PLTR will profit from a Biden who wants to decrease the military expenditures. They will get the job done and at the same time the costs will go down. With the recent judgements the door looks open.

&#x200B;

* **4. Valuation problems**

I could spam some multiplication on revenue or even a DCF but I think it‚Äôs not necessary. Expect the costs of research and development (maybe marketing) the costs of PLTR stood mostly flat in the last quarters. It‚Äôs a growth stock and the pricing is mostly in the perspective of PLTR. This is actually all we need to know that the revenue increases while the costs staying mostly flat. Check out the balance sheets at page 12 on the S Form 1.

Let‚Äôs talk about the market. The whole market seems overpriced but it isn‚Äôt tbh. Due to the low cost of capital there is no alternative than to throwing your money on stocks or on real estate. There is nothing with a solid interest rate around (not even in emerging markets). At the stock exchange like in 70s, the companies had to offer a return, a perspective which should be more attractive as putting your money on a saving account with 8% interests without risks. These times are gone since the 2000s. So before people discuss insane valuation they should check out the fiscal and economical policies.

Now back to PLTR and why the price is difficult to set (cheap imo). First of all PLTR did a direct listing without an investment bank for their share offerings. Its lacking of the valuation which they usually would get through such a process.

PLTR wanted to do IPO with Morgan Stanley but it was mess.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears)

Morgan Stanley proved themselves many times as stubborn communists when it comes to valuations. I mean you guys remember their disgusting price targets for tesla like 100$ post split or stuff like that.

These guys are very focused on numbers and I know it‚Äôs difficult to price in the potential and perspectives. But you can‚Äôt ignore these things for a fundamental valuation. If you want to consider these things in the price you have to understand the business of the company.

This ended that one team at Morgan Stanley valuated PLTR with 5 billion while another team thought they worth 40 billion.

[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html)

How is this difference possible and why is this happening? Because people don‚Äôt understand what they are valuating. This happened a lot in the last decade because the decision makers in these banks and many analyst don‚Äôt have any idea which metrics they should use on companies like that. They are using the metrics from classical industries on new business. They freaked out when Facebook was valued with 100 billion as IPO. Same with Twitter and in the last years it was Tesla. They said apple going to tank every damn year in the last decade. I honor Warren Buffet so much since he has the dignity to realize that he don‚Äôt understands something but at the same time he sees the potential and the trend. That‚Äôs why he hired 2 Chads who bought Snowflake for him. The transformation and the generation change didn‚Äôt happened yet. That‚Äôs why they try to use the metrics from Caterpillar on Tesla.

Guys the whole market is mooning with the cheap liquidity. Pennystocks and zombie companies transforming into billion dollar market cap companies. Facebook as IPO had a market cap of 104 billion back in 2012. At that time it wasn‚Äôt possible for Facebook to monetize their users with selling ads. They just paid 100 billion for the potential in more difficult market conditions.

Look at the IPOs like doordash, Bumble. I‚Äôm not going to call this a bubble. Just check out their business cases and use the metrics. Maybe its easier for people to understand Bumble and Doordash‚Ä¶

On page 12 of the S1 (balance sheet) Form you can already see the huge positive trends in PLTRs revenue and their costs. All this without all the positive events and contracts PLTR recently got.

PLTRs valuation is difficult and I think it‚Äôs miscalculated by pessimistic communist who don‚Äôt understand that their products are game changers for industries, governments and defense forces. Because of these points I think there is huge price potential for PLTR

&#x200B;

* **5. Risks for PLTR**

Despite the general market risks PLTR mentions at page 29 of the S1 Form the competitors as the main risk: ‚ÄúWe face intense competition in our markets, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.‚Äù The S1 Form didn‚Äôt aged well. Actually I don‚Äôt think that PLTR would have any trouble with offering new shares. Also with Peter Thiel as one of the founders the financial side should be stable.

As PLTR competitor people use to mention IBM. The boomers from IBM already surrendered with their Windows95 computers and decided to cooperate. The biggest threat would be big tech with big money like AMZN or APPL. You all now the stories about APPL and Spotify or AMZN and all the merchants. Even if the big players would step into PLTR markets it would be difficult for them since PLTRs products doesn‚Äôt rely on an Amazon store or on apple devices. PLTR is years ahead with their products.

I think the greatest risk (still) are the boomerish arms industry and all the boomers in pentagon and other authorities.

There are very corrupt infrastructures when it comes to decision making and assigning contracts. People fear changes but they can‚Äôt avoid the changes. With the recent judgements we can see a turn on the tables but the transformation will still take time. It‚Äôs a circuit breaker with an avalanche effect.

The risk factors on page 16 on the S1 form mostly aren‚Äôt relevant anymore. People complained that PLTR wasn‚Äôt profitable for 18 years. Well PLTR was never designed to be profitable and Alex Karp once said ‚Äúlove us or leave us alone‚Äù.

[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html)

But even this changed recently. PLTR became profitable in 2020 with 130,000,000¬ß. Now the same people complaining about how high the stock price compared to the profits. Well just you wait.

&#x200B;

* **6. Conclusion and Outlook**

If you still reading I have to admit that this was a lot text and i am sorry again about the lingo. Let‚Äôs connect the dots and bring this information to a point

1. The boomer coalition in the pentagon and in the arms industry is taken down by PLTR. They will able to get the governments contracts and the classic arms/defense industry is no match for PLTR products. The judgements of lawsuits were catalyst and the effects should be already shown in the next earnings. These were such underrated events but I think there still will be some odds but PLTRs situation is much better as it was a time ago. The chains are off!
2. Military expenditures rising worldwide

&#x200B;

[https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion)

With Bidens presidency we will see more disruptive technologies chosen by the government. Biden want to reduce the military expenditures. PLTR is able to provide better service for lower cost. Not only the recent judgements also the political change will help PLTR. Ironic if you remember that Peter supported Trump and getting his tendies from Biden.

3. PLTR superior products profits hugely from economy of scales. They don‚Äôt have any significant costs when they acquire new customers. Making the big data usable for decisions making is already very important and step by step people realize that this issue growing fast. We creating everyday more data than we did yesterday and leaving the majority of it as trace and unstructured data. We don‚Äôt work with it but big Institutions does.

Here is the passage from the S1 and I fully agree with it:

‚ÄúThe systemic failures of government institutions to provide for the public ‚Äî fractured healthcare systems, erosions of data privacy, strained criminal justice systems, and outmoded ways of fighting wars ‚Äî will continue to require both the public and private sectors to transform themselves. We believe that the underperformance and loss of legitimacy of many of these institutions will only increase the speed with which they are required to change.‚Äù

4. PLTRs value. The current situation of the market with tons of liquidity seems like a bubble. People don‚Äôt know what to do with the cheap capital and people throwing it even on meme pennystocks.

Facebook had his ipo back in 2012 during much harder market conditions as now. The valuation of Facebook was over 100 billion and people called it insanely overvalued. They did it because Facebook didn‚Äôt had a way to monetize their users (especially on mobile platforms). Facebook has a market cap of over 750 billion now and nobody calling it over valued.

A remember the recent examples? Bumble?! Bruuuh. Don‚Äôt get me wrong if you invested in Bumble but they have nothing special to offer and their business case can easily copied or improved by others. Its shows the current state of our market with the crazy liquidity that even zombie companies got astronomic valuations. Use these metrics on PLTR with great products, great management, low cost base and less odds as ever before‚Ä¶.

PLTR price is wrong imo especially in this market and with PLTRs current state and perspective.

5. Do you use PLTR? Me Neither! It‚Äôs not designed for us and we have to inform us about the success. PLTRs new contracts and their future are shining bright. With the settled lawsuits the sky is clear for PLTR. But their customer base is not only America. I‚Äôm not a murican and 3 weeks before I just find out that the police departments in our state using PLTR products. I don‚Äôt need to link endless evidences here since you can google it by yourself and see how many contracts PLTR recently got. Especially after the circuit breakers we talked about.

I have genuinely trust into Peter Thiel and Alex Karp that their will make the best of PLTRs potential. The odds getting removed and the demand for PLTR is increasing.

If all these information would priced in correctly we would have a share price of at least 60-70$.  With upcoming and ongoing positive events PLTR share price should soar more..

**What‚Äôs next?**

Now we have earnings ahead and the lock up period ending.

For the earnings I think the number will be fine and keep up the positive trend on revenue with a disproportionately trend of the costs. The most important part will be guidance for 2021. We should listen closely and see if the magic is already happening.

The second event is the ending of the lock up period. You all remember the end of the lock up period of Nikola? Just 1-2 days after they announced they don‚Äôt got the GM deal? The stock tanked ‚Äì for a good reason. You know the guy Trevor Milton.

But in PLTRs case everything is different. Despite the successful deals they got, does a guy who says ‚Äúlove us or leave us alone‚Äù sounds like someone who going to drop his shares at the first possibility? I don‚Äôt expect such a behavior from Alex Karp and neither from Peter Thiel. If some employees drop their shares it should be fine.

I would appreciate if the stock prices would go below 3√ü. It would create a healthy bullish chart pattern and would be actually a nice discount to get in or stock up. I don‚Äôt think that the shares going to dump a lot because of this event. The earnings and the guidance are more important and the key events if you want to invest mid ‚Äì long term.

What does all this means for you? Nothing! Please don‚Äôt do any market activity based on my DD. I‚Äôm just sharing my knowledge and looking for critics so I can reevaluate my theses. This is not a financial advice.

My hearts bleeding for all the GME holders. My last Reddit account got banned because I criticized ‚Äúthe pumpers‚Äù. In one of the comments I called the mods gay and got banned permanently (bye bye 20 k karma). If you are new to this please don‚Äôt do any decision based on this so I can sleep gladly.

I‚Äôm not well positioned and not trying to pump this stock. I have 70 shares and a CSP. Fair play and fuck all the bots and pump and dumper we recently got in the sub!

Leave an upvote if this post helped you. I need some more karma to be able to shitpost everywhere again!"

Am seeing a ton of Asian ADRs being shilled on here with the message being that they're cheap. Yes they are cheap, but there's a reason.

***Shitty Corporate Governance:***

I'm not completely familiar with Chinese and Japanese conglomerates (but have heard they're similar) so I'm going to focus on the Korean ones. Korean companies essentially exist for the benefit of the founder's families. Period.

People went off about corporate governance issues at Facebook and Snapchat during their IPOs due to founders controlling the company with ""only"" 22% and 36% ownership respectively... Samsung's ""owner"" controls the entire conglomerate with a 3.4% ownership stake.

[This is Samsung Group's Ownership Structure](https://preview.redd.it/jqvamel8m0h61.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=41dbc7133b7a239b7f90b8c56787791b3ebf9461)

***Circular Holdings:***

A Korean company having a holding in another subsidiary isn't a good thing. It's a way for the founder to hold on to as much control of as many companies as possible with as little capital as possible.

The founder will have a stake in company A -> Company A has a stake in company B -> Has a stake in Company C -> Has a stake in Company A.

***Prices Held Down:***

Unlike the US where CEOs have bonus incentives to keep stock prices up (a different issue in and of itself), founders/CEOs in Korea have incentives to keep the price down. They want to keep the price as cheap as possible so that when they die the inheritance taxes are lower for their children. Seriously. Stock prices at these conglomerates go up when one generation of owners die as they're no longer held down.

The shit that these founders pull on shareholders make hedgefunds/wallstreet guys in the US look like saints. Nearly every founder of every major conglomerate in Korea has gone to jail for securities fraud/embezzlement/bribery. It's a shitshow.

**tl;dr:**

Don't mess with Korean stocks (or Chinese, Japanese, etc) if the only reason is ""they're cheap"". They're cheap for a reason and they will be for a long time."

What Happened: The social news aggregator and discussion website's current investors include Tencent Holdings Ltd (OTC: redacted), Andreessen Horowitz, and Sequoia Capital, according to Crunchbase.

Reddit has doubled its valuation to $6 billion in the latest funding round, which was led by Vy Capital, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said that it was a 'good market to fundraise.'

'Valuations are very high right now. It never hurts to raise money when there's an opportunity to do so and Reddit had a strong year,' the executive told the Journal pointing to a 90% YoY increase in advertising revenue in the quarter ended December.

Why It Matters: Reddit has been in the limelight after r/WallStreetBets, a community of retail investors on the platform, short squeezed stocks of GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC), Blackberry Ltd (NYSE: redacted, Nokia Oyj (NYSE: redacted) and others.


'We are also readying to double the number of Reddit employees this year; it's surprising not only for the pace of growth but also that such a relatively lean team has been behind one of the most visited websites in the world,' the social media company said in a statement.

Reddit purchased video-based social media platform Dubsmash in December.

* While other competitors seem to be playing a price and ""free"" game, Bumble seems to be going the quality route.

What I don't like:

* Facebook dating is in development and being tested - poses a huge threat

Nikola, a company who has never produced a product and is widely believed to be outright fraud has a marker cap of ~$8.3B as of Feb 3rd, 2021. GameStop, a company with ~40k employees in the growing industry of video games has a market cap of ~$6B. A few months ago a dynamic businessman, Ryan Cohen bought millions of shares of GameStop, and then joined the board with other former Chewy executives (an online pet supply store worth ~$40B). People who had long believed GameStop has more value than the market was giving it (a low of ~$250M total market value at one point), along with new people who now saw potential in this businesses turn around, bought stock in the business. That should be the end of the story.

It‚Äôs because hedge funds on Wall Street have again been so greedy that they risked the entire United States financial system. See, these hedge funds ‚Äúshorted‚Äù the stock, 140%. How can you have 140% of an entire companies stock? You can‚Äôt but they did. And the risk, which they never considered in their infinite wisdom, is infinite losses. Infinite losses? Yes, a stock price can go to $0 and the shareholders lose all their money and the company is bankrupt. But a stock has no top dollar amount, and when you‚Äôre short a stock, you bet it goes to 0, but if you‚Äôre wrong it can go as far up as any stock has ever gone for any reason. A good reason would be, the stock went up for fundamental reasons but the short positions couldn‚Äôt unwind because you can‚Äôt undo 140%, you could only undo 100%. Therefore, in using market manipulation to drive a company into bankruptcy they were suddenly faced with infinite losses, something that would send catastrophic ripples through the financial industry.

So, Robinhood. We all thought they were cool but like Facebook they‚Äôre fucking evil because they‚Äôre free, so instead of paying $6 a trade we pay $0, which was cool until last week when we found out that in spite of their name Robinhood, they are actually in the business of selling financial data to hedge funds. They take your trade order, and let the hedge funds know so their High Frequency Trading can arbitrage pennies on every trade by ‚Äúbeating‚Äù it to the order, millions of times a day. Ok, fuck us millennials, ok yeah but also, a little consumer protection, maybe? Ok - this is where it gets fucked.

What we learned Thursday is that Wall Street and the stock brokers do not have America‚Äôs interest their interest is to hedge funds and banks. Trading was restricted, whether it was Robinhood, the brokers, the Market Makers, we may never know but it‚Äôs not that important because it reveals that the system is fundamentally and structurally aligned to protect the few existing billionaires against Americans interest. This is a fatal sin against our democratic capitalism and risks everything we stand to be.

Moreover, they did it for a reason, the same people that control our stock markets, the barons of our nations wealth, also risked destroying them with infinite losses. How do you cover -140% to infinity? This would alter the value of every equity in America, so they shut it down.

Now, as we try to piece this together, one wrong is repairing the damage done to individual investors but the bigger change needs to be structural, prosecuting the criminals we allow to run our economy and rebuilding an equitable market to allow the American dream to prosper.

1. If you‚Äôre going to invest in stocks the first thing you need to do is join a Facebook group. 
The people there have already done the homework and know exactly what they‚Äôre talking about. 

2. Second, look for post that just have the ticker symbol ex: $abc
That way you know exactly what to buy without doing any hard reading. 
Picking a winner is easy. Just look for the following emojis. üöÄüåïüìàüëêüíéüöÇ

3. Always, always buy high and sell low. 
Dont bother reading books or looking up quality youtube videos. You didn‚Äôt need those economics or finance classes in school, you‚Äôre buying a lambo anyway.

4. Then complain about your losses to the same Facebook group because you didn‚Äôt know what a stop limit was or when was the right time to pull out. 

5. Become cynical and bitter about any stock, that anyone mentions, but continue to not understand market mechanics.

6. Assume everything is a pump and dump trap. Even though there is evidence to the contrary. #AMC #GME #shortladderattack

If you do these things, you too can be a Facebook group stock investor.

I'm a member of multiple teacher groups, as I was interested in how people are adapting to online learning. Here's the thing. THEY HAVE TRIED AND ITS REALLY HARD.

Why do you people keep raving about the digital age when so many people don't have an internet connection strong enough to download an IOS update in less than 5 hours, let alone a COD update.

What does't cost internet? Physical shit. And in a place like the US where I'm sure there are people in lower SES communities afraid of doing a craigslist buy for a secondhand disk because they might get robbed, fleeced or shot, there's a huge market for a middleman who at least won't disappear of craigslist after you find out the game is scratched or broken.

That also doesn't include how a huge proportion of gamers are now women, and who don't have the male privilege of not viewing everything as a potential attack, especially given the virality of #metoo in the last 10 years.

So, just how many potential customers, or rather, nearly guaranteed customers (because poor people buy shit to make them happy to distract them from being poor, or for social capital ([https://talkingpointsmemo.com/cafe/why-do-poor-people-waste-money-on-luxury-goods](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/cafe/why-do-poor-people-waste-money-on-luxury-goods)).

More than a few people have boasted about using funds gained to buy things they need, or to donate things like a switch or ten to a hospital. Because we all know that when life really fucking sucks if you've got a video game you can play then you are able to at least escape, just for a bit. I'm gonna play super metroid after this.

What does all of this spell? It spells that half the reason that people are betting against gamestop is because a bunch of old people, due to their own privilege and inability to understand the social economics of why and how people play video games, have failed to understand that regardless of gamestop's need to pivot to the lucrative metropolitan market, that until there is ubiquitous internet access for ALL americans, Gamestop has a VALUABLE place in the market as a safe place for pixel purveyors to do business.

As the reply to the reply, yes amazon is a big online retailer and makes big money because people who like convenience also shop there. True. But also good luck returning what you bought from amazon, and good luck selling shit on there, it's not ebay, and inaccessible for the average punter.

In sum of my short, poorly referenced sociology post,

FUCKING BUY GME and HOLD IT LIKE ITS YOUR LAST WANK BEFORE NO NUT NOVEMBER

This is also not financial or legal advice. This is just logic.

My opinion is that unless I can find compelling evidence that the squeeze is truly done for and off the table, my conviction has only grown stronger.

Most important things that stick out, all of which really build a case that must not be dismissed:

1) If shorts have covered, we should have noticed reasonable strong upwards momentum, as buying pressure consists of short covering along with retail buying, and a limited float.

2) Past few days we've seen trading volumes below average, likely suppressed demand caused by broker restrictions on buying. Lower volume can make any dump pull the price down easily. Especially when the demand side is getting locked out. Have to mention the timing of which Robinhood locked buying last week as well, coinciding with a massive dip.

3) Look at [this image](https://preview.redd.it/dralf2uks4f61.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=52223e916aacb4f65681da1cfe4f5e1ade7cea30)

Notice how AMC & GME have almost identical candlesticks, and the same is in the BB-NOK pair. It is undeniable that a lot of people are buying this stock and holding this stock. Not just in America but all across the world. We have global support.
You would think that with this many people in the trade (whether they are on the buying / selling side) we would see greater variance. This correlation to me looks like obvious manipulation by higher frequency and higher volume algorithmic trading.
It's hard to look at these charts and say that this is natural supply and demand. Seriously, same candlestick patterns on unrelated stocks. This price action is influenced by targeted manipulation to a high degree. Even if people were really selling off like crazy, wouldn't we see more natural candles?

4) We have mainstream media (MSM) covering the ""reddit mania"" extensively. MSM says reddit is trying to squeeze silver, which is false. You will not find anyone pushing to buy SLV on reddit. In fact, you will see a warning about silver and how many HFs have long positions in it.

5) We've seen an influx of bots on social media (reddit, FB, twitter) promoting silver, spamming that GME squeeze is finished, diverting attention away from the more uninformed audience. Why? If it's finished why the need for these?

6) MSM says the short squeeze mania is over and shorts have covered. If that is true, why are we seeing trade restrictions still on more and more brokers, and nonstop coverage all over TV and the internet. If it's over, why are there so many articles bashing retail to stay away?

7) GME is an outlier in the ""failed-to-deliver"" statistic, and has been put on NYSE short restriction (uptick rule). Something fishy is going on with the shares in the float.

8) SI% numbers are very conflicting. Especially the numbers that came around 30-50%. It was then later mentioned by someone in S3 that a different calculation was used. If you convert to the old calculation, you still get over 100% SI%. Why are they trying to change it all of a sudden?

To me, this is enough to say we're still in the game. If it's over, let them prove it by crushing GME to $20 and on February 9th we hear the official SI% being low. Then it's finished. Something tells me that it's not over, and this is all a ploy to mitigate the damage they are about to receive when GME eventually triggers the MOASS.

Can't say for sure it's a 100% trip to the moon and beyond, but what's really suggested otherwise? This whole misinformation campaign + price manipulation combo is too important to dismiss.

Remember I'm retard and please make your own financial decisions. This post is based on my observation and speculation.

Position 50 shares GME $210

üöÄüíéüôå $GME to the moon üöÄüíéüôå

**TL;DR** - *YES THERE IS LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN A SQUEEZE LAST WEEK, BUT WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING LATELY SUGGESTS THIS IS NOT OVER! MOASS IS POSSIBLE UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE! WAIT FOR ACTUAL CONFIRMATION BEFORE THROWING IN THE TOWEL!*

No, he was thinking 10-20 years out. We're in a different league now. The rules you once knew aren't applying but there are some underlying truths you have to know, deeply.

This is a perspective post. You'll get your gd rockets in the end. 

Pump the brakes. Stop living in the moment every 20mins over and over again. Zoom out, gather yourself, have some perspective. 

I was GLUED to my screens the last few weeks, watching, gathering, celebrating, maddening‚Äîbut this last week has taught me a lot. The stock price and fluctuation, in this scenario, is not attached to what's really happening. **YOU KNOW THIS.** Now stop panicking when you know they're fucking with you. We've learned that the free market economy, that we've been encourage to take part in, is not all rainbows and roses. What we do know is they're illegally manipulating the price, but it will catch up to them. VOLUME IS NOT MATCHING PRICE SWINGS. 

There's amazing DD done after the markets are closed. Dig around and look for those, they'll give you all the reassurance you need. While the markets are open, that's when the snakes strike. They're tanking the price, the news is infiltrating your brain, you think of losses. But it's all synthetic. 

You need to take care of yourself and be stoic. People who are dropping out and acting out of emotion and instinct, not confidence and understanding. Take a look at our lord and savior, DFV's Twitter: [https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty). There's no panic, no short-term thinking, just fucking swag. He posts kitten gifs and his positions at the end of each trading day. His balls are swelling beyond the size of the moon. That's confidence. He's lost tens of millions in theoretical value this last week, and yet he's stoic. What does that tell you? What does he know that you don't? Find the DD at the end of the days. Look at volume vs price swings. 

This isn't supposed to make sense if you've been following the market for some time now. You'll see your favorite youtube stock investors starting to cave under the pressure because they're still associating the stock price with gains/losses. They are focused on likes, follows, subscribers and that's amplified by big jumps in stock price; of course they'll feel defeated. But OG investors will always tell you that the longer you hold the better off you'll be. You think Warren Buffett threw a party every time Coca Cola went up 5% in a day? No, he was thinking 10-20 years out. We're in a different league now. The rules you once knew aren't applying but there are some underlying truths you have to know, deeply.

The clients of the hedge funds can start the squeeze once their paper losses get to be too big and they all start crying on Facebook.

2nd thing: make clear I m holding hell yes!! üôåüíé
3rd thing: dont have any knowledge about markets, I mean 0, nothing.

This is a war. I dont feel like we will win without fighting or working on it. The dark side indeed are manipulating all they can, working to win hard. I see like most of us just sit front pc, say hold and waits for the win.

Dont think in the same way. We need to work for the win too.

Imagine a balloon (remember I dont have any knowledge about all this), to win we need/want to explode it. The dark side is taking out just some air everyday, they want the pressure to disappear for win.

There are many ways for put more pressure in the balloon, mainly is buying more, easy. But most of us cant put more money in this.
Then, we can (my 3rd post about this) get all the fucking world involved in this. It s a fight david vs goliath, everyone love this fights. We ll get many people helping, they just still dont know about this fight.

Bomb twitter, fb, instagram, etc....try to get known people in this. Create a movement or how is called, in the social media. Get everyone knowing about this, what is, and why we do. Share your funny billboards all arround, your generous donations you are doing, this is called publicity and is a tool to win.

Other pressure is not directly on we are doing, instead of pressure over what the dark side is doing. Send infinite complains about this to the SEC, media news, wherever is needed. (I tried to fill a complain document online to the SEC, didnt know even what to write, I m useless)
Put so many eyes on their movements to make them stop manipulating, or starting to proceed (SEC).

To end, resuming, I see most of us being ""lazy and bored"", shouting hold!!!!! And dont have clear at all we will win only with this. Move your ass and start working for the victory.

With my best intention.
Hoooold !!!! üôåüíé"

It's Only Just Begun.,116,8,2021-02-02 22:22:42,"Been watching the whole Gamestop thing unfold since November on WallstreetBets (WSB) and holding some shares since $40. WSB has grown from 2 million members last Monday to 8 million just a week later, and they have revealed an amount of corruption in the open market more than I could have previously believed. I'm proud of the major newspapers reporting most of the event accurately so far, while all the major TV stations (CNBC, CNN, Fox, etc.) are blatantly lying and saying WallStreetBets has moved on to invest in Silver. They've given up on trying to say Gamestop is a lost cause because that just put fuel on the fire. Now they are trying the tried and true method of ""divide and conquer"".   

The financial system doesn't seem to realize how many young investors they have pissed off. They haven't reported on are all the people who used their Gamestop winnings to buy video games and consoles to donate to children's hospitals, or the billboards across the country this week in Hartford, NY, Boston, Denver, and even in front of the NY Stock exchange itself showing something similar to ""WE'RE NOT LEAVING, GAMESTOP TO THE MOON"".   

Today, STAKE, a broker in Australia akin to Robinhood (RH) is now preventing people from buying the stock after it has dropped about 60% in one day. They let you buy it when it was worth $300 and $400, but not at $150. Seems fair right? The google store removed an inflow of thousands if not millions of negative reviews from the RH app when RH prevented buying. Facebook has deleted groups talking about the stock and actually protected groups talking about the fake silver investment. Not that Apple is a saint but they actually allowed all the negative reviews and now \~1/3 of the RH reviews are 1/5 stars. 

I'm happy that when many brokers in the US shutdown buying the stock last week that people from Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia, etc. posted their portfolios--posted that they were here to support Americans and buy when we were prevented from buying. The media sells the ideas of republican vs democrat, gay vs. straight, Christian vs. Jew, native vs. foreigner, male vs. female, black vs. white. These are all to distract you from what the real battle has always been and always will be: the poor vs. the rich. Not the rich that may deserve to be rich--the rich that have made their money off scamming, stealing, and rigging a system that influences the entire planet.

We caught them with their pants down shorting a stock 140%. How do you sell 140% of something you don't even own? The media says the short squeeze is over. They said it was over a month ago on CNBC when Gamestop was worth $20 (a 100% increase in a week). Then they said it was over when it spiked up to $40. Again when it hit $150. Its not over. Its only just begun because there is no way for them to buy back 140% of a stock when we are proudly holding a decent percentage of it and refuse to sell. These Wallstreet firms will either change the rules of the game or go bankrupt. Either way stay tuned for more news when it spikes up again later this month."

Does it guarantee anything? No. Does it mean it's still incredibly likely that the squeeze will still happen and have insane repurcussions for lots of people/company's bank accounts and the global economy as long as retailers are willing to hold until the end of February? Yes.

TL;DR -  BB üöÄüöÄBlackberry has an architecturally secure embedded operating system compared to competitors, safety and security are important for electric vehicles, military use, and future IoT devices, I am holding 2000 shares of blackberry and suggest you buy to hold for longterm gains.  üöÄüöÄ

I'm a cybersecurity sector employee. I have previously brought you detailed analysis surrounding the capabilities of [Palantir](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l07ly5/dd_pltr_foundry_explanation_from_reformed_data/), [FireEye](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laki1v/feye_playing_tomorrows_fireeye_q4_earnings_based/) (check comments), and other cybersecurity vendors here in WSB. I have also written a [guide to understanding how propaganda and misinformation campaigns are being used to manipulate retail investors](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l928lr/obfuscation_misinformation_propaganda_and_gme/) and what you can do to help yourself.

Anyway, moving past establishing credibility, here is my analysis on why I am bullish about the security posture surrounding the Blackberry QNX operating system in comparison to other competitors in the embedded RTOS environment.

# What is RTOS

RTOS is Real-Time Operating System. Most operating systems do not need to perform tasks within predictable computation timeframes, as we tend not to notice any performance difference. This is why it takes either 7 minutes or 11 lifetimes to download Winrar. With an RTOS, the primary applications are time-sensitive or mission-critical operating systems. These include power plants, water treatment facilities, dams, vehicles, drones, and further applications. If your system does not operate in a predictable fashion within set timeframes and capacities, you cannot rely on it for ensuring your dam doesn't overflow, your autonomous vehicles does not crash, or your drone can stay afloat in the air.

# Start with Monolithic OS

Most RTOS are monolithic as far as their OS architecture goes. Generally, systems are built into Kernel and User land. A monolith tends to control all system management within Kernel-land with user applications running in Userland. The issue with this approach is reliability. Any individual failure can potentially crash the OS, which is an unacceptable condition for many of the above applications.

In addition, trying to modify the monolithic OS is difficult to do without a complete shutdown. Shutting down a drone or train mid-journey is not feasible. For cybersecurity purposes, the attack surface is enormous as any individual part of the system (including applications) can affect the reliability of the OS.

Good news is that they're more performant though!

# MicroKernel

QNX is a MicroKernel architecture. The MicroKernel only does process isolation / memory management / task switching. All other standard OS operations (file system, drivers, networking, etc) are performed in UserLand instead.

This architecture is useful because it means that:

* Individual component failures will not compromise the entire OS. So for drones, a bug in a camera application or in the network traffic will not affect the flight of the drone. This is pertinent in the context of power plants, dams, military equipment, and autonomous/electric vehicles.
* When a component fails, it is easy to detect the point of failure. Monolithic kernels are difficult to trace faults in, especially as services get coupled together.
* Live restoration, if a component fails it can be restored without taking the system offline.
* Isolation, processes do not share memory or processing space, preventing many classes of memory manipulation bugs / security flaws such as buffer overflows, use after free, etc.
* Systems can be built to scale or share workload across multiple Userland apps, potentially preventing the crash entirely at the cost of degraded performance.

So look, the architecture of the QNX system puts it in a great position compared to other monolithic kernels in the embedded OS space.

# Key QNX benefits

Memory Protection - Typically, an OS assigns a block of memory to a process for it to store either data or instructions. QNX assigns a process a block of virtual memory, that is then mapped to physical memory with spatial separation between each block. This means that you cannot reliably change the operation of the program or read the data effectively when given physical access. Sure, ASLR, Canaries, and the Guard space do exist in modern OS's, but in embedded space memory is much tighter so this is a key benefit!

CPU Scheduling - CPU's use a variety of scheduling algorithms to give processes different weights for execution. This can become problematic when critical processes end up being stalled because low priority processes are hogging CPU time due to bugs or manipulation (such as regex backtracking for validation). QNX uses adaptive partioning which basically enforces that each application is partitioned to have a predetermined set of resources such as memory, filespace, or cpu time. This makes it difficult to starve any particular critical process of resources.

Safety & Compliance - The OS has pre-configured designs ready for compliance with EC 61508 (industrial), IEC 61511, EN 50128 (rail), IEC 62304 (medical) or ISO 26262 (automotive) industry standards. These are rigorous engineering standards that are designed to enforce strict safety measures, monitoring for faults, and procedures for operating. Compliance with any of these is a long and arduous process, which BB has been working on for a long time. Other embedded system vendors have not met these standards yet, or have only chosen to focus on their key industries.

Security - Normal Standards like secure boot, integrity validation of all programs prior to execution, address space validation, application isolation and sandboxing, data and network and inter-process access control, and execution of everything from userland (no root) are all other benefits I don't have time to get too deep into.

# Some other pieces

[https://devblog.blackberry.com/en/2020/10/elementary-detecting-for-better-bug-hunting](https://devblog.blackberry.com/en/2020/10/elementary-detecting-for-better-bug-hunting)

This is a good blogpost that details how the microkernel is able to quickly identify deviations from the standard, apply logging, and pinpoint where to analyze further for performance or security remediation.

[https://devblog.blackberry.com/en/2020/04/securing-the-clipboard](https://devblog.blackberry.com/en/2020/04/securing-the-clipboard)

This was in response to an iOS update that showed when applications were accessing a users clipboard. Tiktok and facebook were accessing the clipboard p. much every second. Conspiracy theorists would say that Tiktok was harvesting user clipboard data hoping for PII or credentials. Regardless, BB was prepared for this attack vector already as demonstrated by this quick blog post as a response.

[https://devblog.blackberry.com/en/2019/10/https-versus-blackberry-spark-communication-service](https://devblog.blackberry.com/en/2019/10/https-versus-blackberry-spark-communication-service)

Building their own competitor to TLS, the standard for secure web communication. The web's based off of a Request/Response model, but BB allows for PubSub, Voice, and Video amongst other secure data transmission methods. Looking into their encryption algorithm support, Argon2 stands out as it is a relatively recent (with low uptake) hashing algorithm.

# Summary

Overall, hope this gives you some confidence that BB are market leaders in the embedded OS space, as the microkernel architecture does set them apart when compared to competitors in the business, and their existing big enterprise relationships and 100% certification and compliance to safety/security standards should get them into many new critical infrastructure, military, drone, and electric vehicle embedded systems.

Its quite simple. The HF's overplayed their hand, and they got caught.  So bad in fact, that they are DESPERATE to unwind their positions at any and all costs.    


There are 8 million people in this sub now.  Imagine if each one of us sent a complain to the SEC.  How on earth could they ignore us?  My opinion is that we have not done enough campaigning of our own to educate people about what is going on.  Of course all of WSB is familiar with the blatant manipulation, how about your FB friends? How about Twitter? Stocktwits? Other investing forums? That journalist you went to school with? We all have a voice and we NEED to use it.  

We are being owned in the media, and they are controlling OUR narrative.  All people are hearing is that a bunch of punks on WSB bought a bunch of shitty companies making the stock rise and they are all going to loose their money, cause another financial crash, and kill your 401k.  Is that what we did here? Or did we discovery that some HF's fucked up so badly due their ungodly greed that they themselves risked blowing up the ENTIRE financial institution (again) and are breaking every law conceivable trying to bail themselves out?  

That's the message that all 8 million of us should be spreading right now.  I full expect each and every one of you to write to the SEC about what is happening.  The HF's may have the money, but we have the voice!  


*""If you ever thought you were too small to make a difference, try going to sleep with a mosquito in the room""*  


TL/DR: Write to the SEC about what is going on.  Use your voice to set the narrative straight and do not give up the fight!  We should be controlling our narrative.  We do that, and its GME-OVER!"

We're in a war with the hedge funds and with wallstreet and basically the root of corruption in America with our GME short squeeze proxy war, and if you autists want to win this war, you need to know the enemy, and know yourself.Firstly, education is KEY, so if you're new, you DEFINITELY need to go learn at least what a short squeeze is and a short ladder attack is.

What the enemy is doing:

1. ***Price manipulation:*** With short ladder attacks, they use high frequency trading to make the price artificially lower.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4pji/gme\_volume\_still\_low\_with\_positive\_cmf\_which/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4pji/gme_volume_still_low_with_positive_cmf_which/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la5upr/dont\_panic\_and\_just\_look\_at\_the\_fucking\_volume/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la5upr/dont_panic_and_just_look_at_the_fucking_volume/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laak53/for\_those\_of\_you\_getting\_scared\_look\_at\_that\_tiny/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laak53/for_those_of_you_getting_scared_look_at_that_tiny/)This can be seen with sizeable price movements that have tiny amounts of volume. There are several reasons why they are doing this:
   1. Scare off paper hand bitches: They prey on people who jumped on GME without even knowing what a short squeeze is; they see price fall, they paper hands and they get out.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6vcb/wall\_street\_plan\_trying\_to\_psychologically\_scare/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6vcb/wall_street_plan_trying_to_psychologically_scare/)
   2. Make it cheaper for them to cover their more costly short positions.
   3. Price manipulation will fail ultimately because while they are able to drive prices lower with their short attacks, when they eventually have to cover their short positions and buy, they will again drive prices up due to purchases of almost none existing stock (cuz we be holding), sending prices up as high as before they shorted or even higher. All the while hedge funds will continue to eat fees and interest on their short positions, making this cycle not doable indefinitely.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7bhj/gme\_mms\_have\_until\_tomorrow\_22\_to\_buy\_shares\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7bhj/gme_mms_have_until_tomorrow_22_to_buy_shares_it/)
2. ***Media manipulation***
   1. Most if not all American main stream media is clearly serving corporate and wallstreet interests, simply by the false narratives they are reporting.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1022/hmmm/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1022/hmmm/)They are not to be trusted and if seen, can dishearten and shake the will of those who don't have diamond hands. Best to avoid if you are a paper handed bitch. Some examples of false narratives are:
      1. Reddit is made up of alt-rights, or idiots, or gamblers, etc. -> We're not idiots, because we're the ones who were able to grab wallstreet by the nutsack. We're retards and autists who love the stock and the company. That is all.
      2. Reddit is moving on to silver. -> SILVER CANNOT BE SQUEEZED!!!!! With a market cap of more than $1.5 Trillion, there is NO WAY for retail investors to be able to make a dent in that. The only possible short squeeze play is GME because it's a small cap company with a market cap of only $250 million as of July 2020, so it is definitely doable for a bunch of retards on WSB to affect the price of a small cap company stock. Literally all the posts on reddit promoting SLVR are from bot accounts that have sus creation dates and karma and post counts. Plus, Citadel owns a giant amount of silver so silver prices going up higher is gonna benefit them and give them more fuel to fight this GME war. You're shooting yourself int eh foot if you buy SLVR.

      3. ""XXX IS THE NEXT GME"" -> This is also a false narrative. NOTHING can be the next GME, because NOTHING is shorted as much as GME, which is STILL over 100% shorted. GME IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY GAIN FOR US, AND LOSS FOR THEM!
      4. Shorts have covered their position. -> Another false narrative. Short interest is still over at 100%, and there are multiple WSB posts that explain this. Another metric that correlates to short interest is cost of borrowing for opening short positions, which would increase if it is harder to find shares to short.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7d94/no\_more\_shares\_to\_short/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7d94/no_more_shares_to_short/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laaai8/gme\_short\_interest\_is\_currently\_sitting\_at\_12297/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laaai8/gme_short_interest_is_currently_sitting_at_12297/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5d6sk/gme\_short\_interest\_increased\_to\_7141m\_after\_jan/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5d6sk/gme_short_interest_increased_to_7141m_after_jan/)
3. ***Breaking the law:*** Some if not all of the things posted above are pretty much border line illegal, but there has been clear signs of breaking the law and market manipulation, IE: freeze buying of select stocks and only allow for selling. They can spin it however they want, but as far as I know, it has been unprecedented for a majority of brokerages to simultaneously alter the way a stock can be traded with cash. And if the situation is desparate enough, they'll break the law again and again if it ends up costing them less than to just let the price get to $69.420. Expect them to fight dirty until the bitter end.
4. ***Social Media Manipulation:*** Hedge Funds now employ bots to spread doubt and misinformation in order to weaken your hands. Some places they target is WSB itself, other stock trading subreddits, facebook, and on sites / apps like Webull and Yahoo Finance. Don't believe in random comments. Always believe in WSB posts with huge amounts of likes (top posts are vetted by the 8 mil users here / by mods too to make sure they're factual)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lafh4d/in\_case\_you\_needed\_proof\_that\_there\_are\_imposters/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lafh4d/in_case_you_needed_proof_that_there_are_imposters/)
5. ***Their Current Strategy:*** Wallstreet calls us ""dumb money"", because they think we are unsophisticated and just chase after a quick buck, and we have short attention spans. They'll try and continue to manipulate the price so that the stock will trade sideways, or continuous short ladder attacks, trying to scare paper hands into selling, and bore diamond hands into selling as well. They will also try to tempt us with other ""NEXT GME"" type plays and may even artificially raise prices of a stock or two (IE: SILVER) to try and get people to hop off the GME rocket. They'll use media to continue to push narratives that the GME short squeeze is over, short positions are covered, and redditors have moved onto something else. If this fails, then they may simulate a ""SQUEEZE"" by suddenly letting the price go up to $700 or $800, then unleash a short ladder attack unlike which we have ever seen, to simulate the sell off, so idiot retards will be scared into thinking they missed the top, so they will all sell. But if people just look at the volume, they'll know it's all a ruse.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What we're doing, our advantage, and why the enemy can't win.

1. ***This is a movement:*** This has become more than a few people of a subreddit trying to make a quickbuck off of a short squeeze. This has become a movement that represents the struggle between the corruption of wallstreet and the 1% vs the 99%, the common people. News agencies from all over the globe are reporting on this and have their eyes on this. We have ape brothers and sisters all over the world buying and holding this stock together. We even have a few outspoken whales on our side as well, as well as politicians from both sides of the spectrum speaking out for our side as well. We have billboards being bought all over the country, airplanes flying banners about GME. A global movement will crush any hedge fund.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5mt6n/gme\_short\_squeeze\_the\_whales\_have\_arrived/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5mt6n/gme_short_squeeze_the_whales_have_arrived/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9qtey/kjetill\_stjerne\_is\_da\_real\_mvp\_he\_his\_friends\_are/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9qtey/kjetill_stjerne_is_da_real_mvp_he_his_friends_are/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rf4k/times\_square\_right\_now/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rf4k/times_square_right_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
2. ***We are holding, and we're continuing to buy:*** We are getting smarter, tougher, and slowly but surely paper hands are turning into diamond hands. We managed to hold during the short attack to \~$110 on Thursday, and that was when they froze our ability to buy across many brokerages. They will never have another chance to do this again now with everyone watching. The volume trading these days is getting smaller and smaller. Any price decrease is strictly from short ladder attacks, and not us selling, due to tiny tiny volumes. Also, we are continuing to buy calls on GME to increase upward pressure. No one here has stopped buying. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labvei/volume\_is\_low\_dont\_believe\_the\_news\_no\_one\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labvei/volume_is_low_dont_believe_the_news_no_one_is/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l83ctf/the\_volume\_of\_gme\_has\_plummeted\_the\_past\_few\_days/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l83ctf/the_volume_of_gme_has_plummeted_the_past_few_days/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lagd2m/millions\_in\_gme\_calls\_bought\_today\_at\_800\_hold/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lagd2m/millions_in_gme_calls_bought_today_at_800_hold/)
3. ***Nuclear Bomb still undetonated***\*:\* Short Squeeze still coming, it hasn't happened yet. We know this because the volume of shares bought is not nearly enough to show the shorts have bought enough to be covered.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1q9hy/l2\_nyse\_quotes\_for\_gme\_volume\_the\_squeeze\_hasnt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1q9hy/l2_nyse_quotes_for_gme_volume_the_squeeze_hasnt/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l66kcl/gme\_volume\_is\_low\_shorts\_arent\_covering\_hold/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l66kcl/gme_volume_is_low_shorts_arent_covering_hold/)
4. ***Enemy loses money everyday, we don't:*** It costs the hedge funds billions to continue to fight this war of attrition becauase they continue to eat insanely high fees and interest on their short positions because the cost of borrowing remains high because the short interest are remaining high. Melvin down over 50% just this month alone. You think they can hold on much longer and keep eating fees?[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labq1a/this\_is\_so\_satisfying\_to\_look\_at/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labq1a/this_is_so_satisfying_to_look_at/)Meanwhile we don't have to pay anything for holding our stocks. We can literally just hold and not have a short squeeze and just from the cost of borrowing alone the hedge funds will run out of money, so that's why there will come a time where it's cheaper for them to cover their positions rather than just keep on bleeding until they die out. I don't think they can hold out for another month of trading sideways with no progress. I believe in Feb we will see some major action. It could even start as early as tomorrow, because that's the last day shorts have to cover their 1/29 puts that expired.
5. ***We're not breaking the laws, they are:*** Recent rumor mills are saying that there are a lot of [counterfit stocks](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) circulating and the hedge funds and clearing houses are all in on it, and once they need to start to find shares to buy to cover their short positions, things are going to explode in a way that is unprecedented. Basically by taking advantage of a situation wallstreet has set up (insane short interest set up for short squeeze) we may have uncovered one of the biggest financial crimes in the history of the stock market. You bet that the government and SEC will be involved soon if this is true, and things will explode to the stratosphere. Read the following and ponder yourself, I'm not a financial advisor, just a dumb ape.

6. ***We're getting smarter:*** Everyday we get new DD on WSB and more and more people are reading these DD's and understand how to diamond hands, and can now filter out fake news from mainstream media. We've just hit 8 mil subs; our subs are going exponential. We've recovered from the RH fiasco and we're primed and loaded on other brokerages like Fidelity. We are more ready than EVER to continue this war and this fight.
7. ***An Ape's Move this week:*** Again, not financial advice, but hypothetically if there was an autistic ape, the autistic ape would buy the dips, ESPECIALLY at this insane discount price of around $100. The autistic ape knows that basically it is paying $100 for a ticket to ride the GME train past $1k, easily 10x their bananas. Those apes who bought in at $300 will only get to 3x their bananas at the end of the month. The autistic apes will also understand that this is not a 1 day thing, but the events leading up to the squeeze can take weeks. But the autistic ape will ask itself, is it willing to wait a few weeks to at least 3x their bananas? Most apes will answer yes. But the ape knows if they buy it, they should be prepared to see red in their banana tracker for a month. But those red number are just fake numbers generated by HFT short ladder attacks, and not due to other apes actually selling their bananas, because apes together STRONK.

We have been absolutely destroyed lately by the media and their wet dreams of a Silver squeeze taking place. Something that we have repeatedly said, is not happening. We need to combat these disgusting pricks (i.e. Wall St. and the Media). These pricks have been forcing misinformation down our throats for the past week and I cannot sit by and listen to their bullshit anymore. We must start on our campaign but instead of a misinformation campaign, it must be an informational campaign. The people buying billboards and even planes need to focus some of their capital towards Instagram and FaceBook ads that show that we haven't quit on GME and AMC. We must shove anti silver information down the throats of all the smooth brained idiots buying silver and we must shove the FACT that the shorts have NOT been covered down the throats of anybody who sees these advertisements. I implore anybody with spare capital to purchase social media ads to encourage this so we can fight back against the bullshit media and genuinely EVIL tactics being used by Wall St. I will be buying multiple social media ads and I encourage you all to do the same.

Do you realize reddit has a search function? Here is a list of posts that talk about a potential silver squeeze of SLV and JPM long, long, long before GME blasted off towards the moon. This is /r/wallstreetbets, not /r/GME. We trade multiple tickers, you dumbshit fucking ""entry at $450"" bag holding tards.

Great, you joined in the last 2 weeks because your autistic nephew made more money in 2 months than you've ever done.

Instead of just shutting up and watching the plethora of good DD posts rise and fall, you think this entire subreddit is only about holding one frickin' short squeeze as if that's the first time in history anyone got squoze, and downvote otherwise great research because you're frickin' terrified of losing money you couldn't afford to lose in the first place.

The entire global media didn't all pool together in 48 hours to present a uniform story of ""buy silver"" as part of some frickin' conspiracy designed to save a few medium-sized American hedge funds. No more than COVID was made by the Chinese to win Biden the presidency, anyway.

So here, since you guys are too damn handicapped to use a fucking search engine, are a list of DD/YOLO/Discussion posts about SLV and Silver written LONG BEFORE THE FUCKING GME SHORT SQUEEZE FINALLY ROCKETED!!! Jesus fuck, you tinfoil wearing sack of ""fake news"" American mouth-breathers with the collective IQ of a doorknob.

Just look at the fucking DD and pretend GME doesn't exist for 5 minutes. Silver. Is. A. Deep. Fucking. Value. Play! It has value. So much fucking deep value! 

Yeah, no shit a market maker is holding silver positions when silver becomes more sought after, their job is to make fucking markets liquid. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SUPPLY LIQUIDITY IF YOU DON'T HAVE SHIT TO SUPPLY?! DID YOU NOTICE HOW THEY HAVE A LOT OF PUTS AND A LOT OF CALLS, AND NOT JUST CALLS?!

DO YOU THINK NO BILLIONAIRES HELPED RIDE GME UP? Do you think it was 100% retail on one side and 100% Melvin and Citron on the other? Ah, you do. Of course, you do.  


GREAT, WE GOT 8 MILLION DEGENERATES HERE. The 6M that didn't manage to find this place without hearing about GME having rocketed already, MAYBE DON'T FUCKING POST, COMMENT AND BRING YOUR DAMN IGNORANCE INTO A SUB THAT WAS ACTUALLY PROVIDING 2-10 DECENT TRADE IDEAS PER WEEK PRIOR TO THIS CULT FUCKING INFESTATION OF JACKASSES COSPLAYING RETARDS.

Whatever, here's a list none of you fuckers are capable of reading:

\- 5 months ago, /u/negovany wrote ""[Cornering Silver Market](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/idjk61/cornering_silver_market/)"". The whole thing is about JPM and squeezing silver. $GME was at $5 back then and /u/DeepFuckingValue was still getting laughed at for buying at every opportunity. Rest of you fuckers had barely gotten over the last cult following, PRPL mattresses.  
\- 6 months ago, /u/lucasandrew talks about ""[Why you should trade futures - WSB Edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i3qkex/why_you_should_trade_futures_wsb_edition/)"", in which he mentions ""*Speaking of SLV, people have been posting all the reasons that JPM fucks with the SLV ETF*"". Yeah, I bet he took a fucking time-machine back 6 months in time after Citadel got stuck in the boo-boo. 

\- 6 months ago, /u/LE0TARD0 implores the ""[SILVER CHAD'S RISE UP!](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hy7nvn/silver_chads_rise_up/)"". A straight fundamental thread on why silver is undervalued, not mention JPM. However, in the comments, a thread is started by /u/kbtech18 and supplemented by /u/ayyayyron talking about precisely JPM and their price manipulation of silver. YEAH, NO THAT NEVER HAPPENED, I'M SORRY FOR BEING A SHILL, LIKE FUCKING TAKE YOUR TINFOIL HATS OFF YOU DUMB SHITS!

\- 5 months ago, /u/Fuzzers wrote ""[September Silver Futures Contact - Something Aint Right Kids](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9b1th/september_silver_futures_contact_something_aint/)"".  
After hailing his fellow degenerates, HE IMMEDIATELY SAYS: ""*I know there has been 6 billion posts about silver,""* before later writing ""*A large amount of contracts will stand for delivery such as in July. If its enough, maybe some of the big banks who have short positions might find themselves in hot water with their silver delivery amounts."".* Isn't IT JUST GLORIOUS HOW MELVIN AND CITADEL HAVE ALL THESE TIME MACHINES TO MAKE UP IMAGINARY SILVER SQUEEZES 6 MONTHS BEFORE THEY WERE MADE UP? YOU GUYS ARE SO FUCKING DUMB RIGHT NOW, HOLY FUCK! DON'T INVEST IN SILVER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO, BUT PLEASE STOP WITH THE AMERICAN FAKE NEWS CONSPIRACY THEORIES, IT HURTS MY ALREADY FUCKED UP BRAIN, STOP, I DON'T CONSENT!

\- 5 months ago (YOU GUYS, MAYBE YOU ARE RIGHT, ALL THE POSTS ARE FROM 5-6 MONTHS AGO, MAYBE IT REALLY IS A TIME TRAVELLING CONSPIRACY BY MELVIN AND CITADEL, YES, LET'S GO WITH THAT!), /u/jetter23, wrote ""[Weekend Update - Silver](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i6l0o2/weekend_update_silver/)"". What did he have to share, in terms of ideas and DD? "" *4a) Banks will continue to fight us on silver, but they are losing as they were massively short,*  "". WHAT SNEAKY FRICKIN' MARKET MANIPULATING HEDGE FUND SHILL HE IS, JUST GOING BACK SO FAR IN TIME TO SET US UP FOR THE PERFECT TRAP TO HELP CITADEL!!!

\- /u/jetter23 was quite active shilling 5 months ago, he also wrote ""[Weekend Update - Silver (DD#3)](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9uxok/weekend_update_silver_dd3/)"", where he just casually mentioned ""*JPM is currently under DOJ investigation AGAIN for price speculation on Silver. JPM is learning a VERY expensive lesson that when there is a pandemic, global FIAT currencies are crashing(like the DXY), and there is a run on physical metals - you can't be naked short on paper.""* IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE'S TALKING ABOUT SOME SORT OF SILVER SHORT SQUEEZE ON JPM, BUT HEY, THAT CAN'T BE IT BECAUSE THAT'S JUST A SCAM FAKE NEWS IDEA THAT'S 2-3 DAYS OLD, RIGHT? 

\- /u/CCJ_Moon_6969 popped his head into the stream of tachyons, relatively talking to us from the present all the way 6 months ago, when he wrote ""[Silver. $SLV call options. New York Comex.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hy8wv9/silver_slv_call_options_new_york_comex/)"". Do you remember /u/kbtech18 from a few threads up? WELL, GEE WHIZ, HE COVERED THAT TIME STREAM TOO, talking about JPM and silver. 6 months ago. I mean, today. Reddit probably changed the timestamps on the posts. DAMN SHILLS!  
\- /u/rawvi wrote ""[JPM and Silver](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i88cyy/jpm_and_silver/)"" 5 months ago, wanting to learn more about... time travel. Nothing to do with naked shorting of silver. BECAUSE THAT WASN'T EVER TALKED ABOUT ON THIS UNTIL 2 DAYS AGO, SO LIKE... HAH, HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN ASKING ABOUT THAT, RIGHT?!?! CORPORATE SHILL BOT LOLOLOL!

WE LIKE THE STOCK!!!

**Before you downvote, listen to my thought process**

""At 3 a.m. on Thursday, Tenev said that Robinhood's operations team was sent a file by the clearinghouse that handles all stock trades - the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) - requesting a security deposit of $3 billion."" - Vlad  
**(Could be true or not, ill give it the benefit of the doubt)**

Chamath didnt give RH the benefit of the doubt and went straight on media to blast the company to get retailers on his side.

Why would he do that?  
1-**He is also running for Gov of CA so he needs the attention of the people.**

Having retail on his side makes it much easier for him to win.

**2- chamath shills sofi (IPOE SPAC ) which also sells order flow.**

**chamath says Robinhood is bad because it sells order flow data**  
**""** Facebook and Robinhood App

On SoFi's website, they claim this is in the ""best interest of consumers"" because it allows commission free trading. Huh! **Notice their execution partner is the clearinghouse Apex, which also restricted GME and AMC trades like RH. But it goes farther! (Cant post link, check on sofi website)**

**Tldr: This might be another case of a billionaire taking advantage of retail.**"

The Article, Copy/Pasta:

 GRAPEVINE, Texas, Jan. 28, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GameStop proudly announced today that it has received a perfect score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation‚Äôs 2021 Corporate Equality Index, the nation‚Äôs foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ workplace equality. This marks the eighth consecutive year that GameStop has earned top marks in the annual workplace campaign.  


‚ÄúReceiving this award and designation as a *Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality* is an honor for GameStop,‚Äù says George Sherman, chief executive officer for GameStop. ‚ÄúOur values compel us to be the voice, commit to inclusion, and personify respect. At GameStop, we act on this through championing causes for the LGBTQ community, and all those committed to improving and protecting the rights of every human.‚Äù

‚ÄúFrom the previously unimaginable impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, to a long overdue reckoning with racial injustice, 2020 was an unprecedented year. Yet, many businesses across the nation stepped up and continued to prioritize and champion LGBTQ equality,‚Äù said Alphonso David, Human Rights Campaign President. ‚ÄúThis year has shown us that tools like the CEI are crucial in the work to increase equity and inclusion in the workplace, but also that companies must breathe life into these policies and practices in real and tangible ways. Thank you to the companies that understand protecting their LGBTQ employees and consumers from discrimination is not just the right thing to do‚Äîbut the best business decision.‚Äù

The results of the 2021 CEI showcase how 1,142 U.S.-based companies are not only promoting LGBTQ-friendly workplace policies in the U.S., but also for the 57% of CEI-rated companies with global operations who are helping advance the cause of LGBTQ inclusion in workplaces abroad. GameStop‚Äôs efforts in satisfying all of the CEI‚Äôs criteria earned a 100 percent ranking and the designation as one of the *Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality*.

The CEI rates employers providing these crucial protections to over 18 million U.S. workers and an additional 17 million abroad. Companies rated in the CEI include Fortune magazine‚Äôs 500 largest publicly traded businesses, American Lawyer magazine‚Äôs top 200 revenue-grossing law firms (AmLaw 200), and hundreds of publicly and privately held mid- to large-sized businesses.

The CEI rates companies on detailed criteria falling under four central pillars:

* Non-discrimination policies across business entities
* Equitable benefits for LGBTQ workers and their families
* Supporting an inclusive culture
* Corporate social responsibility

It goes through immediately with no fees. For example, I sent it to my husband. Then it gets auto deposited into our bank for immediate use. No needing to wait days for them to transfer it to your bank. 

I can then use the funds to purchase stock WeBull or another platform. Obviously, you have to sell stock to access your capital.

You can check how much cash you have accessible by clicking on transfers and scrolling down to ‚Äúwithdrawable cash.‚Äù This is not financial advice. I‚Äôm just an idiot who knows how to pull out.

**There‚Äôs also an account number and routing number on RH. Even if you don‚Äôt have a card, this may be a means to transfer.**

Edit: Reminding you that selling is a taxable event, transferring brokerages generally is not but takes longer. It‚Äôs important to leave enough capital so that once your transactions are ‚Äúsettled‚Äù everyone gets what they‚Äôre due. This is merely a suggestion from a moron in direct response to those looking to liquidate other stock and buy more on platform that allows unlimited buys."

While this short-squeeze has been going on, and the sell off that just happened, a lot of good stocks has gone down, including Apple and Facebook after great earnings numbers. Even tho Tesla missed earnings expectations, Tesla is still a great investment. 

What‚Äôs interesting is that if anyone has watched Keith Gill (u/DeepFuckingValue ) YouTube videos (Roaring Kitty) he invested into GameStop because he states that he‚Äôs a value investor. (7/27/20 and 8/04/20)  
Keith Gill took the time and educated himself on GameStop‚Äôs position. 
Keith saw that GameStop was highly undervalued. He saw that they have more cash on the balance sheet and that the market cap was less than the amount of cash on the balance sheet. 
Keith researched about consumers spending habits on physical vs digital consoles and games. Also on physical games vs physical movies and physical music copies. 
Keith saw that GameStop has potential to make a lot of money on the new Xbox and PlayStation consoles.

Make a sexy and ‚Äúgamified‚Äù stock trading interface and market it to the masses, then use the data to make better trades.  

But somehow I think this beast has gotten away from them.  Suddenly the masses are more interested than ever in the stock market.  They are sharing their ideas and experiences in an open forum and finding out that they are actually in agreement on what stocks to buy.

Here is the problem; hedge funds pay billions of dollars for our data to companies like Robinhood, Facebook, and Mastercard.  They spend billions more on algorithms and the fastest systems just to make trades on companies that WE ARE SUPPORTING.  What value is any of that if you already bought a share of MCD on Robinhood before you even paid for your cheeseburger?  We can suddenly beat them at their own game.

I think the next logical step in this progression is that Robinhood goes down hard, Robinhood users get settlement cuts of a few hundred dollars, and we feel like we really stuck it to the man, but did we?

Robinhood is the best weapon we have right now to arm the lower class with the same weapons as these hedge funds, and they are more than happy to nuke it before we realize.  Sure most out there will move over to other brokers but let‚Äôs face it, other brokers like TD and Fidelity are intimidating to begin trading on, and won‚Äôt encourage the everyday masses to learn more about money.

So feel free to take your money elsewhere and by all means make Vlad and those rich assholes at the top of Robinhood pay.  But ask yourself why Ted Cruz agrees with AOC on going after Robinhood, because he sure as hell doesn‚Äôt care about retail traders.

The very value of everything is being rocked to its core right now.  Hell a currency with a literal endless supply shot up 1000%.  If everyone in our society can make a living swiping their phones all day, maybe Wal-Mart has to pay their employees a bit more or improve their working conditions. 

Anyway I just wanted to get these thoughts out there and say be careful where we take this."

I wrote an article 2 months ago about why WSB was running the equity markets. I explained how the rise of passive investing (ala Mike Green's thesis) was making it so that the marginal mover of capital was entirely passive, and this is leading to a war between retail (WSB) and hedge funds for the valuation of markets and basically the winner gets to lead the sheep (the passive money). It explains the massive run-up of Tesla/Nio and the endless bids from the likes of vanguard funds once they reach certain market cap hurdles. I won't go into this in depth. Those who wish to find out more should read my previous post and go look up Mike Green from Logica. 

I won't go into details on the gamma convexity squeeze dynamics, and how it is enhancing a lot of momentum and creating feedback loops, for those who want to read more, I would recommend Chris Cole of Artemis capital to talked about this dynamic in the podcast **End Game** with Grant William.

This time around, I will talk about two misconceptions of the market surrounding GME. I will talk about why attacking hedge funds like they are part of the establishment is also pretty misguided. And I will will go over my thoughts on what will happen next.  

**GME Misconceptions**

The two misconceptions on GME have to do with manipulation of GME shares by the brokers and that they are having to do this because the short sellers are trapped in an infinite money black hole. The problem with this narrative is that it ignores some fundamental understanding about how buying shares work. The prevention of GME buying really has nothing to do with market manipulation in collusion with Citadel or Melvin or any market makers. The fact is that the market makers are running trillion dollar flow books and couldn't care less, and Robinhood is not a broker for any hedge funds. The real reason is that some of these smaller brokers don't have enough working capital to fund the required collateral by clearing houses (which was raised on them over the past few days), this is why the largest guys like Fidelity didn't have that issues. Which is why many brokers are drawing down their banking lines (such as Robinhood drawing down $1 billion from banks). Once they bring on enough liquidity, they will enable them again, but until then, we still live in a T+2 settlement world in which brokers have working capital needs. The implementation was retarded, but the brokers basically panicked when they saw their working capital deplete rapidly.

The other misconception has to do with WSB finding in infinite money wormhole. Trust me, I was there when a relative value Fund I interned at in 2009 basically went bust when a short selling ban was implemented. I was there when the Italian banks were on the verge of collapse, sitting on my 10x delta puts with a seven figure paper profit as a 26 year old when Draghi announced LTRO and blew my portfolio up. There are a lot of things that would stop the infinitely money machine, especially if you have been around long enough and have seen all the games being played. One such way is that management can simply issues new shares (likely through a privately placement deal with the short seller consortium), and the likelihood goes up the more the price goes up. Another way is that the SEC could step in and put a short term trading halt while forcing the short sellers into a deal with mgt. 

**Misplaced Hatred of Hedge Funds**

If one looks around the financial landscape today, Hedge funds are actually a dying breed. The young put about 80% of their capital to work in passive while the boomers that are exiting have historically placed about 80% of their capital to work in active funds. As a result, since about  2008, active managers such as mutual funds and hedge funds had actually been dying, even though they played almost no role during the 2008 GFC. If anything, many hedge funds identified problems in the system way earlier and most of the people in the big short were successful hedge fund managers. The problem was that the rise in passive and the fed had manipulated price signals so much so that one cannot actually make money arbitraging value (long undervalued, short overvalued) in a world less and less flow cares about value. 

The narrative being promoted by those who do not understand markets is that these evil hedge funds were shorting stocks, bankrupting companies and forcing layoffs. This could not be further from the truth. The value of a share in a secondary market has no impact on the day to day business of a company. A company could trade at 0 value, but if it generates healthy profits and has a strong balance sheet, it will keep going, hiring people and expanding. The truth is that these ""evil"" hedge funds were managing long short books. They were owning things like Facebook, Apple or it could be distressed debt they thought were undervalued, they were hedging their long book with things they think could go bust in the event of an economic downturn/crisis. 

**What Happens Next**

The effects of the GME short squeeze should not be underestimated, not because of the money lost by shorts on its position of somewhere around $20 billion (that's peanuts in financial markets terms). The full ramification is actually on the long side, from hedge funds who no longer feel like they can hedge out their downside by shorting fundamental unsound companies. I would not be surprised if the action in the markets in the past several days is just the beginning of large unwind because hedge funds will have to now reduce their risk position in their longs, the ramification of which will be in the hundreds of billions to trillions. It could very well be that this de-risking by active managers will lead to the start of a larger correction in the broader market. And as we have seen during the March selloff, without active managers who have cash on their books, who are the buyer of last resort, but instead passive flow, who actually tend to go bid-less in a market crash, we could see increasing volatility the likes we have never seen before. 

If the market does crash, congress may blame this on ""reckless speculators"" and ban option trading for those under certain income/networth thresholds. just as hedge funds are being scapegoated for 2008 despite being innocent, retail may be scapegoated for the next crash despite the real driver of volatility being the rise of passive money. The lack of retail participation in options may mean that he gamma squeeze dynamics will end. 

I have taken off most of my long positions and am sitting on cash and reloading VIX calls and some weekly ATM SPX puts.  Congraduations, you autists have beaten hedge funds (who are more like whales being hunted to extinction than fierce sharks) in the first major battle, but have set yourself to lose one of your most important tools (gamma squeeze). I would suggest taking out your gains and buying downside protection, maybe you'll gamma squeeze the market into a 50% correction and turn yourself into a high-net-worth (HNW) so you can bypass any future retail restrictions."

I'm just sharing random thoughts for entertainment purposes only. 

**This upcoming week is the opportunity of a century.**   
**What you do is up to you, but this is how I see things.** 

**First, an overview of what happened last week:**  
\-There was an immense wealth transfer of billions of dollars from HF's like Melvin to the retail investor.  
\-Citron announced that they will no longer enter massive short positions.    
\-Robinhood expands trade restrictions on more stocks, and then retracts them on positions like AMD, AAL and BBBY (no more limits!), and relaxing the share/call restrictions on NOK.  
\-Cramer said last Friday that GME holders ""already won,"" that they must take profits, or otherwise risk ""immense pain"".   
\-CNBC spent all day talking about how risky GME is at this point for the retail investor.   
\-Friday was the lowest day for the market since October 2020.   
\-CNBC also bought ""paid promotions"" on Twitter and FB linking news that Melvin closed all their GME positions. 

Guys, I've worked in the Hollywood TV Industry as a development executive. I know firsthand how the media manipulates the masses. If it's not damn clear by now, we're being manipulated in a textbook fashion so that we sell our positions in ""the stocks we like"". Why? Maybe because Melvin still has short positions. They're a bunch of smart, manipulative bastards. **Except, the bigs f\*d up their media manipulation strategy (or couldn't execute properly due to the overall pandemonium), and I foresee even greater losses for them. Here's why:**

**1) Don't Think of Elephants**

Quoting JGL's character in *Inception*, what happens when someone tells you to not think of elephants? You think of elephants. 

Robinhood essentially outlined which stocks we need to buy by telling us not to buy them. Also, they actually made each of the ""do-not-buy a lot"" stocks more valuable by lowering the supply without lowering the consumer demand.

Actually, how they SHOULD'VE played this was by temporarily adding fees to those specific stocks. This strategy worked for California groceries. Once groceries started charging for plastic bags, people brought their own from home, which stopped excessive use of environmentally hazardous single-use plastic bags. You might think I opened pandora's box on a really good idea. Not really. It's too late. If Robinhood does add fees back, we will migrate to Fidelity, Ameritrade or E\*Trade, if not now, then later. Robinhood's fee structure and profitability is not our problem. They already tarnished their brand. It's too late to add fees now, because it will be ""on top of"" all the bs they did last week. They needed to choose the ""less bad"" decision and picked the worse one. 

**2) Fear, Uncertainty, Destruction (FUD)**

So, in tandem with the brokerages, CNBC and other mainstream news outlets tried to lower the demand on GME, AMC, NOK, BB, etc. by spreading fear that ""retail investors will be in for some real pain"". Do we believe what they're saying? Nope. Why waste precious airtime for the entire day, discouraging retail investors from buying more of the underlying? Because Melvin and other Hf's still have open short positions. Thursday's GME low was $112. If they couldn't buy to close then, they surely didn't do that on Friday. 

**3) Opportunities**

a. **Black Friday of the Century**  
Hold your stonks. Hold your leaps. There's gonna be an immense, pent-up demand and a surge in prices for each of the stocks outlined in Robinhood. They gave us a cheat sheet for what stocks to buy and hold for the immense price hike to come. If you already bought GME and the others, this is like owning a PS5 before everyone got them. Hold, because the prices are gonna be insane. 

b. **Retail Arbitrage of the Century**  
If you didn't already, open up new accounts on E\*trade or Ameritrade, Buy those ""do not buy a lot of"" stocks you can't get on Robinhood. It will be the price arbitrage of the century once Robinhood is forced to lift restrictions on those stocks. Not gonna say more.

TL;DR - There's obvious manipulation by the brokerages and media. Melvin is not in the clear. We must buy and hold, and take advantage of the immense demand surge that'll happen due to the brokerage's desperate, last minute reactive measure. Media manipulation only hints further that GME and other stonks are far from ""done""."

Some of you know I‚Äôm a big BB bull on $BB 

I love the stock, I love the company, I love John Chen, but it‚Äôs finally clear why BB has been moving the way it has, in tandem with GME 

Prem Watsa is a huge BB investor and owns a large stake 

Guess who Watsa has beef with? Steve Cohen, the guy supporting Melvin in GME, the final boss so to speak of Point72 with deep ties to Citadel  

[Watsa vs Cohen beef](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.theglobeandmail.com/amp/globe-investor/fairfax-e-mails-come-back-to-haunt-a-wall-street-titan/article571008/)

These are billionaires in financial warfare, with Cohen‚Äôs group having TONS more capital, political leverage, and media influence than Watsa‚Äôs measly long side

Steve Cohen‚Äôs tried to kill Watsa‚Äôs Fairfax fund. In turn killing Blackberry. Everyone always thought that Facebook had a hand in suppressing BB stock, turns out it was always Cohen‚Äôs group that were the hostile players with MASSIVE capital that have been punishing BlackBerry for years.

It‚Äôs obvious now why BB SP has been so low in the market. It‚Äôs because Steve Cohen has tried to squash it due to his beef with Watsa. Same thing they‚Äôve been doing with GameStop, but BlackBerry is more personal for Cohen 

Don‚Äôt believe me? Look at the daily chart for GME and BB 

GME had its first squeeze on Jan 13th, from $20 to $40. 100% gain. This was an astronomical loss for Melvin, who is backed by Cohen 

Guess when Blackberry began its epic run? Check the chart... Jan 14th, MASSIVE green candle 

December 22nd, random and short BB surge out of nowhere, was so random it shocked me as I thought it might even halt for news. The move faded. 

Check GME chart December 22nd, same day GME posted its first big power move from $16 to almost $20. Again Cohen group taking the edge of BB and moving it to GME. Clear as day now. 

This BB surge is Cohen‚Äôs group backing off their BB short, pushing the price up, and shoring up enough funds to move to GME which was hemorrhaging HUGE outflows. Retail and momentum exasperated this move in BB

This is so God damn obvious now in hindsight. This is why BB has been moving in tandem with GME 

This movement is not organic, has nothing to do with fundamentals, or even Blackberry itself!

This is a war between Cohen (Point72, Citadel, Melvin) and anonymous long hedge funds + retail. These anonymous long hedge funds are either using retail or are siding with retail. In the end, funds don‚Äôt give a shit about anything besides profit. So be careful, they don‚Äôt care about sending any message

Investing in BB right now is investing in Cohen losing his shirt in GME

I know I‚Äôll get hated for this but it‚Äôs true and needs to be said 

CONSIDER: 

1) Deleverage, get off margin, don‚Äôt YOLO
2) Hedge with puts 
3) Scale some out 

You‚Äôre investing in between a financial tug of war that runs deep and is directly tied to the outcome of GME. You are not investing in fundamentals of BlackBerry right now! If Cohen uses political leverage which it looks like he has already, stabilizes his position in GME, he will go on the offensive and come back for blood in BB. Just be careful. This is crazy stuff.

Edit: LOL this place has gone wild and become an echo chamber. Fuck it, I hope Cohen gets destroyed and jailed, TO THE FUCKING MOON BOYS!!!! üöÄ üåô"

In the interest of consistency, and because everybody needs to be chipping in right now, here‚Äôs the scans that caught my eye today heading into next week. Mondays are my best days so Ill have way more then, EOD.

üê≥üßê**Overall, whales kept betting on tech to bounce back heavily**, in convincing style (signals that indicated the call blocks were more than just hedging). Image links are call blocks from each. **Intitial research is often with barchart, but I always check for confirmation with Unusual Whales**

[FB](https://i.imgur.com/A0R2dz2.jpg) üöÄüöÄüöÄ: until the bitter end today, people were feverishly pumping call blocks with puts aligning them. If tech bounces back, FB in particular is due for a rip after correcting post-earnings

[Unusual whales confirmation: look at this March call order](https://i.imgur.com/nQ6WcFN.jpg)

[SQ](https://i.imgur.com/40VDFnM.jpg) üöÄüöÄ: consistent bullish call volume all week. People thought they fished the bottom yesterday but got curbed by the blood red index day

[Unusual Whales research confirmation: strong 2/5 call block ](https://i.imgur.com/H7onSWz.jpg)

[DKNG](https://i.imgur.com/wapFAGh.jpg) üöÄüöÄ: lots of sporadic call clusters like this. PENN gets most of the glory, but there are a lot of catalysts coming around state regulations soon. Load up some 2/26 and wait for the pop

[Unusual Whales research confirmation: repeated weeklies each week, such as this. ](https://i.imgur.com/imHvK1O.jpg)

[AMZN](https://i.imgur.com/bfCXbJj.jpg) üöÄüöÄüöÄ: the bulls are buying calls heavily in anticipation of earnings. If you think you know what a good beat is, just wait for AMZN Christmas results

[Ununsual Whales?: yep](https://i.imgur.com/3R6pPLI.jpg)

BONUS: sporadic FDX call orders have come in. After an oversell for FDX recently, AMZN sympathy is plausible based on orders.

[Unusual Whales spotted a sneaky FDX call order for 2/12](https://i.imgur.com/JX0HwyD.jpg)

[INTC](https://i.imgur.com/F2SUHPy.jpg) üöÄ : yes. I know INTC can be awful. But tons of pump since the ER. they have a new CEO everyone is excited about now, and look to have found a bottom. I like this.

[Unusual Whales spotted this INTC call block got 2/5](https://i.imgur.com/aRBlrRY.jpg)

**Tech grab bag:**

**ZNGA PINS CRM SNAP FSLY**
EDIT: I forgot AMD

 **All HEAVY volume and look great for ERs coming off this tech drubbing.** Very bullish call flow.

**EDIT/UPDATE:** /u/lordofoptions has sold me on **SENS**

Hope this gives you some confirmation bias or ideas to look into.

**Inbox always open**: i was super busy this past week, but in light of recent crazy market/WSB events I will be checking frequently and am willing to bounce ideas, field questions.

**TLDR: Buy tech calls, because whales richer than you are doing just that.**
good luck. üê≥"

So most of the news and social media memes about GME boils it down to being the result of an obscure meme ticker being intentionally rallied up by a group of risk-tolerant self-proclaimed retards who all collectively agreed to buy and ""screw the hedge funds"" because we were ""bored at home"" with stimulus checks or whatever fuck else these jackoffs think we did. Yeah it's funny and feels good, but it's not the whole story. After all we hype around retarded momentum stocks all the time, why didn't CHWY, NIO, TSLA, PLTR, AMD, and SPCE surge 800% in 6 days?


#This narrative is dangerous, and lacks important context about Wall Street's manipulation, greed, and how this whole thing ACTUALLY started.


If this narrative is pushed and becomes believed and accepted, then Wall Street and the SEC could actually have a case for accusing retail investors and WSB of market manipulation. But in case you're new that's **not what happened**


This was the complete and sole result of large firms short selling at a gross rate for over a year, while simultaneously working to push down Gamestop's share price through manipulative tactics like ladder attacks and media hit pieces. They could have covered at $4 for huge gains, but it wasn't enough, They were fully intending to run Gamestop into bankruptcy during a pandemic for maximum profit.


Eventually WSB autists picked up on this and bought the stock **for good reason**, not to collectively just ""fuck the shorts"". Those good reasons include the 148% short interest, GME being undervalued at 4% their revenue, etc etc. You guys know the deal.

This info was spread through WSB as early as last July by our holy Lord &amp; Savior DVT. Hype over GME went on for months here and eventually it was enough to begin the spike. The spike grew as other firms bought in too and news went viral. And yes, other firms are buying in too. No, your friend on Facebook who just downloaded Robintard to buy 1 share at $310 isn't the biggest one ""holding the line"". Even if 25% of adult Americans owned an average GME position of $300, that *still* leaves institutional investors with ~70% of shares. Yeah we're having a HUGE impact on markets right now but don't be naive and downplay the fund's positions too.

Obviously what's happening is incredible, and I'm diamond holding shares &amp; options to the fucking andromeda galaxyüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

But please try to correct the narrative where you can, and add the important context. It can make the difference between retail investors getting legal protection or being regulated out of existence.

TL;DR: WSB sparked this but greedy and manipulative Wall Street short sellers were the gunpowder and don't let anyone forget.

Price: 140.99  

Average Outstanding shares: 179.69M

Currently owns:

Tinder, Match.com, Meetic, OkCupid, Hinge, PlentyOfFish, Ship, and OurTime totalling over 45 global dating companies.

The growth rate of users on dating apps worldwide has been steadily increasing:

[https://www.businessofapps.com/data/dating-app-market/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/dating-app-market/) 

Of these, Tinder is the most popular by a significant amount; hence, I will use that as my example to illustrate some points going forward:

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/826778/most-popular-dating-apps-by-audience-size-usa/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/826778/most-popular-dating-apps-by-audience-size-usa/)

Tinder growth rate:

[https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tinder-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tinder-statistics/)

Facebook growth rate:

[https://www.statista.com/chart/10047/facebooks-monthly-active-users/](https://www.statista.com/chart/10047/facebooks-monthly-active-users/)

The tinder to Facebook comparison is not intended to illustrate that tinder could ever get into the same level of popularity of Facebook; it is much more niche. Rather, the comparison is to illustrate that the growth rates have similarities proportionally.  

Key factor in business model:

Tinder has two primary sources of income. One of which derives from monetization, which has proven to be extremely fruitful for all social media apps thus far.  

Most importantly, they have a subscription based product, Tinder gold for only $15. This has proven to be extremely successful as 6 million of their total 57 million users use it. That‚Äôs 10% of their total users, that specifically chose for the paid model. To put how vast this percentage is into perspective, YouTube has about 2 billion active users, while only 1.5 million are subscribed to YouTube red for $5.  

What makes tinder gold differ from other traditional free app optional subscriptions:

Unlike many subscriptions, tinder gold does not simply remove the ads from the UI. People are paying for two things primarily; they are first paying for the potential to have their profile be seen by others more, since it is extremely competitive. More importantly, they are also able to see the profiles of people who like them. This is a huge factor, because without it, tinder does not allow you to see who likes you. It forces you to continue swiping on random people until you stumble across someone who liked you. Due to basic human nature, people want to immediately see what people liked them, they want to cut to the chase. Therefore, they are required to sign up for tinder gold in order to see them.

Another huge money maker for tinder is the profile boosters. You can pay a certain fee, in exchange for tinder‚Äôs algorithm to push your own profile into more peoples feeds for a finite period of time. This results in significantly more likes and matches. These are not points or games, these are real people, so many often get a rush from this and continue to use more and more boosts after they see how affective it is.  

These being only three sources of their income alone already should illustrate how advanced Tinder is in terms of marketing their products. Tinder preys on basic human nature, and it has resulted in incredible user and financial growth.

Many of these other dating apps that are owned by Match include very similar marketing tactics. Again, I used tinder as an example simply because it is the most popular, and allows me to simplify some of my points regarding these dating apps. It is also the most profitable, due to the impressive marketing tactics I explained

‚ÄúThe company revealed Tinder pulled in $1.2 billion in revenue over 2019, a 43% increase from 2018. Match owns several other high-profile dating platforms including Hinge and OkCupid, but overall revenue for the year was $2.1 billion meaning it gets more than half its revenue from Tinder.‚Äù

Total balance sheet:

Anecdotal notes:

Perhaps some investors will shun me for even considering anecdotal experience to be note worthy, but I do feel that if some individuals have experienced something, it is more than likely to have occurred outside of that individual experience as well:

A large problem with dating apps is that there is a stigma to meeting someone online, or even having the apps downloaded. Several years ago, I remember seeing jokes about people who ‚Äúneeded‚Äù to use tinder to find girlfriends. I even remember seeing memes about people trying to hide the tinder app three layers deep into a hidden folder on their phones. This stigma certainly still exists, but from my experience, it has certainly decreased. It‚Äôs no longer about ‚Äúneeding‚Äù to use the app, it‚Äôs becoming more normalized. The popularity charts I provided illustrate this as well. Many people don‚Äôt even use tinder to meet people; many simply use it to entertain themselves or meet people virtually.

The stigma is dying, and as it continues to die, there will be continuous increases in users. The largest stigma was actually buying the subscription for ‚ÄúTinder gold‚Äù, which gives you a select amount of features. However, even this is becoming more normalized. People can justify it by simply wanting to see who likes them, rather than being for the benefit of helping your own profile be seen. Curiosity didn‚Äôt kill the cat in this case, but it influenced over 6 million users to spend at least $15 a month. 

Entry point?

I figured now would be a good time to make this post since they are coming off a recent sell off. The support has not proven itself yet, so it certainly has more temporary downside potential. Regardless, if you‚Äôre in it for the long run, this won‚Äôt matter as much. Watch for potential support Monday, 

This post will probably be brushed aside due to the short squeeze focus point at the moment, but feel free to share your thoughts if you do end up reading this. I‚Äôm very open minded and completely accept that I can very well be completely wrong on this. I mostly would like to hear people‚Äôs thoughts regarding the key factors of the business model I mentioned. I really do feel that they are next level in terms of preying on human psychology. It‚Äôs extremely impressive marketing in my opinion from a scientific perspective at least. 

This is not financial advice, these are strictly my opinions for entertainment purposes only."

From the outside looking in, nothing can go wrong, look at the chart, it doesn‚Äôt lie. Stocks only go up. 

I‚Äôm all for high risk high reward, but there is a clear line between gambling your future away and gambling your present. Eating ramen and driving a moped so you can drop your last dollar into a OTM BB play is reasonably ridiculous.

When you need that money to live though, when you‚Äôre pulling from rent and food money, just for the opportunity to get out of your situation, you‚Äôre not likely going to make it. The first hit is free, sometimes you get lucky, but a lot of times things go against you. This sub is not for you losing house/home/stability, you need to take care of yourself first, it‚Äôs expensive being poor and the market can help out, but not by get rich quick mentality, but my living frugally so you can invest, and lose, and when you lose, get right back at saving for your next play.

Please, gamble within your means, and if you think the hedge funds are evil, recognize that they are only greedy, a vice that is rife here too."

You‚Äôve always had an inflated ego, and going to Wharton for an MBA definitely didn‚Äôt help in that regard. You interned at GS for the summer of 2003 and told all your friends about it, probably even brought it up oh so casually on dates. When you were hired as a trader by a moderately good to great fund, you probably lost a good deal of friends from your previous life, because they ‚Äújust don‚Äôt get you now.‚Äù You‚Äôre in a different league than them, even your classmates that now work at lesser funds. You act friendly, liking Facebook posts, returning their calls, but there‚Äôs a nagging feeling that they‚Äôre holding you back. That you‚Äôve *made it*, and you don‚Äôt need some loser that doesn‚Äôt even work on the East Coast.

**Jump ahead a few years**

It‚Äôs September 20th, 2008. Bear Stearns closed months earlier, Lehman went bankrupt a few days ago. ""Buddies"" of yours from both funds have been texting you, some you know from college. Maybe you‚Äôll take pity on them and put in a good word, maybe you‚Äôll tell them nothing‚Äôs available right now and that you‚Äôre sorry. You don‚Äôt tell them you were part of your fund's effort to short sell theirs into oblivion. Maybe you really are sorry though. What you‚Äôre more sorry about, however, is that your bonuses are probably going to be shit for a few years. They could even dip into five figures, god forbid. Your thoughts are of course directed to the millions of people losing their jobs across the country by the news, but inevitably your bonus reduction resurfaces as your biggest concern. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like I can do anything,‚Äù you say, after downing some wine. You go to sleep fairly easily, while across the country, innumerable people are forced to contemplate moving.

**Let‚Äôs jump ahead a few more years**

It‚Äôs mid-March, 2020. At this point, its become evident that COVID-19 is going to ravage the world, in some capacity (not gonna put politics into this because that‚Äôs not the point). As either a CEO or senior executive at a mid-range hedge fund, your thoughts gravitate towards your craft. It‚Äôs clear the market is going to tank, so you do what you do best. You short the shit out of several clearly sinking industries (https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/investing/short-sellers-market-coronavirus/index.html). But you don't stop there. You go on CNBC, Fox Business, maybe even the BBC, and announce doom and gloom. Doing this will get people to dump their stocks, meaning your shorts print even more money. Oh well, if there‚Äôs a positive to be gained from this whole thing it‚Äôs your fund making good money, right? By late March or early April, your wife convinces you that going with the kids to the Hampton‚Äôs would be the best choice, since the upper east side is getting a little claustrophobic. You‚Äôll need to cancel your two week St. Barts vacation, what a bummer. You rent out a nice beach house in Sag Harbor for 125k a month, managing to beat out the other bidder by upping them by 10k. Once again, millions of people are losing their jobs, and you‚Äôre shorting the companies they work for. What else should you do? 

**Only a few months forward this time**

It‚Äôs October. Weeks turned into months, and while you‚Äôve started getting back to the city more and more, you‚Äôre still staying in Sag. Sometimes you have family friends over for an ostensibly socially distanced wine + cigar. You don‚Äôt think much of the events of the summer, aside from that one tweet you had PR send out in July. Your kids might have thoughts, you haven‚Äôt asked. 

**Just a few more months, I promise**

It‚Äôs January. For really no other reason than the prospect of making more money, you along with a few other funds have decided to open naked shorts on GameStop. While technically not allowed, there are loopholes. Why would the loopholes be there, if not to be exploited, right? Not like you don‚Äôt do the same thing with your taxes.

**Then, the unthinkable happens**

A bunch of retail investors, led by a specific part of Reddit, decide to fuck your position by dramatically raising the share price. Since you firmly believe these people incapable of sticking to such an audacious play, you do nothing. Before long though, you start to become slightly unnerved by how steady the growth of the stock is. It's approaching $100, and you're losing hundreds of thousands to millions every day on short interest. So, you decide to take action. You get on CNBC, and cry about fundamentals. About volatility crushing these people. They don't listen, and keep buying. A week passes with you and your rich friends trying various strategies, none of it working. You're aware of another fund leaning on a popular trading app to force them into not accepting buy orders for GME, amongst others. You're  not above sacrificing pride for money, so you announce your fund has closed its shorts. You're lying, of course. What kind of looks what you get at future parties if you cowed to these people? No, fuck that. You've read all the right books, been to the right schools, made the right friends, networked at the right parties and functions. You will not close, everything in your life has conditioned you not to. In fact, you'll double down. You go on CNBC some more. Artificially lower the stock price by trading between a few other funds. None of it's working, and you're intensely aware of another potential gamma squeeze on Friday. Restrictions on buying help during the day, but after hours, the stock jumps. That momentum carries it into a solid Friday. You won't budge, but at this point you're losing millions of dollars a day. 

**So, here we are**

These people do not care about you. You're the least of their concerns, actually. They care about money and fund image, in that order. We have a real chance to make guys exactly like this hurt where it counts (for them), and I want people to understand that. I'm not saying throw your rent into GME. I'm saying you have the chance to really be a part of something, to screw the people that have been doing the screwing for your whole life. The house has been running a fixed casino, and you have the chance to hit back. 

**Do not close. We have them, and they know it. We're winning, and if we keep winning they will give in.**"

The broader market took a nose dive today as volatility resume in earnest due to, of all things, fucking meme stocks. As GME, AMC, KOSS, and others continue their large swings to the stratosphere much to the grief of short sides, chatters are now about that sell-offs are partly a liquidity issue as funds close out their long position to cover (and prevent a margin call) on their decimated short positions in GME et al. VIX continues the spike from Wednesday and was up as high as 19% as systemic risk to the market are now fully in the spotlight.

* During intraday low, the DOW was down as much as -747 pts while SPX was down -94 pts and Chadsdaq was down -352 pts. Almost all sectors are being punished while a few medical products company in SPX escape into the greens due to a strong ER and an overall strengthened demand - cuz there's a fucking global pandemic. TMO is up 2.93% for the day to $511 while DHR is up 4% to $237. Conversely, big tech are big fucked as AAPL, FB, and MSFT are all down significantly. AAPL closed down -3.74%, FB down -2.52%, and MSFT closed down -2.92% (despite a strong ER result earlier in the week). AMZN, GOOGL, and NFLX are all down around -1%.

* GME swings to a strong green opening after RH relents being a shill bag for Citadel, allowing limited GME and AMC trading (to one or five fucking shares? what a joke). Turns out when the product is free, you're the product? In yet another volatile session, intraday high was at the opening $413 and intraday low was at $250 (a 40% intraday move) as MMs clear out their delta and escapes a total gamma squeeze to live yet another day. The short squeeze, however, is still in play as GME closes up 68% to close at $325, thanks to a reversal of movement shortly before power hour. As of writing, short sellers are at mark-to-market loss of almost 20 bil. You gotta feel for them as they might need to downgrade from a super yacht to a pleb boat. Such shame.

* Congress critters, media pundits, and everyone's moms continue to give their 2cents on the GME and gang episode - and while consensus is usually in favor of the little guys, being a cynical F - you should expect regulations and further restrictions from regulators/industry moving forward. One likely curb to help save MMs would be restricting options trading to a certain account size, or further restricting access to 0dte, particularly for volatile underlyings. Expect all this to come out with messaging of ""helping to protect our customers.""

* RoaringKitty AKA DFV gets [nice profile from the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/roaring-kitty-reddit-gamestop-markets.html) and if you are one of the few millions who are new to the story + sub, the piece does a good job giving a history of how DFV got started. Yours truly somehow got quoted in the piece as well and while the quote was decisively retarded as F, no cap it was an accurate description of most of our mindset. (Of all the fucking quotes to pick out from DFV's updates since 2019...). DFV posted his [latest YOLO update](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l846a1/gme_yolo_monthend_update_jan_2021/) minutes after market close. Don't click thru. Guess if he's still in?

* If you're unhappy with your broker due to restrictions, select veteran brokerages such as Fidelity, Vanguard, ETrade, has placed zero restriction (short of whatever that is already existed) on meme stock trading. As it turns out companies with decent corporate value are actually NOT dick bags, even in the face of market volatility. (Sure their UI might be stuck in the 90s and early 2000s). Things are especially helpful as these brokerages do their own clearing and aren't beholden to Citadel and others. While brokers who use Apex as a clearing house has had limited time restriction (Ally, TDA, Tasty etc.) they are definitely far better than whatever RH has done to their customer.

* Notable upgrades and downgrades: Despite receiving a strong upgrades this AM, BA couldn't handle overall macro pressure and its green opening of +2% swung to red as the day chugs on. Morgan Stanley double upgraded Boeing to overweight form underweight with a PT of $230, up from $165. BA closed the day down -1.54% to $194, further contributing to DOW's demise. SFIX, who rode quite a bit of the short squeeze mania in recent days (from $55 to $100 within two weeks) was hit with a downgrade by Baird as they notch the shares down to neutral from outperform with a PT of $85. SFIX closed the day down -4.44% to $95. GM, who's looking more and more likely to be the next strong EV contender receives another PT hike to $80 from $57 by Morgan Stanley. Shares remain unchanged given the recent run-up and closed the day flat at -0.7% to $50.68.

* After a decent rally from ER, AAL immediately sets out to offer another round of 1 bil in stocks, further fucking over their long term boomer shareholders. Already selling 1 bil in stock back in Oct of last year, the new offering will be selling up to 1.12 bil in more. Shares of American Airline close the day down -5% to $17. Others in the sector are also down, particular as UAL warns that thousands of job are at risk again - despite a 15 bil handout from the recent stimulus package. UAL close down -6% to $40, DAL down -5.29% to $38. Meanwhile JBLU and LUV handles the sector news a bit better given their management isn't complete trash.

* In WSB meme stock land, everything is a fucking meme stock now. AMC close the day up 53% back above $13. BB, a stock without the short squeeze factor closed the day down -3.75% to $14. If you like the previous DDs and plays on BB - you can always regrab $15c or $20c leaps when IV has cool down some more after VIX has retreated. As of writing Jan 22 and Jan 23 leaps are still looking at 140-150% IV. Which is a bit too expensive in premium. ICLN retreats yet again, down -3.3%. MT is down -3.8% after running up almost 7% the day before, and PLTR close the day down -1.35% to $35 ish. TSLA took another haircut of -5% to close out at $793, furthering yesterday's decline after an ER profit miss that didn't impress the market. Yeah, you almost forgot about all these tickers, didn't ya?

* Looking for a bullish meme stock play but just can't stomach the IV or premiums level and shares are too boomer (or out of reach in the case of GME lol)? Thanks to crazy high IV, you can join theta gang sell GME puts (cash covered or spread) at strikes of $25p to $35p for April, netting you premium of around $7 to $11. This bakes in one Q4 ER which GME should do well in, and with IV at +400% and delta of under 0.02 and lower (heh), the odds are stacked in your favor to come out ahead of the play. If assigned, you'll be paying only $18 for GME for the 25p and $24 for the 35p. Another company that will likely be a decent hold if assigned: BB puts are also going for decent premium. Feb 19 10p is going for around $1.75 with a delta of 0.2, or you can go further out to March 10p which nets you about $2.5 with a delta of 0.2 as well.

* **Noteworthy ERs:** With most of the big bois ER behind us (and overshadowed by meme stocks), earnings season continues next week with a few more market movers. On Feb 2nd, BABA, PFE, and UPS all reports before market opens. Later that afternoon, AMZN will report after market close. Further along the week, PYPL reports on Feb 3 after market close while PINS reports Feb 4 after market close. (PINS doesn't really move market but its noteworthy enough).

* **Notable econ numbers** includes the usual boys with Monday PMI at 9:45 AM ET, ISM manufacturing index at 10 AM ET, jobless claims on Thursday at 8:30 AM and the big daddy employment situation (nonfarm payroll etc) on Friday at 8:30 AM ET. 

* The DOW closed down -2% or -622 pts, Nasdaq down -2% or -266 pts, SPX down -1.93% or -73 pts, and RUT close down -1.57% or -32 pts.

(Yesterday's recap: none, but you can read [last's week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2a0e9/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_marketdriving_news_jan_21/) and bask in the past before GME and the Internet toppled the hedgies)"

LETS GET ONE THING STRAIGHT HERE PEOPLE: WE ARE NOT ROBINHOOD‚ÄôS ‚ÄúCUSTOMERS‚Äù AT ALL. Robinhood is a free service, and the way they make money is by selling our data to hedge funds so that they can make smarter, more strategic decisions. Fuck, 50% of ROBINHOOD‚Äôs income is from fucking hedge funds dude. 50 percent comes from these manipulative fucks. Maybe even 51%. They dominate these sellouts. They literally played us by naming it Robinhood to lure us in.


WE ARE THE PRODUCT. They are scraping data on all of us and selling it to them. These hedge funds then use AI technologies to make sense of this data and help trade for them milliseconds quicker than anyone else. When swing trading, thats a huge competitive edge. These guys already have a HUGE advantage over us, have all the money and resources, SET THE RULES THEMSELVES, and then completely bribed Robinhood in the eventuality that something like this happened. Melvin Cap became Robinhoods biggest customer / revenue source on purpose no doubt. Why else would they have such a risky short strategy? They probably have TD also bought out, and the fucking lot of them. Fuck. Robinhood. Sell out commie pieces of shit. 


We have to not only hold our options and shit here through expiration to REALLY fuck them over, but once this event is done gtfo out of Robinhood and make them pay. Find a new brokerage to use. 


It‚Äôs insane that a Chinese exchange, fucking Webull, is more ‚Äúfree‚Äù than our US based ones. This is supposed to be a free market, and the fact that they changed the rules mid game is so beyond fucked up it‚Äôs actually criminal. 


I understand everyone‚Äôs extremely mad, but we diamond hand this together. We are all in this and experiencing this together. It sucks that we are just a product of Robinhood, like we are products of Facebook, but we also have the power to leave in droves and completely screw them over. 


I head they were eyeing an IPO... how ironic would it be if Robinhood was the app that stole from the poor to give to the rich, and Vlad himself got impaled? What timeline are we in again?


Stay strong boys. I love you all. üíé üôåüèº 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT: For those asking what to switch to / what to use, you can always try out Fidelity. I hear decent things. Or you can pay up and try to work with a private broker, with whom you have much more liberties.

It seems the new era of investing is gonna be found in apps though. On-the-go, mobile investing seems to be hot, especially as things become more digitized through IoT. 

Stay strong everyone. The short squeeze hasn't even begun. Short interest in GME is still 100%+, so don't listen to the boomer news. These stocks will soar on Monday as people want in, even internationally. HOLD.

GME üöÄ + BB üöÄ + AMC üöÄ + NOK üöÄ + BBBY üöÄ = üåô"

Think about it. There‚Äôs only two major live streaming platforms targeted towards gaming, Twitch and YouTube. I won‚Äôt even mention Facebook streaming because that is something for üåàüêªplus the YouTube livestream UI is pretty üí© 

Factor in GME‚Äôs interest of expanding into eSports, it would be more profitable in the long run for them if they owned their own streaming platform and not have to share profits with Twitch or YouTube. This would also be cheaper than a game Dev studio, which I‚Äôve seen a lot of people mention (those have massive overhead and limited to profits once every 3 years or so, and no one wants to compete with Fortnite)
To pile on, there‚Äôs some major streamers out there that currently cannot stream together on air and there‚Äôs no alternative platforms on the market to entertain you retards on. For those that don‚Äôt know, Twitch won‚Äôt let partners stream with other members that were banned, forcing exiled streamers to YouTube with zero alternative. This forces streamers/entertainers into a corner and it sucks to be cornered without any options. These 2 streaming services hold too much power over their talent and it reminds me a lot of our showdown with WallStreet fuckheads like Melvin, Steven Cohen, and Citron. 
And let‚Äôs face it, I dunno about you but I really want to see Dr.D and TimmyTheTatman playing with each other on stream again because I miss those two playing together. Also YouTube livestream player is hot garbage and remains a total afterthought because Google knows Streamers have no alternatives, effectively cornering the market. 

I l believe a platform like this would totally justify the current share price as well! 
GME to the moon!! üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Positions: 740 Shares of GME

TL;DR if GME created a gaming livestream platform they could leverage it for their eSports scene and it would let TimmyTheTatman and Dr.Disrespect play together on stream again."

**Quick Points:**

- BlackBerry has major contracts with companies such as, Amazon, Huawei, and Zoom, which all have the potential to power sales growth. 

- BlackBerry QNX is currently the SAFEST and most SECURE Real-Time Operating System that is embedded into Train Controls, Factory Automation, Medical Robots, and Ventilators, etc, etc. 

- BlackBerry and Baidu expanded their partnership to power next generation autonomous driving technology and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC Energy Aion models.

- Post Positive adjusted earnings in its most recent quarter. 

- BlackBerry settled their court case against Facebook, which is undoubtedly a massive positive catalyst. Most insiders speculate that the court case is the reason for the stock shooting up early January, and not just WallStreetBets, which means this isn‚Äôt just the team buying in.

**Major Contracts:**

- **Amazon** contract is for BlackBerry IVY, a cloud-connected intelligent vehicle data platform. IVY will shorten the time it takes to build, and monetize new in-vehicle applications and connected services through many different brands and models of vehicle. 

- **Huawei** contract was a purchase of 90 cellphone patents from BlackBerry; so BlackBerry is ditching dumbass phone and solely dedicating to Cybersecurity.

- **Zoom** contract is for BB cybersecurity software that will help create highly-secure video calls for Zoom.

**TL;DR:** $BB TO THE FUCKING MOON üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ"

WSB is showing how censorship can effect us all if we don't reject it.,910,108,2021-01-28 16:48:30,"There is a desperate and coordinated effort to thwart everything retail investors are doing, censor and ban their communication platforms, and lobby for regulations to protect the elite Wall Street investors against the retail investors.  

CNBC has been relentlessly spreading the narrative that the government needs to step in to 'protect' the retail investors from themselves.  As short-selling hedge funds are bleeding billions of dollars, CNBC has the gaul to suggest that it is the retail investors that need to be protected.  

These ultra-wealthy investors have more influence than you could ever imagine, and they are transparently using it to their advantage.  Not only are they using the media to spread fear about these squeezed stocks to drive the price down and push the narrative that the government needs to regulate retail investors, they are also using their power to CENSOR these communities and keep them from exercising their free speech.  

Tech companies, likely influenced by their politician buddies in Washington, have been overtly censoring millions of people from their platforms simply for having political beliefs that they do not support.  Youtube has been banning channels for minor grievances.  Twitter has been silencing thousands of vocal users.  Facebook has been doing the same.  And most recently, the tech companies used their collective monopolistic power to basically destroy Twitters largest potential competitor: Parler.  It was no coincidence that nearly every tech platform and web service decided within a few hours to ban services to Parler.  They all used the same justification, even though their own platforms were equally as guilty, if not moreso, of the same wrongdoings.  It was blatantly coordinated censorship.  And they don't care, because they have the power.  

Droves of people defended these actions as acceptable because these are not government entities, and they can censor anyone they want.  Many smugly pointed out that this censorship is not a violation of the First Amendment.  And they are legally correct (barring any future antitrust legislation), but they are absolutely morally wrong to defend this censorship.  

Free speech is not just a right enshrined by our constitution, it is a cultural ethos and value that has been embraced by all political sides of this country since this country was founded.  Censoring legal speech has been looked down upon and shunned by nearly everyone in this country for 100's of years.  But recently, it seems that this ethos has been set aside as long as it is only those you disagree with who are being censored.  

And then we have WSB and GME.  

The people of WSB rarely if ever talk politics.  We are a massive group of investors who get together to discuss their dumb investment strategies.  People from every background come together and discuss one thing: investing and tendies.  There is no left or right, no red or blue.....only green.  

But now that they are hitting the elites where it hurts, the wallet, the elite are using their power to censor.  

First, we have Discord.  Over 250,000 people on the WSB discord.  [And it was censored for 'hate speech'.](https://gizmodo.com/discord-bans-r-wallstreetbets-for-hate-speech-violation-1846146314)  The most obvious color to paint a group that you want to silence: call them hateful, racist, etc.  

Note that Discord has had significant investment from private equity funds including FirstMark Capital, Greenoaks Capital Partners, Index Ventures, IVP, Greylock Partners, Benchmark, Accel, General Catalyst, Ridge Ventures, Spark Capital, and Tencent Holdings. 

Who do you think pulled the strings on Discord for them to censor the WSB channel?  

And now you have Reddit.  Commentators on CNBC have already called for the WSB subreddit to be banned.  And with Reddit's investor profile, who knows what billionaire may call in an order to censor that subreddit.  

So you see, this isn't just about tech companies censoring those for political beliefs.  This is about censoring anyone who threatens your wealth or power.  Many of those who defended the previous censorships may have said, 'yes, I'm okay with it because I don't like their politics'.  But many of those same people may now see that accepting censorship as a norm may one day come back and hurt them.  We must collectively reject and fight back against censorship, lest it comes to effect us all.  

I truly hope the last few days serve as a wake up call for those defending the billionaires and big tech censorship.  We need to get back to 'we the people' controlling this country and not 'we the elite'.  I know the censorship issue may seem like a drop in the bucket to some, but when it comes to our culture and values, that slope can be slippery my friend.  

Tl;dr - GME to the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ, Censorship by the powerful is bad."

Thank you Matt Phillips and Taylor Lorenz for enacting the same level of distain for us as the hedge fundies our tax dollars bailed out after the Great Recession. 

You mischaracterized both the type of people involved in this action (literate, engaged, working poor to middle-class) and the action itself (is it greedy to spend our paychecks wringing dry hedge funds who daily manipulate the markets in milliseconds while we are forced to drop a few bucks here and there and hope for the best?).

There is a palpable elitism at play here, and a deeper concern that rests not with those risking real money during a pandemic for the shot at a better life but for the goddamn MMs and collective arbiters of financial advice and financial institutions beneath whose thumbs we've been placed to squirm long enough. This is a handful of stocks we're using to kneecap some idiot short sellers and you're insinuating that we're about to collapse the whole system. 

We're not. We can't. These motherfuckers can, and have. We're fighting for a piece of the damn pie.

Make up whatever story gets you the headline, ""[above the fold](https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1354635872180662273),"" as you so deliciously revel in bragging about. I hope you both learn from this. Because you didn't even bother to spend any time here listening to what these working folks have been shouting into every post on the board, shouting on Twitter, on Facebook, into our phones as we watch the stock green dick rocket every hour on Robinhood: ""THIS ISN'T ONLY ABOUT THE MONEY!""

I am currently an investor of $MVIS and help moderate a forum on reddit - /r/mvis  Investment/Technology Speculation DD for Microvision ‚Äì Microvision has been working and perfecting technology for a future emerging market for 28 years and those emerging markets have finally arrived.   In these slides, I will introduce Microvision, and their verticals, and why their technology is considered disruptive by many of their investors, and why I invested in the company, and stay invested after 3 years.

Microvision was founded in 1993 to commercialize Virtual Retinal Display technology, in which images are drawn directly on the viewer‚Äôs retina.  Massive amounts of wealth has been pushed into R&D and patents, and has taken their toll in the past 28 years, accumulating a $572.6M deficit as of Dec 31, 2019. This amount has allowed them to accumulate 484 Granted and Pending Patents, and 28 years worth of Intellectual Property in design, testing, and manufacturing laser scanning devices.   Microvision is currently run by CEO Sumit Sharma. Before joining MicroVision Sumit Sharma was also Head of Operations for Google Glass for over 2.5yrs.   On April 2, 2020 they hired Craig-Hallum to help them find a strategic investment (which include M&A).. They signed Mark Spitzer, and Judy Curran to the board to help them facilitate this strategic investment.

 Microvision is the leader in MEMs Laser Beam Scanners (LBS). A key technology which could unlock consumer grade near eye displays, and long range automotive LIDAR.  (Explain like I‚Äôm 5) ‚Äì The lasers work in coordination with the mems mirror. A current is applied through the silicon, which produces a ‚Äúwobble‚Äù as seen in the gif. ASICs (basically a chip) controls the lasers, and the wobble of the mirror to be able to paint a 1440p image at 120hz (in the Hololens 2). The same method is applied with an infrared laser to be able to track objects, and provide 20 million pts/s.

Microvision allowed Microsoft to double their field of view (surface area), by switching from Liquid Crysta on Silicon Panels (built by Himax), to the laser scanning system without increasing the volume of the Light engine, while reducing the weight, and power found in the Hololens 2.   The doubling of field of view, does not mean less pixels per inch either.. As Hololens 2 has been able to maintain their pixel density, allowing user to be able to still read fine print through the near eye displays, unlike other components. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0qgqb8hglwd61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1a255a3e202a3e33dd328094bdb52dbe402d635

The basic concept of why Microsoft switched from a ‚ÄúPanel‚Äù type display like Liquid Crystal on Silicon, and decided not to use more expensive, and less mature technologies like MicroLED or MicroOLED is that with the panel type displays, the panel needs to proportionally get larger as the field of view expands. This makes it a challenge for designers and engineers trying to make a light weight consumer near eye display for augmented reality and mixed reality.  The beauty of the laser scanners is by adding a mirror, and a RGB module, they can change the angle, and create a larger FOV without proportionally getting larger. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wvdmh9whlwd61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=405bc391b0b630fadec2f1e702032e3acb6566e8

Sharp / Socle (Foxconn) have already roadmapped a smaller RGB Laser Module to be used for near eye displays. Their mass production of these modules will only make it cheaper to use, as the technology accelerates. This also solves other issues regarding how much power the lasers draw (barely already), being able to create even greater efficiencies in immersion by creating wider field of views and something called ‚Äúfoveated rendering‚Äù which reducers graphical processing power by up to 70% in some cases.  High definition, wide field of view, low cost of processing. Holy grail of near eye displays. This is another reason why we believe Dr. Mark Spitzer come out of retirement, to join Sumit Sharma on the Board of Directors of Microvision.

 The estimated increase in the market is going to be a total of 41.3% more each year.  

 2021 - 8.6 Billion  

2022 - 12.2 Billion  

2023 - 17.2 Billion  

2024 - 24.3 Billion  

2025 - 34.3 Billion  

Or an estimated market market opportunity of 96.6 Billion dollars total of potential in the next 5 years. Now if a purchase of MVIS can capture even 30% of that potential, a purchase of the company, even with the associated yearly operating expenditures of many million dollars a year, the potential market share would be nearly 29 Billion dollars of value. How much does a prospective buyer pay for just the AR related MVIS tech when they could control 30% of a nearly 100 Billion dollar market over the next 5 years?

There is no confirmation that Microsoft is utilizing Laser Beam Scanners for their Integrated Visual Augmentation System contract for the US Army.   We only have Microsoft patents that show how they plan on achieving wider FOV‚Äôs, and that the Hololens 2 was used as the platform to create the IVAS device. Currently Microvision has not given guidance for finances in 2021, which we assumed is because of ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) regulations and NDAAs.  Most evidence we've compiled is circumstantial, but it's the same kind of information that allowed us to realize Microsoft was utilizing Laser Beam Scanners from Microvision in the first place.

Microvision is leveraging their 28 years of experience to create small (size of a VHS tape), powerful (OVER 200m range), and wide FOV‚Äôs (dynamically changing).  Re: How this is Solid State-  The weight/mass is so minimal, it is considered part of the chip... impervious to vibration. If I understand it correctly. From a physics perspective, imagine a brick and a tiny piece of fabric sitting on the passenger seat next to you when you drive. The brick is going to jump around with every bump. The fabric will be unaffected. Too small and light.

Low cost, small size.  Think of how Microvision was able to create an interactive laser projection system in a smart speaker with an MSRP of $199. One word: ‚ÄúScalability‚Äù

Luminar, the market leader for LIDAR with it‚Äôs recent SPAC, is currently using a Mechanical MEMS system utilizing a polygon mirror the size of your eye, that spins aong with a planar mirror.  Their ‚ÄúSolid State‚Äù Lidar solution called IRIS doesn‚Äôt have very much published information, but a dive into their patent holdings shows the use of DMD style MEMS (solid state) which is owned by Texas Instruments.   This is the same technology used in Laser Projectors for theatres, that have excessive heat, excessive price, and excessive sizes (due to the heat sinks and fans required to manage the heat).   Had to look up the Luminar patent to find the vertical FOV, 120degx45degx300pts per squaredegree = 1.6 Million points... and we can't even complete the calc because hey maybe it refreshes a bunch of times a second...

Craig-Hallum and Microvision are currently focused on finding a strategic alternative, which incudes the possible sale of the company. It‚Äôs a dragged out process, but we‚Äôve found multiple Tier 1‚Äôs that have shown they plan on expanding into the space Microvision currently holds large IP for (near eye displays and Lidar) which would unlock Consumer grade products for these OEMs.   Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook is just a small sample‚Ä¶ which would include companies like Amazon, Google and other large whales.

This model allows for a lot of optionality and diverse revenue mix.

**Note:** I do not think this is the only option available to GameStop, nor the right one, just throwing it out there as it shows how much potential there is to re-think this business, on a fundamental perspective there is a lot of upside if they can execute on something compelling.

## Summary

A digital platform that offers both a subscription service for all-you-can-eat cross platform titles plus a digital games store where you can purchase cross-platform titles that are able to be traded-in for a credit.

## What revenue would it create?

At the moment, GameStop has over 50 million PowerUp Reward members. This program is largely limited to USA, whereby this digital platform can be global. As a benchmark, Xbox Live Gold is over 90 million subscribers, World of Warcraft has somewhere around 10-20 million subscribers (@ $15/month) - that's just 1 game. GTA 5 has sold over 120 million copies and Take Two makes $350m in micro-transactions in a quarter.

If this service cost $169 per year, cheaper than Microsoft's GamePass Ultimate, this is roughly the recurring revenue it would bring in. Maybe they could charge a lot more than this. $19.99 per month or $239 pa. $24.99 per month or $299 pa.

This service may just sit alongside GamePass, or Microsoft may choose to just integrate into GameStop's service so they are getting their Microsoft owned studio titles on more systems. See this article: [Microsoft wants Xbox Game Pass on PS4.](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-on-ps4/)

|Subscribers|50 Million|100 Million|150 Million|250 Million|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**$169 pa**|$8.5 Billion recurring|$17 Billion recurring|$25 Billion recurring|$42 Billion recurring|
|**$239 pa**|$12 Billion recurring|$24 Billion recurring|$36 Billion recurring|$60 Billion recurring|
|**$299 pa**|$15 Billion recurring|$30 Billion recurring|$45 Billion recurring|$75 Billion recurring|

It's possible too that this model does not simply provide a catalogue of games, like Game Pass does, but could work more like a library system where you can check-out something like a few games at a time. Any games. And turn them back in. Given the potential for license revoking, the opportunity of how the model could work on a subscription basis is only limited by your imagination. This kind of new approach would be different to what we've seen to date out there.

## Digging deeper: More like Spotify for Games

In some ways this model could operate similar to music and movie streaming services (e.g. Spotify & Netflix) where you have the ability to choose from the entire catalogue, and the publishers are paid based on what is being consumed/streamed/used/played. Play hours could be monitored and factored in.

Benchmark: Netflix has around 200 million subscribers, Spotify around 150 million, Disney+ around 85 million.

## Classic Buy/Trade-In model

On top of this, purchased games would be sold in full, generating more classic sales revenue. These digital purchases could work in a number of ways:

1. Games sold generate commission/profit per sale (just like selling a retail disc now) and could be integrated into existing digital stores across Xbox, Playstation and Nintendo eShop.
2. Games purchased through the console stores or other stores could be ""traded-in"" with GameStop for a small credit. It would be some minor work to integrate ability for the existing platforms to disable/transfer the digital license.

Traded-in games would encourage more purchasing than what happens currently where they rot in your catalogue never to be played again, so publishers are incentivized to be involved and contribute to this.

DLC and other digital purchases in-game could generate a similar commission for GameStop, in the same way that the current Microsoft revenue share model has. See below.

## Couldn't _________ do this instead?

Maybe. But, GameStop has advantages over every other player who might want to become the ""Netflix"" of gaming, if you will. They are neutral compared to other companies in the gaming sector, and neutral to the other major tech companies such as Google/Amazon/Facebook when you put them up against Microsoft in particular.

||Microsoft|Sony|Nintendo|Steam|GameStop|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**PC**|X|||X|X|
|**Xbox**|X||||X|
|**PlayStation**||X|||X|
|**Nintendo**|||X||X|

## GameStop is well connected across the gaming world to act as the global carrier for digital gaming

1. Steam might be able to pivot into this area, but GameStop has something Steam doesn't have: the console market. Primarily this means capturing Nintendo & Sony into this future.
2. GameStop has Reggie Fils-Aim√© (former President at Nintendo of America). This is a huge card in terms of getting Nintendo of Japan to agree to some kind of involvement.
3. Game streaming is something that can be built in now or down the track. Again, being platform neutral is a big bonus here, as the offer they provide would not be limited to other ecosystems such as what would be through XCloud or Stadia. Microsoft may even want to develop a deeper partnership to provide the technology/infrastructure (e.g. license/transfer XCloud - like an AWS style relationship) and allow GameStop to operate it as a neutral party. At the end of the day, Microsoft may get slightly smaller cut of a much larger pie through a model like this - and not be accused of anti-trust/monopolization.

## Understanding the Microsoft Digital Revenue Share

>Domo President Justin Dopierala told Ars that GameStop Investor Relations representative Eric Cerny sent an email with the statement: ‚ÄúWe are allowed to state we will receive a portion of the downstream revenue from any device we will bring into the Xbox ecosystem.‚Äù  
>  
>Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba confirmed what Dopierala said, adding that **GameStop will get a percentage of the revenue from every full game and DLC download, every microtransaction and every subscription made through an Xbox Series X or Series S it has sold through its stores.** And since the original line in the PR mentions ‚Äúlifetime revenue value,‚Äù it means the retailer will be receiving money from Microsoft throughout each console‚Äôs lifetime.

1. Microsoft want to do these things, but know they would never get Sony onboard. They probably wouldn't even get Nintendo onboard.
2. Sony has been known to bow to pressures in the gaming industry, so would come on board with something like this if Microsoft and Nintendo are hooked in. [Sony caves to the fans: Fortnite cross-platform play coming to the PS4](https://www.nintendoenthusiast.com/cross-platform-play-fortnite-ps4/)

## Plus all the other options available for revenue

1. Physical media will likely still exist for a long time. Case in point: We're still buying up Vinyls. Hell, there's probably still a case for retaining some stores over the next 2 decades in some capacity.
2. There's a waft of physical items that GameStop can continue to sell: Collectibles, hardware, pc parts, consoles (both outright and subscription based hardware), apparel, peripherals, toys, books, etc.
3. eSports: Tournament platforms, leagues, streaming.
4. Private label brands: GameStop can expand into its own house brand of gaming accessories.
5. Game studio development: They can start to make their own games, ala. what Netflix Original Content is all about. There's billions of dollars of potential here.
6. Leverage the data: 50 million members and growing. What else can it do with it?

The shit-tier level of journalism covering the GME saga has been a fucking disgrace. Half of it is plain financial illiteracy, and the other half is inter-generational bashing and fear-mongering. You think it's been bad thus far? The squeeze hasn't even really set off yet, can you imagine what happens next week when the stock hits the low triple digits? Eventually to 420.69? End game of 1000$+? Lets recap what has happened so far:

**False media narrative #1**: Recent rise of GME is due to sHorT sQuoZe!!!1! 

**Reality**: GME is an undervalued company & a turnaround story. Investors are finally starting to notice. Short squeeze hasn't even started yet.

*January 13th* - We had our first breakout to 30$ from the sub-20$ doldrums, the shit-tier level reporting started immediately. The media went balls deep on the short squeeze narrative despite absolutely no evidence that shorts had covered at all. Rather it was just long buyers piling in. For example, [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-13/heavily-shorted-gamestop-soars-most-ever-as-day-traders-circle) titles their article ""GameStop Surges Most Ever in Short Squeeze After Cohen Move"" despite quoting Ihor Dusaniwsky stating the opposite in the body of the article.

*January 14-15th* - The stock bounced from the mid to high 30's. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2021/01/15/with-138-short-interest-board-change-sends-gamestop-stock-soaring/?sh=21052b426da8) reports ""What drove up GameStop‚Äôs shares was a short-squeeze on steroids."" despite no evidence to support that claim and while quoting Ihor Dusaniwsky saying the actual catalyst was due to stronger holiday sales & board shakeup. 

*January 22nd* - GME breaks out yet again - hitting the low 70's before settling to the 60's. [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/22/gamestop-soars-nearly-70percent-trading-briefly-halted-amid-epic-short-squeeze.html) proceeds to again spread the falsehood about ""massive short covering"" with absolutely no evidence to back that up. Rather the bump was a result of a gamma squeeze.

**False media narrative #2**: Rabid retail investors are victimizing the poor short sellers 

**Reality**: Short sellers have been conducting illegal naked short selling to drive a company employing tens of thousands to bankruptcy.

[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/gamestop-tug-of-war-gives-reddit-army-a-win-on-record-volatility) blithly characterizes reddit as an ""angry mob"" out to attack poor little Citron. Bullshit, an angry mob is what stormed DC on Jan 6th, not a bunch of random individuals that left internet comments you didn't agree with on your youtube video. No mention of Citron's far shadier and illicit history. 

[Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/gamestop-stock-wall-street-bets-short-squeeze/) re-urgitates Andrew Left's baseless claims of being ""hacked"" and ""harrassed by pizza deliveries"". No mention of Citron's ¬†track-record of making baseless fraud allegation and market manupulation

[WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/short-bets-pummel-hot-hedge-fund-melvin-capital-11611349217) sympathetically mentioned ""Many investors have complained about short squeezes that have left them nursing losses."" and then going on to write a gushing biography about Gabe Plotkin. No mention of illegal naked short selling or that Gabe drove GME all the way down to 3$ but was too greedy to lock in his profits.

We, the retail investors, didn't do shit other than invest into a company that deserves a second chance. The shorts put themselves into a precarious situation through their own greed and illegal naked short selling. The media wants to punch down on the ""easy"" target: Reddit and WSB. Reddit is scary to boomers who can barely navigate the reddit UI, let alone get an erection. They prefer facebook, where fake news can be piped directly into their senile brains. This mis-information will just get worse from here on out.

We can and should push back, not by some centralized WSB twitter handle, but by what we do best: acting as individual retail investors who advocate for the truth on our soapboxes of choice.

TL;DR - Stay strong and üíéü§ö. Don‚Äôt be afraid to correct the fucking record."

[SPCE](https://i.imgur.com/qKQ1nS4.jpg)
-somebody rushed a bunch of calls through EOD. My best guess is imminent space launch or something 

[NVAX](https://i.imgur.com/ebyj4B7.jpg)
-saw deep OTM calls coming in towards the end of the week. Could be big news coming, or could‚Äôve been an assumption based on all the weird vaccine news about PFE and MRNA that came

**Edit**: there were some I forgot to mention because I didn‚Äôt have screenshots. ZNGA going absolutely apeshit, FSLY with quite a few calls after an upgrade, and INTC very bullish call volume and OI on the heels of a few upgrades after their ER plunge. There were tons of PT upgrades for tech last week, seems like names can üöÄ next week with earnings season here. 

Many more to be added Monday probably since it‚Äôs statistically the best day to follow whales. Some of these already had decent AH pops yesterday.

I worked for this company way long ago. Mostly interns work there but that‚Äôs how they reduce cost.

Blackberry is not the Blackberry you used to know before. They have a new highly profitable unit called QNX which is into developing embedded softwares for Autonomous Vehicles and EV stuff.

Apart from that, they are into creating security softwares for government. For example, Korean government is high paying permanent client.

If that‚Äôs not enough, they are going after all the companies who copied their patents. They are leaving not a single fucking company even if they copied a mere of an emoticon style. Seems like (sorta) this is now a side-income revenue model for them as they don't sue for shit. They sue for near billion amount.

For example this one, [https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/12/blackberry-awarded-815-million-in-arbitration-case-against-qualcomm.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/12/blackberry-awarded-815-million-in-arbitration-case-against-qualcomm.html)

While I was there they won a lawsuit against Qualcomm (another billion dollar company) and won over 815 million dollars in compensation.

Now, they won against Facebook. I am not sure but they sued Snapchat as well for fully copying their messaging features.

I attended all the town-halls given by John Chen, and he is fucking awesome guy.

In my opinion, they are gonna crush their March Earning's calls. And, there would be a surge right after that. From all three quarterly townhalls, the April ones are generally more exciting and good news types.

It's not just some Canadian company. They have offices all over the world.

Go easy on me fellow WSB. I also put a lot of üöÄüöÄüöÄ here but pleaseeee do your own DD if you're gonna buy $BB)

**Intro:**

Most people look at Blackberry (formerly known as RIM) as a dead cellphone company. A company that‚Äôs basically a prehistoric dinosaur at this point with a small cybersecurity portfolio left of their business. Their inability to adapt against cell phone companies such as Apple & Android vendors has caused their main revenue driver to plummet into non-existence. However, their business has been able to keep afloat in the past few years due to their competitive advantages around cybersecurity. Many government officials & corporations till this day still use QNX from BB as their mobile/security platform due to these advantages.

**Word on the street:**

Around last year summer, word on the street was that BB is looking to partner with Amazon on a EV platform around data sensors, automation, and cybersecurity. Stock prices at the time was around $4-6 CAD. Just looking at financials alone and the amount of $ revenue they bring in compared to the industry standards, $BB stock price seemed quite undervalued in comparison. However, this made sense since $BB has failed to deliver and disappointed shareholders over the past years.

Whether we‚Äôd like to believe it or not -- EV (electric vehicle) is the future in the next 5 years. Whether that is one day where we run out of fossil fuel‚Ä¶ or people moving towards environmentally friendly options, there is much to be explored and the market is relatively immature.

In today‚Äôs world, every automotive company is chasing EV currently and wants to avoid becoming the next ‚ÄúBlockbuster‚Äù prehistoric company. The question we need to ask next is, ‚ÄúDo they have the necessary tools & solutions to help them transition in that journey?‚Äù To answer this, I will give a quick example. Most farmers do not build a tractor to farm their crops. They instead go out and buy one than to waste precious time seeing their crops die. I believe this holds true for automotives as they lack the necessary skill sets to develop a platform that can run cybersecurity, data sensors, and automation for their cars. If you didn‚Äôt know already, popular car services such as Apple‚Äôs CarPlay and Google‚Äôs Android Auto all already operate on top of QNX today in our cars today. Amazon‚Äôs partnership will only help accelerate that movement as QNX will be linked to their public cloud to do over-the-air monitoring, upgrade, security, collision crashing assistance, autonomous driving, AI machine learning, and many many more.

**What‚Äôs happened recently**:

Well‚Ä¶ their partnership with Amazon came true around December. In addition to this, they‚Äôve sold off their üí© cell phone patents to Huawei so they can finally focus purely on Cybersecurity and EV.

Icing to the cake, they‚Äôve recently won a settlement against Facebook so they gotta pay up that $$$ to $BB which hasn‚Äôt been reflected in their quarterly report yet.

SpaceX, Zoom, Qualcomm, governments, and many more are working with $BB as we speak today. Sony recently just announced their partnership with $BB for their next upcoming car last week. Overall, lots of exciting news back to back.

This explains the excitement around $BB and why it‚Äôs been taking off recently. I believe they will continue to do so as the EV and Cybersecurity market continues to evolve from its infancy. (With other digital ""currencies"" growing, would there be a bigger cybersecurity play for $BB? Who knows)

**So.. what are the Risks:**

3 things I can think of currently:

1. No Revenue Growth despite all of the above
2. EV doesn‚Äôt take off as much as it should. COVID is impacting sales of cars or sales of anything in general. Self-explanatory there
3. Someone creates a better platform over $BB

This all depends if $BB is capable of hiring great salespeople to execute on their job. Only time will tell.

**TLDR; In Conclusion**

Most boomers will avoid $BB because they think it‚Äôs a cellphone company. Anyone that‚Äôs googled it recently will know that this isn‚Äôt true. I personally think $BB is very undervalued and with the reasons I‚Äôve explained above, I feel there‚Äôs much potential for the company to grow. Lots of people are going to be selling it when there‚Äôs a bit of a profit but I think the company‚Äôs barely scratched it‚Äôs potential.

Finally, the ret‚Ä¶.s WSB from reddit are using lingos such as ‚Äúto the moon‚Äù and ‚ÄúRockets üöÄüöÄ‚Äù for $BB so we all know people are dumping hard on this to make it the next big thing.

AAPL extended their rally to close the day up 3.67% to $136.87, nearing ATH once again thanks to some more positive comments from analysts this morning. Morgan Stanley up their AAPL PT from $144 to $152, while Bernstein notes Apple's strong iPhone 12 demand cycle. In other big tech moves, FB closed up 2% to $272 as Evercore ups their PT from $320 to $355; AMZN trimmed their earlier morning gains but still closed the day up 1.34% to $3,300; finally, after running up 6% yesterday, GOOGL retreated from a morning high that almost touched ATH to close the day at 0.22%.

* GME euphoria roars along unabated as WSB continues to go all-in on the gaming retailer. With intraday moves of over 13%, GME is as volatile as ever. Shares initially traded red in the morning but soon rally to as high as $42 when it became apparent Citron's video was postponed yet again (damn hAxOr!), but the stock soon went red once the video was uploaded. Suffice to say, Citron's video on YouTube immediately accumulated thousands of dislikes while not revealing anything material that the market wouldn't know about already - and shares recovered after an initial dive. Through the rest of the day, shares bounced from low $40s to the ~$42 sell wall, but eventually broke through during power hour and closed the day up 9.99% to $43 - a relatively strong bullish close considering GME hasn't closed above $40+ since last week's big pump. Support appears to be around $35-$37 and resistance is around $42-$43.

* Morning numbers had jobless claims falling slightly by 26k to 900k for the week ending in Jan 16 with consensus being 910k. Housing Starts saw another strong month with a 5.8% increase to 1.67m in Dec. Finally, Philly Fed manufacturing index showed a strong uptick with numbers at 26.5 vs the consensus of 12, representing an 11-month high. 

* Airlines took a beating today with UAL leading the charge. With steeper than expected rev miss from their ER, UAL closed the day down -5.7% to $42.69. DAL closed down -2.28%, JBLU -2.37%, LUV -0.91%, and AAL closed down -2.10%.

* In an unexpected move, INTC released their earnings early before the market closed and the stock traded with strength to close the day up 6.46% to $62.46. After digesting the numbers, shares retreated in AH to a current -3% to around $60. INTC reports Q4 EPS of $1.52 while consensus was $1.10 (hence the pump minutes before close) and they also projected Q1 EPS of $1.10 while consensus is at $0.93. The blue-chip semiconductor company is also upping its quarterly cash dividend by 5% (boomers love their dividend). The sector performed well today with AMD up 3% and NVDA up 3.75%. As with before, AMD's AH is a reverse of INTC with Su Bae showing boomer INTC what's up. AMD is up another 2.8% AH to $94.10.

* IBM took a heavy beating, with AH currently at -6.4% to $123 as the large IT company reports fell short of the street's expectation. While adjusted Q4 EPS was $2.07 beating the consensus of $1.79, revenue was $20.37 bil vs $20.67 expected. Especially troubling was IBM's cloud segment, producing 6.84 bil instead of the consensus of 7.18 bil.

* In WSB meme stock land BB traded red for most of the day but edged out a flat close to 0.47% to $12.85 (though it is retreating again in AH as of writing at -1.87%). ICLN closed up 4.41% to $32.66, filling the gap from last Friday's sell-off. Meanwhile, MT continues being pressured and closed the day at -1.49% to $23.

* More notable ER movers: STX reported ER and while numbers were decent, shares are retreating AH to -4.83%. WDC follows suit AH to -2.45%. TAL, the Chinese after school online learning platform, rocketed up 15% for the day after reporting a strong quarter. Shares of other Chinese ADRs in the sector also performed strongly with GSX (a Citron short) up 11.62% and EDU up 6.95% for the day.

* The DOW closed down 0.04% or -12 pts, Nasdaq up 0.55% or 73 pts, SPX up 0.03% or 1 pt (look at all those gains), and RUT close down -0.89% or -19 pts.

* Notable numbers tomorrow: PMI at 9:45 AM ET with existing home sales soon to follow at 10 AM ET.

l22qez,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l22qez/nvax_a_fortnight_bottlenecks_and_imminent/,"NVAX: A Fortnight, Bottlenecks, and IMMINENT Efficacy Data (urgent)",68,57,2021-01-22 01:10:50,"The point of this post is to describe why I think Novavax ($NVAX) will be releasing efficacy data in the next week and explain why I have decided to buy weekly options until data comes out for the biggest possible return.

**tl;dr:**

1. Data is coming in the next week.
2. IV on options expiring next week is going to go through the roof on Friday afternoon.
3. High likelihood of good data.
4. Buy now.

For quick context, as of today NVAX will be the 4th COVID vaccine to release Phase 3 efficacy data, though they have already secured the most government contracts. Currently, Novavax is in a phase 2B trial in South Africa, a phase 3 trial in the UK and a phase 3 trial in US/Mexico. The release of South Africa and UK efficacy data is imminent (see reasons why I think data will be released next week below). This data is a significant catalyst as, up until this point, no efficacy data has been released from NVAX, other than non-human primates (which was best in class relative to competing vaccines).

As for what that data will entail, there are a lot of reasons to be optimistic that I will not get into in this post. I am a medical student and am more than happy to discuss further if needed, but for starters I recommend reading the 4 posts by [u/Upstairs\_Speech](https://www.reddit.com/u/Upstairs_Speech/) on why NVAX is deeply undervalued and has a high chance of success. The only thing I would add to their posts is the robust antibody response (significantly higher than MRNA and PFE) after 6 months, as shown on [slide 17](https://ir.novavax.com/static-files/84a85933-d43f-438e-9dd3-32a023129da7) of their JPM presentation two weeks ago, which as a result has gotten many immunologists excited.

We have seen the share price impact of released efficacy data before. For reference, Pfizer added $15B to their market cap after release of efficacy data in November and Moderna doubled its market cap in November (from 30 to 60B). NVAX has a market cap currently of $8B (16% that of Moderna) - and that includes the valuation for a separate influenza vaccine that completed Phase 3 in March 2020. I think a 40+% immediate increase is reasonable following good data and I think NVAX will continue to grow to be multiples higher than current levels in a few months. A 40% increase from current levels would take the share price to $175 which would net a 10x or greater return. NVAX hit $190 share price last year after the primate data, it could certainly go higher than 175.

Here are the reasons why I think NVAX will provide data in the next week:

1. At JPM's healthcare conference on January 11 their CEO said data would be ""in a few weeks"" and has repeatedly said data would be in ""early Q1.""
2. At the same conference their Chief Commercial Officer said South Africa data would come first and UK would follow shortly after in late January/early February but could be sooner due to the high burden of disease in those two countries. Here are a couple recent news articles highlighting how out of control the situation is: [UK article](https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-19-coronavirus-uk-variant-cases-2021-1) and [South Africa article](https://www.theafricareport.com/57277/south-africa-new-coronavirus-variant-rages-alongside-vaccine-finance-debate/).
3. On January 13, the following South Africa news [source](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/comment/novavaxs-south-african-phase-iib-covid-19-vaccine-trial-likely-to-reveal-results-within-next-fortnight-source-says/) said Novavax had completed its data entry with the government and results would be revealed in the next ""fortnight"" which implies results coming out by next Wednesday at the latest.
4. The screenshot in this [tweet](https://twitter.com/someguymg/status/1351237225636360194?s=20) from two days ago from a seemingly reliable Facebook vaccine group where a study participant in the UK had been told by a sponsor that Novavax had completed the 50 events for an interim analysis.
5. The New York Academy of Sciences announced a [webinar](https://www.nyas.org/events/2021/webinar-the-quest-for-a-covid-19-vaccine/?tab=agenda) on February 2-3. Novavax is attending alongside Pfizer and Moderna and their President of R&D is giving an ""Efficacy Data Update."" Earlier stage vaccines are only giving ""updates"" so we know that at the very latest we will have data by February 2 and I believe it will be much earlier than the New York Academy of Sciences presentation.
6. Pfizer, Moderna and Astrazeneca have all released news before market on Mondays, so given the combination of the points above I think we will be getting data next Monday morning and if not, definitely sometime next week.

Currently IV is so high on Novavax that I have been opposed to buying calls a few weeks out, as it kills potential returns. So for the last two weeks I have bought small amounts of calls on Friday that expire the following week. I am buying significantly more this week for options expiring next Friday due to my confidence in imminent data.

Lastly, on January 8, before the JPM presentation, IV went over 200 and that was with a monthly expiration that had strikes going over $220. There is a bottleneck of availability of strikes on next week calls (expiring January 29) as they only go up to $170. On Friday afternoon IV will go through the roof on these higher strike calls so now is the time to get in.

**Positions:**

1/29: Strikes 150, 155, 160, 165, 170 - anything you can get your hands on

As an aside, some have expressed concern that NVAX, a relatively unproven biotech company, may not have the ability to ramp up production and/or the US trial is too late for the vaccine to get traction. Those worries are WAY overblown in my opinion. Now‚Äôs not the time to get deep into that, but here‚Äôs some quick reasons why:

1. NVAX currently has more than 1.6 billion doses already ordered from countries around the globe. Pricing is consistent globally at \~$16 per dose (do the math on revenue and think about other biotech firms trading at 2-3x revenue‚Ä¶ we should see the market bake a lot of that in once positive phase 3 data is released).
2. NVAX has made acquisitions and partnerships (incl. Praha vaccines, Serum Institute of India and Baxter in Germany) over the last year to ensure production capacity is ready once regulatory approval is granted.
3. FDA has [signaled](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/19/novavax-vaccines-clinical-trials/) it is willing to rely on the UK interim data to grant emergency use approval."

Lately i've been pretty busy with gme and i haven't been able to follow the upcoming bb hype. I've been trying to find what caused the sudden hype but i can't seem to find it really.

 I know that they've pivoted away from phones to software for self driving cars, but i assume this has been known for quite a while. I also know they settled a suit with FB, but i wouldn't expect something like that to trigger this much hype. So why the sudden change in popularity? And what is the bull case for it that suddenly made the stock such a compelling choice to invest in?

Tl;DR what is causing the BB hype, and how far will it go

Apple announced in 2020 that they plan to increase the level of privacy of the iOS users, with the release of iOS 14. What does that mean concretely?

\--> As soon as you open a new app, they will ask with a pop up ""Do you allow this app to track you across different apps"". We expect that 10 to 20% of the users will say yes. Bumble officially said while filing their IPOs that could be a major risk for them, to do proper analytics on their users.

Therefore, all the apps relying on paid acquisition, won't be able to track where you are coming from, and if you are a rentable user. Therefore, it makes it even harder to create profitable user acquisition campaigns on mobile. Those who will suffer from it are casino, midcore, casual games, as well as all the apps relying on paid subscriptions. It will provoke a drop of eCPMS (price per 1000 impressions of ads), as there will be less demand on the ad networks.

Certain networks will suffer more than other, but the biggest one is Facebook.

99% of the revenue of Facebook is coming from ads. It means that they will still be able to do targeting on Facebook itself, but not on the networks of apps that run ads (like all the games). Facebook is a key player in this industry, and this will certainly provoke a drop in terms of revenue (9M businesses are relying on their ad network).  They officially said that IDFA change (this iOS privacy update) "" Could Have A Material Business Impact"".

Apple postponed their measure to Q1 2021, but this will come.

Google usually follow suit with these kind of measures.

More info:

 

1. Some quotes:

Facebook [published](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2020/06/18/value-of-personalized-ads-thriving-app-ecosystem/) a blog post outlining a test it had conducted comparing how revenue differed between personalized and non personalized ads on its Audience Network. Facebook said it observed ‚Äúmore than a 50% drop‚Äù in publisher revenue when personalized targeting was taken out of the equation ‚Äîthough it didn‚Äôt publish a detailed outline of the study.

2. The iOS market is the most profitable mobile market. It represents around 50% of the total revenue for app publishers, while only 27% of mobile owners have an iPhone.

3. In any case, the advertisers won't be able to track properly the performances of their campaigns. Even if they will still be able to target users, they won't be able to know how efficient it is, as we used to today. Moreover, if you increase the amount of ads in Facebook, this will definitely have an impact on the retention rate / session length. This is a lot of fine-tuning, but the solution isn't there.

&#x200B;

TLDR : Significant drop in terms of ad revenue on mobile due to the new iOS privacy change. It will prevent targeting and tracking of the users. Facebook will suffer from it like crazy, as well as other ad players such as Unity, Ironsource (IPO soon) or Applovin (IPO soon), and apps Bumble (IPO soon).

Play : Wait for Q4 Revenue annoucement of Facebook. Then short Facebook until next quarter, when the measure will show its impact

Big tech such as FB and GOOGL closed up 3.9% and 3.3%, while MSFT closed up almost 1.8%. Conversely, select sectors were punished today as a rotation of sort occurred. Retail/consumer storefront took a beating with WMT down -0.86%, COST down -2.12%, TGT down -3.41%, DG down -2.54%, and BBY down -2.11%.

* It's another spectacular pump day for WSB cult gang as a new religion is formed where GME is the deliverance and the Moon (or Mars?) is the promised land. From fractional shares to irresponsible six figure plays near the recent top, the GME hype is so overwhelming that even WSB has quarantined them into a specific thread. GME opened at a strong 15%+ and went as high as 25%+ intraday to $45.52 but a tweet by Andrew ""tool bag"" Left of Citron at 9:58 AM derailed the party and sent shares under $37 before the bull run continued. Shares of GME closed $39.36, up 10.87% as shorts continue to be squeezed, though the momentum has clearly be snapped a bit.

* Over at BB land, shares of BlackBerry Ltd. pumped another 25% as the market continues to shift the company's valuation as the Canadian company chugs on with their focus on enterprise security software/service. BB closed up 25.51% to $12.35. 

* NFLX reported stellar numbers as sub count tops 200 mil. New net sub numbered in 8.5 mil, an uptick of 2.2 mil from the previous quarter and beats previous projection of 6 mil by 2.5 mil. NFLX sees Q1 additions of 6 mil. While Q4 EPS was $1.19 vs $1.39, NFLX sees Q1 EPS of $2.97 vs consensus of $2.10, further propelling the stock. Implied move was about 8% for weeklies so for those who YOLO'ed you're gucci as long as you didn't buy some retardedly OTM strike. NFLX is up 12.5% as of writing in AH to $564. DIS is up 2% AH and ROKU is up about 1.6%.

* GM pumped more than 9% today on news of MSFT 2 bil investment in GM's self-driving startup Cruise, valuing the side hustle at 30 bil. The boomer stock has low-key been killing it in the past few years and as Model 3 replaces the entry-level 3 series and C class in various neighborhoods, you'll likely see GM EVs replacing various Hondas and Toyotas in the coming years as well. GM closed up 9.75% to $54.84.

* Bank/financial earnings continues with BAC and GS reporting this morning. Both reported strong quarters tho the run-up may have been a bit too much as both underlyings faced the same sell-off pressure their sector faced last Thursday. BAC authorized a 2.9 bil repurchase plan, shares closed the day down slightly -0.73% to $32.77 while GS closed -2.26% to $294.

* Incoming Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urges Biden to act big to further help the rona punished economy, but also made some notes on raising corporate rates eventually (once the US overcomes rona). With Yellen set to replace Mnunchin, those who enjoyed Mnunchin's various stimulus phone tag with Pelosi will no doubt miss the ""stimulus talks are going well"" pumps.

* Shares of home builders reacted favorably to Biden's $15,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit proposal, though it will likely face an uphill battle in Congress given the various scope and size of the overall stimulus package. LEN is up 2%, DHI up 2.8%, PHM up 3%, NVR up 3.74%, and KBH up 5.5%.

* In WSB meme stock land not named GME and BB, ICLN closed up 2.75% as the cleantech pump resumes, while MT took a beating of -4% to closed at $22.96, despite a slight PT raise of .5 Euro by Morgan Stanley. Surely metal gang won't be another tanker gang situation.

* In recent IPO land, DASH is up 6.20% to $198 (yeah this 60 bil market cap makes tote sense), AFRM is down -5.14% to $110, AI pulled back -5.46% to $126, and ABNB closed up 2.61% to $173.

* The DOW closed up 0.38% or 116 pts, Nasdaq up a strong 1.53% or 198 pts, SPX up 0.81% or 30 pts, and RUT is up 1.32% or almost 28 pts.

* Notable ERs and numbers later this week: UAL, DFS after market close on Wednesday and INTC on Thursday after market close. Housing market index on Wednesday morning at 10 AM ET, jobless claims at 8:30 AM on Thursday, and on Friday PMI at 9:45 AM ET with existing home sales soon to follow at 10 AM ET.

FB is the most undervalued mega tech growth stock on the market today. Period. I've heard the most insane statements with respect to the future of facebook as a company. ""This is the end!"", ""Everyone's deleting their accounts!"", ""The scum of our society!"", ""Trump will teach them!"", etc....

No one gives a fuck about your conservative right wing viewpoints. No one gives a fuck that you deleted your account (you have zero influence on the global population). This company will continue to steal your wife's boyfriend's daughter's soul and print cash to the cows come home.

Are you still not listening? This company has data on 40% of the global population. If there is nothing else to take away from this. Trust that this company will monetize that data over and over and over again. They will figure out how to make you an addict. Like heroin to the vein. Like you getting cucked by Jimbo the plumber.

Social media is officially a VICE. Same shelf as sex, drugs, gambling....I'll put my money behind these categories every day of the week.

Anyways. Take a look at growth. This company's earnings are ripping YoY. PEG ratio under 1. Forward P/E is trading like a boomer stock in today's environment.

SHUTUP and buy facebook before you realize you were a fucking idiot for not buying facebook.

""BUT ANTITRUST!"" Shutup. Buy facebook.

**Position: 55x Jan 2023 $300C.**

UPDATE: Earnings are next Wednesday, if you want a cheaper and riskier play, buy $265-$275 with term that straddles earnings. I would buy into Feb/March. Rockets.

-Incredible value
You‚Äôve heard this before, now let‚Äôs understand why.  Looking at the cyber security industry, BB outperforms on a number of metrics.  Price to sales is 5.85 vs 11.31 industry.  As well price to book is 3.11 vs industry 11.44, this indicates relative to its industry BB is highly undervalued(Value investors look for P/B ~(0-3), so BB just about fits in there). They also operate on gross margins 3.3% higher than industry.  All this to say, BB is going to reach a more accurate share price, it‚Äôs just a matter of timeüöÄüöÄüöÄ
-outperforms market in cyber security, 10% more growth on the year than the industry average and it still has undervalued metrics, this is only the beginningüöÄüöÄüöÄ
AWS Partnership

-Partnership with Amazon Web Services to expand QNX systems that are already trusted and viable.  New system will be backed by Amazon and allow new capabilities for car manufacturers to interpret sensor data and improve driving experience for their cars.  Possible features included but not limited to predictive maintenance, tracking driving habits and even book spots for EV charging along your route.  Once integrated with Amazon‚Äôs IoT and machine learning services, IVY will be ready and is expected in 2023.üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

-Amazon is helping to market IVY so it will be extremely competitive from an industry leading cloud computing company and also backed by the goat of cyber security (BB), their birth child IVY will secure Tendies for all WSB retardsüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
-John Chenüëë

Saved BB in 2013 from sinking to nothing with Apple as competition, pioneered them back to the front(soon)of another field and is still CEO.  If that wasn‚Äôt enough, he is taking bonuses in shares and gets a huge bonus when shares reach $30, this means his bottom line for the company vision is the same as ours. SharesüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüåö
-Large Mobilization of Funds

BB sold 90 patents to Huawei, which serves 2 fold, no more fees on those patents and also increased capital.  As well they settled with FB for an unknown amount, this also is a double edged sword, no more uncertainty(or fees) due to lawsuit and they will have a sizable settlement (hopefully to spend on R &amp;amp; D) for IVYüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Reasons (not)to Buy:

Earnings Down/
Analysis, QNX loses a significant portion of revenue, given auto industry was significantly impacted, so was licensing sales of QNX, Chen says sales will return to previous when auto sales correct.

If IVY cannot increase profit margins or expand user base it will be an R and D cost alone...  Given the new value however, I‚Äôm confident in its larger profit margin. Or at the very least in leu of new value and a credible partnership significant increase in licensing sales, especially so in the Emerging EV market!üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

In conclusion BB üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüåö

________________

Some Unusual Options Activity caught my eye from Friday for this week.  I typically like to scan the prior Friday on the weekend, so I figured I‚Äôd share what I was looking at in case it gives you confirmation bias or an idea. 

*REMEMBER: UOA IS AN EDUCATED GUESSING GAME WHERE YOU ARE TRYING TO STAY ABOVE 50%, AND HAVE A FEW AMAZING BAGGERS HERE AND THERE. DO NOT YOLO WHALES*

**The way I‚Äôll break this down is by laying out my..**

**C choices:** Options activity that is intriguing, but seems like there is a strong possibility it could be a hedge, a sell the news event, isn't confirmed once I do more research, or hasn't been called out by Unusual Whales.  No precise formula. 

**B choices:** Ones I am pretty down to hop on, but need to see more.  I might be waiting for a dip, a related news event to play out, or this is one I feel could go against me big if it's an institutional hedge because of its Greeks. 

**A choices:** Shit I will likely buy right at the open, fits into what my thought process on a sector generally has been, and is simply a ticker I like.  
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

**C choices some whales bought:**

**FSLR and SPWR: Somebody is betting solar**

[UOA cluster example for both](https://i.imgur.com/5BzcmaV.jpg)
**FSLR**: underlying=96.85 **Order**: 110c 1/22 (IV 63.98%)

**SPWR**: underlying= 31.96 **Orders**: 33 and 37c 1/22

**Unusual Whales Alert:** FSLR no/SPWR YES 

**Earnings Reports**: Mid February

**Why I like it:** Solar cooled down a little bit after the Biden-stonk frenzy to start off the week.  ICLN, EV, etc could just be refueling, and aren't necessarily done running.

**Why I don‚Äôt like it:** Falling knives, and could still be finding the bottom of it's channel.  It had a hell of a run, and hopping in now feels greedy.  The volume on these orders is also low, which can be a coinflip as to what it means.  Sometimes 600-1,000 volume is the sweet spot, but

**IV and Greeks [SPWR greeks]:** shitty theta (you‚Äôre giving back almost 20% of premium price each day on the 1/29c) and IV at or near the money is already about 100% by this point.  The only upside to straight buying a call is playing the IV/Vega on Joe Biden's inauguration speech

**News confirmation and catalyst(s):** Biden's inauguration speech could lay out a great renewable energy plan that gives the whole sector a boost.  Last week people played weed, energy and EV in hopes that his Thursday speech would touch on these things--there is a much higher likelihood his inauration speech will.  Also, [huge news about the Keystone pipeline came out this weekend ](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55709261), and I don't know if this means uppies or downies for other oil companies, since big oil is trying to appeal by saying they'll switch sources. 

**Position**: Waiting to see how Keystone decision fallout hits them tomorrow morning.  If there is a significant dip I'll probably buy it for some 1/29 SPWR calls Wednesday morning and dump with a swiftness after inauguration.

**B choices**:

[**PEPüöÄüöÄ** underlying=141.39 **Orders**: 152.50 2/12c (IV 20.74%), 143c 1/22 (IV 16%)](https://i.imgur.com/67bZ71V.jpg)

**Unusual Whales**: No alert

**Earnings Report**: February 11th

**Why I kinda like it:** Didn't see many KO calls around, but saw the PEP calls; that contrast made the order stand out to me as more than a sector/industry bet.  The fact that the ER is one day before the 2/12 call expiration makes me like this play because I can pick up some IV along the way for what feels like a very oversold tech stalwart.  

**[IV and the Greeks:** Looks good to me, no major caution flags.  BUT, the bid/ask spread is a little wide.  This partially keeps it at C level; I‚Äôll probably put in a low bid, forget it, and see if the price action during the day gets the order filled.

**News confirmation and catalyst(s):**On Friday Lebron James announced he‚Äôs switching his KO sponsorship to a PEP sponsorship--which probably played into this UOA.  Looking into this more, I saw that it's an energy drink play and he's now attached to Mountain Dew's Rise energy drink.  Maybe PEP gets some price upgrades since people saw how much of a beast MNST has traditionally been, maybe this starts some conversation around the sector as a whole on CNBC, or maybe neither of those things happen.  BUT, with a relatively safe stock making a big name play leading into earnings, I'm willing to lose a little theta for a week to see if anything plays out.

**Position**: A relatively safe PEP 145c 2/12 while I play the waiting game for a week or so and reevaluate.  If it's smooth sailing, likely hold for a bit into the earnings run and sell before.

**FBüöÄüöÄ**: [Underlying= 251.36 / b: 252.50c, 257c 1/22, others (IV: 38% for 1/22, ~50% for 1/29)](https://i.imgur.com/gGXVZTA.jpg)

**Unusual Whale alert**: No

**Earnings Report**: 1/27

**Why I like it:** Welcome to earnings season for big tech, and FB is a steal right here.  They‚Äôve been pummelled, fairly or unfairly, in the ""censorship"" aftermath and is at a great level to bounce...you can't cuck the Zuck.  I have been seeing Fb calls with their own hedges trickle in like this since Wednesday and Thursday nonstop--there was some bad What's App backlash to their new privacy policy, but if anything that will be a tastier dip for Monday entry that is to be bought. 

**IV and the greeks:** slightly elevated IV because ER is coming, but fine.  Still plenty of room for an upward trajectory on IV/Vega.  The premium for 1/29 is a tad bit pricey, so if you can't afford that I'd look at a vertical call spread capping at 255 if you're going to play it with a close expiration.

**News confirmation and catalyst(s):** What's App issue is a potential albatross for tomorrow, but I do believe this will be a relatively smooth upward earning trajectory.  Also, their Oculus 2 demand numbers are going be through the roof and has great meme potential.  I don't usually hold through ER, but I may keep a lotto for this.  Been hovering around MA200, ready to bounce bounce.

**Position:** FB 1/29 255c, FB 2/19 260c

**DVN üöÄüöÄüöÄ**: underlying= 19.57 / **Orders**: 19.50, 20c, 21.50 1/22, many others with exp. from now to May. (IV high, around 100% on ATM weeklies) 
[DVN UOA](https://i.imgur.com/VL7iirc.jpg)

**Unusual Whales alert**: Yes

**Earnings Report:** Feb 16th

**Why I like it:** I've been seeing it pop up so much in clusters I can't ignore it any Longer. The volume has been intense in the whole sector.  [This Barron's article confirmed the activity I've been around energy.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/why-energy-could-have-a-tesla-like-2021-51610744972)  They compare it to TSLA--yes, TSLA.

**IV and the greeks**: IV is getting a bit high because of the overall energy spike, but I have confidence it's heading higher.  The bid/ask spread is problematic, though.  Will enter low and hope the order gets bought on a dip.

**News confirmation and catalyst(s):** aside from the call activity and the Barron's article pump, we have the inauguration for Biden to lay out a true vision for energy.  Early indications are that while solar, EV, etc are the hot names there is a place for truly evolving big oil companies.  They also just completed a merger on January 7th. Plus we have a nice dip tomorrow as an entry point with the Keystone news

**Positions**:  This is one that you buy LEAPS or monthlies on-- I'm looking at **2/19 121.5c and 3/19 121.5c **but I fully acknowledge that the bid/ask spread is a bitch at the moment.

**A list:**

[EDIT üöÄüöÄüöÄ](https://i.imgur.com/hgjrLgU.jpg): underlying = 76.14 / **Order**: 1/22 85c (IV 116%) 

**Why I Like It:** Ever since I missed the NIO/PLUG everything EV launch a couple months back, I've been looking for the next industry to go off.  Energy is one of my choices, the other is whatever the fuck is going on with Gene Editing.  Genetically constructed super-babies, so hot right now. I know ARKG exists as well, I consider that a part of this play too. 

**IV and the Greeks:** Unideal for the short term, as under 100% is a general rule of thumb, but I really like this as a long term hold--so much so that I'm going to recommend the S word here (ssssssshares).

**Confirmation and catalyst(s):**  [Barron's came out with this piece over the weekend,](https://www.barrons.com/articles/with-rare-speed-gene-editing-emerges-as-biotechs-new-cutting-edge-51610655079) which is part of what I'm sure that whale was chasing. 

>While gene-editing start-ups will lose money during years of clinical trials, it‚Äôs hard to say the stocks are overvalued. If their one-time interventions can cure diseases that otherwise require chronic treatment‚Äîor lack any treatment at all‚Äîthen the stocks will fly. 

**Position**: Opening up two LEAPs if I can get a dip so the 1/20/22 ask is only around 2,300.  Will chase on a 2/5 77 because the bid/ask spread on that strike is (relatively) reasonable and it feels doable. If this one is pricey for you consider call debit spreads.

**Two interesting trends from Friday UOA that I‚Äôm trying to connect some dots on:**

[1) Cruiseline puts were everywhere](https://i.imgur.com/AOuseNk.jpg)

I saw this enough that it made me think.  My hunch was that a lot of bad COVID recovery-stonk news is coming during inauguration (plus global trends).  That contrasted a little with the second interesting trend...

[2) Vaccines all got Unusual call options at various times](https://i.imgur.com/Z1AfJuF.jpg)
I saw MRNA got some UK upgrade attention today--maybe that was some of the reason, maybe that was none of the reason, but interesting nonetheless.

I checked Unusual Whales to see if they have any cruise alerts and they had the opposite of the orders I saw--a CCL 1/29 call alerted.  They also had MRNA 2/5 145 calls.  I'm going to stay away from the cruise puts, and probably go with some MRNA and NVAX 2/5 calls, slightly OTM depending where we open up.  It seems like the cruise puts were a hedge for a good week for vaccines. 

**Open Interest change notables**:

1) **Oil** saw huge OI increases for January and Feb expirations (XOM, PBR, etc).

2) **Uber** had huge OI increase for 2/19 both calls and puts.  Earning are 2/10

3) **F** and **GM** having obvious increases from their big splashes

4) **SRNE** had serious volume as well and lots of sporadic call buys

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

**Other options I saw I liked:** **BZUN 2/19 45c** **FEYE** 1/22 25c I will play as a 2/5, **WKHS** 25c 2/5

**Positions:**

**PEP** 145c 2/12

**FB** 1/29 255c, FB 2/19 260c

**DVN** 2/19 21.5c and 3/19 121.5c

**EDIT**: 2/5 77c

**INO/NVAX/MRNA** take your pick (Cruise puts hedge)
**EDIT: JUST NOTICED A 170c 1/22 NVAX I MISSED**

**VXX**: 1/29 18c and 19c. bigly hedged for inauguration shenigans. 

*waiting for a dip for some of these because I‚Äôm
Nervous about Thursday.* 

**TLDR**:
Energy, Gene editing, and Vaccines were all trending on Friday UOA.  FB has been getting a lot of call activity as well ahead of earnings.  PEP looks good for a run too on the heels of Lebron James signing pre-earnings.

l07ly5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l07ly5/dd_pltr_foundry_explanation_from_reformed_data/,DD - PLTR Foundry explanation from reformed data plumber,419,160,2021-01-19 08:16:51,"Hello fellow bagholders,

I am a palantir autist, aka, i've actually used foundry for 2-3 years at old workplace. I thought I'd write a piece to explain technically what it does, so you can feel more comfortable holding the bags and continue your confirmation bias.

# What is Foundry?

Foundry aggregates data from disparate systems and then allows non-technical users to combine, correlate, and chart it in many different ways. Here are how it works:

# Connect Data-Sources or upload data

Palantir uses a combination of Cassandra (for writing data quickly) and Parquet (for doing ad-hoc analysis) and SparkQL which helps do distributed data computing. I am not a data nerd, I don't understand this well, but it's much better than trying to do it yourself and getting eaten by Apache Alligators.

Enterprise users give authentication string to the Palantards, and they do either a pull or push from that data-store into Cassandra, which then writes it all over the place. Data analysis is done w/ Map-Reduce and Parquet tables to be ZOOOOOM.

I've seen people connecting p. much anything, whether it's Structued Query Language, Mongo, Comma-separated Value files (Automod didn't like the abbreviation), logs, excel spreadsheets, images, html, whatever. Can't say that it's a good idea connecting a bunch of these, but whatever we don't choose what garbage our employers like having their numbers and words in.

Anyway, data goes *PSSHHH* into Cassandra, Parquet goes *BRRR* and do SPEEDY data thing.

# Cleaning data using Blacksmith or code (Python or Apache Spark)

Okay, data is in AWS Parquet stores, but generally it sucks dick. Few examples of why it sucks:

* Country Code: US, USA, America, United States, US of A, MURIKA
* Name: Ree Tard, ReeTard, Ree, ree, Mr Ree Tard, Lord Ree\`Tard
* Date: 01/10/2021, 10th October 2021, 01/10/2021 (European though!)

So on, what this means is your data is super shit quality on ingestion. So you gotta write some code to look through all that data and make it Pristine *TM*. Nobody wants to make a chart seeing where all the retards who buy PLTR are from, and find that there are 40 variations of USA.

So you can do this with code, or something called Blacksmith. Blacksmith literally drag and drop simple web-ui click click delete garbage data, remove empty rows, format everything, replace dumb strings, etc.

Code gotta write stuff like.

       ^(?:(?:31(\/|-|\.)(?:0?[13578]|1[02]))\1|(?:(?:29|30)(\/|-|\.)(?:0?[13-9]|1[0-2])\2))(?:(?:1[6-9]|[2-9]\d)?\d{2})$|^(?:29(\/|-|\.)0?2\3(?:(?:(?:1[6-9]|[2-9]\d)?(?:0[48]|[2468][048]|[13579][26])|(?:(?:16|[2468][048]|[3579][26])00))))$|^(?:0?[1-9]|1\d|2[0-8])(\/|-|\.)(?:(?:0?[1-9])|(?:1[0-2]))\4(?:(?:1[6-9]|[2-9]\d)?\d{2})$ 

But we're all retarded so we use Blacksmith.

# Using Ontology Transformations

&#x200B;

[Palantir Ontology](https://preview.redd.it/g4dubmm6m6c61.jpg?width=1285&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28d1c6e899e6ee6e505d6359ba0d73e48c7926ff)

Okay, so you see this beauty. This is whats called a Data Ontology. The left-hand side is your data-sources, step after that is the cleaning of that degenerate excel data into pristine shit.

This is where either palantards or enterprise nerdgineers will write Python or SparkQL code to try to combine data-sets but mostly where it doesn't make sense. Business often asks synergistic process optimisation stuff like ""Hey Nerd, please correlate license plates, blood types, and Club Nintendo memberships, thanks"". I don't get it, but O+ Nintendo gamers are clearly national security threats to put an all-points bulletin out for.

Examples of use cases I know, there are plane assets, and each plane has parts, and each part has data about it's testing, and each test was performed by an engineer at a location etc. So immediate ability to determine whether any part was not validated by an engineer at any location, to improve safety for planes.

Other use case was we have an asset, that asset has these IP addresses, these vulnerability reports, these log feeds, these people owning and being accountable for it, it located in this area, it connected to these other assets and to these business processes, etc. Quick analysis of your risk posture for various computer assets.

Sounds confusing, but it makes sense if you look at it as a graph problem, and the ontology is a good visualisation for how shitty disparate data can be combined to get actionable information.

# Contour

After you get your ""I have all data in one view"" table after the ontology transformations, people need to make decisions based on it. Often having a piece of data is all well and good but good luck looking at a 100 column table and understanding it.

Enter Contour. Contours a web interface that lets you do a bunch of hectic cool data-graphing shit with no training needed. Just beep boop button click > INSIGHTS and AESTHETIC CHARTS.

You give so many options to people, that most of the time people can find a way to make whatever data they want conform to the outcome they are looking for. This is kinda useful to an enterprise, but mostly it keeps middle-management employed and happy, thus continuing to purchase additional palantir contracts and hype it up to their friends on the golf course, sponsored dinners, or businesstalk conferences. If you think that's a good thing, trust your instincts.

# Other Thoughts

Okay, so that's the gist of what Foundry is doing. Other things to note:

Forward Deployed Engineers are peeps who get shipped to workplaces worldwide and told to move excel datasheets into palantir for [250k a year](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Palantir/salaries/Software-Engineer/). Sweet gig, except it can be a mix between zero% and 120% stress level based on the retardation of the org you are working with. Since most orgs using Palantir are big enterprise, the retardation is higher than wallstreet bets and I bet you didn't think that was possible. forward deployed engineers have high turnover because they arent having fun working with weird requirements and usually take the job to get shipped to god knows where as a working holiday. They get paid better at [FANGMAN](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Facebook/salaries/Software-Engineer/) too.

Good news for Palantards is that since Palantir changes on-site employees every 3-6 months, it means nobody in the big enterprises or Palantir itself actually knows whats going on so any change and maintenance takes forever and are a consistent source of revenue.

Tech Expertise within enterprise is a sticking point too. [Banks](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Capital-One/salaries/Software-Engineer/Software-Eng/), [Government](https://apps.opm.gov/SpecialRates/2021/Table059301012021.aspx), etc don't pay big bucks for engineers compared to our FANGMANS, so the good peeps yeet off when possible. Generally, doing palantir ontology writing is literally doing plumbing except you get covered in shit always instead of occasionally. Either management asking why the transformation is taking so long (hint, 30 tables being pulled together at once is [N30 complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), no wonder it takes forever) or everything breaking from data edge cases (I can't believe we didn't think of people having a hyphenated last name???).

I know like 9 engineers hired to do palantir programming, all 9 left 3-4 months into the role to pickup literally anything else. One became an actual plumber. It means that ontologies aren't maintained and rot over time so the org needs to keep getting palantard's or new entry-level data people who leave after 3 months, aka the product sticks around forever. Bullish.

Shit is slow. They're dealing with huge data, but Cassandra and Parquet + Map-Reduce are only so effective. Especially because each org insists on their own private cloud tenancy.

Contour is good, but people can draw dumb insights from it. If you just click random buttons you can probably find a chart that looks like you can use it for whatever empire-building you're attempting. Since most users have no stats or science education, they can infer incorrectly or plainly mis-inform each other from cherry-picked data. Very bullish for middle management.

Locally, I know 6 organisations that use Palantir, 2 are banks, 4 are spooks, so that's a good sign. Palantir is very secretive about who their other clients are. Their clients at meetup events are happy to be open about where they work though. Funny that.

Once management gets used to clicking on stuff in Contour and having automated reports, they don't want it to go away or to have to learn anything else. This is why we still use Windows 20 years later. Palantir is addictive data-porn.

**TLDR**

Give an animal like 8 things to eat, animal eats it up, sacrifice the animal and look at the entrails, interpret the entrails with your confirmation bias and do random shit. Forward Deployed Shamans change identity every few moons and mostly get more food for the animals to eat. Entrails are surprisingly aesthetic and animal-sacrificing becomes addictive because of that.

Position: 350 shares at $30 diamond hands.  üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Edit: 3 x Rockets because on Blind, Palantir employees think the share price will hit $90 EoY rofl.

$NIO sold off toward the end of the week and is now sitting .3 CENTS ABOVE THE NEXT FIBONACCI RETRACEMENT LEVEL... PERFECT ENTRY POINT. Once we clear the next Fib trend level, near term prices could easily exceed $80+ and would further validate our trend line, which still appears bullish even after the selloff. Moral of my rant BTFD (BUY THE FUCKING DIP)

Great long opportunity especially considering a current RSI of sub 20 (way oversold) on no material changes in the company. We are still in a strong up-trend as can be viewed by the chart trend line and buying at an oversold level is an optimal entry point which is likely to continue given all technical factors.

There seems to be a common misconception that it's impossible to compete with Tesla. Think of Tesla like myspace. They were one of the first social media platforms with a successful business model, dominating the industry until Facebook had solutions for flaws in the system users didn't even realize existed. NIO isn't the next Facebook. But we're going to see something very similar unfold. The EV industry is still so young. Tesla basically created it's popularity and no one's had the chance to truly assess, adapt, and develop a business model that legitimately competes, until NIO.

Kick ass ET7 sedan they unveiled and next generation solid state batteries(providing 600+ miles of range on a single charge coming in the next year)

Battery as a service and battery swap stations are also taking off in China, this decrease upfront purchase price and longer range batteries makes $NIO eligible to continue receiving government subsidies unlike many competitors.

Tesla created the electric vehicle... NIO is reinventing the EV business.

This is also my first DD, so I apologize in advance for mistakes that may be present below. If you do see anything, please call it out in the comments.

Twitter ($TWTR) appears to be on sale, with good signs of upside. Twitter's share price has fallen substantially in light of allegations of censorship and removing Trump from their platform. Other firms in big tech have also experienced similar scrutiny by taking similar steps in light of recent events (i.e. FB and the Zucc). This has left shares on sale, with some appearingly positive buy signals on $TWTR.

Bull Case: Recent price trends and technicals may give an indication for price projections in the near future. While WSB might not like TA, I think it can be useful for making price projections, especially when used in conjunction with evidence from times it has worked previously.

[red = low where we are; blue = two other interesting lows](https://preview.redd.it/nojbl40jbyb61.png?width=1104&format=png&auto=webp&s=e35f91ec51393a44e36e1a02981f35a80efd8ff0)

The stock has a strong up trend-line (support, blue) that is touched 3-4 times over the duration of the pandemic rally (March-Present). The two blue arrows signify two important times this support has been touched previously and reversal ensues. At these two points, it also touches or partially penetrates the ichimoku cloud, which can act as an additional support level. Both are also marked by a distinct local minimum in RSI (of roughly 40) in the purple pane. After both of these lows, a substantial retracement occurs, often reaching the value of the previous high rapidly.

Note: values below are estimated

The pattern in these two lows suggests that once the price hits the support, it rapidly retraces to the previous high and then price increases in excess of the previous high. In this first, this is represented by a high of roughly 35 in June, falling to a low of 28 in July where it touches the trendline, and then rockets back to 35 within 2-3 weeks and then exceeding that value in the next weeks (gain of approximately 20% with a buy at 28 and sell target at 35). Similarly, in the second area this is represented by a high of roughly 52 at the end of October, falling to the indicated low of 40 at the start of November (indicated by the second blue arrow), which then rises to 52 in roughly 6 weeks (mid December), and then continues to increase beyond that. This represents a gain in excess of 25% from the low around 40 with a sell target at 52.

At present (red arrow), the stock is poised with the lowest RSI that's been seen in the pandemic rally, falling below 30. This suggests that the stock is oversold, and it is likely to experience a reversal in the near future. Moreover, the price is sitting just at the ichimoku cloud and near the trendline, two supports that were observed in the previous two examples. There is also additional resistance caused by a double bottom, as a result of another candle that shares a low with the current low price. This evidence suggests that TWTR will likely see a big move going upwards in the near future. Buying in now (45.18) and setting a price target around the previous high (55.87) could be return a profit of roughly 23% based on previous patterns. The time horizon for this gain is relatively short, with expectations of around 2-6 weeks based on the two previous trend-line touches (blue). With the oversold RSI condition, it may even be able to reach or exceed the target in a much faster time than previously.

Disclosure of Concerns: Currently the price has fallen below the up trendline (albeit not by much). If the price does fall further, this could indicate the trendline has been violated and the share price will collapse. I think due to the oversold RSI, this is unlikely and that the price is more likely to reverse back into the trading range. Moreover, while the ichimoku cloud does tend to act as a resistance, the price being inside the cloud often suggests greater risk of the stock moving sideways (note how after the second blue arrow, price increases much more slowly when it is trapped inside the cloud). Confirmation of a movement upwards or downwards should be sought before making any trades on twitter stock in light of these concerns. The climate around Twitter isn't positive at present, and this could prolong the amount of time before the the move completes, or even drive down the share price if the situation does not improve. Even after the Trump presidency has ended, twitter is likely to face additional controversy over decisions it may make with the incoming administration. One example is the suggestion that Twitter might reset follower counts to 0 for official White House accounts once the new administration enters. This could put twitter under greater scrutiny once the new administration takes office, with accusations of unfairness already in the air.

TLDR; $TWTR appears to have positive upside. Projections may suggest a gain of over 20% over a span of about 2-6 weeks based on previous price patters. However, there are multiple concerns present in the current climate surrounding the stock and some concerns regarding the current technical position.

Positions in $TWTR: None. I made this DD for fun. If you are interested in purchasing $TWTR shares or calls, I highly encourage doing your own DD before you buy in. This is not financial advice. All of the material presented is just opinion that needs to be verified and is subject to change."

I'm most likely too deep into GME to see the big picture, and that's why I want some perspective from other users here. Things just *appear* to align, but sometimes things happen on their own and isn't evidence of a conspiracy altogether. I want this to be the beginning of a discussion, and possible investigation, not the end of one. 

Here's the quick hypothesis, and I'll post some brief supporting pieces of data below.

The upcoming short squeeze has the old money scared as fuck, and pissed as fuck at us. They've altogether already lost *nearly a billion shorting GME.* I'd love to see that loss porn. 

Question: How much would it cost to hire a troll farm to start a disinformation campaign? Something to help distract even a portion of a large group of users away from their quarry? Astroturfing is a real big thing, it's been used all over reddit for at least the last 5 years or so, facebook, etc. With the recent election wrapped up, I suspect these troll farms probably have a lot of availability for large firms who have a lot to lose. For just a couple million dollars, they could save hundreds of millions, by infiltrating this subreddit. And I wonder if they have? I think it's a safe assumption they know about us. Especially after the mainstream attention we're getting.

So that's the hypothesis. And here's some of my supporting ideas that I'd really hesitate to call ""evidence"".

GME starts the blowup on Jan 13th. The very next day, the long dormant BB starts blowing up a little bit. I don't know when BB started getting pumped on this subreddit and I don't know where to find out, but I *suspect* that started on **the day** GME started blowing up.

On Friday the 15th, the day a lot of shorts have to be paid back in there was a massive push by brand new accounts, heavily pushing BB, and a lot of other things. A lot of ""fellow kids"" kinds of posts, every 10 seconds there was a new one. Most were filtered out by the mods, and a lot of them were down-voted quickly by people on /new. I'd be really interested in seeing some figures on this though, or maybe an opinion on how much more active Friday morning was compared to a normal day from a mod like /u/zjz for instance who I know was cleaning up a huge amount of garbage posts. 

To be fair there were a huge amount of garbage GME posts too. But I'd like to think after a 100% gain over 2 days there would be substantial buzz here, and with the MOASS on the horizon that we ALL know about, you'd think that GME would be once again the only topic of discussion here. But it was far less posted about from my totally subjective, totally biased perspective. 

After hours on Thursday, BB was also pumped up quite a massive amount. This is what I see as the bait at the end of the fishing hook. But then despite all of the YOLO posts I saw on /new the stock continued to drop throughout the day, ending back where it started at the EOB on Thursday. I don't know how much it would cost to pump BB from $9 to $10, but I bet it costs less than the billions hedge funds stand to lose on GME going through the roof.

So I know this sounds nuts. I know I'm biased, and I'm trying to make sense of yesterday. But also, doesn't some of this align too well? Can anyone with the means pull some numbers together to see if this hypothesis holds water?

Also, see you on the moon everyone! :)"

A while ago I started mixing unusual options activity into my ~~gambling~~investing.  At first I lost a shitload of money chasing dumbass whales with zero plan, but now I actually have a pretty good feel for it.  I still fuck up alot, but more often I do not fuck up.  This is to help those of you who want to start chasing whales, or are at a basic level and want to do it better.

I'm using some plays from this week as examples because they are fresh in my mind and I have a couple screenshots.

**Tools**
I use barchart in tandem with Unusual Whales. For barchart, you can honestly get by using their free version, you just can't sort as well.  They have a free month trial too.  I also pay the 20 bucks for Unusual Whales to confirm what I scan, and they have a good stocks volume standard deviation tool.  I have zero affiliation to either, just saying what I use.

There are way more technical ways to do this, but I like to use my eyes to scan sporadically throughout the day like a boomer.

**Basic Concept**
Long story short, you're ideally chasing the options purchases of what are, presumably, deep-pocketed individuals or institutions.  UOA identifies certain options contract orders that are higher than the average daily contract order.  For example, if the average daily option volume on an GME weekly is 4,000, and an option order enters for 4,000 or higher, it's flagged as unusual activity since it's a multiple of that daily average volume--sometimes it shows as multiple orders if ""they"" push through a few smaller purchases that produce heavy volume.

MM are sneks who like to move in silence, which they can do with with stock positions via dark pools and the like.  However, they can't get away with that with options activity--it all shows.  That fact, young autist, is your slingshot against the institutional goliath.

**Hunting the Whale**
So I've got my unusual options activity page open on barchart or wherever for the current day.  I adjust the expiration date option so that the options I'm looking at don't expire past a couple weeks out (more on why later), then I'm ready to eye scan.

I typically start by looking for **one of two things: 1) large clusters of orders that belong to one ticker  or 2) sporadic orders for a ticker that consistently show up over a couple hours, but belong to non-hot, non-meme stonks that do NOT have earnings imminent.**  To make sure I'm looking at something potentially weird, I choose to exclude options that expire more than a couple weeks out.

**1) Clusters of orders‚ÄîABNB example**
The way I scope it is kind of a tiered process.  *First*, I'm looking to see if there are any clusters of orders that catch my eye on a quick scan.  *Second*, I'm looking to see if those clusters of orders contain both calls AND puts, with some OTM activity and spreads preferred.  *Third*, I look to see if the number of seperate call orders outweighs the number of put orders (or vice versa), and additionally I look to see if the volume of the calls drastically outweighs the volume of the puts (or vice versa).  

**Why?  Because it helps you determine if the options order is just a hedge, or if it‚Äôs hedging against itself as it‚Äôs own positio**n. This is super important so try to follow along-- most UOA is just institutions hedging; Mr. MM has a nice, busy life and fancy yacht and can't just exit his positions back and forth all day like a WSBer.  He also has like a billion shares of his stonks, so if he dumps it when he's got paper hands it will siginficantly tank the value and cause a ripple effect.  So, *instead* of hedging by dumping his shit, he hedges by adding OTM options against his position--next level fucking diamond hands.  That would be the type of whale order from Mr. MM we don't want to follow.  *But*, if Mr. MM buys 4,000 FB call options in a few blocks, and you see like 1,000 in FB puts go through right alongside it, the odds are that someone is betting big on FB and using the puts as a hedge, since the puts represent a smaller volume in the call/put ratio.  Instead of the options being a hedge for a bigger stock position they hold, these types of option clusters indicate that the option order itself is the big, independent play, and it's hedging itself with lower volume order vs the higher volume (4,000 calls to 1,000 puts).

**Then I do an easy confirmation**.  I check the tickers general trend the past week or so in a chart, do a news search on twitter of their ticker for news catalysts and sentiment, and google and YouTube to see if the crayola kids think it's a good nerd play.

**Example**: Here's the screenshot on some ABNB UOA I noticed and played this week.  It went to 200% and change within a couple hours, but I had unfortunate diamond hands and sold for about half that.

So, this a softball.  **First**, you can see that ABNB all of a sudden explodes with all these options showing up at 12:52‚Äìthat's our cluster.  **Second**, the clusters have both calls and puts in that minute timespan, with some put orders showing at the bottom of the cluster.  Some of the calls are deep OTM, as far as 200c.  **Third**, the call orders far outweigh the put orders in both amount and volume.  *Awwwww shit, looks like we got more than a hedge‚Äîwe‚Äôre onto something.*

**Confirmation time**: ABNB had been on a general uptrend, and I typically don't like to chase, but I combed twitter and saw their were rumors of the CEO speaking the following day, and that news had just broken of their DC booking cancellations.  I looked back into the morning, and saw a few more unusual blocks, and a few more rolled in just after the cluster pictured above.

Passed the smell test.  Options bought, tendies gained.

**Sparse Orders: SNAP example**

The same principles can apply to orders on tickers that pop up individual orders, not large clusters,  which **a) haven‚Äôt had much attention b) have been on a steep downtrend‚Äîthis makes the order unusual, and/or c) seem to keep popping up in single orders over a few hours to a day.**The same principles as above apply, but if you see these types of orders with very little time left until expiration, you can assume assume it's probably not a hedge.  SNAP isn't the best example of the week because there wasn't a put order in this block.  But, there was positive TA sentiment when I searched, SNAP had been on an oversold downtrend, and I don't have screenshots left of the better ones I saw and went after.  **Plus, importantly, IT WAS TOWARDS THE END OF THE DAY** (this is huge, EOD is prime time for AH news whales)

[SNAP UOA](https://i.imgur.com/GGr5bra.jpg)

A better example from this week though is SPCE, which had only a few orders sprinkled throughout the day, and one toward the end of the day which was DEEP, DEEP OTM expiring 1/15.  **That‚Äôs a flag for us‚Äîsporadic listing throughout the day, OTM toward the end of the day. ** BAM! EOD SPCE OTM calls sprinkle in, ARK invests to kick off AH, SPCE moons. 

**Sparse Orders Patterns: Connecting the dots on tech rebound with FB and SNAP**

Seeing the SNAP orders above sharpened my eyes that day to looking for a pattern with tech on the whole, since big tech had been so royally gaped the past week.  I kept seeing FB options like this pop up

[https://i.imgur.com/muVGtq2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/T54peER.jpg)

Sometimes you can put together sporadic listings and create a working theory based on a sector.  Because this and similar FB orders were deep OTM and one day out, I knew there was a risk they could a hedge, but also knew that the tech sector was due for a rebound and saw SNAP posting sporadic OTM as well.  **So, I bought my options for each of those two another week out and closer to ATM (important, more below), to give the whale some breathing room** in case was it was a hedge, even though the technicals agreed with the bounce.  The whales were right, and it was an easy little overnight profit.


**How I‚Äôve Fucked Up 1: Don‚Äôt get tricked by trends**

Although we like to believe institutions are ahead of the curve, often they are just trend-riding lemmings who follow what's already way, way up.  They buy the top, just like WSB tardies such as yourself specialize in.  So, when you see shit like this below, take a minute to think before you get excited:

[NIO UOA LIKE THIS WAS NONSTOP](https://i.imgur.com/JCZBx2s.jpg)

It was the same for all the memes: PLUG, FCEL, MARA, and RIOT all week, dominating the orders.  If something is already too popular, just stay away from it.  You can ride something up, but when you see massive orders on shit that's already like 400% IV, just...don't.

**How I‚Äôve Fucked Up 2: DO give the MM‚Äôs some breathing room**

*Even if you‚Äôre confident in a move you see that is a few days out, extend your play a week or two further out minimum, and strike it closer to ATM.*  If you can't do either of those things because you can't afford the premium just skip that play and check back for something new later; I promise a better opportunity will arise.  You can recover from bagholding, but you cannot recover from blowing your account on an incorrect 0DTE.

Breathing room is also important because often whales will have the news but not the exact timing.  Two months ago I followed a DDOG whale on a Thursday 1DTE that expired worthless the next day.  The following Monday (1 trade day later) DDOG made the announcement that rocketed them like 20%--if I'd given them a week's breathing room, it would've been a 15 bagger.  Fucking F.

**So, to review:** look for order clusters or sporadic ticker orders that a) have a mix of calls and puts with one dominating the other b) unpopular tickers that have deep OTM or close expirations c) always check chatter afterward and fundamentals and d) try to put together a narrative of things that are related that catch your eye (this Monday's EV run or this Friday's tech bounce could be next week's airline dominance or cruiseline craze--connect the dots).  Initially look for options expiring soon, as they indicate the most riskiness--and therefore confidence--if the MM is not hedging.  Shop with a short term eye, buy with a long term choice. 

**10 Things That Will Help You Not GUH:**

**1)** Monday and Friday morning/afternoon are the most accurate whale times, according to data from Unusual Whales

**2)** If you don't have PDT always save some spending power for EOD shopping

**3**) If you don't have PDT never, ever follow a whale with a weekly.  Sometimes the news the whale bets on is a 'sell the news' event, and you won‚Äôt recover from a drop especially if there is IV crush involved. 

**4)** Always give the whale breathing room by purchasing an expiration at least a week further out

**4b**) Always give the whale breathing room by going closer to ATM strikes than theirs

**5)** Sign up for barchart monthly trial (then continue it) and unusual whales--they're each like 20 bucks and thats way less than you spend on an FD. 

**6**) You don't need to learn TA, but you need to check technicals on the tickers you want to chase--almost every major ticker has youtubers or fintwits giving their daily or weekly TA.  This way you know if it's a proper breakout happening if the whale hits, and you're not just guessing at when to take profits.  Remember, whales can buy wayyyyyyy OTM and sell for massive profit at any point--they *aren‚Äôt* bagholding a call until it's in the money like you are. You may be 10% up waiting for the next 80% GME day while your whale has sold at their target 5% profits on the play and is chillin. 

**7**) Leave at least 10% of your account spending power free each day.  I promise, the one time you go full boat you will see the most obvious whale play at the end of the day.  Then you won't be able to do shit about it and you'll hate yourself when it's a 10 bagger overnight.  Trust me.

**8**) Make sure the ticker you're chasing isn't just ER anticipation/bets.  Always check earnings dates before buying.

**9**) Remember whales are people, so they can be stupid, too.  Don't baghold a position that is clearly fucked for some news that looks unlikely to come.  They are gambling addicts just like you, except they have more money.

**10**) Always take profits if you ask yourself if it's time to.  If it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to close the position.

**Positions**:
Dumped a ton of stuff and loading up Tuesday because long weekends scare me, but saw some ineresting 2/5s I held including

WKHSc
PLTRc
SPYc (1/19, 1/22)
LMNDp

And a couple tickers that I couldn‚Äôt post lol.  also have AAPL and JD leaps

***

TLDR
Use a service to follow whales so you can get ahead of announcements.  Look for clusters of options activity that hedge themselves via call/put ratio, and do a legitimate check for TA and catalysts to confirm their moves.  Never follow a whale into a weekly, but use weeklies are your best screener.

***

*I might do a pretty consistent DD post (a couple times a week) on what I‚Äôm seeing at the end of each day if there is interest, and if it‚Äôs not a day I don‚Äôt have a ton of real work.  If something quick catches my eye I usually throw it up on my twitter @yourboymilt (there‚Äôs no notification thing on here mods, just trying to be helpful‚Äî not selling anything) I‚Äôll also probably throw some more potential Monday positions on here over the weekend once I decide to do some more research.  Later.*"

So I‚Äôm scrolling through fb at 5am bored, waiting for the market to open. The Robinhood group is talking about fubo tv. I‚Äôm half awake and look at the chart and notice it hit ATH at $60 Tuesday. I‚Äôm expecting a mini rally before it goes to shit. Based on the analyze tool, the trade was a guaranteed winner as long as the stock didn‚Äôt close below $20 a share at exp (td has never forced me out a trade), it was at $40, and ipoed around $15ish but traded around $25ish.

One of my accounts with TD had Apple call spreads worth $50 for earnings and $0.70 buying power yet the system allowed the trade to go in premarket yesterday. I‚Äôm confused as hell why this is going in but assume it will autocorrect at 8-9am. I forget about it.

9:30am, I sell my nflx 500/505c exp fri for $150, too early ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è it shoots up to $400 15 minutes later
I sell my amzn 3080/3085c for $320 too early

I notice fubo executes and shit is it volatile. I have no idea what to do. The mid point was $19.50 premarket, I put in $17ish thinking no way it executes. It drops to $14.50, comes back positive for a few seconds before staying around 14-15 mark. TD for the first time ever forces me out the position. I have to eat a $335 loss. Thank god I didn‚Äôt add leverage. TD rep has no idea why the system allowed the order to go through. 

Fast forward now, the system is still accepting covered call orders for Fubo with no cash required upfront! It‚Äôs letting me buy multiple contracts despite my account not being able to afford it. It‚Äôs allowing me to place an order to short 100 calls and buy the stock which would cost about $300k. 

This only seems to work for fubo stock. I tried Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Airbnb, and even cheaper prices and it didn‚Äôt work.

*Live Updates*

&#x200B;

**First Post:**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuwg1e/i\_have\_a\_discount\_trading\_bot\_which\_gives\_out/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuwg1e/i_have_a_discount_trading_bot_which_gives_out/)

&#x200B;

**Background:**

* My discount bot to help /r/wallstreetbets. It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.
* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.
* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.
* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.
* There are a lot of SPY500/""boomer"" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.
* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.
* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement
* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only
* This is a one man bot.

&#x200B;

**Bot Overview**:

It's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits. Backtesting has not been done, do not YOLO your life savings into whatever stated risking it all.  Rather use this as a side tool.

&#x200B;

**Key:**

* Pharma companies are very risky.
* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.
* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.
* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).
* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.
* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.
* Take the ""Calls"" as very discounted, and ""Potentially A Call"" as somewhat discounted.
* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.
* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.
* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.

Alright everyone. Poshmark will soon be joining the ""Becky Index"" with a much anticipated IPO tomorrow morning. While I wouldn‚Äôt define myself as a necessarily intelligent (or competent) investor, but I am very familiar with the platform and the re-commerce industry as a seller and buyer.

I‚Äôve been selling people‚Äôs used shit since high school, in an attempt to finance a previous weed addiction. Fast forward 4 years and I have still been selling people‚Äôs used shit, though now the funds are going toward monthly Model 3 payments I am underwater for. That said, I‚Äôve been selling used clothing and have completed a bit over $300k in gross sales through various ‚Äúre-commerce‚Äù platforms such as eBay, Amazon, FB Marketplace, Mercari, Grailed, and Poshmark. eBay is the most well established platform for used clothing sales and thus wins for market share, but Poshmark wins in nearly every other category- which I have broken down below.

&#x200B;

[Yes, I am one of us](https://preview.redd.it/1nroqslei8b61.jpg?width=2902&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1df27f7feea578af8e41262d689dea6c260f84fe)

Before we get started, it is important to understand what the hell $POSH is and why it is a buy below $50. Poshmark is essentially eBay, though marketed towards Millennials, Gen XYZ etc, and those who value convenience. *Poshmark is a leading social marketplace for new and secondhand style for women, men, kids, home, and more.*

The social media aspect is a bit of a spectacle, as no one really wants to socialize and add ‚ÄúPoshmark Stories‚Äù of their shit to get a sale- but this method does succeed in retaining returning customers and rewarding sellers whoa re active on the platform. Because of this, the average time spent on poshmark is 27 minutes a day, which is less than, although comparable to that of social media sites like TikTok and Instagram- rather than the likes of eBay, Depop, or Mercari. The company also turned a profit of $20.9 last year, which is bullish considering the amount of money they burn and COVID.

**Selling fees:**

Poshmark has ridiculous selling fees, although it has proven to be beneficial in respect to revenue. The platform makes money by charging a fee for every sale: 20 per cent for items more than $15, and a flat fee of $2.95 for items under $15 that are less than that. Products worth more than $500 must be sent to Poshmark for evaluation, but the average order value is $33. 20% is ridiculous, especially considering that this does not include shipping costs of the seller/buyer. All the other platforms take a standard deviation around 10%, which begs the question why the fuck do they charge so much. People complain but continue to use the platform because of the next point- shipping.

**Shipping:**

For the past few years, the platform and its social media/YouTube influences have been aggressively marketing towards stay at home mothers and teenage girls. These aren‚Äôt your typical streetwear wannabe EnTrePenUeR businessmen, and Poshmark certainly knows that. They supply USPS Priority Mail shipping labels for every. single. fucking. order. Have a 2oz necktie that would ship for $2.62 USPS first class? Fuck that. Poshmark send you a $7.11 Priority Mail label that will arrive to your buyers doorstep faster than Amazons COVID shit prime delayed delivery. While a cost deterrent for lower value items and cheap buyers, this system simplifies the selling process of needing to calculate shipping costs and having to deal with various mail carriers. Packages rarely gets lost and any lost package issues are generally covered by Poshmark or the insure USPS provides through Priority Mail.

&#x200B;

[Less shipping hassle = more time for sellers do shit like this](https://preview.redd.it/iq6b6102i8b61.jpg?width=1484&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=673b69586ea4bdf52c8965da9c89c49d8cd48c26)

$7.11 is cheaper than my Ebay rate for any priority mail, so I also give this one to Poshmark as they seem to have worked something out with USPS. For eBay, if I can shove a pair of Jeans into a Flat Rate Envelope it will cost me $7.59 to ship. Any heavier or larger clothing items cost me, on average, about $9-14. While this last part is speculation, I do believe that Poshmark does get a kickback or receive some commission from every label. The cost has risen about $2 in the past couple years, which is a higher percentile than the USPS shipping rate increase.

**Convenience:**

Buyers love convenience, and poshmark certainly does well in that regard. Poshmark is a large SoCiAl MeDiA MarKetPace, giving them access to a fuckload of your data. When you sign up, you can add the city you live in, university, job etc. You also have the ability to like and share items.

Both of these combined, allow the app to recognize who you are what what type of items you may be interested in buying. My homepage looks the same as my closet at home, shoving new items, markdowns, etc from brands I am much too familiar with.

A lot of purchases tend to be of impulse on the buyer, which is good for sellers since Poshmark doesn‚Äôt allow returns (unless fake/ruined/ not as described). I have a handful of buyers asking me to return items every week because they don‚Äôt like the color, fit, or price; I tell them to fuck off and Poshmark gets to keep the commission. For reference, my return rate on eBay is about 7% for no reason.

I just sold this Ikea Rug today that I was too lazy to return. I paid $10 for it and the buyer most likely saw the nice stock photos on their homepage and failed to crosscheck the price on IKEA. Convenience of the homepage.

**SEO:**

I study rhetoric so I have no fucking clue how to rank or asses the SEO of a company, but look for any used clothing brand and Poshmark will generally be the first to show up on google. If that doesn‚Äôt signify good SEO, idk remember I study rhetoric.

&#x200B;

**Market share:**

In terms of Fashion and clothing APPS, I think Poshmark does fairly well. An in depth DD would reference technology, social media, and e-commerce platforms as well- but I‚Äôll just include a graph I found.

[Chart](https://preview.redd.it/h7rm9we7i8b61.jpg?width=1450&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05dcf73e82484e67a62d5df146ef327c05a0f1ae)

In terms of their presence online, I think Poshmark does the best job engaging with their users. They are constantly reposting buyers and sellers images on instagram- making it somewhat of an incentive to use the platform and engage with others in the community. I‚Äôve been posted a few times on their instagram page and story. As a seller, I‚Äôve also been invited out to drinks with some of the staff in SF. Was all food and drinks at the bar covered by Poshmark? Idk ask my Jonny Walker Blue.

&#x200B;

[They follow me on IG lol](https://preview.redd.it/rk0sby59j8b61.png?width=1617&format=png&auto=webp&s=202d187e321d43163c5a0c197284992ad3e1bdda)

I do about 5x the amount in sales on eBay, and have never engaged in any form of communication with anyone not from their Philippines call center. I understand eBay is significantly larger, but this does show that Poshmark‚Äôs ethos is something different and much appreciated in the re-commerce industry.

&#x200B;

[They probably spent $10k renting the bar for 2 hours. There was were 10 sellers, including myself](https://preview.redd.it/hj58ify9i8b61.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab39b5983c504e6440b825746dec912ecea8d34f)

**IPO:**

As a long time seller, I was offered direct offering shares which I have committed to. They were planning on $32-39 but I have been notified that the IPO price will be $42 with an offering size of 6,600,000. I‚Äôm not much of a share guy, so I will also be buying 100c leaps when they become available.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kadpoz8ci8b61.jpg?width=634&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=60d0f4976e1d916140397996f5871cb1bcd51d7e

**TLDR:** I think Poshmark is a great platform, doing very different things than traditional selling platforms. Much higher fees and seamless shipping integration makes the platform a winner. They are valued as a selling platform, but they are much more than simply just that. Can you buy Lululemon pants at $GME? No, but you can on Poshmark. I also have not proofread this post at all.

Re-commerce is covid proof. I'm going 50% $POSH and 50% $EBAY this year. Fourth quarter has been consistently the best for online clothing resellers. When they release 2020 Q4 earnings, just watch :)

Edit: Formatting is fuk. Also Poshmark opened at $102"

BB makes their money from licensing, cybersecurity (one of the only companies that have not been hacked in this SolarWind shit), BB QNX is already in 175 MM cars worldwide, partnered with XPEV, and is in talks with multiple Tier 1 automakers, 20 different OEMs, and will be in vehicles by 2023. Does that mean anything now? Yes, you dumbass. Per CEO John Chen, my new president, #DidYouKnow @BlackBerry has been selected by 19 of the top 25 #ElectricVehicle manufacturers, and they represent 61% of the Electric Vehicle market?

Bubblicious and sexy. Expect some of the big tier 1s like Nissan, Toyota, BMW, and others to jump on this train. Think TSLA doesn‚Äôt have competition? Bitch they cant even make a billion dollars unless they sell stock (which since MS just upgraded their price, I bet they offer at least $5B in stock in the coming days).

BIDU's new EV? Yep BB. 

Events for this week:

I‚Äôm not going to go into deep detail here as it is quite intricate and all I know is that BB won a suit against fuckerberg $FB related to messaging, whatsapp, and something else. $FB has till January 15th, 2020 to settle, see here: https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.331602/gov.uscourts.cand.331602.144.0.pdf

They also had were at the JPM Auto and Tech conference yesterday, here's my recap: Takeaways from $BB $JPM conference: tons of value, competition isn't even comparable, 7 big rev streams possible from BB &QNX and IVY on top of it is a huge add on, IVY is 50-50 with $AMZN (dev and all. It is not some AWS relationship). There is INSANE value here. TSLA can be a customer. They have a HUGE percentage of the EV world already are customers of BB. QNX by BB is in 175 MM cars already. 

This shit is only at 4x sales, and by the end of 2021, it will be at 10x sales with sales at least doubling. Watch their new revenue streams.

Recent new customer and order that no one is talking about: https://www.electrive.com/2021/01/11/huge-order-for-lion-electric-trucks-from-amazon/ 2025 delivery order already created and guess what, it definitely will have IVY by BB and AMZN. no one is talking about this shit.

The above is over a year old. So what is Fitbit, and why am I posting this now, then?


Fitbit is an American electronics and fitness company which focuses on health-related metrics, tracking, and data analysis. For you, what you need to know is that it sells smartwatches. 

Anyone who cares about watches or fashion at all, you might have heard of Fitbit. As someone who used to be big on high fashion about 2-3 years ago, Moncler was a suave yet not over-the-top brand that a lot of rich Asians and Khabib Nurmagomedov wore. https://i.imgur.com/tiONi3I.jpg. Personally for me, Fitbit has a lot of resemblance - popular enough for the cool kids wear and know, and still good for the boomers due to the functionality. 


Fitbit is ranked 5th worldwide in shipments for watches, behind notably Apple, Samsung, and Xiaomi. https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS46122120


Back in 2019, some of you boomers here might recall an announcement by Google, with plans to acquire Fitbit at a 2.1 Billion dollar USD transaction, which was halted by various legislative and activist communities due to the ongoing battle vs. FAANG+M (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, GOOG(Alphabet) + Microsoft). See: Facebook vs. US of A currently. Let me give you the spoilers on this stuff for the upcoming Biden Administration and the near future: it doesn't matter. 

https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22158271/googles-fitbit-deal-eu-regulator-approval


Big techs rule the world, that's why they are boomer stocks at this point, that's why they are blue chips. Stonks only go up? None of this exists to today without the big tech companies starting the trend and movement into this digital era, into this technological boom. Your teachers use Google to find their sources despite telling to you keep your nose in the books. Your very own senators representatives and law-makers, voting about the 25th Amendment, revisit the constitution thru Google, while actively voting against big-techs taking over the world, using... Google. 


The very same Google is bent on acquiring Fitbit, and has received a conditional-yet-final approval from the EU commission, and will be soon to follow in the USA, I presume not long after the transition of power on the 20th. Google will acquire Fitbit due to their previous failure to breach into the smartwatches market, which exploded some ~4-5 years ago. Apple currently dominates the market, and Google wants a piece. Do you think Google will sit by idly and watch one of their prime competitors claim the throne without contest?


Google recently filed a patent for a smartwatch-design which includes a heartrate tracker. It's very unlikely that after their past attempts at breaking into the watches market, that they will go ahead and just, ""TrY aGaIn"" without the proper measures taken. Fitbit is that proper measure, it's the acquisition which will get them the entry footing they need, to grow. https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-fitness-band-design-revealed-uspto/


But the biggest reason why I'm in Fitbit right now, is because it's a tech-involved product maker coming out of the COVID pandemic, consistently beating earnings expectations for the last 2 quarters of the pandemic, about to report yet another earnings in... ~3 weeks, speculated 1st/2nd week of February. Premiums are beyond dirt cheap also, the stock's been sideways for a year since Google's acquisition announcement over a year ago. Get in before the holiday earnings in early February.


**TL;DR**
- $FIT is a watch company being acquired by Google, after long halts from various legislators and committees.

- Earnings are coming up, have consistently been beat during the pandemic, smart watch market grew ~80% YOY in 2019 and Fitbit's revenues grew during pandemic.

- Premiums are dirt cheap, stock has long to run. If $PTON can grow into 2021, $FIT will certainly rise from the ashes.

Down on all, been in for over a month on all of them, some longer. Will be burnt for January calls. Time your calls to the ides of February or after - earnings are definitely not priced in.

Here‚Äôs what the bot stated under discounted companies...,50,11,2021-01-13 23:03:53,"Wednesday, 13 January 2021

*Live Updates*

&#x200B;

**First Post:**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuwg1e/i\_have\_a\_discount\_trading\_bot\_which\_gives\_out/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuwg1e/i_have_a_discount_trading_bot_which_gives_out/)

&#x200B;

**Background:**

* My discount bot to help /r/wallstreetbets. It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.
* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.
* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.
* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.
* There are a lot of SPY500/""boomer"" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.
* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.
* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement
* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only
* This is a one man bot.

&#x200B;

**Bot Overview**:

It's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits. Note: that this has not been efficiently back tested. 

&#x200B;

**Key:**

* Pharma companies are very risky.
* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.
* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.
* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).
* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.
* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.
* Take the ""Calls"" as very discounted, and ""Potentially A Call"" as somewhat discounted.
* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.
* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.
* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.

Welcome to Wednesday. Here are your pre-market movers & news this AM-

#[Today's Top Headlines for Wenesday, January 13th, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-13-2021.html)

# 5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday

*****

> # 1. Stocks set for modest drop
> * U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday, a day after Wall Street resumed its 2021 upswing with modest gains. The fallout from last week‚Äôs Capitol riot and the push to impeach President Donald Trump have been keeping a lid on market moves this week. Rising rates in the bond market, with the 10-year Treasury yield over 1.1%, have also been a headwind for stocks. However, ahead of Wednesday‚Äôs trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 were less than 1% away from their records. The Nasdaq was just over 1% away from its record high.

> * Target said Wednesday comparable sales rose 17.2% in November and December. While online sales remained robust during the pandemic, shoppers also visited Target‚Äôs stores and spent more money per purchase than they did last holiday season. Target‚Äôs same-day curbside pickup grew by more than 500%, while sales fulfilled by its Shipt delivery service grew more than 300% during the holidays. Target shares were relatively flat in premarket trading.

*****

> # 2. House to impeach Trump
> * Trump is on the verge of being impeached for a second time. The House set the unprecedented vote for Wednesday, exactly one week after supporters of the outgoing president attacked the U.S. Capitol. While no House Republicans voted for Trump‚Äôs first impeachment, this time a small but significant number, including third-ranking GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, will join Democrats.

> * Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has reportedly told associates he thinks Trump committed impeachable acts, though it‚Äôs not known if the Kentucky Republican would vote to remove the president. A conviction in the Senate, even after Trump leaves office, would prevent him from becoming president again. It‚Äôs unclear if the Senate would try to hold Trump‚Äôs impeachment trial before President-elect Joe Biden‚Äôs inauguration next Wednesday.

*****

> # 3. Pence rules out 25th Amendment
> * The House is moving ahead with its impeachment vote after Vice President Mike Pence ruled out invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump. The House on Tuesday night passed a resolution calling on Pence and the Cabinet to push Trump out of office over his role in fomenting the Capitol attack. In a letter to House Speak Nancy Pelosi, Pence wrote, ‚ÄúI do not believe that such a course of action is in the best interest of our Nation or consistent with our Constitution.‚Äù

> * Speaking publicly Tuesday for the first time since last week‚Äôs siege, Trump did not take any responsibility for the mob violence and warned a second impeachment could be dangerous for the country. Later in the day at the border wall in Texas, Trump made a vague threat against Biden while insisting Pence and his Cabinet won‚Äôt remove him from office.

> # 4. YouTube suspends Trump account
> * YouTube on Tuesday suspended Trump‚Äôs account, saying the president uploaded content that violated its policies, though it did not specify any videos. The so-called strike-one on the platform prevents new uploads for a minimum seven days. ‚ÄúGiven the ongoing concerns about violence, we will also be indefinitely disabling comments on President Trump‚Äôs channel,‚Äù said YouTube, owned by Alphabet‚Äôs Google unit. YouTube‚Äôs decision to freeze Trump‚Äôs account follows the indefinite suspension of the president‚Äôs Facebook and the permanent suspension of his Twitter.

> # 5. Operation Warp Speed chief resigns
> * Operation Warp Speed Chief Adviser Dr. Moncef Slaoui has submitted his resignation at the request of the incoming Biden Covid team, under a plan that would see him stay in the role for a month to help with the transition, according to two people familiar with the situation. Though the initial vaccine rollout has been criticized, the speed of their development, which Slaoui oversaw, exceeded expectations, with two vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna approved for emergency use in the U.S. by the FDA.

> * The U.S. will soon require all airline passengers to prove they recently tested negative for Covid-19 before flying to the country, the CDC said Tuesday. The measure, which aims to curb the spread of the disease, comes as new infections hit records. The U.S. reported a record 4,327 daily Covid deaths Tuesday. Starting Jan. 26, arriving American citizens and foreign travelers will have to test negative for Covid-19 within three days of their flight to the U.S.

Well if ETSY is mooning, you know what else is going to follow, the site where people *advertise* their ETSY stores, Pinterest. Not convinced?

Pinterest is:

-	A safe social media company without the baggage and politics of Facebook/Twitter/Instagram/Google, people see it as a cute website for crafts, cooking, and home decor. Meaning it won‚Äôt be targeted by Dems for a breakup or attacked by conservatives for free speech. Might even benefit from a breakup of Facebook/Instagram. Funds might want to use them for social media exposure instead of the big boys.
-	Technically set up for a run. It just bounced off the 20 SMA and as of today is having a bullish MACD crossover. It‚Äôs breaking through it‚Äôs resistance at the ATH on big volume (institutional buying).
-	Will certainly have a preanticipatory run up from now to earnings in early February. It unexpectedly blew earnings out of the water last time with everyone staying home looking for things to do, bringing in that sweet sweet ad revenue. After earnings it gapped up big league and went on a run for 2 months. Only in the past few weeks has it been cooling off as the hype died down. Once they announce their earnings date, people/institutions will remember the massive gap up and try front running it.
-	Q4/December ad rates are even higher than Q3 and more people were looking for Christmas gifts and Christmas decorating ideas, and baking holiday cookies. So expect an even bigger earnings beat, but this time it‚Äôll likely be factored in ahead of time.
-	Smart/big money has already started accumulating the past couple of days during the dip.
-	To top it off, our girl Cathie loves them and ARK thinks they‚Äôre the future of the internet (included in ARKW). Also means they get pumped whenever ARK gets inflows (so when Tesla is on a run Pinterest benefits).

If looking at the chart and common sense still doesn‚Äôt convince you, all you have to do is hit up any single woman you know between the ages of 20 and 40 (if they‚Äôll even talk to you) and ask them how they‚Äôre spending they‚Äôre time during CoViD, especially if they‚Äôre not dating right now. Chances are they‚Äôre browsing Pinterest for home redecorating ideas, baking recipes, home exercise routines, and crocheting ideas.

Going to hit/surpass ATH by EoW easy. Price target of $90 by earnings, based on Fib extensions if you believe in TA. Get in now ahead of the trend before the crowd catches on and dumb money starts pouring in, possibly even during Power Hour EoD.

Positions:
85c February 12

75c February 5

73c January 22"

I have been writing this post for several days, and I have been trying to find the simplest way to persuade people to starting buying deep calls on FB.

This is all about Other Revenue, specifically the Oculus Quest 2, the first stand alone independent VR headset.

**Other revenue.** Other revenue consists of revenue from the delivery of consumer hardware devices and net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure, as well as revenue from various other sources.  - This is straight from their last 10Q.

&#x200B;

[Other revenue figures ](https://preview.redd.it/o80iptfhuxa61.png?width=1880&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ee5eef4d398e60ea6710d65c885e75635a4ce66)

As you can see Other Revenue is growing over the past year with the Oculus getting phased in, but it actually slowed this Q. That is all going to change.

Oculus Quest 2 is selling like fucking hot cakes around the globe right now. It does not take a genius to understand that marketing is all over the world right now from digital to NBA courts. Facebook is hitting it heavy. Do you know why?

&#x200B;

There is an entire eco-system already established that is friendly to the consumer. There are HUNDREDS of games already created that can fill the sales channel. Oculus has been around over a decade. A massive increase in users will only yield more gains.

Lord Zuckerberg already explained the massive momentum Oculus is having down line:

*""This quarter we also took major steps forward in building the next computing platform. We launched Quest 2, our most advanced virtual reality headset, right in time for the holidays. It delivers a real sense of presence ‚Äî like you‚Äôre right there with another person or in another place ‚Äî and we‚Äôve worked to make it accessible to more people. It‚Äôs lighter, faster, has a sharper screen, and a new price point of just $300. Pre-orders have outpaced the original Quest pre-orders by more than 5x and have surpassed our expectations.""*

[Quest 2 Pre-Orders 5x That Of The Original Quest According To Zuckerberg - VRScout](https://vrscout.com/news/quest-2-pre-orders-5x-oculus-quest/)

Facebook is selling everyone one of these at a 10-20% loss for Cost of Revenue, but they are filling the sales channel with hundreds of diverse games. I have already spent nearly $200 on BeatSaber, Population One, and dumb as shit my kids want to play. These games have already been around for several years, but its fresh material for 8 to 20 year olds ready to play that just got their Quest.

On to the options trading and the buying opportunity. Angry people on the internet are causing Facebook to lose -15% of their value over the past two weeks, because of something Twitter did. No one gives a fuck about Twitter. The Feb 260/265/270 calls are getting hit fucking hard. There have been huge 5,000 block trades initiated over this week and I will be following.

&#x200B;

[FB Chain](https://preview.redd.it/63x5b34jwxa61.png?width=721&format=png&auto=webp&s=46cf549004771f2d3c5dfaeff559e8988bb979e8)

Position - 

265/260P 2/19 to lever up - $6.00 in premium

However, others have argued that there should be more stocks included in such a hypothetical.

I hereby propose an alternative BECKY index that includes more companies, and I would like to request WSB to comment on this proposal. Here are the considerations:

1. It assumes the normal consumption habits of a Becky in 2019 and before, and that COVID could not wipe out gyms and malls.
2. It assumes that these items are less likely to be purchased by Chads, Zhangs, or Robots (see ([u/Su-Bae-Bae's research](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b8d5uy/bcky_index_chad_index_zhng_index_rbot_index/) and [u/elons\_cybertruck's research](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/edazey/introducing_the_official_tonks_and_becky_trackers/) for reference).

Here‚Äôs what the bot stated under discounted companies...,140,57,2021-01-12 13:53:53,"Tuesday, 12 January 2021

*Live Updates*

&#x200B;

**First Post:**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuwg1e/i\_have\_a\_discount\_trading\_bot\_which\_gives\_out/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuwg1e/i_have_a_discount_trading_bot_which_gives_out/)

&#x200B;

**Background:**

* My discount bot to help /r/wallstreetbets. It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.
* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.
* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.
* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.
* There are a lot of SPY500/""boomer"" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.
* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.
* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement
* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only
* This is a one man bot.

&#x200B;

**Bot Overview**:

It's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits.

&#x200B;

**Key:**

* Pharma companies are very risky.
* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.
* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.
* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).
* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.
* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.
* Take the ""Calls"" as very discounted, and ""Potentially A Call"" as somewhat discounted.
* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.
* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.

Here‚Äôs what the bot stated under discounted companies...,4020,373,2021-01-11 13:48:24,"I wasn‚Äôt sure which flair to use.

As the title says I have a trading bot which I spent a long while developing.

There are two batches of codes which I run alongside each other.

Batch 1 and Batch 2.

Batch 1 uses some of the judgement of myself and calculations to gather stock.

Batch 2 is just purely calculations which release values which say if it‚Äôs worth doing a call, or not worth doing a call.

Past few days the top picks with NVDA, and a small cap  I can post this daily if you guys are interested.

This the data which I have acquired on Sunday (NY) 10th of January 2021, based on the close of the last business day.

Here‚Äôs an update to my trading bot. QS looks tempting but I think I can hold off until tomorrow a better company I understand comes on sight.

Only invest in companies you know and have a understanding of and can see they have a future, to lessen any potential losses via trading.

&#x200B;

**Key:**

* Pharma companies are very risky.
* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.
* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.
* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).
* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.
* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.
* Take the ""Calls"" as very discounted, and ""Potentially A Call"" as somewhat discounted.
* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.
* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.
* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.

Edit 1: there might be companies which you haven‚Äôt heard of, this is due to me adding the SPY 500 companies into it to increase data output.

EDIT 2: I‚Äôm not charging anyone for this data and no you cannot buy it - I worked too hard to get it right. I‚Äôll be giving daily updates for it.

Edit 3: My goal is to do 400 successful trades with minimum losses before I say everything perfect.

Edit 4: I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future.

Edit 5: Hahaha but really you guys who did the 13 upvotes have made my day! I‚Äôm happy I‚Äôm helping you guys out.

Edit 6: Holy I made it to 50 votes, you guys are honestly the best. I didn‚Äôt even realise this would help this many people but honestly thank you. I will not fail you.

Edit 7: No I don‚Äôt have a paid site where you can get this data. Please do not sell this data to anyone it‚Äôs free information. I know there‚Äôs discord/telegram admin of paid groups who would try and monetise it. Please do not.

Edit 8: Over 100 people have seen this, I feel like it‚Äôs my birthday. I love you guys. I just want everyone to be well off and have money.

Edit 9: 168 upvotes I just can‚Äôt imagine I would‚Äôve ever got this, you guys are amazing. But please just invest in companies you know and are confident about. That‚Äôs all I ask, I‚Äôm waiting for a big tech company to be discounted enough to show up that‚Äôs where I would drop 20-40k into it. Only invest in the things you are personally confident about. I‚Äôll be posting this everyday, stocks are a waiting game keep in mind.

Edit 10: 200 UPVOTES WHAT THATS CRAZY!!!  Thank you so much for all the awards, you guys really don‚Äôt have to, please spend that money on stocks and such. It‚Äôs very expensive.

Edit 11: 453 upvotes I just don‚Äôt know what to say you guys are amazing I‚Äôm trying to perfect everything for you guys, but please don‚Äôt rush to do trades everyday only trades which you are confident on. Thank you WSB I will be a loyal member to the community.

Edit 12: I just ate and came back and it‚Äôs almost at a thousand. You guys have just made my day especially the upvotes and awards which I given. You guys are the absolute best and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without you. Please read my messages above carefully. I don‚Äôt want you guys to lose money and PLEASEEE AWARDS ARE EXPENSIVE DONT WASTE MONEY ON ME PUT IT TOWARDS STOCKS INSTEAD HAHAHA BUT HONESTLY THANK YOU GUYS.

Edit 13: Tomorrow I‚Äôll update the tickers to companies which have a larger market cap and doesn‚Äôt go sideways half the time. This includes removing boomer companies. As some of the companies are pretty obsolete in today‚Äôs market, to the point its likely not in view of many others and I. I‚Äôll revolve it more around myself.  I‚Äôll remove many of the SPY500/boomer companies next update so expect the list to be shorter. With batch 2 it‚Äôll be hard but batch 1 it can be done fairly easily.

Edit 14: Ban for one day on WSB, can‚Äôt post will post Monday update on the other sub in my post history. /r/wallstreettrader , my bot is designed only for WSB.

Edit 15: Tuesday post  https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kvlpjb/post_2_tuesday_i_have_a_discount_trading_bot/"

Edit: Most likely going to buy a longerish term short option on Monday, will advise specifics when I buy. Thanks all.  


Edit 2: Bought some Jan-2023 $20 puts. Either I'm right or I'm wrong, but figured if I'm right I'm probably really right, so levered up the bet. Cheers all and thanks for the input. "
kuletk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuletk/oac_a_sleeping_giant_kylie_jenner_promoted_their/,OAC ‚Äì A Sleeping Giant. Kylie Jenner promoted their product her Instagram,29,36,2021-01-11 03:49:57,"  

Okay, I admit, I originally dismissed this stock because of the terrible DD‚Äôs previously posted about this. OAC is a blank cheque company that will be merging with HIMS & HERS.

A lot of the other DD‚Äôs have mistakenly categorized HIMS as a company that specializes in selling erectile disfunction pills, which ironically, I found as a turn off and dismissed it completely. However, I decided to give this company a second look because of the recent price action on the stock and what I found was a sleeping giant in the making. Yes, it‚Äôs true that they do sell ‚Äòboner pills‚Äô, but that‚Äôs just one product among many others (i.e. hair loss treatment, birth control, acne, etc.). What caught my attention wasn‚Äôt what they were selling, but HOW they were selling it. Take Amazon for example, which was a company that sold books originally, and expanded into other products as it grew. What made Amazon successful wasn‚Äôt what they were selling, but HOW they were selling it. 

HIMS is looking to position themselves as a Telehealth disruptor in the Healthcare space. How they are unique from any other e-commerce platform that simply sells medication is the fact that they have a unique network of physicians that will address consumer concerns. For example, a person that has concerns about their hair loss might be too self-conscious to go into a doctor‚Äôs office to get a prescription and then must take that prescription to get fulfilled at a pharmacy. The whole process is embarrassing and intimidating, and as a result, the customer might just not seek a solution all together. However, with HIMS, the customer can consult a doctor remotely, get a prescription, order his medication, and have it delivered to him all through his phone and in the comfort of his own home. This in a nutshell is what give HIMS their unique competitive advantage. 

What really attracted me to HIMS were their financials. The company has been in operation for 3 years and the company is almost generating net positive EBITDA and will be in the next year or two (think about what happened to $SNAP when they were finally able to turn a profit and the stock price blew up). In their latest S4 Amendment, it shows their Q3 results in 2020 vs. their Q3 results in 2019. They were able to generate almost twice as much Revenue (from $57 Million into $107 Million) and was able to reduce their marketing expense (from $49 million into $39 million) at the same time. Not only that, but they were also able to increase their gross margins from 51% into 72%. As a result of their increased revenue, gross margins and decrease marketing expense, they were able to improve their EBITDA by $49 Million Year over year in 2020. They will mostly likely be EBITDA positive in 2021 when they finish their merger with OAC. Keep in mind that the company is only 3 years old and still have lots and lots of run room. Their growth potential is exponential. 

So far, I have demonstrated that the company has an amazing business model and amazing financials, but what about their social media presence? The HIMS account has 99.9K followers and the HERS account has 100K followers, for a total combined following of 199.9K followers. Their closet competitor is Lemonaid Health, and they only have a total combined following of 8.3K. So clearly HIMS has a lot more social influence than their competitor and once again keep in mind the company is only 3 years old. Having a strong social media influence is part of the reason why they were able to generate more revenue while spending less in marketing in the year of 2020. Most recently, Kylie Jenner (The world‚Äôs youngest self-made billionaire with 208m followers on Instagram) posted an Instagram story of her buying HERS product and tagging Jennifer Lopez (who is a primary business partner and investor of HIMS & HERS). Having strong social media influencers like Kylie Jenner and Jennifer Lopez allows HIMS & HERS to bypass and save money on traditional marketing (like billboards and magazines) and allows the company to directly advertise to their primary target market (a generation of users that prioritize their mental and physical health, and prefer to conduct their business online)

So, they have a great business model, financials, and social media presence, but what about their management team and investors? Andrew Dudum, is the CEO of HIMS & HERS, but before that he was the co-found of ATOMIC, a company that specializes in start-up. The guy literately started a start-up company that focuses on start-ups. This means he knows a thing or two about company valuations and reaching out to venture capitalist to generate funding and increase valuations. As a result, he was able to receive funding from notable investors such as Peter Theil (the guy that invested in FB, PLTR, and many other blow out companies in the early stages).

Okay, so the company has a great business model, financials, social media and leadership, but how much can I expect on my return on investment? The OAC merger gives HIMS a valuation of $1.6 Billion at $10 per share. Currently OAC is trading at around $15, which gives HIMS an implied valuation that is greater than $2 Billion now. However, the CEO, Andrew Dudum, is suggesting the company has a potential to reach $20 Billion, which is a 10X bagger from $15 to $150 per share in the future after the merger. The merger with OAC is expected to be completed by the end of January, afterwards the ticker symbol will start trading as HIMS.

Position: 1K shares

TLDR: OAC Merging with HIMS - The company has a great business model, financials, social media presence, leadership team, and future valuation. Merger expected to be completed by end of month.

# 

Let me explain why:  


**1. Twitter has just provoked the eyes of Congress in an unspeakably stupid way**  
Twitter has for years attempted to fend off Congress by claiming that they're fundamentally neutral, and their Terms of Service don't have real ramifications to speech. By suspending hundreds of prominent conservatives, including POTUS, they've now declared a partisan war which, I can guarantee you, House Democrats are going to be asking ""why didn't you do this before?"". I think the Republican talking points are going to be obvious, but if there was ever a reason to repeal Section 230, this is it.  


**2. Twitter's fundamentals suck, and everyone knows it**  
The straight fundamentals of Twitter are terrible. They've got a stagnated user base, and by kicking off Trump, they've provoked an exodus which will almost definitely show up in their Feb 9th earnings. At the moment, puts are cheap, as they've been on a bit of a tear upwards. . . but I don't see this continuing. They could lose a lot of revenue from their recent actions, but I don't see anyone hopping ***onto Twitter because they did what they did. This is a net-loss action.***   


**3. Puts are cheap**   


If there was ever a good reason to go against Twitter, it's that puts are super cheap at the moment. No one could have foreseen that the Trump rally would go this way. I work at one of the social media companies (not Twitter), and trust me, it caught everyone off-guard. This decision has fundamentally reshaped the investment thesis around social media; non-US dominated versus US dominated / regulatory and anti-trust risk, etc etc etc. Puts are cheap as fuck. I recently paid for some puts (5 contracts of TWTR $48.50 Put 1/15 +  10 contracts of TWTR $40.00 Put 2/26), and it's discounted for sure.  


**4. In summary:**  
Ya'll are smart enough to see that this recent action is bullshit. I'm willing to say that this is actually the beginning of the end for Twitter. $FB will last longer because of Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus. Reddit has a decent trajectory, but monetization is a bit of an issue. Pinterest is actually the biggest dark-horse of the bunch, though I'm personally bullish on Indian stocks atm.   


Good luck autists!"

I still think TSLA has and will continue to change the world, but with a valuation of 859.9B when companies like Facebook that basically print money are only worth 756.96B it's time for me to cash the fuck out.

I'll probably try shorting this bitch from here, I'd love to buy back in around the $400 levels."

Welcome to Friday. Here are your pre-market movers & news this AM-

#[Today's Top Headlines for Friday, January 8th, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-8-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Wall Street set to continue its record run

> U.S. stock futures rose Friday, one day after the Nasdaq closed at a record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 also closed Thursday at records. Both benchmarks were tracking for weekly gains despite Monday‚Äôs sharp drops, the first negative starts to a new year since 2016. The Nasdaq was also solidly higher for the week as Wall Street powered higher over the past two days despite Wednesday‚Äôs deadly siege at the U.S. Capitol and its fallout.

> Bitcoin, which topped $40,000 on Thursday for the first time ever, passed $41,000 on Friday. The world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency has been up more than 30% in the first days of 2021 and 400% over the past 12 months. The value of the entire crypto market, which is made up of bitcoin and other digital coins, topped $1 trillion Thursday for the first time.

> Tesla shares marched higher in Friday‚Äôs premarket after rising 10 sessions in a row, surpassing Facebook in market value, and making CEO Elon Musk the world‚Äôs richest person. Thursday‚Äôs increase in Tesla‚Äôs share price pushed Musk past Amazon‚Äôs Jeff Bezos, who had been the richest person since 2017.

*****

> # 2. December jobs report could be weaker than forecast

> The pace of job growth likely slowed dramatically and could even be negative in December, as the coronavirus spread rapidly across the U.S. Economists expect to see a gain of 50,000 jobs, down from 245,000 nonfarm payrolls additions in November. The Labor Department‚Äôs monthly employment report is out at 8:30 a.m. ET, and the stock market could react more to a positive surprise than a negative one. The 10-year Treasury yield remained above 1% early Friday ahead of that report.

*****

> # 3. Trump finally concedes Biden will become president

> President Donald Trump late Thursday admitted ‚Äî for the first time in his own words, despite vowing never to concede ‚Äî that a ‚Äúnew administration will be inaugurated‚Äù on Jan. 20. In a nearly three-minute video, posted after his Twitter lockout ended, Trump did not mention President-elect Joe Biden by name. It came a day after the outgoing president sparked the riot that saw a mob breach the U.S. Capitol in protest of the election.

*****

> # 4. Pelosi, Schumer call for Trump removal from office

> Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are calling for Trump‚Äôs removal, accusing him of inciting ‚Äúinsurrection.‚Äù Schumer said that if Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet do not move to invoke the 25th Amendment, Congress should reconvene to impeach Trump.

> Pelosi said Congress ‚Äúmay be prepared‚Äù to impeach Trump if executive branch officials do not act.

> Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were among the Cabinet secretaries who discussed the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump, three sources told CNBC. They determined the process of elevating Pence to the presidency could take more than a week, diluting its effects.

*****

> # 5. Single-day Covid deaths top 4,000 for first time

> The U.S. had its first day of over 4,000 deaths from Covid-19. In the single worst day of the pandemic Thursday, 4,085 people died from the virus. The latest coronavirus surge iaw record seven-day averages of new daily infections and deaths running at 228,497 and 2,764, respectively. As of Thursday, the number of people hospitalized with Covid fell slightly from Wednesday‚Äôs record high levels.

> A coronavirus vaccine developed by U.S.-based Pfizer and Germany‚Äôs BioNTech appears to be effective against a key mutation in the more infectious variants of the coronavirus discovered in the U.K. and South Africa. The research by Pfizer has not been peer reviewed. The World Health Organization said last month that health authorities were ‚Äúurgently investigating‚Äù whether the virus mutation affects vaccine performance.

#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, January 7th, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/07/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-7-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to add to Wednesday‚Äôs record despite Capitol turmoil

> * U.S. stock futures rose Thursday, a day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high despite the turmoil at the Capitol. Early Thursday, outgoing President Donald Trump said in a statement there ‚Äúwill be an orderly transition‚Äù of power, shortly after Congress confirmed President-elect Joe Biden‚Äôs win.

> * Economists expect an increase in initial jobless claims, when the Labor Department reports its weekly numbers at 8:30 a.m. ET. With the seven-day average of new daily U.S. Covid infections spiking to a record high, first-time filings for unemployment benefits are seen rising by 28,000 to 815,000 for the week ended Jan. 2.

> * Ahead of Friday‚Äôs government employment report, the ADP‚Äôs look at December jobs trends at U.S. companies showed a contraction in private-sector positions for the first time since the early days of the coronavirus. Throughout most of the pandemic, the ADP estimates have been below the final government count.

*****

> # 2. 10-year Treasury yield above 1%; bitcoin above $38,000

> * The 10-year Treasury yield remained above 1% on Thursday morning after projected wins for Democrats in both Senate runoff elections in Georgia. Lightening up on bonds, pushing prices down and yields up, investors bought riskier assets like stocks and bitcoin.

> * The world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency smashed through the $38,000 mark to hit a record high on Thursday as it continued its massive rally. Bitcoin has been up about 29% in the first days of 2021 and is up 380% over the past 12 months.

*****

> # 3. Congress confirms Biden as next president

> * Congress early Thursday confirmed the Electoral College vote for Biden, a day after Trump supporters breached the Capitol in a chaotic effort to avoid the formal recognition that the president lost the election. Shortly after the confirmation, White House spokesman Dan Scavino tweeted Trump‚Äôs statement, which promised ‚Äúan orderly transition on January 20th,‚Äù the day of Biden‚Äôs inauguration, but also perpetuated the baseless claim that he actually won.

> * Congress‚Äô process of counting Electoral College votes was interrupted Wednesday afternoon when rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol building. A woman who was among the invaders was shot and killed by Capitol Police. Three other people died from medical emergencies.

*****

> # 4. U.S. trade group asks Pence to ‚Äòseriously consider‚Äô invoking 25th Amendment

> * The National Association of Manufacturers, a trade organization representing 14,000 U.S. companies, called on Vice President Mike Pence to ‚Äúseriously consider‚Äù invoking the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to remove Trump from office. Jay Timmons, CEO of the manufacturers group, is a former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Two Democratic U.S. representatives worked on a letter to Pence requesting he invoke the amendment.

> * Members of Trump‚Äôs Cabinet issued harsh rebukes of the violence that unfolded at the Capitol. The officials, however, stopped short of criticizing the president, who had urged his supporters to take action at a pro-Trump rally Wednesday morning.

> * An administration official confirmed to CNBC‚Äôs Eamon Javers that National Security Advisor Robert O‚ÄôBrien and Deputy National Security Advisor Matthew Pottinger are considering resigning over the insurrection. Stephanie Grisham, chief of staff for first lady Melania Trump, and Sarah Matthews, White House deputy press secretary, both resigned Wednesday.

> * Mick Mulvaney, Trump‚Äôs former chief of staff, announced on CNBC on Thursday he is resigning as special envoy to Northern Ireland.

*****

> # 5. Democrats win the majority in the Senate

> * During the Capitol siege, Democrat Jon Ossoff was projected as the winner of the second of two Senate runoff elections Tuesday in Georgia. The defeat of Republican David Perdue, whose Senate term expired Sunday, coupled with Democrat Raphael Warnock‚Äôs projected victory over Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, splits the 100 Senate right down the middle. However, Democrats take over the majority as Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaking vote. After Biden‚Äôs inauguration, Democrats will control the Senate, House and the White House.

#**DISCUSS!**

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/wallstreetbets?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Thursday, January 7th, 2021! :)**"
ks4s3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ks4s3s/bb_king_the_blast_from_the_past_with_the/,"$BB King, the blast from the past with the legendary comeback",630,301,2021-01-07 11:40:22,"**BB is king.**

before anything, this is not financial advice, go fuck yourself you autists. I am a degenerate with a hypothesis. Now that that disclaimer is done

Man blackberry, who the hell thought I‚Äôd be investing in you after the fall of BBM and Brickbreaker. Well, strap in folks as I take you through one of the most bullish stories in stonk history, and it all starts with one statement. Everything you‚Äôre thinking about with Blackberry at the moment, is wrong.

It is not a phone company. It is not telling you to use BBM. It is a software, automotive, and cybersecurity company that is about to make a killing. Let‚Äôs begin:

BB stock price, 6.71 as of Close on 1-6-2021. 

Technically, this thing is a fucking beauty. MACD flip, Stoch RSI cross, volume died on the sells and the thing is pushing up just the market died twice while it had solid momentum. This is going to move soon, but let's go away from crayons and into the magical land of make believe: news events, conferences, and fundamentals. It's not just two letters, it's a business. https://www.tradingview.com/x/uI3Cl51F/ 

**Recent Earnings**

Fiscal Quarter End| Date Reported| Earnings Per Share* | Consensus EPS* Forecast| % Surprise
---|---|----|----|----
Nov 2020| 12/17/2020| 0.1 | -0.04| 100
Aug 2020| 09/24/2020| 0.1| -0.02| 600
May 2020| 06/24/2020| 0| -0.04| 100
Feb 2020| 03/31/2020| 0.06| 0.01| 500



Surprises along the board.

* Revenues last quarter, $224 MM.
* Revenues projected for Q4, $246 MM.
* Full year Guidance 2021, $950 MM. 
* Mkt cap, $4 B. 
Total company non-GAAP revenue of $224 million; total company GAAP revenue of $218 million. Non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.02; GAAP loss per basic and diluted share of $0.23. Net cash generated from operating activities of $29 million.



Saw this cute image of CRWD PLTR and SNOW, all with similar or lower Revs but SNOW is half but worth 20x BB, CRWD has less revs but is operating at 11.75x, PLTR (WSB fav) has 50M more projected annual revs and is worth 11x. Alright who cares about revenue, that's only today. If only it accounted for the big event happening in the next 9 days (see news events below).

**NEWS EVENTS**

*FB settlement*

I‚Äôm not going to go into deep detail here as it is quite intricate and all I know is that BB won a suit against fuckerberg $FB related to messaging, whatsapp, and something else. $FB has till January 15th, 2020 to settle, see here: https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.331602/gov.uscourts.cand.331602.144.0.pdf 

This FB settlement is not included in earnings expectations, meaning THAT SHIT GOES UP or will be in analyst projections.

*BlackBerry IVY - Intellectual Vehicle Data Platform*

The big kahuna that will change BB for the next few years. Per BB website: ‚ÄúBlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.‚Äù

What does it mean to the end consumer (the automakers?)

**IVY Fueling Business Outcomes**

BlackBerry IVY will help automakers and automotive suppliers:

Fuel Innovation by supporting rapid development of new customer experiences
Drive Revenue by unlocking new revenue streams and business models
Reduce Costs by moving processing to the edge & reducing raw data transmission
Improve Operations with enhanced data visibility and access
Expand Ecosystems by unlocking the broader app developer community

Want a TL;DR? Automotive, cloud, cybersecurity, IOT, electric vehicles, every bubble on the planet. And this shit got all of it. Want more info? https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws Read this and watch their conferences coming up.

**Partnerships with big companies**

Blackberry partnered with Zoom (link: https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/10/blackberry-and-zoom-together-secure-your-virtual-enterprise-meetings), Microsoft Teams (link: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management-301147559.html) and some other company that I forgot. Cybersecurity adding onto big big platforms that exploded this past year. MORE MONEY you dumbasses.

Patents
BB started offloading old patents but have one that will be important as of recent, with the sexiest one being this: https://uspto.report/patent/grant/10880812 

Very pretty stuff, big sex.


**Business Implications**

BB makes their money from licensing, cybersecurity (one of the only companies that have not been hacked in this SolarWind shit), BB QNX is already in 175 MM cars worldwide, partnered with XPEV, and is in talks with multiple Tier 1 automakers, 20 different OEMs, and will be in vehicles by 2023. Does that mean anything now? Yes, you dumbass. Per CEO John Chen, my new president, #DidYouKnow @BlackBerry has been selected by 19 of the top 25 #ElectricVehicle manufacturers, and they represent 61% of the Electric Vehicle market?

Bubblicious and sexy. Expect some of the big tier 1s like Nissan, Toyota, BMW, and others to jump on this train. Think TSLA doesn‚Äôt have competition? Bitch they cant even make a billion dollars unless they sell stock (which since MS just upgraded their price, I bet they offer at least $5B in stock in the coming days).

**CONFERENCES**  

BB is speaking at the following conferences:

Citi‚Äôs 2021 Global TMT West Virtual Conference - Thursday January 7th, 2021 at 1 PM with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) 

JP Morgan 19th Annual Tech / Auto Forum
Tuesday January 12th, 2021 at 5:45 PM ET 
with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) 
LINK: https://gentherm.gcs-web.com/events/event-details/19th-annual-jp-morgan-techauto-forum 


Needham‚Äôs 23rd Annual Virtual Growth Conference 
Friday, January 15th, 2021 at 1:15 pm ET 
With Ryan Permeh, Blackberry Chief Security Architect & Co-founder of Cylance and Eric Cornelius, Blackberry Chief Product Architect 

This was just announced and you bet your ass this will pump this stock up.



**Conclusion:**

This stock will generate a lot more cash in the coming years, will gain in the short term by offloading old patents, settling with FB and getting some moolah, growing in their partnership with Bezos gang, roll out to more EVs with Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive companies, and compete with Tesla on this as well. This shit trades at $6.70 and is so close to going up if the market just doesn‚Äôt crash in the interim. They already are used by big companies for Access and other Mobile applications, so that someone can securely use their dinky iPhone to work. Think big whales aren‚Äôt interested? Look at 2022 2023 option OI. 

I think this goes to lower PT of $10 by May, more likely $15. uThInKitWiLLdOUbleINmKTcAp???? Yes you fucking idiot, this is trading at 4X sales only, will be profitable this year, and has so much shit coming up. This is UNDER 4B!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just buy the stock and sit on it. Want options? Buy them too. Have fun guys, I hope you all make money.

* Dems clinched the GA Senate run-off election as Warnock defeats Loeffler while Ossoff defeats Perdue (the first millennial Senator). As the results became more clear last night, futures took a deep dive particularly for NQ, while conversely small caps enjoys a favorable bump. The market opened deeply red for QQQ as big tech retreated with renew fear on antitrust probes  and overall an unfriendly corporate environment as Democrats will control WH and both chambers of Congress. 

* By early morning, the sell-off quickly reversed and big tech recovered most of their red, with big tech such as AAPL going from -3% to just shy of yesterday's close during day's high. In contrast to big tech, clean tech and weed soared on Dems securing the Senate. ICLN was up almost 4% during pre-market and as high as 9% during intraday high and HASI was up 10% during intraday high. Weed stock such as TLRY was up as high as 21%, ACB as high as 11%+, and APHA as high as 14%.

* Things quickly pulled back and tech started fading in earnest at 2:15 PM ET when protestors [cosplaying as revolutionaries](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106820104-1609961746992-gettyimages-1230453313-AFP_8YA6MW.jpg) stormed the capitol and Congress had to quickly pause their certifying of the Electoral College votes. Shit got real when a lady got shot as these protestors attempt to storm the [barricaded House chamber](https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1600/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F210106150417-03-house-chamber-0106.jpg) while Reps were still in the building.

* The sell-off accelerated for AAPL, AMZN, FB, MSFT, and NFLX as most drilled back to opening lows by EOD. AAPL closed the day -3.37% to $126.60, AMZN -2.49% to $3,138, FB -2.83% to $263, MSFT -2.59% to $212, and NFLX -3.9% to $500.49. Thanks to overall negative sentiment of all things tech, QQQ closed the day red at -1.39% to $307 (retreating quite a bit more than IXIC given the weigh of big tech in QQQ).

* Morning economic numbers had ADP reporting payrolls dropping to 123k in Dec, slightly below consensus of 130k. PMI was at 54.8 while consensus was 55.3, while factory order was up 1.0% MoM. Thankfully, none of these number fucking matters as the Dow, SPY, and IWM proceed to sky rocket with the market looking forward to stronger spending and stimulus from a Dem controlled govt.

* Beyond weed, clean tech, and infrastructure - financial sector killed it today in particular mid-cap banks such as ZION (up 11.24%), CNC (up 9.81%), and KEY (up 9.73%). You'll find a similar story for large-cap bank stock with JPM closing up 4.70%, BAC up 6.25%, C up 5.75%, and WFC up 7.08%. It's a good thing I've already dumped my reopening [WFC leaps play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kftjzt/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/ggarcbi/) of $25c and $30c which are now fucking ITM by $3~$8 and still have a year left to go on them. Nice.

* In yet another confusing about-face and showing a real Karen spunk, the NYSE is *really* delisting the three Chinese telecoms this time. The real kicker though came in at 2:25 PM ET when news broke that US officials are considering *more* Chinese stock delisting, adding Chinese big tech Alibaba, Tencent, et al. to the potential list. A sea of red soon followed to compound the sell-off as BABA crater to the Earth's core and closed down -5.32%. Following suit, PDD closed down -5.58%, JD down -7.66%, and the same goes for Chinese EV NIO at -5% and XPEV at -2.62%. LI escapes semi-unscathed and closed the day up 2.48% thanks to a new BofA coverage with a Buy rating and a PT of $42.

* In WSB meme stock land, GME was on track for a solid 8-9% day until the storming of the capitol occurred, PLTR's fade accelerated further while MT stays modestly flat, bouncing back from the overall market sell off. GME closed up 5.70% to $18.36, PLTR closed down -4.31% to $23.54, and MT closed up 0.32% to $24.70. ICLN, a new WSB favorite due to new balance of power in Congress might be added to future roundup if it continues to pump. Imagine that, a clean energy boomer ETF becoming a meme stock. The iShares fund managers are probably wondering why their alerts going tits up with social media mentions and sentiment brewing.

* Random trade ideas (these are not financial advice and if it goes wrong that's your own gdamn fault):

    1) FSLY leaps Jan 2022 90c or 100c+ for eventual TikTok climbing back fully onto the service as ByteDance pointedly makes a political jab at outgoing administration. Headwind on this retarded play: cloud/stay-at-home stock continues to take a beating as rona gets under control as vaccine roll out picks up. 

    2) Sell AAPL cash secured puts Jan 15 120p to 122p if the big tech fade continues rest of the week. These ~0.18 to 0.24 delta strikes are likely safe enough and if assigned, you'll have an upcoming ER on Jan 26 to sell IV pumped covered calls to get out of the trade intact. Feb 19 puts are likely okay to sell as well given you'll receive much more premium from the ~43 dte chains. Headwinds on this retarded play: its CSP and CC. As boomer as it gets. 

    3) BABA leaps and/or March debit call spread for another bounce in a wild trading week for BABA. March 230c/250c is probably a sufficient spread while baking in a bit of IV via ER which is on Feb 11. Jan 230c to 250c if you're not poor. Headwind on this retarded play: Jack Ma really is missing and the US govt really will delist a 600 bil market cap Chinese ADR, forcing out all major US institution holders. Yeah, right.

* The DOW closed up 1.44% or 437 pts, Nasdaq down -0.61% or -78 pts, S&P up 0.57% or 21 pts, and RUT closed up 3.98% (!!) or 78 pts.

What do you think they will do if the stock triples in less than a month. They can't go and say that we are updating their 1-2-month-old recommendations to reflect that. They are OK doing it for 30-40% but not for 300%. They have no option but to issue a sell rating and bearish sentiment about it. At a given time there are always bearish and bull sentiments and with enough confirmation bias, you can write whatever. We have seen this in the case of Tesla for e.g. JP Moron has a price target of 80-90$ for tesla and on another hand, they have a buy rating for Nikola. While JPM was telling street to sell Tesla, they loaded themselves in Q3-Q4 in tesla. They offer unique leveraged products to customers based on ARK etfs, which has maxed its Tesla capacity. Long story short, these people are in business to prove them right instead of giving opinions to the general public. There is hardly anyone in the analyst community who understands AI, ML, Big data beyond tech buzz words (Ark is an exception). I spent 15 yrs in the industry and spent the whole of my career building ANN/PCA/SOM models for large 4D simulation problem for projects required multi-billion$ investments and then executing these projects. Today I work in Strategy consulting and with few things i learned over the years, my POV is Palantir is misrepresented by mainstream finance and instead we should focus on more what Karp is saying, how the quarterly number looks, which industry they are entering and who is the real competition

One portion of Palantir is little understood is its 2016 acquisition of Silk Kimono, it has to yield results in the coming days

We listen that Palantir has lost money for a long time. it is important to understand that investing back is not money lost and if we see investments and growth in revenue - it's somewhat a proxy for it

Amazon has done it for 2 decades

Once you stop doing that you become a tech value company under the clock of innovation growth company (which you are no longer)

I can't say in the short term what is the right price, In the long term, i see Palantir at a 10x-20x valuation of its value from direct listing

With my own limited understanding of business and things that I learned (certified nerd, with serious degrees from very serious colleges), I ran an exercise that how to identify companies that have 1 Trillion$ potential by 2030 and under 50 billion$ now - Palantir and SpaceX were two filtered out

so I am long Palantir, SpaceX and off course long Tesla also.

The stock has got volatile as initially, it had a bad press, and then there was no IPO or SPAC euphoria. Once it gained, it became a meme stock. The stock is new in public markets and unique growth stock

So people are still trying to figure it out. What it does, it does best. Customer acquisition is not easy but as they prove their worth, it should get better.

See the case of BP, they pay Palantir 120 million $ a year No oil company pays this much to any of the company for digital and software service‚Äôs And Bp has stated value of Palantir very openly.

They only have one client in all the industries they work In private space. There is a huge opportunity. They have started with a top-down solution model, But they will@make more and more solutions

Possibly new business models, As well.

This company has just started building a sales and marketing team and One thing a good sales team does is to sell proven solutions, again and again, We need 1-2 yrs to see that impact

I assume customer acquisition for Palantir is a 1-1.5 yr process. Thiel has said several times that his focus is to help navigate companies through key inflection points

No other company symbolizes him more than Palantir today. So I don‚Äôt see him bailing out. Alex Karp is super passionate. These guys worry more about the impact they will create and the legacy they will leave than valuation. In their head they see Palantir to be in the same place one day, as we have Google and Facebook."

**A Value-Based A.I. Investment**  

&#x200B;

In the era of growing small businesses and increasing brand presence, the internet appears to be a vast and difficult space to make a lasting impression on from a small business perspective. Small businesses may have insufficient entries in Google, Yahoo, and other search engines, where clients are likely to discover them. This is significant for these businesses, because if their information is inaccurate or missing, it will turn away potential customers. Yext, a growing New York based company under the ticker YEXT, provides a solution for modifying these entries and increasing the internet presence of small businesses.  YEXT shows promise as a growing long term stock due to its unique product line and hopeful financials.

In a sense, Yext is like Google but for enterprises that require more depth than Google can provide for them, and they actually use Google to help companies advertise and gain traction with consumer base using their APIs that are integrated with consumer platforms. The advertising industry is huge, as we‚Äôve seen Google, Facebook, and Snapchat dominate simply off reaching consumers, and collecting their data. Yext bridges the gap between businesses and unstructured data of potential consumers and existing consumers, setting them up in a multi-billion dollar industry expected to continually increase for the future. 

Their main product line includes Answers: a search engine, Listings: an advertising tool to get your company‚Äôs products onto multiple platforms, Pages: a tool that helps get your business at the top of every location search, Reviews: which helps you engage with customer feedback, and Knowledge Graph/Analytics which helps business owners see their customer interactions with their webpages and other online presence. Websites used to be everything for a business but now a business requires presence across multiple platforms and integration with every search engine, map, or social media. The more a business‚Äô online presence is spread the more analytics you need too, and Yext is the amalgamation of the entire business‚Äô internet presence. This cloud-based software is easy to use, and it‚Äôs used by several reputable companies; including huge fast food chains, travel companies, car manufacturers and even banks. 

Yext solves the problem of particular consumer questions and connects the respective business with precisely what the consumer was looking for. Specific questions such as ‚Äúwealth advisor near me who specializes in healthcare‚Äù (an example they used in their past annual report) will become increasingly easier to answer with the newest developments in Artificial Intelligence. The control of the ever-changing facts of a business are what enable it to spread its sales. Up-to-date and relevant information on every nook and cranny of the web has become a necessity, as convenience has become the most necessary commodity. Poor site experience is a huge detractor for the large majority of shoppers, and if businesses are able to retain this potential loss in customers they‚Äôd be willing to pay anything. Managing an online presence using one dashboard is going to be a very desirable service for all businesses, regardless of size. Yext links all the chains together in the cloud, for Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri, and even the Chinese WeChat, all services which are improving more and more in terms of their search capabilities and they‚Äôre growing in popularity.

&#x200B;

The product or service a company provides is the most crucial aspect of a company‚Äôs success, and YEXT seems to deliver on its product. The solution requires a subscription that can be priced according to a business‚Äô specific needs. YEXT does not seem to have as many recognizable competitors. Its main competitors, Birdeye and Chatmeter, are both private companies with no real news about an IPO anytime soon, while YEXT has been public on the NYSE for three years. From this perspective, YEXT maintains an advantage over its competitors due to it being more recognizable and financially stronger due to its valuation reaching over a billion after going public. However, a reported issue with the product is that listings may go back to normal after a contract with a small business terminates. This is justifiable, because a small business could use the service for a month and reap all benefits. To improve this aspect of the solution that is controversial, maybe a potential solution could be negotiating a minimum period the contract has to be active in order for listings not to revert when it is terminated. Despite this drawback, Yext Inc. has innovated in this niche field and is emerging as a frontrunner in back-end listing modification.

Now that we have established that YEXT will likely be a frontrunner in structuring advertising data, we need to establish WHY this is a growing industry, as YEXT is heavily dependent on the growth of eCommerce and other forms of online and in person business. Without businesses, Yext will have no source of revenue so the expansion of commerce is critical to Yext‚Äôs revenue. Fortunately, eCommerce and small businesses are trending upwards, indicating a healthy future for YEXT. One way to examine if this industry is growing is to analyze advertisement spending, as more online businesses directly correlates to more money spent on advertising. The graph below regarding digital advertising spending clearly illustrates that online business is growing, with advertisement spending nearly doubling over the six years.

&#x200B;

Another way to gauge the health of the industry YEXT is heavily dependent on is to take a look at the growing amount of transactions online. Transactions correlate to greater revenue generated via the internet and thus a greater need for YEXT to introduce smaller businesses to this growing market. The chart below from Statista portrays the growth of Mobile POS payments and Digital commerce over seven years, almost tripling in total volume. 

&#x200B;

Once again this looks promising for YEXT, as their clients are primarily located in this sect of online business due to accurate data going hand in hand with more online sales. Furthermore, YEXT will be a solid pick for investors in the long term due to its growth along with a growing industry and its solid product. If you are interested in delving deeper into why eCommerce and online payments are growing, be sure to check out the Paypal/Square DD as well.

On their last 10k, Yext reported the following for their most recent compiled income statement:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f8renwobw1961.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=d66290b3c437c25c5798b9130d55f3fdbbd25470

As you can see for the top line, there are plenty of positive signs. Revenue has grown by over $50M yearly from 2016 to 2019, and from 2019 to 2020 revenues grew by about $70M. So the indicator when it comes to sales is overwhelmingly signaling that this company is well-positioned to grow, especially in the near future. Gross profit margins are also great as the cost of the product itself isn‚Äôt much. The potential issues in the income statement show up as you go toward the bottom line. Operating expenses far outweigh gross profits so net profits are -30% despite gross profit margins being 75%. Breaking down Opex, you can see that about ‚Öî of them go towards sales and marketing, which isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing as distributing your product can be a huge future investment, but it can be concerning for investors who want a product that ‚Äúsells itself‚Äù. Despite this rather arbitrary requirement, the sales growth justifies the spending as it‚Äôs obviously working and eventually revenue should far outpace selling expenses. 

In their 10k, they state that their sales expenses primarily had to do with more wages and a higher headcount of employees. As the company‚Äôs operations grow, they‚Äôll need more employees to run it in an aggressive growth stage. Despite the constant revenue growth, the stock price has been diluted due to more underwriting in 2019. It may take a while to recover from all the extra supply that was brought into the market, but even if we see more financing in early stages, I personally wouldn‚Äôt be concerned as that‚Äôs a normal course of action for younger companies.

A quick look at the financials indicates that YEXT is improving as a company over each year. Due to their relatively high amounts of investment, the EPS for the company has remained negative. The EPS was also a lot worse in previous years. However, don‚Äôt let this negative metric fool you, as the EPS has been trending positive since the first quarter of 2020. This indicates significant improvement, especially since the EPS hasn‚Äôt been improving much prior to 2020. The increase of the EPS is also supported by the increase of change in working capital from $2M to $4M. As for the rest of the cash flow statement, the negative values are primarily caused by the expansion of operations. This expansion of operations is indicated by the increasing total assets, which means that YEXT grew their assets via larger operations. Although the numbers may be negative temporarily, the expansion of operations allows YEXT to generate more revenue from operations and hopefully turn the direction of cash flows around. Constant reinvestment back into the company is a good sign as it indicates owner and shareholder confidence in the future prospect.

Finally, delving into the 10Q provides reassuring prospects for the future health and growth of YEXT as a company. Looking at the breakdown of individual risks, YEXT looks to be relatively secure in the future. The main risks of the company are internal, and are not influenced by factors such as inflation and foreign currency fluctuations. To some, YEXT may appear risky due to its limited financial history and potential unprofitability due to it being relatively new. However, these risks will ultimately be insignificant, as the expansion of operations will soon be recovered by profits if YEXT maintains its current scale of growth that it has achieved in 2020.

In conclusion, YEXT will be a good pickup for many investors because the enterprise solutions industry overall has done very well, and Yext‚Äôs solutions are definitely a foray into the future of artificial intelligence combined with traditional SaaS. If you compare Yext to another company that has a similar premise, Twilio, you can see that Yext‚Äôs price/sales ratio is only 1/7th of Twilio‚Äôs. Of course, Twilio is far more overvalued and has had better sales growth than Yext this past year, but Yext isn‚Äôt a slouch in sales growth either as we‚Äôve seen. Plus, they have far more potential than Twilio does as we‚Äôve seen with their relatively small market cap of $2B. Both companies offer AI-based enterprise solutions, but Yext is just as good if not a better solution for the future as it has more applicability through a variety of businesses. If you want to see similar growth to what we‚Äôve seen in company‚Äôs such as Twilio but feel as if you‚Äôve missed the bus, don‚Äôt worry: we‚Äôve got the pick for you. Yext is still 25% off its 52-wk high, and they are sure to surpass it with just one or two blowout positive ERs which will be in the books soon."

If you are pretty sure about what the trajectory of the Georgia Senate Runoffs will be, you can make money. Scroll to the bottom for the plays.**  




**Introduction:**  
Recall the price action of QQQ (the tech etf we all know about) around Nov. 3. If you can't because you're that guy from the movie [Memento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(film)) , pull out your Robinhood app and follow along with me kid:

On the eve of the general election, when most polls indicated that it would be a Democratic sweep, **QQQ sat at $269.** The next day, with the election contested, **QQQ rocketed to $294.** It remained steady on Friday, before declining the next week. 

Why did the election affect the price the way that it did? It is because Biden's legislative agenda depends on Democratic control of Congress. **In particular, a simple majority in the Senate allows President-elect Biden to raise corporate taxes to 28%, which [he has promised to do](https://joebiden.com/two-tax-policies/)**. These corporate taxes would heavily affect tech companies.


  
To explain, the institutional whales (the folks who actually move markets) believe that:

- Companies that benefitted bigly from Trump's tax cuts (tech companies especially) will be hurt by Biden raising taxes.
* Companies that would benefit from fiscal stimulus (green new deal, infrastructure) will be helped by Biden's plans, and even more if Biden controls Congress.  
* Regardless of who controls the Senate, the divided nature means some companies are guaranteed to benefit.



Don't take my word for it. Read this report from Goldman Sachs (p.15-16): https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/beyond-2020-post-election-policies-f/report.pdf  



Originally, tech companies (facing more regulation and tax increases under the Democratic Trifecta) were trending down. But when it seemed that the Republicans would hold the Senate with a 51 seat-majority, tech stocks made a sharp U-turn

Yet, there was a small blip downward the very next week. This was not a circumstantial correction. It happened because David Perdue (R) in Georgia fell below the threshold to prevent a Jan. 5 runoff, leaving the Republican majority at 50, and injecting the slim possibility for the Democrats to still fully control Congress.  

Now let's jump to the week ahead:

**Right now, Democrats control 48 seats in the U.S. Senate. If they can win both Georgia Senate runoffs on Jan. 5, they will have 50 seats.** With Vice-President Harris as the tie-breaker, they would be able to pass Democratic legislation like tax increases. **In other words, the outcome of this election would have a huge impact on certain stocks.**
&nbsp;

**Which stocks are impacted, and why**

If Democrats gain control of the U.S. Senate, that means Biden can pass his legislation.

* Some companies will be helped bigly (e.g. Renewables)
* Some companies may be hurt (more taxes) but also helped (more fiscal spending)
* Some companies may be hurt bigly (more taxes, regs, and less gov't subsidies)

To make this a pure election-related play, we want to trade:

* companies that benefit bigly from Democratic legislation (and don't have short-term non-political risk)
* companies that are hurt bigly from Democratic legislation (and don't have short-term non-political risk)

So what companies benefitted the most from Trump's tax cuts? (Source: Goldman Sachs Client note)  

* Tech companies like Netflix, which saw its effective tax rate go from 23% to 7%.
* Railroad companies like CSX, which saw its effective tax rate go from 37% to 23%.
* Healthcare companies like HCA, which saw its effective tax rate go from 32% to 20%.
* Pure financial companies like CME, saw their effective tax rate go from 36% to 23%.

Obviously, pandemic-related questions muddle price-action on healthcare. At the same time, there is still some policy uncertainty to what will happen to railroads regardless of the outcome of the runoffs (they will have higher taxes, but that may be offset by stimulus/infrastructure spending). That leaves two sectors as our pure election plays:

* Tech companies will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate
* Financials will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate

Out of those sectors, specific companies may be overvalued or undervalued, and other concerns may matter more than legislative impact by the U.S Congress. For example, BABA is a tech company in QQQ, but as a Chinese company it sure isn't going to impacted much by U.S. tax legislation. We can just ignore it.

However, a U.S. company like NFLX which is a bit overpriced and very exposed to a tax-cut rollback, is an excellent bear trade for a Democratic Senate scenario (especially if corporate tax increases start being mentioned). While MSFT, which is slightly under-valued and also exposed to tax increases, may be a good trade against a Democratic Senate.

&nbsp;
  
**Information about the races to consider:**

* In the November General election:
	* Perdue (R) won **49.7 percent** of the vote, while Ossoff (D) won **47.9 percent**. In other words, Ossoff substantially underperformed Biden.
	* The Republican candidates (Loeffler + Collins) won a combined **49.4 percent**, while the Democratic candidates (Warnock et al) won a combined **48.4 percent**.
	* **These are both substantial leads for the incumbent Republican Senators.**
* What the ""reputable"" polls say about Jan. 5:
	* Republican-leaning **Trafalgar Group** (""most accurate pollster of 2016""), which had Trump up 3-4% in its November poll, has now pegged **both the Democratic candidates leading slightly in its late December poll.**
	* Democratic-leaning Survey-USA (which has pretty accurate polling) had Biden up 1-2% in its last general election poll, is now predicting **a Democratic sweep** of both Senate seats
	* Poll to Watch: AJC/UGA, with polling by UGA Professor Trey Hood (the most accurate major poll for Georgia this year). **This will be released soon.**
* Trump has been calling the runoff ""invalid"", which might mean some of his supporters could boycott the election.
* The Rev. Raphael Warnock is currently in divorce proceedings, and was recently accused by his wife of running over her foot with his car. Watch for whether this gains any traction (or at least enough to sway swing voters)


**The plays:**

- If you expect **both Democratic Senate candidates to sweep** (both 2%+), then AGGRESSIVELY short QQQ, NFLX, CME, and long green energy + industrials (e.g. etfs like TAN and Solar stocks like ENPH). I would buy weekly Jan. 8 FD puts.
* If you expect **both Democratic Senate candidates to win** (both 0.5%+), short QQQ, NFLX, CME. I would buy puts for Jan. 15/22, since the counting might drag on a few days.
* If you expect **Republicans to comfortably hold at least one seat**, long QQQ (specifically NFLX, FB, and MSFT) for Jan. 15. An OTM bear put spread is recommended, but calls should be fine.
* If you expect **Republicans to sweep**, long QQQ and short green energy for Jan. 15. Use synthetic long options strategies if you can, as those are not affected by vega contraction.
* If you expect it to be **nail-bitingly close**, and unclear whether Republicans can hold at least one seat (think month-long recount), long vega on QQQ, e.g. NFLX with a bearish tilt. This would be buying OTM puts, or buying a medium-term strangle. 
* If you expect Trump to still be President on Jan 22 following the events of Jan. 6, aggressively short SPY and long MAGA because a civil war is probably coming.



**FAQ:**

**Q: What is the expected outcome?**  
A: Republicans win, but there is enough uncertainty that you can definitely make money.

**Q: Why bother trading an election?**  
A: This is largely a binary event. A candidate either wins or they don't. This beats trading earnings, as often we could get the earnings result right, but still get cucked by guidance. Moreover, as shown by what has been happening in recent years, the market is often no longer sure of the outcome.

**Q: Why is NFLX a particularly good short in the event of a Democratic sweep?**  
A: Netflix has a fairly simple business model. Its value is dependent on the expected number of subscribers, the monthly price they pay minus the server cost per subscriber, the amount of its business costs to produce shows, and the tax rate. So let's go through these one by one:

* Unlike when it was still a growing company, or at the start of the pandemic, it's unlikely for NFLX to suddenly see unexpected explosive increases in its subscriber base in the short term. 
* Moreover, they only recently increased prices a while back, so it's fairly unlikely for them to announce price increases within the next two weeks. 
* Their costs are unlikely to change drastically, since show production budgets are generally fixed. 
* As a company with a low worker count, you won't see any Congressperson arguing for tax carveouts or subsidies in the way automakers or airlines would. Sure, when they produce shows, there is an economic benefit to certain communities at places where shows, but shows are always temporarily (~3 seasons) and tax subsidies are generally done by local governments, not federal.
* As a largely B2C company, they can't structure their revenue to take advantage of tax loopholes that companies with B2B segments can. Indeed, this was why the corporate tax cuts benefitted them so much, and why a tax raise will hurt them."

\*\*\*I do want to clarify that some of the timing of iOS 14 changes could get changed and Facebook could push back against certain parts of the change. I did my best to explain the basics of what I think is going on, but it is possible that I miscommunicated or misunderstood some parts of the iOS 14 update, so digital marketers, feel free to let me know in the comments and I'll edit accordingly\*\*\*

\-------------------------------

# TL;DR - Apple's iOS 14 - ""Get Zucked, Zuckerberg,"" Said Tim Cook

For reasons that will be explained below, it is possible that Google and Facebook will begin seeing their duopoly slowly diminish over the next several years (probably >7 years, based on how ""fast"" Turtle Mitch is able to get anything done). I do believe that Google and Facebook will continue to be the top two players in the game for the foreseeable future **(SO I AM NOT RECOMMENDING SHORTING THESE AT ALL YOU üåà NOOBS).**

The core problems that these companies will soon face, especially Facebook, is [anti-trust law suits from the FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization), more distrust of their platform due to the most recent election, censorship across both platforms, a complete failure of Facebook to properly address the negative side effects of social media on the youth and actually do something about it, and, most importantly, **Apple upgrading to iOS 14 (explained more later).**

* [The Anti-Trust Law Suit from the FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization) talks about Facebook becoming a monopoly and buying all the competition such as Instagram and WhatsApp, instead of competing against them.
* [iOS 14](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2020/08/30/ios-14-facebooks-apple-nightmare-keeps-getting-worse/?sh=3029be574cfe) update will roll out early 2021. This will hinder the collection of iPhone identifiers for advertisers ([IDFA](https://www.appsflyer.com/mobile-attribution-glossary/idfa/)), one of the primary things used to track users online.

\-------------------------------

Primary Issues For Facebook From The iOS 14 Update

1. **Bidding Issues:** As I stated above, Facebook is going to lose more and more data points as  time goes on, making it so that they aren't able to bid appropriately on someone like Johnny Bravo when he is scrolling through his insta feed. What does this mean? Insta may look at Johnny Bravo as a Joe Schmo and decide that he's not worth bidding up on, so Johnny Bravo will never see those ads of Playboy and Whey Protein that he would have bought if he got an ad for it. (Example for this: with the iOS14 update, Facebook loses its data points to Johnny Bravo's workout apps, so they had no way of knowing he would have been more likely to convert.
2. **Creating Audiences:** Facebook is going to lose thousands of data points on its users, effectively making it harder to match these audiences into their appropriate buckets. Before, if someone had several golf apps on their phone, you could assume they were a golf lover more easily. Without being able to use that app data sharing, it will be much harder to know they like golf unless they follow several golfing pros / shows in Facebook.

\-------------------------------

With the expectation that Facebook will become less efficient as time goes on and that certain lawsuits could negatively affect the company, many advertisers are looking for other viable options to put their ad dollars. There have been several social media competitors working to monetize their app and become the third wheel of digital marketing. Some of these companies include:

* PINS - Pinterest üöÄüöÄüöÄ
* SNAP - Snapchat üöÄ
* TWTR - Twitter üöÄ
* Twitch - (Owned by Amazon aka AMZN) üöÄüöÄ
* LNKD - LinkedIn (Owned by Microsoft aka MSFT) üöÄ
* Hulu Ads - (Owned by Disney aka DIS) üöÄüöÄ
* TikTok - Not sure if correct, but you may be able to get shares [here](https://www.ig.com/en/shares/ipos/bytedance-tiktok-ipo) (ticker tbd, but pretty sure it will be ZOOMR üöÄ

The name of the game is trying figuring out which of these new channels will be the next to gain 5-10% more market share of ad spend from clients and which will be nothing more than moneyless pits since they do a terrible job at monetizing their app and creating engaging ads that lead to conversions for clients (looking at you SNAP and TikTok).

\-------------------------------

MY RECENT BACKGROUND (aka why should you even bother listening to this autist):

* **Worked in digital marketing and finance for the last 5 years**, also took on several side jobs doing digital marketing for companies
   * **I managed >$10 million in ad spend across various digital marketing channels (Google/Bing/Facebook/Shopping) over the last 30 days** and over >$40 million in ad spend over the last year
   * I work with a team of Managers and Directors at my agency to help talk about new opportunities and keep up with digital marketing trends across all channels
   * Using our >300 clients data, our company is able to look at macro trends at a faster rate, so we can quickly identify which new channels to focus our efforts in (Pinterest/TikTok/Snap/Twitch/etc.)
      * This was highlighted over the last year or year and a half when we noticed a huge spike in companies using Pinterest as a primary channel for digital marketing. Only more and more companies are going to join into the race, this is just the beginning.

\-------------------------------

# Any of these stocks or multiple could improve throughout the following years, but my money is on PINS üöÄüöÄüöÄ

* Even with PINS recent run up in stock price, I think there is still plenty of time to buy this stock now.
   * Our clients are continuing to spend more and more on the Pinterest ad platform and it is returning better performance metrics (ROAS/ROI) than most of the other mentioned channels.
* Pinterest also relies on on targeting people based on boards they visit/follow/create, combined with using a search query method for ads, somewhat similar to Google's. **This means they don't have to rely as much on pixel data, like Facebook does, to create their audience targeting.**

&#x200B;

# I think the safest way to make money on PINS is to buy stocks for the long term, but I know that doesn't get some of your little schlongs hard enough.

* Their next earnings are on 2/4/21(after hours) and ***I fully expect them to smash expectations just like McConnell's dad smashed that turtle to give birth to Mitch.***
   * Look at PINS options that make sense to you for a little after earnings, preferably not 2/5, literally the day after earnings. But you do you boo.
