119,giaajo4,t1_gi9bz6e,"It is not just the ML, AI, fancy UI, role-based access to data.

The strength is that they have done a good job of aligning with government - existing contracts, data protection, refusing to work with foreign countries who are not aligned with US policy.  That has a huge value.

The small government departments with $20-30MM contracts don't have the competence to procure effectively, so will be drawn to the existing Gment suppliers because of safety in numbers.  If it is good enough for the three letter agencies, it is good enough for the South Dakota Border Patrol Agency etc.

You raise a valid point - all of IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, Northrop and PLTR all have good game.  But the new data analysis kids don't stand a chance on the big, lucrative contracts.  The competitors with the cooler tech (and I am sure there are many) will not stand a chance of winning the big contracts, other than through acquisition or partnerships with one of the majors.  Sensitive data does not align well with consortia of partners either.

The COVID tracking crap has probably helped.  I guess we'll be teased with 2-3 paragraphs in tomorrow's newspaper interview.

Big enterprise also see sucking from the federal tittie as a sign of strength, the government contracts make them a stable supplier.  The next new data analysis startup (and there are many) is great and cool, but will not have the wherewithal to win the big, long term enterprise contacts.  Add an enterprise sales force and it should be easy to outperform the current forecasts.

It does raise a question as to WTF Palantir was doing for the first 12 years of the 17 years though?  Most of the technology developed in those first 12 years must have been through 2 iterations by now.  Hopefully it was turned into experience and intellectual property, rather than a rusty stack of technical debt.

I assume a lot of the first years was spent playing ping-pong and riding scooters around the Bay Area until Mr Pltr made them to grow up and get of the valley.  Hope the grown up data quants are smart enough not to dump all their shares in the first year and to spread their stock sales out.  Anyway, data quants are not famous for being risk takers who immediately cash out and invest it all on coke and hookers.  I guess we'll find out.",4,2021-01-06 16:35:56

The other industry that is similar would be biotech and pharmaceuticals, and it’s well understood that after heavy R&D and years of losses those companies can explode when they have a viable product. 

Tech companies have the same structure. Palantir has been developing, refining, and continuously improving their product for years in a fairly intense area (government/military/intelligence).

Analysts uses data to rate performance.

PLTR uses data to predict the fucking future.

The nature of analyzing, can only be done in past tense. Analysts use what they have to conclude what has happened. They can take a quarterly or yearly report and compare it to another period and determine peformance, but they will never predict the future. That's not the nature of analyzing.

Lets take an example. All the great minds in 1903 straight out rejected the idea of flying. Big US newspapers as well as world wide scientific communities rejected the idea. Then on the fucking 12/17 1903, the Wright brothers had made a vehicle that flew. Everyone had to eat their shit, because their analysis was wrong.

Analyzing data will only get conclusions or comparisons and indicators.

PLTR is pretty much doing the same, albeit i did write literally opposite, but their output data is to predict the future, not determine performance. They use it creatively to predict, not conservately to conclude.",-7,2021-01-06 07:19:43

It also requires training to other people (namely developers) so that they can make heads or tails of the information they are using.  Sometimes the developers themselves need to be able to configure their applications in DT... All I'm trying to say is that it requires a HUGE investment up front from the enterprise.

Datadog appears to be a solid competitor in this space.  Other people compare DT and Datadog to Splunk which isn't a fair comparison since Splunk  is really just log analysis.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanenbaum%E2%80%93Torvalds_debate

You don't need a microkernel for a real time OS. 

The multiple platform runtime sounds like BS. Any OS can do that. 

POSIX support... you know what else has POSIX support? Linux. And the BSDs

What makes it different from other Real Time Operating Systems like vxWorks? That's what prospective customers care about. And they are niche. Expensive niches, but niches nonetheless. No one is using a RTOS on their laptop. That part about QNX replacing desktop OSs is BS. There was almost a microkernel desktop OS (which Apple almost used) and that was BeOS. 

RTOS has nothing to do with downtime. Sure, because of the applications where they are normally used, usually they are well tested (but also incredibly slow to evolve). You need RTOS generally when you are interfacing with the real world. Robots(think industrial robots, not drones or roombas), factories, power plants, rockets, self driving cars (which are robots), potentially satellites. That's assuming your system even needs an OS. And that your use case won't be served with SCADA. And that you won't just use microcontrollers for the time critical parts. 

QNX may as well be good. It's no easy engineering feat to develop (and get customers for) a RTOS. But that write up is pure bullshit.",9,2021-02-02 14:47:11
267,glpg9a2,t1_glpeoze,"I got through the first 2 sentences, skipped the rest, and can probably give a decent TLDR from my own digging in BB.  They have the best security system in the world because there is nothing like it, and the inner workings are so abstracted that it's very near impossible to hack, the run-time support, and machine level code support is amazing, and its an efficient operating system.  Essentially, to break it down even simpler, Linux is very secure typically when talking about operating systems, much more than windows.  The Blackberry operating system makes Linux look like it has holes all over it, and is a security nightmare.  Blackberry  🚀🚀🚀🚀

Positions: 50 shares in BB

I agree with /u/outworlders comment though.  The reasons that  BB 🚀🚀🚀🚀  are not the reasons in this write up.  QNX will not make it to consumer spaces, there is no reason for it to.  The fact that Linux has even made it (barely) into consumer spaces already tells me there is no need for QNX to make it there.

For OP.  I think your points are spun well from a perspective of someone that doesn't work on software in a low level way every day, especially security heavy areas.  I work in the day as a software engineer in the medical space, and have a BA in Computer Science.  I think the micro code, and the POSIX are poor reasons to be bullish.  I think the security, and the niche of the market are strong reasons to be bullish though.",17,2021-02-02 15:35:17

Just a lurker here but want to do my part.

Just a lurker here but want to do my part.

So, feel free to add to this list but here are stocks I like - both long and short.

920,gt5wli2,t3_mionc6,What exactly is PLTR working on AWS?,44,2021-04-03 02:04:22
921,gt6mv8m,t3_mionc6,"Ok - so here's what this may mean for PLTR stock.

When a company announces they partner with AWS, it means 1 of 2 things:

1 - they are going to host their product on AWS. Contractually this means that they are signing up multi year contract to spend x number of $$$ for a period of time on the platform, typically called an EDP (enterprise discount program). These EDPs can be very custom, and can include free consulting, credits to offset their eventual bill, and other offers along with a certain negotiated discount off of any aws service monthly. Depending on the size of the contract this discount could well be into 20% or more off. I've seen credits easily mid 7 figures before. This contract essentially says - you will spend this much money and at the end of the term or at annual periods in the contract if you have not spent, you get a bill for the difference. And also depending on accounting rules - this contract could be considered Capex.

Minimum eligible spend to be able to get an EDP? 500k a year (used to be $1M until recently). Think about how many companies use AWS and would hit this threshold....alot. aws reps also get paid on signing EDPs, so they love them too.

2 - they are going to sell their product on the aws marketplace. The marketplace and having ISVs (which PLTR would be in this case) is relatively new, like within the last 2 years. Only recently (last few months) aws has allowed professional services - not specifically tied to a product offering on the marketplace, to also be sold. The sale process for items on the marketplace can happen several different ways: user finds it and clicks buy, ISV directs customers who come through other sales channels to buy on  AWS (I've seen some offer discounts to do so), or Marketplace specific ISV reps go and specifically sell the product to aws customers and partners (these reps make no money unless someone buys the product). Aws essentially is turning into a software and services disti (comparable distis include SHI, techdata, arrow, cdw).


Now - based on the 5 seconds I used ducksduckgo (fuck google) before I started typing this post up, my hunch is the article is referencing PLTR going the way of my #2 meaning. They would be dumb if they were also not under an EDP too though.


How are #1 and #2 related?

Let's say I'm a company who has an EDP, and I didn't know what I was doing when I made the initial commitment and I'm projecting to come up short at the end of my next EDP term. There are a couple ways to fill the gap without spinning up EC2 instances for fun - one of them is spending money on the marketplace (product, professional services). 50% of the value of these spends count against the commitment of an EDP. So, if you are projecting a 50k shortfall on your EDP term - you could spend 100k on the marketplace to cover it and avoid the 50k bill from aws (for nothing). 

That said - companies are moving alot of their transactions to the aws marketplace because of this EDP benefit. Ideally you don't suck and take into account marketplace spend in your analysis for your EDP spend, but alot of companies dont.


What does this all mean for PLTR stock?

Nothing yet. However there are some future indicators to look out for:

Job postings for Marketplace ISV positions, specifically in the ERP space.

PLTR showing up at an aws event in the future (summits or specifically reInvent)

Announcements of large companies entering agreements to buy/use PLTR who also use AWS

PLTR Announcing professional services/consulting 

PLTR professional services/consulting offers on the marketplace


If one or more of the above happen, it should increase the share value of the stock.

I write this long post as someone who pretty much doesn't own stock (fidelity just puts my money places), doesn't hold any PLTR, and used to negotiate EDPs and was employed by an early adopter of the aws marketplace.

**My likes:**

* TINA. There is no alternative. When building bridges, ships, skyscrapers, consumer products, the cost of a miss due to a software bug is tremendous. Skim a few hundred thousand on software licenses for a firm and expect a few million insurance premiums if your cheap software resulted in a defect that Autodesk would have caught.
* Reopening play for infrastructure. As described by OP.
* University training in the software. Companies know what they get from software and also their new hires.
* Low overhead, high margin business.
* Good acquisitions and growth into adjacent business.
* The move to subscription worked well for Autodesk.
* USA domestic company, so no software backdoors for hostile countries to harm government infrastructure.
* Ecosystem to add to the moat. eg: Shipbuilders can make a shipbuilding module for Autodesk instead of making new shipmaking software from scratch, to a guaranteed audience.
* Not a monopoly. There are alternatives that exist enough to keep antitrust woes at bay.

**Headwinds:**

* Shareholder value gets eroded by their employee option granting over the years. That's life in tech companies.
* PE ratio reflects a lot of years growth already baked into shareprice. Sort of part-and-parcel nowadays in tech growth stocks, but I'd rather take ADSK than a lower P/E unprofitable unicorn just running on hopes and dreams.",15,2021-04-04 02:49:15

Long term if they get too greedy its possible competitors may emerge. As someone who does side work I can't afford their fees so I use something else.

But that being said the overall experience is mediocre and for a price at 2k+ it's simply not worth it for the lack of any sort of meaningful updates aside from small convenience factors. If they lowered the price, or even did dual business set ups on a permanent license and upgrade later like microsoft it'd be much easier to stomach. But they only run off subscription and do very little in terms of software updates. Thus in my eyes without a shift in the way they handle their product, they won't be able to get anywhere near the levels of a company like Microsoft. Would I short it? No. There will always be a demand considering it has an education license and is the one most people teach, but in the long term I expect a small decline in value but not by much.

1102,gtefxjb,t1_gtaui73,">*Either way I don’t really see autodesk mooning. Engineering/construction companies are some of the slowest to adapt to new tech, and many times consulting firms and construction companies are trying to reduce cost and the number of licenses they need in each software*

This lines up with my experience. Sure, Autodesk software is ubiquitous, but that just leads me to believe that it really *can't* grow that much bigger than it currently is. There's not many new sectors for them to break into. 

In the longer-term I feel like it's more likely for a competitor to sink fangs into ADSK's ass than for ADSK to moon. 

Software licensing fees are brutal and companies are trying to get away from being bent over the barrel. I know at some of the larger firms they're *very* slow to acquire new licenses. At smaller firms like mine we try and do anything else - we developed our own solution method rather than license ADAPT-FELT, for example. 

The US having a big infrastructure spend would be good for US-based construction companies, and decent for engineering companies, but I don't think it's more than a blip for a software company. It won't be a *bad* thing but looking at the price history of ADSK I don't think I'd like to buy in.",2,2021-04-05 08:11:48

I’ve never seen the STEAM acronym before but it really nails what I’ve been seeing play out in education/workforce/human capital debates - particularly in developing countries and places like China and Singapore, where there’s an abundance of STEM geniuses but a gap in innovation. Kids need to learn creativity along with their STEM. Video games are the training ground where that happens. I don’t know why schools keep trying to shoehorn art into STEM-leaning curriculums. Video game developers already have that figured out to the point where it’s entirely holistic.

My 5 year old is already using Whatsapp, playing Roblox and Minecraft and stuff (and trying to crack my Xbox account password, haha). He’s  light years beyond me - I just lack the neural plasticity as an adult to jump in and keep up. It’s pretty amazing what kids can pick up from playing video games. I guess I was the same way but never really thought about it at the time. I don’t see the reason parents still hold back their kids from too much “screen time” as long as it’s active learning and not passive.

If any place in the world would be clamoring to use Roblox as an educational tool then it would be here, but it just won't happen. It's a nice bit of padding to talk up the educational benefits of the game but in all honesty I don't think that'll amount to any additional interest or value in the stock. 

Gaming just isn't used in the classroom like that, at any level, and change happens very slowly in education. Steam Pedagogy is a non-starter I'm afraid, at least for the foreseeable.

Anecdotally I’m hearing the same from other parents. I gotta think parents’ willingness to spend cash on f’ing Robucks is gonna hit a wall sooner or later. First time ever unauthorized charges showed up on our cards (linked to ApplePay) from Jan to mid March. Never had spend problems with her before Roblox. 

Thankfully I was able to get refunds for those charges and literally bought 2 GME with the refunds, for real.  

She also blew whatever cash she had in her CashApp account. The only thing she didn’t do was sell her 2 AMC and she bought via CashApp on her 2nd attempt on that day when trading was halted, god bless WSB for teaching her to hold (seriously I’m not making that up)

As for the educational component of Roblox with schools I’m skeptical. But I’m also very biased so will watch with interest.

I dont see any issues with their core product at all and they have an absolutely **massive** playerbase with 164 million *monthly* users.

Surprisingly too they have more older users than one would expect with only 64% of their users being less than 16 and a surprising 14% being 25 and over.

The product is definitely attracting the repetitive player-base needed to be a winner, if I were to guess there’s just either a management problem or they’re still in a huge growth period, the latter of which is fine and justifies their losses.

It’s growing in popularity and has clear and measurable benefits. It should continue to grow and penetrate many industries if not create one of its own, but it may still be met with some resistance because it’s new and seemingly ephemeral. In a lot of ways, it’s success is dependent on the general public being and remaining genuinely interested in new and obscure methods that enrich lives and not regressing to the status quo. The trajectory looks good but history tells us otherwise. It’s a crude example that I’m too lazy to expand on, but hopefully you kinda get the idea of the bearish case.

I'm usually a total war gamer and a mount&blade and football manager gamer. But Roblox has some really fun stuff. And yes it's also immensely popular with kids her entire school and all the kids at her programming class (one of her hobbies) are very much into it. When she turned 10 she was allowed to have a sleepover party with friends and they all slept in the living room. At one point around 4 AM my wife went downstairs because she heard something. They had turned my pc on, and my daughter's pc and where playing Roblox on it and then 3 other girls where also playing roblox on their phones.

1450,h2p5skg,t1_h2p0omj,"I own Nov AMD 100 calls too.

My Micron play is bigger because as I see it DRAM pricing is not end cycle, not even close.  And I'd like to know where you see all these sell ratings.  Last I checked my gayboy etrade account analytics there were like 20+ bank nerds that had a buy rating on it with an average PT of 116.  Hans Moseman, the fucking legend has a 160 PT on it LOL!  I think one single scrub came out last week and put a Hold rating on it because he hates making money and probably wants to kill himself.  I see no sell ratings.  Maybe I'm just blind though.

Anyways.  MU ER is next Wed after close.  What I want to see is some strong guide through 2022 indicating confirmation to my stable DRAM pricing prediction.  If the stock rebounds out of this chart pattern, it's going to be a rocketship.  It needs to beat the short pressure though, and there's a lot, because if it breaks below 75 in the next few weeks/days, it's in for some short term trouble.  Probably all summer.

Also, it's worth mentioning MU is always undervalued compared to it's peers.  Big money fucking hates this stock because it's beta is a fucking 2, the float is diluted to shit, and it trades like a commodity. But when it rips, it fucking RIPS.",7,2021-06-23 05:35:52

NVDA was pure luck, I'll admit that.  Bought before the split announcement.  

ADBE though, that seemed like it had to hit sooner or later.  It's had steady 20-40% growth for 8 fucking years, beats ER every fucking time, and stalled after hitting ATH since last sept.  It's the original SAAS play, and it was being grossly undervalued compared to it's peers.  It was bound to hit sooner or later.  and honestly I won't be surprised if it keeps running for a bit here.

Tech companies have long been recognized as great places to work because they focus on work life balance, but this doesn't mean its the cause of the good performance, it could just be coincidence.  

If you follow this DD's logic you're doubling down on tech companies which isn't necessarily a bad strategy. But you have to believe tech continues to innovate and outperform the market average. And in particular that these large compounders like Microsoft and Apple continue to stay on top. I personally believe they will and a significant portion of my portfolio is in those stocks... but I don't think anyone can say definitively that the only reason they're good compounders is because they have good work culture... but logically it should help.

I remember talking with the CEO because we stopped receiving the award and it involves you going through a registration process - and the value of being recognized as a great place wasn't worth the effort to get selected at the time - because the effort scaled with the number of people/size. We also had a research company inside our umbrella of companies so we started doing our own employee satisfaction opinion polling.

Its changing because of the number of companies that are public and is in the list each year are very different. If its present in an year only I will add the same amount of investment to spy. 

Take an example. lets say in 2013, the top 100 companies had only 50 public companies in the list and top 50 only had 30 companies. 

In the next year, the top 100 companies had only 60 public companies in the list and top 50 only had 20 companies. 

So now when you take weighted average over the years, the returns would be different since the base numbers are different.

I first watched it today secondhand through another source and they made it seem like it was an interview that happened today, but I can see now after looking up the original that it happened two days ago, so I take back my comment about this causing the stock dip. No clue why it dipped today then. 

Key points I see from this interview:

1) 3:31: discussion of positive cash flow. CEO says it’ll be mid-decade depending on producing 250k cars a year. This raises a red flag for 2 reasons; 1] in their investor call last week they mentioned that the full 4.5 billion they received from the merger will only last them until the end of 2022, so that leaves them with no cash on hand besides what is received from vehicle deliveries at that point, plus they will be attempting to build a new plant by the end of 2023 so they will need massive capital. Either new share sales will occur or they will take on debt. 2] Their production goals don’t align with their current outlook, timeline and cash flows (they want to make 250k cars a year by 2025, but won’t have the cash by 2023, or capacity for 90k cars a year until 2024)

2) 6:00: won’t be producing the base model until the end of 2022. This is a concern since the majority of their preorders are for the base model. If the majority of their demand isn’t going to be met until the end of 2022, do they expect the other models to be produced prior to that and have increased demand at that point? This also coincides with the first point about cash flows. The end of 2022 is when they are expecting to run out of money so if they plan to begin new production on a new variant of the model at that point, then they run into a budget timeline issue where the bulk of their demand/revenue will have to be delivered without a hitch. If there are production issues getting the base model out, then you have a convergence of their largest demand not being met, their revenues not coming in, and no cash left to work out those production issues which leads back to the debt/share offering. 

These are just my opinions after following this company for a while. Personally I don’t think they would have an Apple deal since they have a long ways to go to get their own production under control and on track.",5,2021-07-29 04:49:07

1724,h8b3uox,t1_h8aptnw,"Thanks for the recommendation here, u/hypemaster33 (although, now that I'm typing out your username, I'm a little more concerned...). 

Did a bit of my own DD, and I like what I'm seeing here. It got me thinking about the CRM market and the HubSpot vs. Salesforce dynamic, and I don't think DigitalOcean's position is dissimilar to that of HubSpot's. 

At face value, the CRM market is dominated by a few heavy hitters and is intimidating to enter, but even SFDC only has <25% market share, and HubSpot -- despite a significant disadvantage in resources and experience -- has been able to consistently out-execute SFDC in the SMB space over the past few years due -- in my opinion -- to 1) strong community / brand loyalty, 2) simplifying what has traditionally been a complex type of software, and 3) a significantly lower total cost of ownership than 'enterprise-grade' competitors. 

Also -- on an anecdotal level -- I work in the iPaaS space, which gives me a lot of exposure to enterprise software trends (which is why I'm very bullish on Snowflake, despite analysts claiming it is still overvalued), and there's a lot of folks at SMBs that are salty about AWS's complexity and unpredictable TCO. Certainly coming across a lot of Azure, but that's more so due to Microsoft's ability to sell the 'side of fries' with the Office/Dynamics, than it being a superior to AWS. 

From an addressable market standpoint, many companies -- regardless of industry/size -- are 'tech companies'... they just don't know it yet. They need to embrace technology in order to compete / differentiate / scale effectively, or they won't be in business ten years from now. I firmly believe we're only scraping the tip of the iceberg with SMBs today.

That's all to say, I think there's a massive opportunity here for DigitalOcean to carve-out a sizable niche in SMB.",5,2021-08-10 01:23:20

Amazon didn't ""grow at any cost."" What they did was reinvest their excess earnings into product/business dev. It was a capital allocation decision, not a cost.

You’re at least the 100th post of there being a crash coming soon.

In the mid 90s there were reports of an imminent crash (It ran up another 50% over the next few years). 

Your forecast is just another drop in the ocean of public knowledge prognostication. 

GME, and AMC, FWIW, are terrible hedges. If there’s a crash, the apes on here on balance more leveraged than the rest of the market. There is not some $10B pool of reserves on this board to come to the rescue. There ARE a good chunk of folks on here at risk of a margin call. 

If you really wanna hedge, buy SPY puts, VIX calls, and move more of your portfolio into SPLV. 

But we’re in a market where the money supply has expanded significantly yet interest rates are STILL low, and all the other major financed assets (houses, cars, etc) also have seen massive price increases.

This is a direct quote from Robinhood for those that are less than savvy about how a leveraged product works. It was $100,000 a share years ago, and if you were able to look back at it now in 12 years it would look the same because of decay. This product is never intended to go back to where it was. It's meant for a daily hedge. If you ""threw money at this"" grab it back and take your L. Read a bit about a product before throwing money at it!!

DFV saw an amazing opportunity in an over shorted stock. It then soared from $4 to over $400 before corruption let brokers cut off buying killing the run completely. People still talking about ""squeezes"" and the like are on some serious copium at this point, after that move, the run was dead.

These are smart people managing billions in a cut-throat industry. It's easier to make money following the big money then fighting it.

Also that they haven't taken hedged positions (ie short but buying high price calls to limit risk). Or buying puts as a hedge or whatever.

You are also assuming they haven't hedged against index downturns by shorting stocks that are highly correlated but (higher beta) so they would crash more than the indexes in a downturn. 

The point of hedge funds is to hedge, beat the index benchmark and collect your 2 and 20, and betting they haven't hedged or adjusted risk models after getting massively fucked this past year seems like kinda a bit of a suckers game.",2,2021-10-19 08:31:53

I sold GME at $337 and $347 (1/27), and $390 right after open (1/28). 

I bought some more after the dip and sold it on 3/10 at $270, and most of what was left on 3/26 at $204. I exited the whole position at $250 on 6/3.

2136,hjmfys2,t3_qodllu,"So, here is the thing

Microstation is the defacto platform in most states and almost exclusively in the north east when it comes to roads and bridges and tunnels.  Autodesk has the market in land development and architecture.  It's an engineering preference thing as much as a time to learn and get efficient at using the product.

Autodesk is far and away a better product.  And it doesn't matter as your clients are used to microstation have thier standards set in microstation and demand the files be submitted In microstation.  The folks in charge are boomers and they like what they like.  Sure some states will run autodesk for roads.... But amtrak and all of the east coast and west coast transit agencies don't and niether do thier consulants.  So autodesk is a clear winner but not alone and likely in second place for what the infa bill provides.

It also looks like there is almost zero exposure to oil/energy, which has been a dying asset class, yet still can have outsized returns (50% YTD). No AMZN either, I don’t even need to explain this one, do I? You simply are not dynamic enough a portfolio manager to time these rotations and they happen [regularly ](https://novelinvestor.com/sector-performance/). Is it more fun to manage a portfolio, yes. Will you outperform some years, absolutely. Just don’t make blanket statements over exaggerating your experience level when you’ve never done it on a professional level or when times are actually tough because I will call out your BS and 100% take your bet. Come back here and tell me I’m wrong in 10 years. Till then, don’t talk to me like I’m an idiot and have fun investing",-1,2021-11-18 17:32:27

If they had poor growth and high debt though they definitely bit the dust. Here's an example in professional services. Median debt/equity ratio of that industry was 0.68. NRC had a debt to equity ratio of 0.48, so they would have been good. EXPO had .06 so they would have been great.
