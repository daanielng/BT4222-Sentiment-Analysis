[If you read this extremely long article, you would realise why inflation is certainly coming and why 2008-2009 crisis response was completely different than this time around.](https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/)
Deflation won't be an issue. Government is doing a shit ton of deficit financing(modern monetary theorists are winning) and deflation would wreak havoc on our capability to pay down our debt.

The scale of this deficit financing would almost certainly lead to inflation. Velocity of money has also risen slightly. Fed itself is warning of inflation and has taken the stance that they are ready to accept inflation higher than 2% if the mean is 2%.

People are expecting even more stimulus==more deficit financing.

Also, we are having historic supply shortages in almost all products(unbelievable to think, but it is what it is).

2.

Also, the fed or the government is not really directly propping up the stock market. This is just the result of their actions. They are not directly buying stocks. People are.

Fed action to stabilise the bond market, government spending, low interest rate etc are creating excess liquidity and is indirectly leading to stocks being more attractive than any other investment source.

ASML has such a solid foothold on their market position, and EUV is only going to deepen and strengthen that position.

For sub 10nm processes EUV is a major differentiating technology, its so critical. There was a report last year that TSMC owned 50% of the active EUV systems worldwide... just let that sink in...

TSMC is absolutely slaying the sub 10nm game. Apple, AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Broadcom... Most of the major fabless players have some TSMC production ongoing. There‚Äôs even reports of Intel exploring use of TSMC as an alternative supply source for their CPUs, likely because of the 10th gen CPU supply shortages and Intels struggle to successfully transition past 14nm node.

TLDR: Increased reliance on TSMC for sub 10nm nodes = reliance on EUV = massive revenue for ASML",5,2021-01-19 06:53:34

To get an understanding of their moat, ASML is currently the only manufacturer of EUV lithography machines in the whole world and the R&D process to develop this technology has been ongoing since the late 1990s. They even received large investments from TSMC and Samsung in order to fund this research. 

Most importantly, there are currently no other competitors researching this field, as the technological and comparative advantage of ASML is too great to make it profitable. This all happens in a growing industry, which profits from a lot of 'megatrends' such as high performance computing, autonomous driving, 5G smartphones and cryptocurrency mining.

114,gnnv044,t3_lktzoi,"I‚Äôm late to this party but I wanted to add some info since I‚Äôm a reformed semiconductor engineer. TSM should be a buy and hold even though it‚Äôs at ATHs right now. They have the best yielding production methods (translation: chips go BRRR) and they deliver on time. Their biggest competitor as a foundry in terms of scale and production is Samsung. One edge Samsung has had is that they have a large fab in the US, however this edge will soon be gone; TSMC is building a production facility in the beautifully arid southwest. They‚Äôre already poaching top talent from other fabs. In the near future, many of their chips will be made in the US which means more incentives for both TSMC and their customers. 

TL;DR bullish af, get it while it‚Äôs hot.

I think anything semi conductor should do well. 

I also would not sleep on Intel. They already have several foundries here and one was just competed this past year.

127,gnmlx71,t3_lktzoi,"Depends on what you are after.

I think TSM is a buy because they (along with Samsung) currently have an absolute lock on the smallest manufacturing processes. This is super important for high powered electronics like CPUs or GPUs or mobile phones. They don't however, focus very much any more on other semiconductor markets. Simply put, the very small nanometer processes that we use for CPUs and GPUs are really hard to make. They have high (relative) failure rates, and take more time to complete. Because of this TSM can't really make both the super in demand and very expensive stuff, like they do for AMD and Nvidia, as well as the less intense but lower margin stuff like auto-manufacturing robot parts. So, its the best performance product semiconductor stock, but not the best sales volume semiconductor stock. 

That said, I love TSM, and I think theyre going to be even bigger than they already are. I think they're headed to be a company like what Samsung is now, a Massive corp with many hands in many pots, not just semiconductors. Also, the huge lock they have on the small nanometer processes puts them in a bracket where really only Samsung competes with them, and with the shortage, they're clearly primed to expand.

TL;DR I'm long TSM, but I think they are going to be a slow grow for a while. I think other semiconductor stocks focused on sales volume and less intense fab processes will do better for the short term. I'm personally long both $TSM (stocks) and $ON (calls) [\(my $ON DD\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhvcqm/im_on_for_on/).",4,2021-02-16 16:28:54

193,h1e3rxb,t1_h1a28ym,"An important point is this kind of brewing 'semiconductor cold war' between most of the world and China. It potentially effects TSMC, international relations and the entire semiconducter industry in a huge way.

TSMC is basically unrivaled in the semiconductor space. They've developed their tech and factory for the last 30 years to get it where it is today, and it's really the one single place on earth with the tech and capacity to produce the semiconductors needed to meet the world's demand.

If China took drastic action to try and bring Taiwain back into China as one unified nation, it would have a monumental effect on everything. Some suggest China could invade Taiwain, if they did it could completely destabilise the world. If successful, China would dominate and control the semiconductor industry, the supply of chips would be drastically effected in the short term. We rely on semiconductor chips for almost everything these days, from smartphones and cars, to military technology and transport. Even your coffee machine probably uses one.

While TSMC is the single player right now, countries such as China and the US are positioning themselves to reduce the risk and reliance on 1 company, by investing billions into their own semiconductor industries. Both China and the US have put aside tens of billions to futher their semiconductor tech, but this will take years, maybe decades for them to catch up to TSMC.

So I guess it comes down to how aggressive you think China will be in regards to Taiwain and TSMC, and how aggressive the US and rest of the world are in their response.

Little bit 'doomsday', i'll admit, but it's definitly a consideration to make when investing in the semiconductor industry.",2,2021-06-11 19:33:37

201,h3ln8nu,t3_ob5fjq,"LET'S FUCKING GO, they absolutely smashed EPS, Rev, and guidance estimates. That's big fucking money. I was in for 1200 shares, and now im taking an investing break like a goddamn king after this lol. Excited to see it smash $90 tomorrow (just my prediction), then I'll take my profits and rest easy.

Micron Technology (MU) reported 3rd Quarter May 2021 earnings of $1.88 per share. The consensus earnings estimate was $1.72 per share on revenue of $7.2 billion. The Earnings Whisper number was $1.78 per share.

The company said it expects fourth quarter earnings of $2.20 to $2.40 per share on revenue of $8.00 billion to $8.40 billion. The current consensus earnings estimate is $2.02 per share on revenue of $7.85 billion for the quarter ending August 31, 2021.

‚ÄúMicron set multiple market and product revenue records in our third quarter and achieved the largest sequential earnings improvement in our history,‚Äù said Micron Technology President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. ‚ÄúOur industry-leading 1a DRAM and 176-layer NAND now represent a meaningful portion of our production, and Micron is in the best position ever to capitalize on the long-term demand trends across the data center, intelligent edge and user devices.‚Äù

\[insert rocket emojis x100 here\]

EDIT: Looks like the market disagrees! MU also said it was selling off one of its plants, and I think that has investors scared about their ability to continue as they have, despite MU's raising of next quarter's guidance.

277,h5hkvy5,t1_h5d0s77,AMAT is the way. Especially after this weeks sell off.,1,2021-07-17 13:52:09
278,h5dkybk,t1_h5dkpbm,I agree there‚Äôs a lot of promise out there! It‚Äôs why I made the list. These companies are all over the semiconductor spectrum and each have their own specific niche.,1,2021-07-16 16:55:15
279,h5f47lk,t1_h5f3wf8,There‚Äôs an number of answers to your question. You ready to go deep to understand them or do you want the simplified version?,2,2021-07-17 01:23:28
280,h5d6mem,t1_h5d5e9n,"The options on VSH are only a few cents premium above trading value for the $15 Jan 2022 calls. Simply amazing ü§£. Even if the trade turns against you, you can roll it. With a forward PE of 11 and 96% institutional investment, it‚Äôs certainly a safe play. And the economic conditions support a bullish thesis too. Truly a hidden play known by institutions but out of the eyes of retail..",3,2021-07-16 13:39:20
281,h5emvvl,t1_h5emkoh,"You should. But if they‚Äôre already trading at a value price when you consider the growth potential like VSH, you should welcome it! 

Buy in small, average down when it hurts, keep money to the side, and enjoy the boost when it becomes too irresistible to institutions.",1,2021-07-16 23:21:09
282,h5fs4p9,t1_h5emkoh,"Yup. TSM tanked 10% overnight, and is down 17% from its peak a few months ago. MU has also tanked hard since their ER. They're down 20% from their peak. Semis are shit investment as long as China continues to shit on the world economy.",0,2021-07-17 04:13:56
283,h5d2hdj,t1_h5d28yp,"100% agree. But with such back orders and an ever expanding market for semiconductors for everything from cars, to AC units, to ear pods, to freaking toaster ovens, you‚Äôre going to see increased demand and a lot of acquisitions and expansions/reinvestment. It‚Äôs not just the high end semiconductor market benefitting. Many of the high end companies like INTC, NVDA, AMD, & TSM are drawing all the attention right now when there are much better plays out there not tracked by retail.

This list is to help folks track semiconductor earnings to gauge where the market is and hopefully therefore provide some insight into where they‚Äôre going. There‚Äôs so many different angles to play here and this should provide some insight.",12,2021-07-16 12:52:48
284,h5digr2,t1_h5di1uu,Totally possible. But if we get a solid pullback there will be dip opportunities. Kinda the reason I like VSH. It already dipped amid the course of normal trading. If it dips any further the value will be simply irresistible given their growth. In fact it‚Äôs sitting so hard on support that it dipped much less than the general semiconductor sector yesterday. I‚Äôm kind of hoping it dips some more as it‚Äôs effected by ETF exposure. I like the value. Damn forward PE is 11 ü§£,2,2021-07-16 16:18:43

291,h5diwac,t1_h5digr2,"Yea, I briefly looked into them after I saw this post. It seems like they have good growth, but are unpopular with institutional investors. It hasn‚Äôt really found solid footing since the 90‚Äôs. Still, the numbers do look damn tempting",2,2021-07-16 16:25:03
292,h5o6crh,t1_h5gnrkd,"If you are correct, that means it will be 150 at split. So, in your opinion, is 200 in the realm of possibilities by Friday? Hehe",1,2021-07-19 04:17:14

294,h5d6yl7,t1_h5d6sw0,"Precisely, that or just exercise the calls and hold.  Trading at a few cents above fair price you won‚Äôt lose much with the opportunity to gain it back. And it isn‚Äôt going to $15 unless the bottom falls out of the market so the $15 strike will always be in the money at a fraction of the cost of 100 shares.",3,2021-07-16 13:43:24

300,h5f8n5x,t1_h5f796m,"Ok, first I will cover the basics of trading. If you have billions of $$ and you want to get in a ticker quick, how do you do it? Well if you go in all at once you‚Äôll pump the price so what do you do? Well of the company is trading at $100.00 and you think you‚Äôre going to pump the price to $105.00 ‚Ä¶. You sell $105.00 puts or buy cheap $105.00 calls and THEN you pump the stock! Then once you pumped some bullish momentum into the company you buy back your puts for 15% of what you sold them for or sell your calls for a 80% increase in price. Then as the stock continues to pump and you want to get rid of billions in shares do you just dump them all at once? Hell no, too much selling pressure. Rather you sell calls and dump them, ‚Ä¶ or you buy puts and dump them. Then buy back your calls for a fraction of the price or sell your puts for a huge profit. This is how institutions operate, they don‚Äôt care about your long position or which way this company trades. They‚Äôre going to make their money no matter which way the stock goes. Institutions can also go short and long at the same time. Which helps a lot if they know they‚Äôre about to swing the price with billions of dollars. 

Next let‚Äôs address these companies.",11,2021-07-17 01:54:09

TSMC is building new fabs, Intel is building, GlobalFoundries is building, Samsung just announced increase in capital spending and they will profit from it in 2-3 years as this is on average how long it takes to finish a new fab. Right now the equipment makers will be the big winners on chip shortage. AMAT and LRCX are particularly undervalued. They sold off recently along with MU because they also supply DRAM equipment and there is suspicion in the industry DRAM cycle peaked. But their DRAM manufacturing equipment is less than 10% of portfolio. Moreover, new generation of DRAM goes 3D stacks which need new manufacturing equipment.
