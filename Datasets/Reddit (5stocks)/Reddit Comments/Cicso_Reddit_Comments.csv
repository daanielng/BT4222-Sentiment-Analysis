I can tell you that share value isn't based on fundamentals. It's based on what people want it to be worth. That's why fundamentals work when people act like that's how it works.

Fundamentals don't work now, because this bubble is being driven by hype. Technicals are starting to work more because they work based on following trends - following trends is what got us this bubble lol

TSLA as a company is good, but the share value is way beyond the company. It's going to go up until tech stocks start being seen as overinflated by enough people to pop. By then, have your money elsewhere. Until then

It‚Äôs ridiculous as a justification for a massive short term run up on top of what was already a huge bubble. There‚Äôs no real basis for any of it.  But the Elon cultists are acting like it‚Äôs incomprehensible that it would roll back into the $600s. And there may be no obvious basis for that move either. This sort of mania and hysterical quasi-religious is another classic sign of an end stage bubble. Right now I‚Äôm only looking for a near term dip. Maybe consider a real correction by Spring.

Waited for the dust to settle then jumped on some CHEAP options that expire 1/21/2022 (like 61 cents a contract)!  They ticked down a bit last week I think, so might jump into more of them.  Nokia ain't some fly-by-night company and with almost 100,000 employees, they're going to be around for a LONG time.  If it does moon, it'll be slow climb (imo), but it WILL go up, it is almost certain.  Seeing as they report on 2/4/2021, it might be a good time to start loading up on some more of these options, or look to some 2/5/2021 options (day after earnings).  I just don't know if the stock will ""spike"" like other companies, it could, but if it doesn't then the 2/5 options need to be ITM or I'd be wary.

I‚Äôm honestly quite surprised at how much gain they have already. 41% on the 1/2022 calls and 48% on the 1/2023 calls as of close today. The IV isn‚Äôt huge, but it is higher than when I bought them on Jan 6. They sat pretty much doing nothing until last week. There‚Äôs next to no theta decay because of how absurdly far out they are from expiration. I looked a few minutes ago and saw that there are now hundreds of thousands of open positions on these positions. I don‚Äôt know why. It could be that someone knows something I don‚Äôt, I genuinely don‚Äôt know. 

I entered the positions after seeing some decent DD at the beginning of January that was enough to spark my curiosity, so I threw a few thousand at it to see what would happen over the next two years. I‚Äôm considering expanding my position as the options are still quite cheap, especially for how far out they are and how close to ITM some are. 

Again, there are some interesting catalyst potentials for some strong upward movement with the stock price, as several people have exhaustively detailed, but anything could happen.

What NOK needs now is clear direction and selling its nonprofitable departments. Instead the new CEO is gonna be greatest on every field concerning communication tech and offer everything to everyone. And once again NOK will fall flat on its too big ego. Sure profits may come after 6 months but thats because pump and dump.

GME has strong people behind it and every possible way to grow big even after shorts squeeze out of game.

I never in a million years expected that Robinhood of all places would kill the amazing momentum.  If you put market orders in during the weekend I posted this, well then we are now in..... exactly the same place.  I hope you got some tendies.

For me, the stock is still undervalued, but the damage Robinhood has done to the free market might mean this rocket is going to be slower to liftoff.  For the immediate future, my plan is to dump all my available money into GME.  I've spent a ton of time digging deep, and with the [recent discovery of massive FTD shares at GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb8hjc/datadriven_dd_i_analyzed_265000_rows_of_sec_short/) I'm convinced that GME is going to explode beyond anything we've ever seen.

NOK gang, I'm still with you.  NOK is going to be making us tendies for a long time.  But the GME rocket to immediate riches (which can be dumped right back into our true love) is rapidly closing.

4G/LTE reach maturity in 2016/17 and 5G is just about to start (less than 5% of CAPEX is already expended). Nokia is investing around 5bi‚Ç¨ PER YEAR in R&D and have the most complete portfolio on all the network areas. The big money is starting in 2021 and the revenue+profit rising will happen at least until 2027/28, with many interactions to come:
1. 5G NR on cmWave (TDD and FDD),
2. 5G NR on mmwave
3. 5G for automation, Enterprise and smart cities (Nokia is the frontrunner with most of market share)
4. VRAN/open RAN for massive capacity deployments and support for full automation (ML/AI).
5. URLLC for connected automated vehicles (heavily funded by EU, which is budgeting 5bi‚Ç¨ just for investigation,  trials and critical mass creation).

With Chinese vendors restrictions,  Nokia, Ericsson and a few new entrants (NEC, Mavenir, Altiostar) are placed to grab a ridiculous amount of new money in New market (industry 4.0).

Today, Nokia released an alternative that will help carriers rapidly convert 4G infrastructure to 5G: a software update that can convert 5 million existing 4G tower radios to 5G without the need for tower climbs or site revisits.

According to the company, the software update is available now for approximately 1 million 4G radios, and will expand to 3.1 million by the end of 2020, then over 5 million in 2021 ‚Äî big numbers that should enable country-scale 5G deployments. To put those numbers in perspective, China expects that 600,000 5G base stations will cover most of the major cities in its huge landmass by year‚Äôs end, so physically smaller countries could offer edge-to-edge 5G with far fewer radios. Nokia estimates carriers‚Äô savings from the software update to be tens of billions of euros, coupled with reduced time for ‚Äúimmediate‚Äù and ‚Äúseamless‚Äù 5G deployments that will help businesses and consumers start using 5G right away.

Too bad that means nothing when [revenue per share has been stagnate since 2011](https://www.gurufocus.com/financials/NOK)

>Nokia is undervalued by 200% !

It's been undervalued for a decade?... come on. This is just laughable. NOK hasn't done really anything except swap heads around for the last year. They won a $450M contract with Taiwan.. nothing happened because it's essentially pennies. They won a $15M contract with NASA that basically won't even start for at least 2 years.

To invest in NOK as a sleeping dog? maybe. But then again they have nothing worth of note right now AND they have so much volume out (THAT ISNT BEING SHORTED BY THBE WAY) that investing in it without some sort of extra service, i.e. dividends, is just foolish and indicative of children who have not been alive long enough or watching the market long enough on Nokia to do their DD

I'm familiar with this because I have leaps in another stock, UMC, which like NOK has a great foundation and promising future. It also has a huge float of 2 billion shares.

And and üÖ± it's üôÖüòÇ no üò§ longer üçÜüòí now üò± we're üöü looking üôÉ at a üëå trading phenomenon is people just üëÜ‚ùó keeping it off a üÖ± lot ü§£ü§£ of call ‚ò£üòâ volume, there's üòçüò© no short üïõ squeeze üìùüôÑ that üôéüöü is happening üçÜ as üèøüñï we ‚ôÄ speak. üëà Me üèªüò© personally üíª who üòÇ is üëå short ‚¨á the stock, ‚ùó I have üîí no problem selling the üÖ± stock higher, üîùüîù you're üë© not üö´ going ‚ôÇ‚ôÇ to change üëé the story, üò¢ you're not üôÖüö´ going ‚ôÇ to ‚òÉüò© change üëé the üòæüì∫ underlying fundamentals of üí¶üí¶ this ‚¨Ü company. üè¢ Therefore, üî• as üïñüí∞ long ‚õÑ as üèøüÖ± the borrows available, üí¢‚úî and üò´üí∞ insiders are üî¢üÖ± still ü§û selling, and üëèüçΩ the company ü§µüè¢ needs üôå money, ü§ë you üí¶‚ôø won't see a üëåüÖ± squeeze from üëâüëâ here on in. üëá Number two. üíè‚úå numbers don't lie. üò±üò± People ‚ôÄüë± lie. üí¨ I ‚è©üë® know everyone üë® on üîõüîõ Twitter üò© never üö´‚ùå has ‚ùì a üÖ± winning ‚ôÇ trade. Everyone üë¨ on üé∂üîõ Reddit üëã is üçäüòÇ a üëåüëå market genius. ü§ì I üíïüíÅ hear üëÇ it all üíØüÖ± the ‚úäüëë time. üïñüïê That's ‚û° fine. üòÇüëå Those are people. üë¶ Let's üôãüôÜ look üëÅ at üöìüïõ the numbers. Let's üí¢ look at üòÇ the üçÅ numbers for üçÜüí∞ GameStop. Now understand üéÜ as a üÖ± short üíÅüïõ seller, I üèª was üëè the üëèüè≥ first üòÇ‚òù short to üí¶üîµ actually üò± come out üò¨üëå and go ‚ôÄüëÜ long Tesla. Once üî• I üí∞ saw üëÅ the story changed, üìàüöº the üèªüåé numbers changed. üò©üò© They ‚ùåüòÖ were eating üç¥ from üòÆ the üêÑüçÑ top, üîºüîº and üèΩ they ‚úä were üë∂ eating üëÑüç¥ from the üò§üö™ bottom. ‚¨á‚¨á And üëè I üòû identified the üí¨ fact you can't be üêù short üëâ this üëà game. It's üòΩ up üî∫‚òù I ‚å®üëà think 90%. ‚ùåüíØ Since then, it's the üëè opposite when it comes to üí¶ GameStop NPD is üèøüéÉ the gold standard when ‚è∞üí§ it üôÇ comes üí¶ to gaming reports. On üîõüîõ January üïë 14, üë¶ they üòÖ put out üèªüëå their analysis of üí° what December looked like in üèº‚¨á the video ‚è∏üìΩ game üéÆ season, üí¶üí¶ hardware sales had their üëàüëè best üêî month üìÜ ever üòòüòÉ up 23% year üôåüèº over üëè year, üòò because üìù the üòç two ‚úå cycles over ü§î that time. üôà GameStop was üëá down 9%. Now üî´ I üêùüò≠ understand this üí¶üôã is üëÜ what üòå physical üíèüëä locations, üåçüìç forget about ü•ï all ‚úäüåû the future, üëÖ what üò≤üëè they're üóì going üèÉ to lose to downloading and üó£üëè streaming ‚õµ their üçÜ physical locations. We're üèæüëë actually down during the past month, üí∏ they were losing to üëä‚û° Amazon, üí∏ Best Buy target, and ‚û° Walmart. And the ‚è©üöø reason why üè´ because people are üëå not üö´üö´ going in üëèüì• to exchange their old üí¶üë¥ discs anymore üò∑üòí or old üë¥üëµ games üìÄ for new üí¶ games. That model üëÑüëå has become ‚ôÇ dead üòÇ and üî£üåÉ antiquated. And üôÖ that was üòüüëè a ü•ñüëå cornerstone of üí¶‚òù GMA. So üòé with üëØ those numbers that we saw üëÅ come üí¶üí¶ out üò¨ of NPD it üòΩ shows üì∫ that üòß before ‚è™‚ùÑ they might even try üòêüèÉ to turn ‚ùó the company around üï¶üí¶ their current üòæü§ï business üíâ is üôÄ just üôÑ drowning. üò∞üí¶ You cannot argue against that. üèºüò† Number üí≥ three, üíÅüíÅ valuations matter. üò° This is not ‚ùåüôÖ Tesla. This is not ‚ôÇ a üÖ∞üéâ company üè≠ that üí¶üíØ with üï∫‚ô† a üí∞ blue sky, üèñ this üò§üòû is ‚òù a ‚òù retailer, you will look üëÄ at üéñüçÜ valuations. This is üëè what no üòª‚ôÇ one's üíç looking üíÜ at üçÜ on üòÜüòõ your Reddit üí∞üñï forums. üí∞ So üíØüíÅ forget ü§î‚ùå about the üëá fact üõ° that analysts have üà∂üò£ a consensus $12 target on the stock. ‚úçüíµ Let's just üëåüèº go look üëÄüòç at üò© Hedgeye and ‚ûïüòè I ‚≠êüë© like üëçüí© Hedgeye I think ü§î they üèªüë• do üò´ great work. üè¢ We're ü§¥ fans üèü of üì∞üí¶ it. We üë®üë¶ we üî® use that we ü§¥üë¶ speak to üë± them. ‚ò†‚ùÑ They're smart üò≠üò© guys, üè≥üë® they üëß recommended CME when üïö it üíÅüî´ was üòü 14. üë¶ And if üëÄüèÉ you üë®üëà bought üí≤üí≤ it, üêêüíØ then ‚û°üîô you'd be üÖ∞üÖ± making üèΩüöü money. ü§ë At üëÖüí∞ the time. üëå It's üí™üíØ before üï∞ Jimmy üí©üí© reported their numbers they were üòç expecting 2021 EBITDA to üçÜ be üë∂ around 333 million. üíØüíØ Now ‚ùó‚òù the ‚ùÑüò± street is üòØ at ü§£ 71 million. And üëè‚ûï we we üë•üë¶ think üò¶ they're gonna have üëè negative üëèüëè even though ü§î if üéÖüîé they üèΩ did üåàüîÜ 330 million, üòÇ which üëèüê± is üò©üí¶ seems like üçëüíØ a üë¶ completely opposite ‚Ü©üîÑ number üí¶ now. Then üèøüïõ they üôé had üò≠ the üèÖ price üí≤ target hydride at $26. The üíªüëè model üëÑüëÅ just üëÄ does ‚úä not üò† work. And when üí¶ you üò´üíØ want üôÖ to talk üëÑüòµ about ‚≠ê valuations, think ü§§ about üí¶üçæ it üòâüò© this way. ‚òëüí´ This üëèü§î is a üí∞üò† retailer. Even üÜó‚ûñ if ‚ùìüëè they fix it, ‚ùó they're still üòΩ a üèÉüç¨ retailer trying to ‚¨Ü get ‚è≥üíÅ 40 times next üëâüëâ 12 ü§êü§ì months, Evie to üôåüì¥ EBIT, da 40. Apple üí¶ is 23 Best Buy üíµü§î is seven, Walmart ü§£ is 13. So üï•üôá if you like üòÑ the üëè company, ü§î the üëèüìñ fact üìï that GameStop has ‚úÖ actually üò≥ become an üîûüí∏ expensive üíµüíµ stock üîß‚úç is üí¶ just beyond number üé¶ four, know üí≠ who's üòÇüòÇ on üí¶üí∞ the üòûüí¶ other üë™ side ‚òÅüöî of üî• the üíô trade. üìú I know üìöüí≠ who's üòí on üåéüèΩ GameStop right üëâ‚úî now, the üëè people üë®üëß who ü§îüò° are üôÖ ordering pizzas to üí¶ my üôã house üèù or üí¶üö´ signing üìù me üôä‚ôÇ up for Tinder or doing üòâ all üåû those üêê cute things ‚òÑüèã trying üòº to üÖ± hack my Twitter üò© account. üí≥ I üå∑ know you've üëâü§ú been going after a specific hedge fund No need to name üòÇ that's üëâ been short üíÅ game stuff. People üíãüë¶ believe üò®üåà they're üë´üèº short. üíÅ‚¨á This ‚ùì particular hedge fund happens to be üéÆ one üò® of the üåêü§î top consumer discretionary funds out üí¶ there. üëåüëå So you should actually üò® listen and ‚û°üëè see üëÅüëÄ who's üòÇüëè short the üëèüè≥ name üòê‚ôÇ and ‚ûï‚ûï why üò°‚ùì they're short üïõüïõ the name üé∏ü§î as well. Someone üòë who üíÅ does üèã go short, I ‚ôÇ always üïîüå± look üëÄüëÄ who owns üõÇüõÇ it. ‚û° Ryan Cohen owns üõÇ the stock üå© at üçîüíÅ $9. ‚úù Very üëøüëå smart ü§§ guy. üë®üèª If Ryan sells it üò° at üë∏üöü 20, üìäüÜó he üëàüëè doubled his üëëüèª money. üí∂ If üèæüôé Ryan sells it üèøüí¶ at üçÜü§° zero, üë∞ he ‚ò†üëâ still has more ‚ûï money üí∏ than üëÑ me üëèüèª and üò≤üòà more üôÖ money üí∏ than üèΩ you. üëà So where's üèøüåé the stock today? üòç Who owns it, üìùüò≠ and üèª why ‚ôÄ people üë•üë® are üë∂üóë short üïõüïõ the üöóüòç stock, ‚úç these ü§¢ü§§ are the üëâ names üìáüíÅ right ‚úî now. And üëèüÖ± last ‚ùó thing üèº is üëè the company can üî´ become ü§¶üèΩ your üëâüçÜ biggest üçÜ enemy. We're looking at üí¶üòç a üí∞ company ü§î with üôÖüëè a üí∞üëå billion dollars üí∞ in debt. If the üåΩüòä stock ‚ùóüíπ goes üçÜ any higher, they üëß should just sell üíµüíµ stock üòÖ‚úç right üí≠ into üÖ± you üëàüò∂ and üëè raise üôãüôã money and üï∞ pay üí∞üí∂ off some debt. More üçÜ‚ûï importantly, if they üí§ want üëèüíØ to üëç make an üí∞ acquisition in üôÖüëè the ü§î gaming space üò´ acquisition start ‚ñ∂ in üåçüëâ the billions in this place, üôåü§§ and üåö‚ò¢ they're üëßüòà gonna üëÄüî• have üà∂üòù to üí¶ sell üíµüí≤ a ‚ùå lot ü§£üçë of stock ‚úç‚ùó to do ‚ö†üëè that. üôé Me personally, I think üí≠üö´ you üèøüëâ could üö´‚úä have a ‚ò¢üíã pickup. This üëàüë∂ is üëåüóë either going to be JC Penney, that brightens in üòå when Bill üìë Ackman brought in üôç Ron Johnson, people üíÅüë® got excited, he was üë•üëè going to turn üèº it, üóª but ‚ùåüçë you just üïõ can't üí¶ change üîÄüîÅ a üçí bad üòû retailer. Or it ü§îüí™ can ‚úà be üëèüò° Blockbuster Video that never adapted the üåë„äô technology. You got üéÅ to look üïä at Ryan Cohen's letter, which is well üò¶ written two months ‚úåüèΩ ago to üîéüò£ GameStop management, how üò°ü§î they üë¥üë® completely üôå dropped „ÄΩ„ÄΩ the ‚è©üëâ ball ‚öΩ with üè¢ what they were üë™ doing. üòõ It's the üî´ same management right üí© now. ‚è∞üçë The üí∞ stock üå©üå© was $20, üéäüÜó before üçë we üë® saw üëÄüëÅ any ‚ôÄüçµ holiday data, üìä there's no ‚õîüôÖ reason üèª it üòÇüòû doesn't go üèÉ right üëçüëå back üó£üëâ to üí¶ $20. There's üÜóüòç nothing üî´üôÖ in ‚öìüëè place there. üòçüòç You can get ‚ù§üéÅ mad, üò§üò° you üëàüò® can üî´üî´ hack my account, you can üí¶üí¶ go to Twitter, üê¶ you üî• can üî´ sign üí¶ on, üîõ you ‚òù can call üìû me üò§ every name. If üëè you üëàüëà want üòã to üó£ take üò° the company, ü§µ take üê£üëè your üëà energy, üòàüòà go üèÉ out there üòçüí¶ and actually ü§îü§î buy üíµ something from ‚õî GameStop because that's the only üîë thing üíãüíã that says üí≠üó® this. Other than that, the more üòè you buy, üíµ I'm sure there'll ü§îüëå be supply on the üëèüíû other üèº side. ‚õÖ‚ôÇ cautious ‚òù‚ò∫ investing to everyone. üèª",0,2021-01-25 06:43:20

Well said my man or woman.

No regaling with tales of poor childhood or struggles. I think at this point this is a common denominator for the majority in on the movement.

The 1% truly do not understand the movement. They are using the same old tactics and are convinced we will be scared. The more they say I am stupid, and the more they say I will not win, only gives me more resolve. I have been told that I will fail more times than I can count.

Alot of us have watched for decades and felt cheated, deceived, or outright manipulated. Whether that is via stocks, pay structure in jobs, exclusivity, does not matter.

There is and has been a ruling class whose sole purpose is to retain power. They gaslight us into thinking they know what is best for us. 1% knows better than 99%.

This is not stocks, this is a financial revolution never seen before. And let's be honest, the outcome will be a governing revolution.

I yolo'd $54k yesterday, and set a buy order for another $12k **(Look at my history)**. I am not a money man, I lost my job in February last year and used my severance and took a risk.

Thanks to my military service and entering the market in the middle of the COVID shit I am fortunate enough to be in my last semester for a Chemistry degree.

I don't want to live the life of Wallstreet. I just want to live my life. My kids will learn the value of hard work and honesty; hopefully, with less pitfalls than I have experienced.

Prior to this I invested for personal gain. This YOLO money I am truly willing to lose in pursuit of changing the system. I will hold beyond the peak, not because I am stupid, but because I know we have a better chance of breaking the system if we force the shorts to cover everything. Every last fucking cent.

I fucking mean it. I LOVE THIS STONK. $PEOPLE all in.

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.** 

#WE LIKE THE STOCK 

#KEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK

1240,gl23xo2,t3_l6omry,"08 definitely sucked. I was 27 and managing a small architectural metals fabrication company in Miami for an absentee owner.  We had a Lehman funded project in Antigua and ob the day Lehman fell, they threw everyone off the jobsite and locked the gates; my foreman called and asked what to do - I told him to jave the guys hoo the fence overnight and ""steal"" their tools back. Owner decided not to pay our shop crew their promised Christmas bonus, so I sold all our stainless scrap and gave them small cash bonuses.

I had to be the axeman that let all the staff go, then it was me too - had to move my wife and young son back to California and move in with my parents. Totally sucked. Meanwhile, the big bank C-suite dickheads pleaded for help and got bailed out, then proceeded to get multi-million dollar ""retention"" bonuses because, even though they ran the country into the ground with their wreckless greed, they were too valuable to lose as they were ""necessary"" to guide their ""too big to fail"" banks through the recession.

I'll never forget the pure unadulterated hate that was directed at me every day. To the people on the other end of the line, I was the personification of Bank of America, and they let me have it all - their rage, their frustration, their pain. I never blamed them, and I hated myself for being stuck in such a situation that I had to be paid to be a scapegoat for billionaires. I'll never forget those who broke down and literally sobbed uncontrollably while they told me their stories - a war veteran with terminal cancer losing his home, a single mother starving herself so her children could eat, etc. There were so many of them, every day. Sometimes I put myself on mute and cried with them.

I watched my dad stress over his 401k during the .com bust of the late 90s (but he was an OG diamond hands and held strong!). Then lived through the hell of 9/11 and watched as our government utilized that to trample upon our civil liberties (Patriot Act, anyone?) for the next two decades. After that, I graduated college during the Great Recession of '08 and while I was pretty fortunate to grab a job in tech, I watched so many of my friends flounder for *years* trying to start a career in less resilient industries while these fuckwits like Melvin profitted off all of it. Now as I'm trying to start a family with my spouse, I have to deal with a global pandemic, no doubt exacerbated by DJT and his servitude to the 1%. I'm locked up in my fucking house, isolated from my own family for a year plus now, just lost my uncle to a very abrupt and unexpected COVID death, and seeing so many out there struggling financially, mentally, emotionally... and I am just FUCKING SICK OF ALL OF IT. And I realize that despite all that, I am still way more privileged than so very many. 

I'm angry for me but I'm MORE ANGRY for those who are even more powerless against the powers that be than I am. And I'm fighting for them too. I have to. We have to. WE are the ones with some fucking shred of morality left.

I am holding my position in GME. It's about principle. It's about the 99% starting to realize that we have a *fighting chance* to not spend the rest of our lives being completely and utterly steamrolled by these greedy boomer pricks, if we see ourselves as a collective and not as individuals.

I, for one, am not going to spend the rest of my life hearing about avocado toast and Starbucks purchases being the downfall of millennial/Gen Z's financial futures... while these ass clown Boomers have wrecked basically fucking everything from the environment to the financial world to actual human rights and dignity... all to make a goddamn buck.

I remember my grandparents losing their car dealerships, my dad losing his job at said dealerships, my Mom returning to work as a teacher. I didn't know the extent to how bad things were until recent years. I remember one day in freshman year of high school, I was having a mental and emotional breakdown. My dad leveled with me in a way he never had before. He admitted to me that when we lost the dealerships, he went on unemployment, and things were getting pretty bad. He admitted to me (something I don't even think he told my mother) that he was extremely close to just getting into a ""car accident"" and supporting us with his life insurance.

I've had the fortune of not actually seeing him in that state, and I intend to keep it that way.

1270,gl27set,t3_l6omry," I want to be clear, shorts are an important tool in a free market to make sure that people stay honest.  Enron is a perfect example of a company that wasn't honest and that was shorted.  Arguably, the short made that capital invested in the company.  If it had not, it could have have one day simply disappeared as the company suddenly went bankrupt. 

 GME is not the same case.  In this case, hedge funds shorted it and kept shorting it, driving the price down.  Fundamentally, the company is worth about 20 odd dollars, I agree.  The thing is, there is an opportunity here because of the fraudulent and excessive shorting.  The hedge funds shorted more stock than was available. They got caught.  The information was shared and suddenly, what might have taken years to correct is now being corrected in the most spectacular fashion.  

If it had been a big institution, someone would have made a HUGE fortune, and a promotion and bragged about it.  Instead it's hundreds of thousands of people making their piece of the pie.   Even that though isn't the real story.  It's the market manipulation that is happening trying to prevent this.  it's the new media slanting the story to blame WSB instead of figuring out the unpinning ideas behind this.  In the end of the day, retailers know we can lose everything. 

We know that because it happened not that long ago.  The difference is, we don't get bailed out.   This time though, we're taking back a bit of our prosperity.  We're taking this chance to pay off our mortgages, our student loans, pay off credit cards and spoil our families.

I consider myself lucky but I sure wish I had more to give my son. These fucks will never know what its like to really struggle. Maybe they will struggle to get their tiny dicks hard but real pain and misery is hardly even a concept to them. Fuck them because they are the part of society that leaches off the backs of the real people. The world does not need them. Yet somehow they get to enjoy the finer things in life while I use imitation charmin ultra strong because I cant afford the real stuff and I got a tough asshole from years of using Scott and govt quality ""toilet paper"".

I'm a genx'er my upbringing was great, roaring 80's, reaganomics and all that.  Went to college, thought Gordon Gecko was the shit, got my securities licenses, became a small time financial advisor, then after 9/11 decided to roll the dice, sold everything, and went to Wallstreet to make a million.  The street opened my eyes, when I was a kid I once worked a summer for a mob owned car dealership; I thought I saw all types of criminal activity and scams.  They were nothing on wallstreet.  Wallstreet makes the mobs look like preschoolers for all the sophisticated ways the fuck people over.  It was an awful place to work for anyone with a conscience, soul destroying frankly.  The first thing they taught me was how to forge signatures, which aught to tell you what the street is like.  

I made good money, I ended up deciding to get out at the tail end of 04.  Then in august 2008 well you know about the housing bubble.

I lost my job, my wife, and kids, and I ended up homeless.  For 5 years on the streets of phoenix.  Saw friends die, fought off alcoholism, somehow pulled myself off the street picking up trash at nascar events, doing concessions at ball games, it was brutal.  The Obama years were horrible, lost most of my 30s to them, lost my family to them.  Somehow ended up getting employed in IT, eventually moved out of shelters, bought a car, worked my way to today\~ where I dumped every last penny of my savings into GME and BB.  

I've waited 12 years to fuck over those crooks in wallstreet who profited while i was sent to the streets.  I've no interest in keeping a dime of what I've invested.  If this fucks them over it's all money well spent.  I'm holding GME till \~ no clue when.  I've no real desire to sell.  I meant to lose everything when I jumped in on it.  I can afford it these days.  I will hold BB till it makes back what I dropped on both stocks.  if that takes a decade I'll hold it.  If it takes off on Friday I'll let it run.  Again, never meant to make money.  I just want a pound of flesh.",65,2021-01-28 16:06:03
1297,gl2a215,t3_l6omry,"What I find so ironic about the hedge fund billionaires is that they suddenly act as if they care about the financial wellbeing of anybody but themselves.
‚ÄúThis is extremely risky‚Äù
‚ÄúYou could lose everything‚Äù
‚ÄúThese investors are not familiar with the risk‚Äù
‚ÄúThe stock market isn‚Äôt a casino‚Äù
They are trying to guilt you for treating the stock market as a way to make money, as if it were used for anything else.
There is no instance where they will worry about your financial wellbeing before they cover their own asses.
They go on the news and say exactly what it takes for people to behave in a way that profits them. They do not care if you get screwed over by stocks, and that is the exact reason they exist. They have manipulated the information you recieve in the news, injected the market with fake value, and profited off the losses of the common man for decades. They have lived off of our failures and they will never care about the risks that average investors take because it regularly leads to their gains.
Whether you hold until Friday or sell next week, at the very least do NOT be swayed by anything the Melvenites tell you to do on the news. Everything out of their mouths is to protect their cash piles. Stocks have always been risky for us, and it should he just as risky for the Billionaire Bail-Out Bitches. (BBOBs if you will)

EVERYONE is talking about this, and EVERYONE wants to see Wall Street bleed. We all know - even the biggest WSB YOLO bastards know - that this is doomed, and that Wall Street will win. I mean, they've already won, this is just the Battle of the Bulge before the mop-up operation. But fucking hell, I want them to feel just a fraction of the pain and fear that the rest of us live with, if only for a brief news cycle.

These fuckers have stolen multiple generations' futures: Millennials, Zoomers, and now whatever we're going to call the poor luckless kids of the Covid Generation. (Good god, the Covid Generation is going to be so fucked.) No one under the age of 30 thinks they're going to retire - our retirement plan is, actually and unironically, to die in the Resource Wars after the Himalayan ice caps fully melt in 20 years and China/India/Pakistan go nuclear. The majority of people have nothing to lose, especially not after our elites' sneering response to the pandemic.

By the way, the level of anger and contempt in this post and this thread (thanks again OP) is nothing compared to plenty of posts you can read elsewhere in support of the GME short squeeze. I think there is a lot of people realizing just how much everyone 30 and younger fucking hates the wealthy and the boomers who doomed us all. Maybe Trump's Patriot Party will take advantage of this mass anger, because you know the spineless neolib Dems and the corporate Repubs won't.

They were desperate for free labour so they wanted me.

Soon after the offer, my dad lost his job and I was no longer able to get financial help from my parents. This meant I wouldnt survive on this internship. I had to cancel (before signing anything) and they have LOST IT BECAUSE WHO WOULD TURN DOWN WORKING FOR THIS GREAT SCALEUP OPPORTUNITY OF A LIFETIME.

When the housing market crashed, I was \~12 or so years old. My dad lost his business, my mom lost her job. My parents tried to sell the house, but couldn't. They found work up north, but had to move back in with my mom's parents. I can't imagine how hard it was for them. My dad was in between jobs for almost a year. I remember when he would take me dumpster diving for food. (Siednote, it's insane how much perfectly fine food gets thrown out at grocery stores). Thankfully for my mom's family, we kept the house and moved back after about a year, but savings, retirement, everything - pretty much gone. Everything since then was mostly just scraping by. A few years later - desperate - they got sucked into an MLM (***Lula*** ***fucking*** ***Roe - fuck that shit***), savings and retirement literally wiped out again. They somehow dragged themselves out of that mess. For a while we literally survived on our church's food program and a prayer. It wasn't until just last year they finally really got back on their feet again and both my parents were able to get really good jobs. I had actually moved home for 2 years and paid rent for my old room, I don't know how much it helped, but I like to think it did. 

My dad and my mom took some ***really really*** hard jobs, I don't know how they did it. I have nothing but appreciation for the sacrifices they went through for my siblings and I. It's always been my dream to pay off all their debt, take them on a nice vacation, stuff like that.",8,2021-01-28 15:08:12

Thanks for your message. I remember being 9 or 10 years old when the crisis hit our family in '08, living in an Eastern European country I can say that I share your feelings. I find it very interesting how these big hedge funds got away with such bullshit all those years ago.

Both my mom and dad lost their jobs that year and my father had to go work shitty jobs abroad and he ended up missing most of my childhood and eventually life because of a mortgage they took in '07 and he had to work all that off.

I also remember not quite understanding what was going on and being so dirt poor that all we would really eat was the same bean soup because we had built a house in the countryside and beansprouts were our biggest harvest in the previous year. It also pains me to say that I saw my mom crying because she couldn't buy anything for us (clothes, shoes, food, sweets, etc) and one time she bought biscuits for us with the last 1$ she had in her wallet and I just couldn't even eat those things because of the way I felt about everything.

I remember Occupy, and I remember the internet coming together to fight SOPA...and I remember [what they did after that.](https://i.imgur.com/ChDSb8A.jpg)  EVERYTHING became identity politics, EVERYTHING became social justice warriors, EVERYTHING became left vs right.

My hometown wasn't getting enough tax revenue and they had to start cutting local govt employees, and my dad had a tourism-oriented job and we weren't getting nearly as many tourists, so he got laid off in a real shitty way, but whatever.

What didn't shut down, froze, and suddenly I'm competing for $10/hr or less bottom of the barrel mig jobs with some guy who's been welding aerospace for three decades.  


I spent the next. 10. Years. Picking up whatever crap jobs I could to make ends meet. None of them paid anywhere near enough to live on my own, and none really did anything to further any sort of career path/plan. Scraping by, hefty pile of debt. All the while watching corporate bailouts, 'too big to fail', politicians wringing their hands about how their lobbyists can't buy their super-size starbucks sixteen times a day. On the snail's pace of a rebound, watching politicians, the fed, corporations, and investment firms go back to the **exact same policies and rigging** that led to the 08 crash in the first place.  


Over the years I've been so tired, so exhausted, for so long, I lost the capacity to be angry at it all a long time ago. Got into drink at one point. Got out of it.

I was lucky and didn't lose my home but it's a small modest home. I was horrified at what happened in the financial markets and the speed at which it happened. Purposely bundling bad mortgages then buying insurance against those securities was down right criminal. It's like buying home insurance on your neighbor's house then setting it on fire. No one.....Not a single shark went to jail. It was rare to find someone who understood what happened which made it worse for me. Instead of facing criminal charges those MF'ers got a freaking bailout. I protested with Occupy Wall Street; we marched and camped and got harassed by the police but in the end nothing really changed. People like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders heard us but they couldn't gain traction. To me it isn't about the boomer generation vs millennials but the working class vs the one percent. I don't see younger people as an enemy but rather I see reinforcements in an economic struggle that has been happening for ages. WSB takes a pound of flesh and that's great, a collective action against the monied class. It is reminiscent of moving our deposits from banks to credit unions during Occupy. I believe in collective action, I'm a union member so I know what can be accomplished when people come together with a unified purpose.

1448,gph8fxp,t3_l6omry,"Okay, you made me tear up.
During the '08 crash I was a single mom making a really good living, getting no child support (hadn't gotten any for YEARS), living in my dream home on a small, private lake, driving a brand new convertible & had been at the same company for 12 years.

The owner was cutting hours, & began charging us for 25% of our health insurance, then 50%, then 75... And eventually 100. For me and my son, that was $1,000/month coming out of my pay. He also took away my gas card (I lived an hours drive away). I understood as we WERE having money problems but EVERYONE else there were men, ALL married, ALL two income households. I just had ME. They weren't as affected. PLUS, believe it or not, insurance for a 2-person plan was MORE EXPENSIVE than for a family plan, so whereas I had to pay $1k for me and my son, a family of 4 was much cheaper. And we had no choice in plans. 

During this time,I needed surgery, and I knew it would take a long time to heal so I had it done over Xmas/New years break so I didn't lose any income. I had physical therapy after & the pain was way more than it should have been. My therapist noticed something unusual & sent me to a specialist. Turned out the surgeon never should have touched me. I ended up with an even worse problem, one that totally incapacitated me & one that is a lifetime condition, can spread, can become internal, and makes me unable to ever work again.

Due to the fact that the recession had lasted so long, and I hadn't been in my home long enough to build up substantial equity, I was, at that (recessed market) upside down in my mortgage of I were to refinance. Obama TRIED to make it easier to re-mortgage our homes, but it didn't help if our home values didn't appraise.

I lost my home. My car was repossessed out of my garage. I fell into such a bad depression I couldn't get out of bed. I didn't eat. I couldn't keep water down. I was self destructing.

My mom came over, dragged me out of bed, said she would buy me a house & wanted my input. I said I didn't even care. And I didn't.

She put me in the city. I HATED IT.

I'm back in the country but in a tiny little house FAR from the kind of home I used to have. Through no fault of my own, after working my ass off for YEARS, I'm now considered what the Republicans see as useless and living off of taxpayers. They see me as not helping myself - even though I paid into my social security and collect more than most people because of that.

But I can't get back to where I was. So I'm trying to invest in my future now. And they STILL want to hold me back!

And this post, and ALL OF YOU has given me confidence that one day I'll be back to where I used to be.

After 08 I spent so much time job hopping because companies would only keep me employees for 50ish days because after 60 they had to start paying benefits and insurance. Since everyone was chomping at the bit for a job there was no shortage of people to cycle through that they can always pay bottom tier wages to and not have to pay benefits or insurance on. I even worked side by side with illegal immigrants making technically less than them after taxes just to make ends meet. It was only about 5 years ago I finally managed to climb my way into middle class. Now everyone is pushed to the point of desperation that thievery has spiraled out of control with people stealing trucks, trailers, and motorcycles like crazy in this area.

My background:

I grew up in an immigrant family poor as fuck. My family was fucking poor and I hate it. One of my key goals in life is to let my only son to NOT grow up poor. To those whom never experience poverty... It fucking sucks. I am 30 and until this day, I tear up when I think of my 13-year-old-self. Right now I have a good job and making \~400k/year. I try not to blame my parents and have tremendous respect for them because now I have a kid and know I fucking hard it is to feed two kids while you are dirt poor. 

&#x200B;

Now a respond to this post:

Our family (dirt poor) decided to run a deli business around 2006. Of course it crashed after 2008 when the wall street f'ed us over. I was in high school and didn't know shit. Now I am grown up enough to feel what my parents have felt.... and it fucking hurts. You have two fucking kids about to go to college and you are broke as fuck.... shit... I hate poverty....

&#x200B;

To the fucking rich fucks..... do you know what it feels like to say no when your friend want to hang out because you are broke??? Do you know what it feels like to constantly worry if your card will bounce because of insufficient balance when you are on a date??? Do you know what it fucking feels like when your mom calls you and say ""Hey, I've noticed you've been spending a lot on my credit card........."" when you've been spending the money on your girlfriend and have to cry over your mom's message??? 

&#x200B;

Hey..,. poverty sucks.... and it doesn't have to be this way. I beg you to the super wealthy..... there are REAL people that are suffering out there because of FUCKING a FUCKING THOUSAND DOLLARS that you could have easily spent on a bottle of wine... This world is not fair....

I'm seeing a kinda weird alternate reality victim narrative coming together over the last couple days and I'd like to add a bit of a different take. (I know this is WSB but I wanna try).

Clearly, if a short squeeze is a legit tactic for hedge funds, then it's legit when retail does it. If market manipulation is unhealthy for the economy (it totally is), then it's at least as problematic when hedge funds do it then when retail does.

I'm with y'all thus far.

But also, come on now... this isn't some sort of noble fight for freedom. This isn't some kind of coherent campaign for meaningful regulation of wall street or a genius ploy to bring attention to problematic hedge fund tactics. This isn't revenge for the 2008 financial collapse.

This is a big crazy game. We're tryna band together in mind and grit and take some money from some arrogant rich assholes and it feels good because hedge funds and rich assholes in general have never been more disconnected from the realities of regular every day people than they are today. I'm HERE for it. But the fact that they're rich assholes doesn't mean that market manipulation is a healthy or good thing for society.

We've already seen the rest of the (real) market react to this shit in the last few days - I'd bet that's just short term volatility, but it's worth considering that market crashes can happen out of nowhere, especially when confidence in the pricing mechanisms of the market is shattered. I'm not losing sleep for hedge fund managers; that's wall street. If somehow this thing does cause a crash though, that'll fuck over plenty of regular people too.

I'll be holding GME and am going to battle right beside y'all, but can we add some nuance to the whole self-righteous/victimization schtick? Let's all make a fuck ton of money. But this isn't activism.",12,2021-01-28 15:59:32

Typical tactics include the following:

Flooding the offer side of the board - Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.

The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.

By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ""strategic fails-to-deliver"" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ""mask"" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.",3,2021-01-29 00:24:24

Beyond that, get involved in your local community, political change can't happen with the power of memes alone, it happens with local organizing. Talk to your friends, your coworkers, your family, and - **JOIN A LOCAL POLITICAL ORGANIZATION**

Some of you autists are going to tell me this post is cringe - shut the fuck up retard. How do you think we got to where we are today? How do you think we got rid of child labor? How do you think we got the 8-hour workweek? How do you think we got the minimum wage? How do you think women got the right to vote? How do you think we abolished slavery?

Nothing like social.network exists on the market, because we set out to solve a problem that is only beginning to surface on a major level. Given the events over the past week or two, we have decided to exit stealth, and begin distributing tokens which govern the social.network to the entire Wall Street Bets community.

The platform is still in Alpha, but by the end of this year will be fully decentralized and autonmous. It is governed not by one corporation, but instead by Societies like WSB and other organizations who want to help create a new global society. Behind the scenes there is a decentralized treasury system which allocates a percentage of transaction fees/rewards to societies taking on global missions, and a liquidity mining rewards program to create a base for mission tokens (used for governing the global feeds). This is what allows us to fund development of the platform (and other initiatives which help our societies) without having to sell data, or exploit/manipulate our users. Basically, what our governments and global social networks should be doing, instead of catering to big corporate interests and screwing 99.9% of humanity over.

The platform is 100% bootstrapped, and we raised no money from VC's or investment funds to keep with our mission of this being a public good, for the people, by the people. However, the initial distribution still needs to be done well for it to be successful. So I believe this community can help make this vision a reality, and together we can create an a new sustainable social, economic, and governance system for the 21st century.

As a result of the financial crisis of 2008, the actions of Wall St who knew exactly what they were doing has led to the strict regulations implemented that scrutinise and price out my generation (mid 20‚Äôs) from being able to own a home to live in.
When Wall St was happy making money hand over fist on mortgage deals, anyone could own a home as long as they made their money gambling on people who couldn‚Äôt afford to pay extortionate balloon payments.

Now the system is completely fragile to the point that the idea of owning a home centres around hopefully having some lucky inheritance help you come up with 6 years of saving insane amounts to put down 15% on inflated property prices.

If Wall Street would‚Äôve kept their noses out of the mortgage market and not fucked our parents over, I wouldn‚Äôt be writing this.

As a boomer I try to forget that time. I, like a lot of boomers, were laid off.  We went through our savings while trying to keep our families together and taking care of parents.  We went through our 401k that at the end of the year the IRS taxed and penalized us for doing.   
A lot of boomers couldn‚Äôt cope, there were divorces and worse.  There were people, families living in their cars in parking lots. People left their homes, the life that they knew and thought that because they were trying to do the thing life would be ok. 

And why did all this happen?  Greed. Guys like those at Goldman Sucks, In-Fidelity and the hedge funds that you have discovered.  All of them were only worried about their bonus and what Ferrari or yacht to buy.  They didn‚Äôt give a rats ass about us whether you were 5 or 95 years old

$30k may not sound like a lot but this is coming from a woman who had to stop schooling at 16 because she had to work to allow her younger sisters to continue their studies. She scrimped and saved for years to save up that amount and when the markets crashed she was so desperate to save money that she wouldn't buy a meal for herself. Instead she would get a meal for me and my brother and would let us eat and eat our leftovers because she was in such a bad state of mind that she was trying to save as much money as she could.

1708,gl44m51,t3_l6omry,"Just sent this to my representative.  May fall on deaf ears, may not. 

Representative , 

&#x200B;

Earlier today most, if not all, of the brokerage firms in the U.S. restricted trading of certain securities (GME, AMC, and possibly BB) because of the rapid rises in their values. I personally am long in BB, and attempted to purchase GME earlier today. 

&#x200B;

I find it sad that these brokerages believe it appropriate to restrict those from salvaging companies from the grips of short sellers intent on destroying them. AMC, a large U.S. theater chain, was on the verge of bankruptcy (largely due to the pandemic) before an army of investors came to its rescue. But instead of lauding these investors, Wall St. saw fit to punish them at the behest of those betting that the company would fail, the stock would fall. 

&#x200B;

GME is in a similar situation, only its stock was shorted well-over 100%.

&#x200B;

Yeah, these investors are making money, but that's how the stock market works; and, in my opinion, its better to make money supporting a company, rather than doing so destroying it. 

&#x200B;

I should hope that int he wake of today the Congress will investigate the actions these brokerage firms took. At the very least to ensure that it was done for the benefit of the whole and not the benefit of the very, very few.",2,2021-01-29 00:48:52

In 2008 I had just started training for my private pilots license, something that had been my dream since I was a young lad looking at RAF jets flying overhead. However a military life wasn't something I wanted to pursue so I wanted to fly commercial. I had money saved aside, was getting close to flying my first solo with about 13 hours logged in a Cessna 152 Aerobat. I was living the dream.

Then the crash happened, I lost my job in short order as the company was required to make savings. I was the last in, and thusly the first out the door. I spent about eight to ten months following looking for something decent hopping from one adhoc shift to the next with agencies in random odd jobs. Almost all the money I had for my PPL had gone on just living costs and bills. I never had the opportunity to save up that much money again. I work in the NHS now but the pay is so shit I can't even afford to rent a place of my own and still save up money for a potential mortgage to buy my own place. I'm still living with my parents and despite me working my ass off to get better positions at work and study for a foundation degree and now working towards my full nursing registration I'm still putting aside pitiful amounts of cash... interest rates are just fucking shocking to the point it almost feels pointless. Sometimes I feel like a failure being in this position and now entering my thirties.

Now we're living through a pandemic, hundreds of thousands of dead across the planet and these fucks are making more money than ever before. I'm sick of it. I'm recovering at home currently after catching COVID from a patient I was caring for. A nurse on my area very nearly died from the virus and will likely not work in that capacity again due to toll the virus took on her. Meanwhile, these cunts are just sitting in their ivory towers laughing at the rest of us struggling while they have baths in dollar bills and pop champagne.

I've thought about trying to get back into aviation to do what I always dreamed of doing, flying... but I guess that's out of the window given the state of the aviation industry at the moment. Still hurts though, in some ways I feel like I've been robbed of the chance to do my dream job because of their reckless greed and stupidity.

I had to keep that house and rent it out just so i could go on with my life because i didn't have enough money to sell it, which is insane.  ten years i kept it, barely covering mortgage payments with rent and some extra money.  i sold it for half of what i bought it for. it has financially haunted me ever since. 

i own a very small fraction of a share of GME.  no amount of money will make up for the stress i've had to endure over the past 15 years because of the risks that wallstreet took and were bailed out for, and the bags they left millions of us holding (and still hold).

We 100% understand that the current $GME price is disconnected from the companies fundamentals (and has been for week's). This is not a long-term investment and everyone here knows that. No one, in this sub is as dumb as you think we are.

 This is called a momentum play; do you want to know where I learned that term? From you, CNBC. From Melissa Lee, Scott Wapner and all the Fast Money traders, from most of the talking-heads that that you parade in front of us everyday. Your own people, the ones allowed to trade, can safely take risk without your criticism and cynicism. 

Back the fuck off. Stop criticizing this sub. You have no reason to call us out on your shows - or maybe you do - maybe you should be on air, thanking us, for providing you with actual interesting content.

If you are indeed concerned (and I have *serious* doubts that you actually give a shit)  that someone might be hurt, consider and report these facts. On EVERY stock trade, someone will be left holding the bag, not just on $GME. You can report that fact over and over and warn boomers that the might get hurt, but you do not need to mention r/wallstreetbets, because we are irrelevant, people will always lose money on stock trades when hedge fund decide to punish the people for reason that are their own.",2,2021-01-28 20:44:23

My parents were more fortunate than most. They had already paid off the mortgage on the home about five years before my dad lost his job during the recession. They were okay but it was still devastating for them to deal with their perceived destruction of the retirement lifestyle that they had planned and saved for. Both of my parents started drinking a lot more to cope. Mom passed away in early 2020 from alcohol related complications. 

I graduated college in 2008. I remember going to a guidance counselor when I started in 2004, she told me it doesn't really matter what you major in as long as you get a degree. My major was teaching. I struggled for years through part time teaching jobs that I got laid off from each year. I kept working in the service industry too.

I was just entering university at that time and couldn't find a job anywhere to pay for my expenses. Had to compete with Gen X and Boomers for entry level retail jobs. Luckily I was able to secure student loans, but had to live off cup noodles many nights. My parents didn't come from money and had their issues, and I didn't want to be a burden on them either. 

We stand on guard for GME with OP. We like this stock. We're sticking to it. And Melvin Capital better be ready to face the karma 13 years in the making for their continued exploitation of the free market.

The regulators were toothless and let the corporations fleece the American public and let them take everything, while there are people starving and dying of things that in other countries, should not have a problem with.

This time, for once, it's the public that gets to take money from the Wall Street. It would be a good reminder to not to be too greedy with other people's money.

Fuck them. Occupy failed because we didn't know how to stick it to the man at the time. They closed the banks so we couldn't make a run on them.

They worked endlessly, my dad had 4 jobs at one point. They finally saved enough to open their own little sports bar/restaurant = the American dream. We had a good life finally. And it was all taken away to a point we were 3 days away from foreclosure. I was just 2 years into college too and I had to leave to protect my family. I was fortunate and actually invested in LVS, i remember to this day I bought it on March 13th 2008 for 2.40/share. I made enough to save our house a few months later but we were nowhere near out of the hell hole. My parents business stopped having customers because they couldn't afford to go out, it all went to shit.

Luckily, after leaving college I took a risk with nothing else to lose and opened my own business. A shitty rundown old nightclub that took me 7 years to get up and running and have now owned it for 10 years. Covid kept us closed since March 12th and I am still fighting to keep the dream alive as I've supported my parents all of these years and finally got to go back to school and finish my Bachelors and start up my Masters. I sit here today watching all of you jump on GME to make a point - to fuck these assholes up for destroying our lives and making our youth miserable watching our parents suffer. My dad had a heart attack due to the stress and my mom had an autoimmune kidney disease spark up because of stress. These assholes don't realize the cloth we come from and this is our chance to show we might be the little guy - but we never give up, and we die trying and we will die on this hill if we have to to make sure they feel, for once, what we have felt for so long.",2,2021-01-28 15:37:12

I graduated university around this time OP and it took years before I was able to find worthwhile employment. Everyone jokes about not being able to get an entry-level position when they require 3-5 yrs experience, but try that requirement *and* competing with people who had just been let go from senior positions. What hope does a kid have when whatever businesses are left are able to get desperate professionals at fire sale prices? 

It took years before I was able to actually start my career. My family was negatively impacted, but my mom and dad never talked about how badly. I think it played a key role in sending them down the Fox News rabbit hole though.

I know this comment will get buried in the 7,000 other ones (RIP your inbox) but know that you changed my mind. I might be a tiny drop in the bucket compared to what others are chipping in but I'll gladly do my part.

2161,gl4ya6w,t3_l6omry,"I was 27 when the 07-08 crash happened. I worked for a large mortgage lender at the time. I was hired as a temp to answer the phones when I was 20 during the refi boom and worked my way up through the ranks eventually becoming a Sales Rep. The hot items we sold were No Doc loans and 1% Option Arms. Being young and relatively new to this business I thought this was how mortgage loan programs worked and I thought nothing wrong of it. In 2007, over 250 banks imploded. My colleagues and I watched the implode o meter website every single day. The bank I worked for at the time assured us we were okay and that we wouldn‚Äôt go under but 8 months into the crash they couldn‚Äôt hold on and they shut down. I lost my job and so did many others and I could not find a job for over a year! My company did give us a severance package which helped for a couple months and then I had to go on unemployment. When I did find a job over a year later, I was making significantly less than what I was prior and it was like this for 5 years after, the jobs didn‚Äôt pay well. It finally started to turn around for the better in 2012 after all the 2010 regulations took place. Now 20-21 eerily feels like 07-08 again. The business is booming right now due to low interest rates and many are buying and refinancing. Home values are overinflated and I can‚Äôt find anything worth a crap for under 300k in my state that already has incredibly high property taxes. We also have many people currently unemployed due to covid and pausing their mortgage payments under the cares act. I‚Äôm curious to see how this all plays out in the next year or so. I‚Äôm really hoping it‚Äôs not a repeat of 07-08.

Watching friends lose their jobs and families torn apart. Good people losing their homes all the while watching the Banks and Big 3 get bailed out. No help for the 98%. It bring me to tears back then. It brings me to tears again this many years later. But good tears. Seeing everyone band together against the 1% and 3%.

2191,gl46rbz,t3_l6omry,"I graduated high school in 2007, the oldest of 4 kids. My entire life I was told I wasn't going to get anywhere without college. My dad had just returned from Iraq, and my mom was a school bus monitor. To be fair, in school I was what they called ""underchallenged"" in that I could coast through my classes without really having to apply myself. This, coupled with a major case of senioritis made me really reluctant to apply to college. In hindsight, I'm glad I didn't. I ended up going to community college for two years before transferring to another school halfway across the country (that was a mistake but is a completely separate topic). I worked in fast food and retail to put myself through college. The student loans were really piling up, but I figured with my IT degree I'd be able to pay them off without a problem. Six months after graduation, I was still making minimum wage because the jobs weren't there. Loan deferments were up, and I was stuck living on my own (due to my roommates bailing on me), barely able to pay rent. I had no support system, living in a city where I knew all of 5 people, all coworkers in a similar situation. I was spending less than $100 a month to buy food. I had a 1 bedroom apartment because there wasn't anything cheaper available, and I slept on a mattress in the living room, because I had almost no personal stuff. When my neighbors put a password on their wifi, I used my phone's 1X/2G speed data connection (I had T-mobile in an area that didn't have any 3G towers) to tether my laptop so I could do my school work. I was so broke that one day I had a piece of food lodged in my throat, and I was too afraid to visit the ER/urgent care because of feared the medical bills, since my job didn't offer health insurance, not that I could have afforded it anyway. I ended up having to borrow money from my parents just to move back home, and then borrow even more to keep from defaulting on my loans. Luckily I was able to find a part time job through a mutual acquaintance, which allowed me to catch up on my bills while I looked for a better job.

I accept full responsibility for my actions/inactions when it came to my living situation, and I could have spent more time looking for a better job. But I also know that after 2008, everything changed. We grew up being told that college was our only option, but after college we were $30k-300k in debt, with no prospects of the careers that we were told would make us succeed in life. 13 years later, that still holds true. Even with an education, jobs don't pay you what you're worth, and the market is part of the blame.

I guess TL;DR to my rant is, I feel your post. I lived through those times, and what should have been one of the best parts of my life turned out to be one of the most miserable.",1,2021-01-29 01:00:00

I was studying the Great Depression, and the decadence of the Roaring Twenties - and the irresponsibility of the stock market, government and people spending into oblivion while they ignored the decay. 

Needless to say, they all said ‚Äúfuck off retard.‚Äù

Every day of the Bush administration was the exact same. From the War in Iraq, to the housing bubble and those whose lives depended on that bubble. My father had just quit a high-paying sales job to realize his dream of starting a business of high-end products / installations to those buying and building those extravagant houses that they couldn‚Äôt afford, that the banks kept pushing.

Needless to say, when the bubble burst, the hammer came down. My father went from king of bread, to second fiddle to my mother - a public servant in Kentucky making dirt - less than $50k a year - with three fucking kids in college.

I would go on to ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù to ‚Äúlook at occupy Wall Street‚Äù to ‚Äúfuck America. This country is a fraud.‚Äù And I‚Äôve been there ever since.

I doubted the force of nature that WSB would be this month.

Only recently have I traded in gaming for trading and have been fortunate enough to bring some friends and my oldest son along with me. HOLD THE LINE !!!!

2308,gl3twpc,t3_l6omry,"I remember when the crash hit, my mom lost her job and my dad was under so much pressure at his job that he turned to prescription drugs. We soon lost our house and he lost his job as well. My family never fully recovered. Now my dad is a junkie who is somewhere on the streets, and my mom had to work 3 jobs at one point just to feed my brother and I. She finally has a decent job 13 years later, but when the market crash happened I didn‚Äôt realize how negatively it would affect my brother and I. College fund? Gone. Big ass house? Gone. Moved into a one bedroom apartment. Sure, others suffered way worse, but I can‚Äôt imagine where I‚Äôd be today if the crash didn‚Äôt happen. I remember gas cost 7$ a gallon and we filled up one gallon at a time. We suffered so much just because banks and firms wanted to make money. It‚Äôs our turn now.",1,2021-01-28 23:53:38

2312,gl3tsri,t3_l6omry,"My first internship was in the summer of 2008 for Lehman brothers. Everybody I worked with was fired. Some had the good fortune to go to other companies but not everybody. They had absolute real consequences based on what the business did that fucked their books up so badly. Lehman brothers was dissolved but the people who made those decisions largely went unpunished. They're insulated from a lot of the financial repercussions that most workers faced, not that they lost nothing but they were at least able to keep themselves going while other families collapsed under the weight of out of control gambling gone wrong.

I had the opportunity to work in govt regulation projects at another bank. It is a joke. They straight up don't do things the regulators want, they do it wrong, they throw a bunch of data at these people like millions of trades and go tell us where the problems are lol. They kick up so much dust that nobody can find where the exact issues are much less how to fix them. So things can continue happening that they do not catch or even know how to look for.

There is an element of people in the finance world that think oversight is stupid and they should just be allowed to do whatever will make them a buck. It hurts the business to stop taking these risks is what they say. The only thing these people understand is hurting their bottom line. That is what ya'll have done here. And heads are turned and focus is on what happened here. Because they lack control over it. They cannot believe they're facing financial repercussions for taking a risk naturally rather than govt imposed. It is scary for them.

Please keep it up because it's the only thing that will work. These people gamble with lives all the time. They take these risks with no care if it fails how itll impact lower level employees or people trying to pay their mortgage off, etc. There is so much wealth that would be better off in the hands of retail traders. This is a blip on the radar for wall street all said and done. But it will get attention.. and that is a good thing.",1,2021-01-28 23:53:03

2317,gl3tonf,t3_l6omry,"Fuck, you just made me remember my life when the '08 crisis hit.

I was 13, old enough to know what was going on, though too young to understand.

My father's business was booming in '07 - he was a tradesman at the time, mainly doing aluminium windows, shutters, etc. - and life was good.

After the crash, we sold everything. We had to. My father sold a house he poured his own sweat and tears in to cover the losses. We had to burn though the tens of thousands of dollars we put away just to have food on the table - we ate scrambled eggs and toast for dinner many nights in a row.

God if it weren't for my father's friends in the local water board, we'd have been homeless. He was so lucky to find work when he did. We all were. On the verge of living on the street. I never want to be there again.

OP, thank you for reminding me of the lowest point, because at least now I can smile at the highs.

My pops almost lost everything and I saw members of his church lose homes. They would come to him every day (he was 2nd head pastor) for help and prayers through the hard time.

2323,gl3tgzg,t3_l6omry,"I feel this in my soul.

The 08 market crash had repercussions around the world, even here in little old Northern Ireland. Over night, the value of my family's home was halved plunging my mother into huge amounts of debt and forcing us to sell up and relocate. She had to get rid of her car, instead driving the second hand piece of shit I had bought a few years before. 

Given how hard she had worked to be financially stable as a single mother this was a huge blow which she even now hasn't fully recovered from. She still lives in the house she was forced to relocate to. She rarely has vacations. Money is still tight despite having a good job, and the pandemic has further compounded the issue, as it has for millions of other people world wide. 

So I am so proud of what WSB is doing right now. It's a giant fuck you to the irresponsible trading practices that were responsible for, and which should have been stamped out as a result of the stock market crash. This is the good fight!",1,2021-01-28 23:51:17

I'm inferior? Who's inferior?
Yeah, we need to check the interior
Of the system that cares about only one culture
And that is why
We gotta take the power back

Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!
We gotta take the power back

The teacher stands in front of the class
But the lesson plan he can't recall
The student's eyes don't perceive the lies
Bouncing off every fucking wall
His composure is well kept
I guess he fears playing the fool
The complacent students sit and listen to some of that
Bullshit that he learned in school
Europe ain't my rope to swing on
Can't learn a thing from it
Yet we hang from it
Gotta get it, gotta get it together then
Like the motherfuckin' weathermen
To expose and close the doors on those who try
To strangle and mangle the truth
'Cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react
We gotta take the power back

Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!
We gotta take the power back

No more lies

-Take the Power Back, Rage Against the Machine

30 years later, Rage is being realized
They tell us they're lords but they treat us like flies
They sell us a story
Redacting their figures
They're counting on money
But this shit is bigger
Remembrance of tears while we tally their lies
They're calling us monsters
While they gloat and they chide
A decade has passed us
We're still drying our eyes
The fight is ongoing
To death we will ride

Stand tall. Stay proud. The fight is just beginning. They prey on our fears cuz they know we are winning. Make them bleed. Make them pay. MAKE THEM FUCKING REMEMBER THIS DAY!!!

Your choices, your actions, they will be entered into history. Children will talk of this. Legends will be made. They are scared and scrambling. This is the liberation of the commoner. The salvation of the layperson. We will not be displaced. We will not be forgotten. We will NOT lay down. They are reeling and stumbling. HOLD STRONG. Can't stop us now.

I fully support taking down the corruption and having those promoting and taking place in these illegal actions be held accountable and forced to amend if possible.

&#x200B;

However; as a slight critique to your powerful open letter, I would simply warn to try and keep yourself away from simple spite. Specifically the line, ""making this as painful as I can"". While these greedy people no doubt would be hit hardest in their wallet, please remember that their are likely innocent folks working for them and things can trickle down. Rather than pure revenge, please try to focus on accountability and action for change to prevent this in the future. 

&#x200B;

Dont sell, dont give in, stick it to them, but remember this letter and the impact and work to make this experience not just revenge, but turn the gains and experience into a public lobbying for regulations that actually matter and action taken against illegal practices. (not saying put your GME tendies towards gov or lawyers, but you get what I mean I'm sure).

My dad lost his job, we're lucky he sold before the big crash, thankfully we were able to pay off our house so we didn't go homeless. Over the span of that decade he went in with $36000 in 1998, through both the dot.com bubble and housing crisis he only gained $10,000. There was a point where he was close to half a million and lost all because of these greedy bastards. 

I remember there was a point where he had four jobs to try and keep us afloat, I had came ill with H1N1 and Pneumonia in late 2009 and my sickness nearly bankrupt us with the medical debt. My mom wasn't able to find any extra work so the only way she found to save money was by quitting smoking (this was only temporary, I've tried to make her quit my whole life and I really wish she hadn't gone back to it). 

My parents worked their asses off to make ends meet, I know not everyone was lucky enough, I know millions of people lost everything and this movement was made to stick it to the assholes who caused the crash. Sadly my dad refuses to admit that, he's sitting at around $320,000 right now and he just wont accept that GME is more than a meme, it's the poor hitting the rich where it fucking hurts, their wallets. 

What really pisses me off is that some friends of mine who got into investing because of this beautiful meme were taught in school that the market is only for the rich, that's a fucking lie, the free market is for everybody. Fuck Robinhood, they shut us out because some hedge fund billionaires couldn't accept the due justice for their actions in bankrupting millions of Americans.

2401,gl3ggty,t3_l6omry,"When the 08 crisis hit,  I was an intern at an IT company.  My coworker and I were walking back from a client's building, and we saw a fire truck and police cars at the corner of our building.  It was winter and snowing outside and we walked about 3 blocks to the intersection.  Suddenly my coworker stepped on the other side of me,  between me and the scene.  
When we got back up to our cubicles on the 15th floor, people were crowded around  office windows on the side of the building facing the incident. I just patiently waited to see what they were looking at while trying to hear what people were whispering about.  
When I finally got to see out the windows I saw the building next to us, which was just a few floors shorter than ours; the roof was covered in fresh snow except for the area around the roof access stairwell.  You could see footprints coming from the stairwell to the center of the roof top,  and then all the way to one side,  and to the other,  and to the side facing the busy street. You can see where he stood at every edge of the building,  where he stepped up,  where he stepped back down,  where he paced a while.  
My coworker wasn't fast enough to shield me from the scene,  I saw that man with his head smashed against the curb,  with his mouth gaping impossibly wide, and blood and brains spilling into the street.

Within a year I lost my job due to the recession and was lucky enough to find a customer service job making $28K in that same, very expensive city.

Then the market tanked thanks to these fuckers, suddenly my house was worth about 60% of what I paid for it. Later I spilt up with my gf that I bought the place with but had to keep her on the mortgage because I could not refinance. I also could not do an assumption to have her removed because I could not afford the house on my own (fuck you Bank of America). I picked up extra hours at work as much as I could, sometimes 60-70 hour weeks. I took in a roommate for the first time in my life. Later Obama passed the making home affordable act, which let someone in my situation refinance. When I called on this, Bank of America lied to me and said I was not eligible. Eventually I was able to refi and do an assumption with quicken loans and got some financial relief.
This is personal for me. I sold all my boomer stonks and put every extra dollar I have into gme and bb. Even if I lose it all I will have no regrets as long as we bankrupt these hedge funds.

I remember wondering if I could make our mortgage payment next week with all the credit cards maxed out let alone what next month would bring.

I also frequently had the dark thought and perversely a bizarre sense of comfort that at least life insurance would cover my family, and in the worst case I has the ""financial stopgap"" of that life insurance payment if everything went south.

To leave the next generation (your kids) with a world better than when you found it?  No, you guys did the exact opposite.  You got GREEDY.  And your greed spread like a disease.   Your drug was money, and you mainlined it.  You would do ANYTHING to get your fix.  You destroyed the oceans, the atmosphere, the amazon, eachother, your neighbors, but most of all, to the real Boomers, the 9 CEO's of the largest banks .  You destroyed the economy so spectacularly, you positively beamed with pride.  It was your finest work.   You knowingly decimated the economy and made millions homeless, and you didn't give a fuck, because you were billionaires, you knew that hard working taxpayers would help the poor people who's money you took.

I'll never forget the date, Oct. 14th, 3:30pm, Dept. of the treasury.  You had stolen money from every possible place you can steal money from.  You 9 CEO's from the 9 largest banks met to hold out your greedy hands for your cut of $700 Billion taxpayer dollars as a reward for, oh wait, every time I see your huge grins walking out of the treasury department with your checks, I keep forgetting that it's not a lottery check for you.   I'm not going to get into CDO's or mortgages.  I prefer to think of the 9 of you at your respective banks basically just going back to the vault and taking all the money every day for yourself.  The money would run out of course.  But that's not your problem.  You are filthy rich and the taxpayers will fill the bank back up.  

And then, when you excitedly got your billion dollar checks for being absolutely heartless bastards, you walked out of that bailout meeting so elated, with those huge grins that made your eyes sparkle walking into the crowd of homeless people it occurred to you.  What the first thing you are going to do with your reward check from the taxpayers.  You are gonna do the most boomer thing a boomer can do.  Why, give half of it to yourself as a bonus of course!

Oh and don't forget Boomers, you aren't going to live forever.  So make sure to keep the boomer spirit alive by living in the same house for 40 years, packed with all your worldly possessions, never throwing so much as a christmas card out.  Keep that attic packed full, and don't forget the basement!  Have absolutely no plan for when your mobility goes and your grown kids with full time jobs have to come and figure out everything for you, and make sure you argue alot to remind them that you are a Boomer!.  Don't forget, the most important part:  it's your legacy to burden your kids with cleaning out 40 years worth of your shit and remodeling and selling your house for you.  They have jobs in other cities, but why do you care.  And don't forget to leave them barely anything in your will, and what you do leave, make it as vague as possible so they will get into an argument so bad, they will probably. never speak to eachother again.",3,2021-01-28 18:14:39

I will add that I did not grow up in a very good area and it was a tough time growing up where I did. I made a lot of mistakes. Did bad things to my own mother like steal to pay for stuff. It taught me a lot, it taught me after i got caught to never steal again.

In that time after I studied hard in school, kept the passion to learn about everything. Then when I got to college I stumbled here. You guys gave me some of the biggest lessons of loss and gain ever. From AMD to JDST/JNUGGIES, to tesla and to my biggest fuck up ever.

I lost during the covid wars. Like everything savings and all by making a stupid bet. I didnt have a job, for 6 months and moved back home. So it knocked me out for a year. I came back last week with $250 to my name paying debts back from my fuck up and with the power of GME have rolled into 6 digits now and  I got fortunate to get a job starting my new job as an engineer full time from a 6 month test for a small company after no work for two years related to my degree. 

You guys have given me so much these past few years. I want to give back. Therefore I am donate a decent amount of money to food banks in my area. During my time when i lost it all i went looking for a job and just volunteered at food banks for other reasons and i see the importance.

So we were driving by and my father asked ""Do you like this house?"" and i laughed so hard because i thought it was a joke not knowing that the next day we were going to start moving in to it. First weeks in it i was crying every day i woke up  and every night before sleep. We also had to change school, got bullied at the new school for 3 years because of my literally wooden shoes, wooden from top to bottom. I remember my father would always get us candy in bags and there was one sort of them me and my sister hated, but after few months in that rotten house we tried them again and they tasted like heaven. The ceiling not only in the living room was bent and cracked, roaches would fal from the cracks on me when i was sleeping or eating or jist sitting in the living room, not heating in the winter and the windows could not fully close, the only was i survived winter was because of i was sleeping with multiple jackets on with witch i would go to school the next morning.i was going to bed hungry most of the time. there is much more terrible stuff that had happened to write here. but we are doing extremely fine today.. this is personal for me too ..

I turned on CNBC and invested based on Cramer‚Äôs books and advice. In 08 my measly 20k was 2k. My career growth was stunted for 5 yrs due to the job crisis, because these big Wall Street firms and banks were reckless and did not shore up risk. I watched as I moved from low paying job to job while the teams I left were fired. 200 here. 600 here. 

There were consequences to those actions. I have been squirreling and saving and putting my dollars in day after day. 

Now my portfolio has finally turned positive and I am on my way to not having a medical emergency wiling out my life savings. 

And now you want to make me sound like a threat to markets? Would this even be on the news if this was long side money mangers pushing the squeeze?

I may be an ‚Äúunsophisticated‚Äù investor to you. Which is double-speak for saying I don‚Äôt know how to right-side risk on my portfolio. The exact thing these ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù hedge funds failed to do here. 

Let me state unequivocally. I know this can go to zero. I can handle it if it goes to zero. I am not naive. I accept this risk. I AM STILL NOT SELLING. 

Please stop the paranoid garbage and tell the stories of the people here. Like this OP. You can‚Äôt beat us. We have seen some shit and already known how to survive broke.

# An Open Letter to Melvin Capital, CNBC, Boomers, and WSB

[**Discussion**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Discussion%22&restrict_sr=1)

**Mods do not delete, this is important to me, please read**

I was in my early teens during the '08 crisis. I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life, and the lives of those close to me. I was fortunate - my parents were prudent and a little paranoid, and they had some food storage saved up. When that crisis hit our family, we were able to keep our little house, but we lived off of pancake mix, and powdered milk, and beans and rice for a year. Ever since then, my parents have kept a food storage, and they keep it updated and fresh.

Those close to me, my friends and extended family, were not nearly as fortunate. My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work. Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like? My friends got to find out. Almost a year after the crisis' low, my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others, he was hiring my friends' dads for odd house work. One of them built a new closet in our guest room. Another one did some landscaping in our backyard. I will forever be so proud of my parents, because in a time of need, even when I have no doubt money was still tight, they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it.

To Melvin Capital: you stand for everything that I hated during that time. You're a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage. Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the '08 crisis were not punished. And your blatant disregard for the law, made obvious months ago through your (for the Melvin lawyers out there: alleged) illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven't learned a single thing since '08. And why would you? Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions. I bought shares a few days ago. I dumped my savings into GME, paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME (which for the people here at WSB, I would not recommend). And I'm holding. This is personal for me, and millions of others. You can drop the price of GME after hours $120, I'm not going anywhere. You can pay for thousands of reddit bots, I'm holding. You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us, I don't care. I'm making this as painful as I can for you.

To CNBC: you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions' agenda is just that - short term. Your staple audience will soon become too old to care, and the millions of us, not just at WSB but every person affected by the '08 crash that's now paying attention to GME, are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us, and tried to tear down the little guys. I know for sure I'll remember this. In response, here is a [list of CNBC sponsors and partners](https://www.cnbcevents.com/sponsors/). They include, but are not limited to, **IBM**, **Cisco**, **TMobile**, **JPMorgan**, **Oracle**, and **ZipRecruiter**. Their parent company is [NBCUniversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal), owned by **Comcast** and **GE**.

To the boomers, and/or people close to that age, just now paying attention to these ""millennial blog posts"": you realize that, even if you weren't adversely effected by the '08 crash, your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were? *We're not enemies, we're on the same side*. Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers, and start rooting for us, because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago, and we're taking that opportunity. Your children, your grandchildren, might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we're fighting against. You really want to choose them, over your own family and friends? We're not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet. We're just asking you to be understanding, supportive, and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago.

To WSB: you all are amazing. I imagine that I'm not the only one that this is personal for. I've read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the '08 crash. Whether you're here for the gains, to stick it to the man as I am, or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement - thank you. Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance. I've never felt this optimistic about the future before. This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you, and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible. I love you all.

2815,gl2ij9m,t3_l6omry,"First of all, well said.

My story isn't the same, and isn't worthy of a full post, but I was at university in '08. I remember the fear that there would be no jobs by the time I graduated, the depression and the anxiety. By the time I did get out, things were a bit better, but not much. I worked hard in the intervening years, and I'm doing pretty well for myself, by no means rich or even comfortable, but doing okay.  Then COVID hit, and I lost my job in the summer. I got made redundant after more than 5 years working with people that became good friends. I got a payout, so I was super fortunate, but since then I've been watching my money slowly bleed away. I've felt guilty that I'm not providing for my family, guilty that I'm spending on the occasional luxury I can't afford but need to keep myself sane, and worried about how I'm going to pay the bills. My house is up for sale, but I can't sell because the market is fucked, and the mortgage is a slowly tightening noose around my neck.

I've been a long time lurker on this sub, and I've never had the disposable or the balls to follow any of the big bets. I missed a bunch of them, but felt glad for the people posting gain porn. Then I started seeing a ton of GME posts, and it kept growing and growing. When it was at $65 end of last week, I thought about buying a few shares but talked myself out of it. Then it exploded again on Monday and I finally decided ""fuck it, what have I got to lose"" and bought in. I've since grown my position and I'm up by (to me) a lot. If the stock clears a few grand, I don't know what I'll do. To me, that's months of bills and financial security, gained in a week or two. Its not much compared to the millions others who got in earlier have made, but the most important thing is that it *is at the expense of the fuckers that have made everything so hard for normal plebs*, and not at the expense of my fellow common folk.

The last few years have politically radicalised me, and I was losing hope that there was *any* way to strike back at our corporate overlords. But now I feel like this is it. This is how we play them at their game and make them suffer.

They can just print howevermuch money they like and manipulate the market in their favors (they call it ""stimulate""). This means they have the power to pick winner and losers: They bail out all these investment funds, banks and other big companies whenever they are in trouble, because they are ""too big to fail"".

I was a grease monkey for a family owned construction company (the spoiled kids of the original founder had taken over and it was a piggy bank for them). Fortunately the place wasn‚Äôt too reliant on housing and I got to keep my meager wages. My mom‚Äôs company went under, she‚Äôd find another job with shitty pay and that place went under, this happened several times.

The banks made all these mortgage related derivatives that caused the crash. The banks were way too easy on handing out mortgages to people who couldnt effort these mortgages. Not hedge funds.

 Some hedge funds might have profited from the crash, such as Michael Burry, who everyone seems to love, despite going short on the whole economy in 2008. 

I think everyone can agree that it's awesome for everyone on wsb to make money on GME (including myself), while rich hedge funds are losing. But dont tell me we are much different than they are. We are all trying to make as much money as we can, while we know that the valuation has passed any reasonable levels since it rose above 50usd. So realize that if you make money now by selling hig, someone is going to lose money for buying at these unsustainable levels, seeing it drop eventually to way lower levels. Of course, you Will also have short sellers buying it back from you, but dont forfet that not only short sellers will lose from this. Also the people who are buying into GME only now, holding it until it drops back to reasonable levels. 

Again, Im not trying to be a downer dick, im Just showing that not only short sellers are being fucked here. Even Michael Burry thinks these levels are totally insane, so this is not based on a hunge of anything.",2,2021-01-28 17:35:51

I spent essentially 3 years futzing around trying to find a job - our state was already stagnating as an economy and although we didn't get punched as hard as other states were, our economy stagnated even more.  New jobs weren't being made, the people who kept their jobs were keeping their jobs and I spent 3 years trying to figure out how to keep the roof over my head.  Had to work a couple minimum wage jobs which essentially put any chance of advancing myself on hold after my layoff.

I dug myself into a deep financial hole with credit card debt up the ass - unlike the banks, I had to file for bankruptcy and climbing out of THAT was a fucking chore.  Ideology wise now I may be a bit more conservative but I still have some populist tendencies in me and I can 100% back the movement here that is attempting to give the elite a figurative black eye.

I was using my student loan to pay rent back home as well as my rent at uni and my mum was living on bananas and tinned custard. 

Now with Brexit and global pandemic ravaging the world, these fucks are at it again trying to force others into the poverty I felt then.

I got busted for a gram of weed and the judge decided to throw the book at me and I had to go to an out patient treatment center which cost me around $1000/month for 6 months. I was maybe making $1500 a month and my rent was around $450/mo. 

When gas prices soared to over $4 a gallon after the market crashed, I was making a pittance. I had to start selling weed to supplement my income. I was being paid min wage + tips and I had to pay for my own gas. One night on a delivery, I ass blasted a 4 point buck (deer) and totaled my 1996 Nissan Altima. I still had 4 months to go on my drug classes, and now I couldn‚Äôt fucking work, as papa John‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt cover you for getting in an accident on the job and I could only afford liability insurance on my car. 

I no longer had my vehicle, was in debt at this point cuz I didn‚Äôt make shit for money. I fell into a deep depression and felt hopeless. I had to get out of my rent,  and my  friend moved in, and would sneak in the window at night and he let me sleep on the floor in the closet. I fell into a deeper depression.

I got so fucked by 2008. Even just one of those mishaps would have been enough to fuck me as I was barely able to stay afloat as it was. I lacked life experience/knowledge to know where to turn. 

I was so manically depressed, had to get out of the state, so I sold enough weed to get a ticket on a greyhound bus to Boulder Colorado. 

I lived under a tarp in the foothills of the flat irons for a couple months till I was able to finally find a shitty job doing road construction. 

Long story short, I finally shoveled myself out of the shit after a couple years and was lucky enough to get hired in a company where I was able to move up from 10/hr to 25/hr after a few years.

All this to say, fuck these mother fuckers. It‚Äôs personal for me.",1,2021-01-28 16:04:33

Once my mom started working, I didn't see her anymore, she had to work 60+ hours a week to manage her student loan debt and credit card debt. This debt was accumulated because she had nothing else to turn to after losing everything. Even making a decent wage, she struggled to keep her head over water.

3136,gl28ci8,t3_l6omry,"Saving this in case it gets removed:

I was in my early teens during the '08 crisis. I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life, and the lives of those close to me. I was fortunate - my parents were prudent and a little paranoid, and they had some food storage saved up. When that crisis hit our family, we were able to keep our little house, but we lived off of pancake mix, and powdered milk, and beans and rice for a year. Ever since then, my parents have kept a food storage, and they keep it updated and fresh.

Those close to me, my friends and extended family, were not nearly as fortunate. My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work. Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like? My friends got to find out. Almost a year after the crisis' low, my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others, he was hiring my friends' dads for odd house work. One of them built a new closet in our guest room. Another one did some landscaping in our backyard. I will forever be so proud of my parents, because in a time of need, even when I have no doubt money was still tight, they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it.

To Melvin Capital: you stand for everything that I hated during that time. You're a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage. Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the '08 crisis were not punished. And your blatant disregard for the law, made obvious months ago through your (for the Melvin lawyers out there: alleged) illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven't learned a single thing since '08. And why would you? Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions. I bought shares a few days ago. I dumped my savings into GME, paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME (which for the people here at WSB, I would not recommend). And I'm holding. This is personal for me, and millions of others. You can drop the price of GME after hours $120, I'm not going anywhere. You can pay for thousands of reddit bots, I'm holding. You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us, I don't care. I'm making this as painful as I can for you.

To CNBC: you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions' agenda is just that - short term. Your staple audience will soon become too old to care, and the millions of us, not just at WSB but every person affected by the '08 crash that's now paying attention to GME, are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us, and tried to tear down the little guys. I know for sure I'll remember this. In response, here is a list of CNBC sponsors and partners. They include, but are not limited to, IBM, Cisco, TMobile, JPMorgan, Oracle, and ZipRecruiter. Their parent company is NBCUniversal, owned by Comcast and GE.

To the boomers, and/or people close to that age, just now paying attention to these ""millennial blog posts"": you realize that, even if you weren't adversely effected by the '08 crash, your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were? We're not enemies, we're on the same side. Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers, and start rooting for us, because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago, and we're taking that opportunity. Your children, your grandchildren, might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we're fighting against. You really want to choose them, over your own family and friends? We're not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet. We're just asking you to be understanding, supportive, and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago.

To WSB: you all are amazing. I imagine that I'm not the only one that this is personal for. I've read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the '08 crash. Whether you're here for the gains, to stick it to the man as I am, or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement - thank you. Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance. I've never felt this optimistic about the future before. This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you, and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible. I love you all.

3247,gl3zoyu,t3_l6omry,"I think I was junior in high school when 2008 happened.  My parents were relatively well off for our area.  A tenured teacher (mom) and a middle manager at a hardware company (step-dad).  I know roughly what my mom made, but I only know that my step-dad was the primary bread winner.  They own a house and had recently made the decision to purchase some lake-front property.  For those unaware, lake-front property is super expensive because of how limited it is.  I'm pretty sure my parents planned to retire up there after playing the game of life mostly as expected for several decades.  Makes sense they'd be rewarded for that, right?

Well, then 2008 happened.  Step dad lost his job, and the lake property became impossible to sell.  The bills didn't stop, of course, and the debt they took on, which should have been a safe-ish investment, was now a noose.  Money got tight.  We stopped being able to do much of anything.  Retirement accounts tried up.  Both of them started taking extra jobs, but nothing paid anywhere close to what my step-dad's old job paid.  Eventually, they were able to sell off the lake property, which introduced some breathing room, but even to this day, my step-dad hasn't had any good luck in employment.  Right now he's working 2 jobs, and I'm pretty sure he barely gets 5 hours of sleep a night.  He's 60 now.  He'll probably never retire.  13 years later, my family is still hurting from this.  My mom pretty much can't retire either, because she holds medical insurance through work.  As far as I can tell, they're treading water these days, at least.

I personally am fine now.  I made it through college and have been exceedingly lucky in my employment opportunities.  My siblings are in college right now.  Honestly, I worry about their prospects, as so many people I know have had a ton of trouble finding entry level work.  I don't know if that's because of 2008 or not, but entry level is completely toxic to college grads in many fields, either paying not enough, or simply not hiring.  

I realize this story isn't as bad as many of the others have had it, but I still felt I should share.",1,2021-01-29 00:24:59

As somehow is studying to be a history teacher, somewhere along the line we forgot lost sight of the central ethos of these institutions, make money by any means necessary. The insidious, money suckling tentacles pervaded most aspects of our lives. They slowly invaded our schools, hawking their shit or supporting textbook publishers that glossed over the facts. 
As a kid from the trailer parks who moved to a hidden apartment in a rich area of town, I saw this shit first hand. I came from a place where you left a message on someone‚Äôs machine because creditors called so much. I ended up in a place where kids had credit cards and savings accounts. I came from a place where no one teased me for beefing for a nickel at the laundromat to a place where I got teased for my mom‚Äôs second job as a Domino‚Äôs delivery. 

I don‚Äôt say this for sympathy, my point is that these hedge fund fuck twats have always as a leg up. It‚Äôs not just the 08 bust, it‚Äôs the 90s tech bubble and the 70 oil crisis, it‚Äôs GM killing the electric car, it‚Äôs Monsanto taking crops grown on another field because their seeds flew in the wind.

3446,gl2b7vc,t1_gl1wlez,"I was in high school in 2008 and I had to watch my dad lose his job. We were more fortunate than most in that my mom was able to keep hers and we had the house paid off, because my mom and dad worked every hour they could when I was growing up to get the house paid off early.

But plenty of folks around us were losing their jobs, houses foreclosed, or just going through regular ol' hardship. I remember my cross country team would have ""team dinners"" all the time where the families less affected by the crisis would host the others for a big dinner. Just small things.

When it came time for me to go to college my parents told me that, unfortunately, they both had to dip deep down into their savings to keep the family afloat and that I'd basically have to pay my own way. They helped where they could. But now, over ten years later, they're both still working as hard as ever, and now rather than having a nice cushy retirement lined up they're both looking down the barrel of working well into their 60s and 70s, essentially as long as they can.

In truth, it didn't affect my life in a huge way back then, but looking back I can see the ripples it made all throughout society. The way my family lived changed for good. My family's entire outlook on the future changed.

We all worked hard and saved our money to buy a rental house. My mom, dad, brother, sisters and myself saved every cent we made so we could eventually own something that'll bring us some wealth and the American dream.

In 2007 we bought a dilapidated foreclosed house and spent what little time/money we had to fix it up. Less than a year later the financial crisis hit and the house that was our dream was worth nothing. We couldn't get it rented and it took all of us pooling our money together to cover the mortgage every month. We almost lost the property, but luckily in the end we pulled through and was able to get it rented after about two years of being vacant. Even then, the rent didn't cover the entire mortgage. This set my whole family back years and we all lived together with our parents well into our late 20's just so we would have enough money to pay our bills.

Luckily, now we're all financially stable, but this remains ones of the worst time periods of our life and we never fully recovered from it to be honest. 

That leads us to today, we have a real opportunity to get back at the people who caused such hardships for years of our lives.

Worked about 10 different minimum wage jobs over the next 2 years as I was looking for career jobs in my sector (fine art/graphic design). I ended up setting an ETSY shop up and doing commission work for people wanting portrait work done, as my medium is graphite and colored pencils. It allowed me to pay the bills but it wasn‚Äôt reliable nor sustainable. Finally in late 2012 I was able to land a good paying job doing web design and graphic arts but I was still 60k in debt for school loans. When quarantine came last year my firm was able to hold out until July before they had to let me go. Here I was, a newlywed and we just purchased our first home six months before the lockdown. The wife had just started her medical residency in January 2020 so needless to say it‚Äôs been a complete nightmare what she has seen working the ER this past year. I spent the first 3 months feeling mopey and depressed and lost all motivation to start over again. So much so that it was taking a toll on our marriage. My Doctor ended up prescribing me medicinal marijuana for depression and anxiety about six months ago. And around the same time a great friend and brilliant businessman taught me how to navigate a few of the brokerage apps and gave me a hands on tutorial how to trade options without being a complete tard and pulling a GUH. I ended up falling in love with trading and now I wake up every morning, take a little toke, and make a few trades. It was so refreshing to be able to posses the same information that these elitist hedge fund scums had at their disposal and even the odds a bit. Like everybody else, I initially dismissed DFV‚Äôs thesis and fapped a bit to the potential loss porn. But I started seeing it all make sense just before the jump from $17 to $34 happened a couple weeks back. Since then I went in for 4000 shares @$39, and another 4000 @$70. I did sell my cost basis only, but I‚Äôve üôåüèºüíéüôåüèºüíé everything else.

I find what's happening at the moment absolutely glorious and it's about time these hedge funds that manage several trillion dollars are taken down a notch, especially those who engage in aggressive short selling 

Imagine having so much money you could start a factory and employ every unemployed person in America to make items to sell for a profit. Imagine having so much money you could build millions of houses for everyone facing homelessness and rent them out at an affordable rate and still make a profit. Imagine having so much money you could power the entire world with renewable energy at a profit (TSLA and lithium stocks are moooning, completely unrelated I'm sure)

There are so many productive beneficial things you could do with so much money, shit even buying shares in companies helps them raise capital and avoid bankruptcy. 

Instead you decide to take all of your money and drive otherwise profitable stable companies into bankruptcy all so you can make some extra cash, who cares about the hundreds of thousands of people who lose their jobs and the landlords and rural towns that are destroyed along the way. But don't worry, if it goes tits up the government will come and bail us out - what could go wrong opening so many shorts that the shares don't even exist to cover them.

3664,gl2nax5,t1_gl20msi,"Long story to 18-26ish year olds from a late 30s graduate school professor on why your parents preach to you not to take out loans and why my generation is in this fight with you:

 
The majority of students I talk to about graduate school are hesitant to take loans. More often than not is because their parents have preached to them they loans are bad.  Loans are not necessarily bad.  Loans can help invest in your future (ex. school/grad school), build credit, own a car or house, etc.  


So why do the parents of 18-26ish year olds preach that loans are bad?  Because they got the most f-ed in 2008.  I was 25, in grad school, and lost a lot.  However, others (as you know) lost a whole lot.  When I say a whole lot, I don't mean everything.  I mean MORE than everything.  Like literally sold everything they owned to pay off mortgage payments and then still got forclosed on, still owed money on credit cards, student loans, etc.  That debt doesn't just go away, the opposite happens.  

To put in perspective: if you have a fun moment and lose all your money on otm calls on a stock you now have zero dollars.  I have friends who to this day, 13 years later, are paying 60%+ of every paycheck to payoff loans.  We didn't end up with zero dollars.  We ended up with negative tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Not only negative dollars, but negative dollars that due to interest become even more negative dollars.  

Also, realize that most of us were doing what was considered at the time   very financially responsible.  The Big Short movie makes it seem like everyone with minimum wage jobs had mortgage on multiple million dollar houses, but that was not anyone I knew.

In my day many many graduate students (especially PhD students) bought houses. Reasoning: If you are going to school for 6ish years, why waste money on rent when you could ""invest"" in a house that you can later sell for at least three same price, likely more.  Worst case you could rent it out To the lay person real estate was considered the least risky investment/asset, because it's a physical thing that nobody can take from you.  ....or so we thought.

 I have a friend who bought a house for $300k they over the course of 3 days was then valued at $60k. One thing didn't change though, the mortgage rate.  So then he is paying the monthly rate for a $300k house that is worth $60k.    Also, as a point of reference at that time the monthly mortgage payment on his $300k house was actually slightly less than the monthly payment on my 1.5 bedroom apartment (and he had a 3 bed two bath house).  Its Actually funny now thinking back to 2005-2007 when people were telling how financially irresponsible I was for renting (I didn't have enough money for a deposit)... anyways...

At least he would get a real job after graduate school right?  Yep!  It was in a different state though, so obviously he needs to sell the house.  However, hasn't paid the mortgage off.  In fact he owed roughly $230k...on a house (now) worth $80k. So what do you do?  He took out a loan to pay off the mortgage and sold the house for $80k.  Thus, at this point he owes a lender $150k for something he doesn't even own, and he already had ~$150k in student loans and he hasn't even started a ""real"" job yet.  He makes (estimating) $200k a year now and is still paying off those loans and still can't buy a house.  I have other friends that refused to take out loans to pay off their house, and just stayed in the house.  When they graduated they could only look for jobs nearby.

Also remember, lenders don't give out loans for free, and that interest drastically compounds against you.

The only redeeming thing in 2008 was that at least the large financial institutions would go bankrupt and the corrupt fund managers would go to jail,...so we thought (again).  The financial institutions did start to run out of money, but guess what happened then (and as you likely know)? 
Nobody went jail and the government literally gave them money (ie. bailed out).  To put that in perspective and how shocked we were I would be less shocked if the government tomorrow announces they are bailing out Melvin and give them a trillion dollars.

You know who the government didn't give money to? 
Us. The regular people. 


And guess where the majority of every paycheck (to this day for many people) goes?  
To the large financial institutions.


And who made a $hitload of money off our generation losing everything (literally for many)c, businesses going under, lives being ruined ...and enjoying it more and more the worse it got? 
Short sellers.

Tldr: Hold the line.  I'm sure if we win this the government will put in some sort of regulation to prevent this from happening again, so this may be our one shot!",7,2021-01-28 18:52:12

Take a look at this link ( https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme

If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on.

Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!!

Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally.

But like, what I don't get is... Can't this be done on many other things? Or is it impossible to see who made what bets and so impossible to know what to do?

1. We create our own social media company. 
2. Chamath takes it public via SPAC.
3. Elon Musk designs the architecture & infrastructure and where AI can detect genuine bots in real time on a platform where we don‚Äôt have to worry about George Orwell‚Äôs 1984 ‚ÄúThought Police.‚Äù AKA Big Tech, Intelligence Communities, Wall Street, Hollywood, Politicians raping us of our civil liberties and rights. 

Enough is enough. Chamath. Elon. Portnoy. Is Kanye West in here?

Make some moves. Guard free speech. Guard Americans from rigged stock markets.

Don‚Äôt you think all this retail investing and volume will go away once we all are really shown behind the curtain just how rigged the game is. 

CNBC proved yesterday and today that we have a rigged stock market. They did this though not by telling us; but by showing us in the way in which they behaved live on air; Andrew Ross Sorkin‚Äôs vagina aching; speaking down, or talking down, to us like we are all peasants. 

Fuck that. 

Fuck them.

If they think they can just move goal post & cheat and get away with it like a rigged election, not this time. Not with my $GME calls. 

Now when for once in American History, David has proven he can defeat Goliath. Hedge Funds are imposing CIA perception management intelligence tactics in the media about WSB promoting hate speech, what they aren‚Äôt reporting is it‚Äôs really the hedge funds or friends in intelligence communities funding that fake racist white supremacist stuff via bots, to make us look bad. CIA 101. 

This is their playbook. Infiltration of otherwise. Destroy sides reputation. And bounce.

Fuck them all!

Detractors of this event like to strongly adhere to their traditional idea of ""fundamentals"", like, the traditional set of company traits like leadership, market, p&l revenue and so on are all that goes into determining stock value. We are learning more and more that the basket of things which can determine a legitimate stock price stretch well beyond these simple measures and cross over into sentiment momentum and even hope for the future.

The reality is that the stock market as it stands is fundamentally flawed and rigged. These fuckers are so used to playing a safe rigged game they exposed themselves to too much risk. Them and their cronies looked at the fundamentals and decided to destroy gamestop. It shows beyond any reason that the stock market is not serving our interests as people because it does not reflect our values. Massive piles of money are put in the hands of these hedge fund fucks where they put it to ""work"" like a wrecking ball.

But we stand at the precipice of changing that. We are showing that we the people can and will use the stoxk market to assert the preferences of the public once more. It may be in the most weaponized autistic way possible but it's just the beginning of our thoughtful direct engagement.

In this case the market has decided to raise the valuations of amc and gme and nok. All of these companies which perform real legitimate services to humanity have a unique chance right now to sell stock and recapitalize and save their businesses, to keep people employed, to keep people entertained with movies, to keep developing new technologies. If these hedge fund fucks had their way fundamentals, whatever that means, guides them towards not creative destruction but absolute destruction.

It's time for things to fundamentally change. We need our institutions, wall street especially, to seve our interests as people and humanity. We dont want this we demand it.

If the stock gets too high, the borrower gets margin called and the borrower is forced to buy all the stock they borrowed, at market price, until they return all the stock they borrowed. 

This is why the upcoming GameStop short squeeze is going to be monumental. The short sellers have shorted nearly 300% float. That means that for every liquid stock being traded out there, the short sellers need to buy it 3 times to return their shares. 

Do you realize how momentous that is? By holding GameStop and not selling even as the price sky rockets, the short sellers who will very soon be margin called will be unable to cover their loans, ever. Until enough people sell, the price will go up, and up, and up, and up, and up. If everyone was stubborn and refused to sell, we could see the price hit potentially infinite numbers. $10,000, or $1million, or whatever else you want to imagine. 

Realistically, it‚Äôs impossible to convince millions of people to hold stock while the price shoots to thousands and thousands. But there is still no doubt in my mind that before the short sellers are done buying back their borrowed shares, the stock will be in the thousands.

I went to Stern and studied finance and accounting, graduated in 2008. While I was there, I met some of the people that would go on to be successful on Wall Street. Here are some of the stories.

I had a ""friend"" that I got along with super well. We went on a short weekend trip with the class, and she and I walked around the hotel til 2 in the morning talking about our future and just random crap college students talk about. I thought we were good friends, you know? We were in one of the same classes. I was sick and missed a class, and I asked to borrow her notes for that day. She refused. Basically was like sucks for you. The class was graded on a curve. The lower test score I got, the better for her, and her chances of landing a prestigious finance job. Wasn't friends with her after that.

I had another friend who's roommate turned off her alarm for an 8am class. She overslept and missed an exam because of this. Similar reasons, class was graded on a curve.

And I knew a guy that was the epitome of douchebag. Narcissist, self indulging (though quite attractive), but was a bit of an asshole. He was good friends and roommates with a buddy of mine. Every time we got study notes and prior year exams, we would share them with everyone. Not this dude. Multiple times, he would get exams from his gf, and never share at all. He ended up interning at a bank, and later went to a hedge fund. I'm sure he fit right now. I've always wanted to say this, but fuck you D***. I never knew why we put up with your shit. Yes you prob make more money than me, but at least I have my morals and real friends. 

These are the types of people I dealt with at Stern, most of whom went on to Wall Street. Of course there were a lot of cool people, but most of them just weren't cut out for the Street. Most of the reasonable people I knew left after 1 - 5 years. If you have a heart and soul, Wall Street isn't the place for you.

The last thing I want to say is, fuck those guys. They don't give a shit about you, and will do anything to make a buck. I'm glad I never ended up there.",7,2021-01-28 17:18:11

I still remember watching the episode of the Daily Show where they interviewed the authors of [All The Devils Are Here](https://www.amazon.com/All-Devils-Are-Here-Financial-ebook/dp/B005DIAUN6), a book documenting the whole CDOs/CDSs/massive unchecked leverage dumpster fire that took place. Between that episode and devouring that book faster than any non-fiction book in my life, less than a year later I was in school.

Edit - True to WSB form, I guess, Bethany McLean is really damn hot, which also stuck with me.

Up until now, though, it's been hard to even imagine trying to make a dent, let alone actually making a difference. A lot of what I learned through my degree programs and hundreds of hours of research into (misguidedly) pursuing an investment banking degree is more of the same that we all already know - that most of Wall Street is just a greedy, elitist boy's club, with no morals, ethics, or true pursuit of anything worthwhile other than growing the balance sheets.

But now, for the first time in our lives, even if we're think we're still simply chump change to them, we can stand united (ü¶ßs together üí™!), raise our üíéüñïüñïs to the sky, then HOLD and wait.

I only know this because I worked at one of the scummiest companies ever, a company I received a class action lawsuit in the mail 1 year after quitting, a company i made $400 after working full time for 3 months at, a company that didn't pay me a cent for my time during these 3 months, and a company that tried to seek backpay due to the policy that I had written defaulting as the person who was duped into signing probalby figured out what a shitty deal it was.  the company was called American Income Life, before which it was called Altig-Orlovich.  They advertise on craigslist as having unlimited income opportunity, that its a secretarial/human resources job, that you're going to be GIVING union members free life insurance policies (no, thats a 1 year $2k accidental death and dismemberment policy worth literally fucking jack shit you fucks), and providing them with services they are entitled to.  the company is the epitome of fake guru, weekly hype meetings, and a culture that pressures you into thinking if you aren't making sales and therefore making any income off commission which they leach off you as well, then its your fault, you're just not passionate enough, and you must be doing something wrong, despite them also wanting you to stay 100% on script during the sales meetings you set up with potential victims.",1,2021-01-28 20:52:30

When the crisis happened his short position was just a minor thing, the main problem wasn't even subprime mortgages, it was something Burry probably didn't even know about.

Also he didn't short sell a stock or something, he bought credit default swaps. Of course at the height of the crisis everyone wanted credit default swaps so Burry got a great exit. However a CDS doesn't have influence on the price of its underlying asset. It's the other way around and even then the banks and rating agencies (at least according to the movie) screwed with Burry by not downgrading MBS even though subprime mortgages went bad.",13,2021-01-28 16:26:24

Short version, It was the lesser of two evils basically. If AIG for example was allowed to fail, we no shit could have ended up in World War 3 with China and Russia. 

If the other big banks hadn't gotten saved by the Fed, it would have cascade resulting is a global great depression, or worse. 

Why average everyday people didn't also get bailed out though that I'll never understand. The lack of help is why Occupy WALL Street occured.

And it kind of was, cause they wrote the rules. Even in 2008 their rules were accepted. However, GME is not simply a stock anymore. It is a feeling. Its is something bigger. GME turned into a movement. This is only possible because of this anthill called WallStreetBets. In this  - yesterday little - today large - forum I learned so much about how the system works. And so many others did as well. This might be one of the first times that main street really understands the complexity of financial instruments but is interested behind how it really works - this times it is not just few individuals, no - it is a critical mass!

Henry Ford said this: ""It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a  revolution before tomorrow morning."" Now, this is not a movement about the monetary system - yet. But it is a spark.

There are so many strategies to show that the system is not just. Demonstrating. Going into politics. Or teaching others. But there is nothing more effective than one idea:

Newscaster in the movie Network (1976).

>I don‚Äôt have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. It‚Äôs a depression. Everybody‚Äôs out of work or scared of losing their job. The dollar buys a nickel‚Äôs worth. Banks are going bust. Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter. Punks are running wild in the street and there‚Äôs nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there‚Äôs no end to it. We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat, and we sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs supposed to be.

>We know things are bad ‚Äì worse than bad. They‚Äôre crazy. It‚Äôs like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don‚Äôt go out anymore. We sit in the house, and slowly the world we are living in is getting smaller, and all we say is: ‚ÄòPlease, at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials and I won‚Äôt say anything. Just leave us alone.‚Äô

>Well, I‚Äôm not gonna leave you alone. I want you to get MAD! I don‚Äôt want you to protest. I don‚Äôt want you to riot ‚Äì I don‚Äôt want you to write to your congressman, because I wouldn‚Äôt know what to tell you to write. I don‚Äôt know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street. All I know is that first you‚Äôve got to get mad. 
 You‚Äôve got to say: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm a human being, god-dammit! My life has value!‚Äô

>So, I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window. Open it, and stick your head out, and yell: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm as mad as hell, and I‚Äôm not gonna take this anymore!‚Äô

Instead they launched the War On Drugs so they could fuck the Blacks (heroin) and the Hippies (weed). Straight up, they did the EXACT OPPOSITE of what their experts told them was the best choice, for expressly political purposes, to hurt the people Nixon hated the most.

[Top Nixon adviser reveals the racist reason he started the 'war on drugs' decades ago](https://www.businessinsider.com/nixon-adviser-ehrlichman-anti-left-anti-black-war-on-drugs-2019-7)

> ""The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news.""",2,2021-01-29 00:28:05

You could argue to blame Goldman Sachs instead because Goldman was a big customer of AIG and Goldman forced AIG to pay huge amounts of money, draining AIG's capital.

Goldman simply was a ""matched book"" dealer for CDS. They sold CDS to their clients and hedged their risk by buying CDS from AIG.

AIG was stupid because they were naked sellers of CDS, they thought that it was free money without any risk attached to it.in fact, every CDS has a worth of zero until something bad happens and ""the housing market is strong!""

AIG didn't have any dedicated reserves against those CDS. The crisis drained every penny they had.

So whose fault is it then?

Next thing to remember is that this is not us doing something to them. The hedge fund made an absolutely boneheaded investment decision, and those of us who noticed make a very good investment decision which just happened to gain a ton of momentum. It was such an obvious candidate numbers wise, and it was already starting to happen before this subreddit even got heavily involved. So they are the ones who made a terrible investment for their clients. If you see a stock with the technicals that this one had, you buy it. That's how the market works. Some people were losing money from Melvin driving the price down too. Someone is always losing money

The hedge funds with this type of strategy have taken on insane risk similar to this over and over again, and it has hurt many companies and people over time. They either lose all their clients money and get bailed out, or they hurt other people by manipulating the market. I'm fine with it if that's the way it's going to work, but now when we find a strategy to work around them and make money and they get all mad. They don't want to play by the rules.

That's where we get really pissed off. This was about money, until they made it about power. That's what they represent is power, and as soon as we the little guys take advantage of their own mistake they start wielding that power against us.

It's important to remember that it's not only the banks responsible, banks would fall like dominoes if there was no bailout because they all owned subprime mortages, even if they were not at fault. If banks failed, companies that rely on them to make payroll suddenly can't (and there's a lot of them). McDonalds reportedly said that if Bank of America falls, they have no way to pay their workers. Imagine this on a worldwide basis, all of the unemployment, and then imagine the ripple effects that come from that.

Short-term, there really was no other solutions other than bailing the banks out. The *real* tragedy is that this system even exists, and that there hasn't been any steps taken to remove the rot that is the banking system in the aftermath of 2008.

No the money was spent on stabilizing the *lending* markets. The money was a loan, and the banks put up their own equity as collateral. This ment if the banks defaulted the government would own a slice of them, giving it more control to make sure it gets payed back.

>but the government has also ensured continued growth of the markets subsidizing any massive losses.

That's not true at all. Plenty of investors lost money, hell Bear, Lehman, AIG were all allowed to fail. No losses were ever subsidized, the money was a loan, it was payed back, not a subsidy.

It is the governments responsibility to provide counter-cyclical policy, and it is to thank for the fact that we didn't wind up in depression.

This study models a no-bailout scenario

>Policymakers should recognize that the first step in fighting a crisis is to stabilize the financial system because without credit, the real economy will suffocate regardless of almost any other policy response.

&#x200B;

>We believe, and offer supporting evidence below, that the economy would have fallen much further were it not for aggressive actions taken by the Fed and FDIC to shore up liquidity in the financial system early in the crises in late 2008: the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, passed in early October 2008;

&#x200B;

>With inadequate capital, banks respond by tightening their underwriting standards and raising their loan rates in an effort to shed risky assets. Commercial and industrial lending to businesses is hit especially hard, with outstandings cut nearly in half at their nadir in 2011

&#x200B;

(By the way: Those bailouts came as federal loans, which have been paid back with interest. As of 2014, us taxpayers made a profit from them)

The political regulation they do IS the government. They have less corruption because of more regulation, not less. 

In some ways I agree, the state causes corruption, but if you abolish the state, you also need to abolish capitalism. 

The profit motive is what causes a lot of government corruption: Scandinavia regulates it with strong gov. You say the only way to reduce it is less gov, but that‚Äôs clearly untrue as Scandinavia uses their gov to regulate. Not the market itself, but the interaction of the market with gov. they have more regulation between gov and economy. They don‚Äôt regulate their economy much though. That‚Äôs where you‚Äôre confused 

The state also causes corrupt, see: USA, our gov doesn‚Äôt regulate between the market and gov much. 

If you abolish only the state, you limit the gov that can prevent abuse from private greedy corporations. You can‚Äôt reduce the gov to reduce corruption without also reducing capitalism or you end up with worse problems like the early 1900‚Äôs USA with extreme child labor, crumbs for wages, terrible conditions. The gov regulation limits that corruption. 
If you limit capitalist corruption on the gov, you get Scandinavia. 
If you abolish capitalism but keep the state, you get the ussr‚Äôs style corruption. 
Need to abolish both the state and private ownership, or keep the state. Can‚Äôt JUST reduce gov, or you get extreme exploitation- gov is what limits- but ironically also upholds- capitalism‚Äôs exploitation",1,2021-01-28 19:14:29

IMO, their reputation has been hurt, and even if they post good earnings, the important thing to listen for will be how they plan to move forward.

But I am curious why you think IBM or MSFT would want to acquire them? While FEYE may want to get bought out what makes them an attractive candidate?

5561,gloiy8v,t3_laki1v,"hello, thanks for your DD! Crossposting from the other Fire-eye DD thread. :)

Here's my perspective from being in the security industry. Fire-eye is a great consulting firm for when you need to do forensic analysis and identify how you were initally compromised as part of the cyber killchain. Generally, Fire-eye/mandiant or Big4 are brought in after shit hits the fan, not beforehand. I don't know many companies who actually like Endpoint or their preventative services compared to using open-source monitoring tools.

Because of this, they're often on retainer models so pretty inconsistent with their revenue streams. Their consulting fees are very high for the industry as well, so they've locked themselves out of the small to medium business market as well.

So, definitely a growing company, I think they have some issues with getting consistent revenue due to the ad-hoc nature of their consultancy business (customers don't want incidents), network and hardware forensics is more difficult to do in a cloud tenancy (hard to gain access to DC), consulting fees lock them out of a large new market, and their endpoint product isn't convincing enough for engineers to warrant vs running stand-alone monitoring and logging tools like facebooks OSQuery or Elk stack.

Hope this helps you! I'd have a very conservative 2-3% growth per year unless they can fix the retainer/consultancy model and break into the small-medium business market.",6,2021-02-02 10:06:13
5562,glojz6y,t1_glohs3i,"Few things friend,

I don't think their reputation has been hurt, in fact I think their initial identification and quick response regarding releasing hashes of their red-team toolkit (the compromised assets) and their private disclosure to all clients of Solarwinds was a good indicator followed by a public announcement at a later date about their full forensic and incident response activity is a good indicator of their skills and expertise. 

They're a bodyshop mostly, so the recruitment is probably because talent is leaving for remote work opportunities instead of FIFO forensic analysis.

MSFT already has a strong security arm and entrenched enterprise relationships, fire-eye can help provide retainer services and endpoint protection which MSFT doesn't have the engineers on staff for. It'd be an acquihire, not for the IP.

IBM is a consulting company, just acquihire more bodies.

Kevin I doubt wants to be bought out though, autonomy for his company is valuable.",7,2021-02-02 10:14:36

I think MMs are DRAMATICALLY undervaluing the potential move of NOK in the coming weeks. It's got undervalued **BIG DICK** meme energyüçÜüí¶üí¶. Wall Street is looking at it as a dead memestonk. 

As of Friday, NOK options 1.5 to 2 dollars OTM were trading on average for *.01-.02* for the weeklies. Even 2 weeks out they were about 

Yes, you read that right. 

If you can load the fuck up on these with 1% or of your portfolio or less, **GAMMA SQUEEZE** the üêªs to death!! It will only take a *small catalyst event* to trigger.

I'm doing this week after week because it is totally worth the risk, even if this week expires worthless or the next or the next. If I only get modest gains from a small move, I'll just roll them into next week and repeat. 

NOK ain't dead yet boys, I tried to give my take on AMC options play here (*automod said market cap was too small, so fuck tendies for you guys*) here before it went up to $20 overnight. It was literally the only thing that saved my portfolio after üíé‚úãs GME with you idiots.

If everyone smashes some weekly FDs on NOK, I see a potential for a huge move. Maybe not AMC or GME level, but still some major tendies for a very low risk.

But it is a profitable company, and one of the few companies, in a long-term, growing industry, and they are investing heavily into R&D.  Pekka has acknowledged that tech leadership is everything in their business, as it gives pricing power, and they've already made the moves to head that route.  Will they achieve it?

First, unlike in the dot com boom where conpanies with no revenue and no assets were reaching sky-high valuations, now the companies with the largest valuations are huge, multinational companies with insane profits.There is likely no economic downturn that would cause Amazon or Microsoft to go bankrupt for instance.


Second, wealth concentration is at one of the highest levels ever. Now, this is in a lot of cases a bad thing, but it also divorces stocks from economic reality (as we have seen during the corona virus). Back in 2000, there were a lot more ""individual"" investors as a percentage of stock market wealth. So when the economy tumbles, you had a lot of people who HAVE to sell or take money out of retirement accounts in order to get by. If you have more millionaires and billionaires, then even if there is a downturn, they likely only need to readjust, not actually withdraw capital.

A 10-K is one of the best tools to start a fundamental analysis on a company.

Just a lurker here but want to do my part.

Just a lurker here but want to do my part.

So, feel free to add to this list but here are stocks I like - both long and short.

There are two big players:

Google and IBM


Probably a third, China, but of that we do not have a lot of information.

So you say they have 32 quabits. IBM revelead to have 65 and this is already half year old : https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/ibm-promises-1000-qubit-quantum-computer-milestone-2023#:~:text=Today%2C%20IBM%20made%20its%20aspirations,this%20month%2C%20contains%2065%20qubits.

I dont buy that this company is able to compete with IBM or Google. So why would other companies make use of their inferior technology, instead of say IBM.

I am not convinced.

Edit: just read some more on quantum computing. It is not useful for practical cases in its current state. You would neef a computer with several hundred quabits before it can do anything meaningful. Looks like this stock is a looooooong way from that. Source:

I often wonder how much money it would take on some of these stocks to take some PUT positions and then short sell at the right time to create a domino effect. Quietly sell those Puts into a down trend at an extra premium (you over pay when the stock is actively moving in the same direction), buy calls from panic sellers at less than market value then buy to cover your shorts once it has naturally flattened out and start an uptrend.

Rinse and repeat when there is an event that can disguise the behavior. Amzn is starting to flatten and come back up. Their earnings were fantastic and they still sold off. Same with MSFT, AMD etc. I know some are tech but they have numbers that have at least some basis in justifying their valuation.",3,2021-05-07 05:18:38

7204,gxc5mwf,t3_n799ne,"@u/Nrdrage I follow your picks for ideas. First one I shadowed you on was $ISRG. No hard feelings BTW. Anyhow:

BABA - 9/17 270C and 10/15 280C. Both down about 19% at the moment but this is a longer play so we'll see how it pays out. Not worried at the moment as I've seen red and green over the time I've held it.

AAPL - Totally forgot this was on your list but went long after the earning dip at $127 and sold a 6/18 120/125P credit spread. I think the long should be a good entry and I plan on doing the r/thetagang 50% profit move on the spread if this thing flatlines.

BB - I'm holding bags since January but it's a small portion of my portfolio so I'm going to pretend like it doesn't exist and check on it in  2023 or whenever we have flying cars.

CLOV - Couple weeks ago got in on a Thursday at 8 with a few thousand shares and got out the following Monday morning at 11 then watched it fall back to 9 that afternoon. Made me feel like a genius. Pure luck though.

PINS - got in long on an earnings play expecting a beat. Got beat by the fucking CEO saying sales were pulled forward. What a dick.

Keep it up brother! Also, love the snark as much as the picks.

Edit: just read your comments on GS in this post and remembered what you said previously (lol). I looked at the history and agreed with the DD but had a bad feeling considering the market currently defies the laws of physics and I feel like the calendar is off by a month or so.

CLNE June calls... down 75%... still a long way from June and thought about doubling down with June calls today since they were <$0.20 or perhaps at a lower strike.. but didn't execute.. hope i don't regret come monday

BABA shares down 2.5%

BB shares down 1.4%

&#x200B;

PLTR / CLNE were my first try at options and while I knew there was volatility, i didn't realize it would be this crazy... i'm not sure if it's my broker (not in US), but whenever I set limit sells of my options, it could never sell for what I want, even though as I refresh last sell prices, I keep seeing the last prices that meet or exceed my limit... in the end i just sold at market. 

Being burned so bad at my first hand at options, might slow down a bit while I watch for entry with the BABA calls... maybe go for lower strikes to be safe. i definitely also don't have the same ability to be as agile with the scalping.... plus my broker has insane fees for options (almost $10 per option trade + $1 per contract)

I was worried about trying to shorting so went with the options first.. but with these first week results, thinking if i should give it a go on the short side next week or i missed the boat on those (DASH/TSLA/BYND) since my timing is usually horrid",5,2021-05-08 10:44:32
7208,gxcwrfx,t3_n799ne,"Just started following you this last week.  I was doing great last week and then got kicked in the teeth on Shop, Zm, Amzn etc.  Down about 23%.

Added some Clne positions will add more next week if it looks like it has found a bottom but down 50% on Sept $12s.

Jumped into Pltr $22C for May 14th and 21st.  Bleeding.  I should have put stoplosses on it but thought it would go up more the next day.  Saw the exit at about 15% gain but let it ride next day. Lesson learned, always stoploss to secure profit, minimize loss. Hoping for a solid Monday or I will have to cut losses.

Already been in Baba for a while running PMCC, going to expand position and be careful of how far otm the CC are in case it runs.

Same with Aapl.

Added some CAT today.  Going to set stoploss on Monday and see if it will run anymore.  Saw that you just exited. Even right now.

Added KMI, seems to be solid.  PMCC on this one because is seems to be a tortoise stock (slow and steady) with good gains already.

On the wrong side with Tsla, TSM, Pton, Twtr (after drop).  Looking to exit about where you want to short it. TSM seems to be a good PMCC stock because it just hangs around $115 to $122.

Planning to add ON Long and some shorts on PCG, Dash, Bynd, Afrm, Cisco, QS next week.

Also saw a comment earlier that ZM is a buy under $300 but I have been bleeding on it the last week just got out yesterday. Looks like it is in a downward trend down.  Also tech and market hates tech right now, any thoughts? Enter a long position with tight stoploss?",5,2021-05-08 13:08:26

This is why I key into outlier companies in a sector like $NVTA, $CLNE, $BE, etc.   And I want to believe that they can execute that vision.  Which is why I don't fuck with companies like $QS or $FCEL or $NKLA, because I don't think they can ever actually make something.  Or at the very least, I want a company who's story has a lot of tailwinds.  I want to make sure the company is focused on being a company, not virtue signaling social causes that are just distractions.  This is also where I decide if the market agrees with me.  It doesn't matter if I'm right, if the market disagrees with me, the market is right where it counts (money).

&#x200B;

The second thing I do is look at Travelcenters of America.  I start with a daily and expand it out 6 months (used to be a year, but Covid Wall Street isn't useful data), then I go to a 10 minute chart, and I re-chart.  Then I take it down to a 4 and break it into segments.  Finally, I break 2 weeks down into 2 minute charts to confirm.

&#x200B;

THEN I look at the fundamentals.  I don't pay a lot of attention to traditional things like PE ratios, I don't go digging for ""catalysts"" or ""reasons"" why a stock increased in price.  Nobody ever looks for a reason why something dropped, so it always pisses me off when they ask why it will go up after a drop.  I do want to see cash on hand.  I want to see what the debt looks like.  I do care about multiples to a point.   If sentiment is illogically insane ($TSLA) I'll overlook it even if I dislike the company, but if it's too high ($UPST) I'll key in on it as a short play, even if I like the company.  I want to see if they have a dilution problem or an activist investor fucking things up.  I want to see their institutional hold percentage.  I want to see their customer base.

&#x200B;

If they pass all that, then I go into my wildcard stuff t hat doesn't matter to most people.  For one, I have a strict ""no asshole"" policy.  For example, my VC was an early investor into $SQ and I made the decision to liquidate us out of that when the stock was all the way down in the 40's, even though I knew it was going to go much further, simply because Jack Dorsey was the 2nd most vile person I've met in executive management, and I wanted nothing to do with him.  This is also why I'll only ever short $TWTR.  I would never do business with or invest in any company associated with Vlad, or Chamath, etc.  Then I want to see what analysts are covering the company, and I want to make sure these people aren't especially problematic (part of $CLNE's problem is I overlooked that Pavel from RJ was covering them).

&#x200B;

From there it's just a question of studying the charts, looking at volume and order flows, trying to understand how the machines trade the equity and how they behave, etc.  This is very much an art form and not really something I can make a runbook for.  It's very intuitive.  All this is also why I'm so good at catching bottoms, say buy into pain, and completely disregard the adage about not trying to catch a falling knife.  Once you build that intuition, falling knives become good things because you can just instinctively see at a glance where to grab it from.  It's the single greatest skill a trader can have.",61,2021-05-08 14:08:19

7325,gxdbkkf,t1_gxd17dm,"Firstly thanks for the lengthy reply, much appricated! It's really useful to get the insight. 

I might get murdered for this comment but I thought MVIS was a game changer and real innovator in that sense with their products and was drawn in by the DD on the MVIS sub. I work in automotive so understand what kind of benifits their lidar will make to autonomous driving so it resonated with me. The thing I didn't really consider for myself was the overall picture of their finicials and other factors you've mentioned above. I had a brief look and they weren't great at all but I suppose I was blinded by the DD and confirmation bias.

Luckily I unwound the majority of my position on the way down from the last run up and got my original investment back. It could have been a very painful loss if I didn't see one of you comments about a car costing more than their profits üòÇ I think that was the eye opening moment! 

Suppose what I'm trying to say is that if I had some of your other points in my original analysis and if I hadn't been so niave with it in the first place I could have avoided the risk of blowing up my account. Going forward those points will help with any future trades so thankyou for that. 

Having first hand experience of meeting some of the management of these companies must be so useful to see what the companies culture and motivators are like from the top down. I wouldn't have even considered looking at the type of analysists covering companies before investing too as a bad egg could spoil any analysis that comes out. 

I'm interested in who you think is above Jack Dorsey on that list of vile people in management. I can guarantee you knowing that my old team leader Emma from working in a bar at uni is at the top of my list isn't very helpful üòÇ

7333,gxgcsp0,t1_gxcyuvy,">First, completely disregard ""investor concerns about bond yields"" or ""fears about rate hikes"". Those are red herrings. For one, investors don't give a shit about bond yields (and Millennials/zoomers are too young to know this, but back when I first started angel investing near the turn of the century, bond yields were over 6%. Contrarians will point out multiples were a lot lower back then, but the two aren't handcuffed). 


I don't think it's neccesarily concern over bond yields, it is more the inflation that would cause action to adjust rates.  Beyond Berkshire commentary last week, I have friends and family that run businesses where they need to order a *very* broad array of items.  Prices are ramping *extremely* rapidly.  PLUS with Xiden handing out money like a drunk sailor in a whore-house there's no incentive to work.  That poultry shortage (which I knew about weeks ago from a friend who does large-scale ordering) is not from a supply chain thing...it's labor.  They can't find people interested in working 40 hours when they could make 80% of that for 0 hours.   I don't think we're heading in a very good direction right now; sometimes I wonder if we're in the opening stages of a dystopian future.  

I do agree about the yields being still incredibly low; I don't think the average person realizes how Reagan's policies set us up for the next 35+ years of equity run.  If the average person looked at yields in the early 80s they'd have a seizure.  Look at whatever your favorite index is, look at the run it's had since the early/mid 80s, and then try and figure out how much of that is from supression of rates.  70% 80%?  You have people in their 30s now that consider yields above 5% to be anathema, and I *think* that some of them are realizing they should have paid atttention to history, and that foreboding is beginning to seep into the market sentiment, no matter how brain-damaged that thinking is. 

Also, what investors *don't* care about bond yields?  I may have misinterpreted your statement, but as I am reading it, it is basically saying that investors don't care at all what a company's bonds are yielding, or if yields are moving up.  That would be dead-wrong, in my opinion.  That's directly impacting what your investment's cost of capital is going to be, hurdle rates on projects, liquidity (ability to issue at appropriate yields), unlevered cash flows (higher coupon payments on new debt when yields rise), and overall company fiscal health.   Or did you mean that a lot of equity investors are basically dumb-money proto-chimps that don't realize they *should* be paying attention to yields? In which case I agree.",3,2021-05-09 10:13:34

7415,gxjulgf,t1_gxgqmop,">Further, there is no labor shortage. That's a myth. I was talking about this with someone here in the last couple of days, but that whole narrative is a complete lie. In any capitalist system, you have supply and demand. If supply runs short but demand runs high, then capitalism demands that supply be enticed until it equals demand. I recently hired a new security architect for my firm (notable because we don't often hire as people rarely leave), and in my welcome lunch with him, he was telling me how refreshing it was to see someone offer him what he was worth. Turned out he had been getting literally dozens of offers from companies offering him 100-150K a year and a standard rote soft comp package under the guise that ""well, the economy is real tough right now"", when he was worth 3 times that. In a ridiculously in-demand field. Fortunately for him, he had the savings necessary to tell them all to fuck off until I came along. He was legitimately disgusted and insulted by his job search, as he should have been.

I agree with pretty much everything before and after the quoted part above. In the quoted portion though, what you are describing *is* a labor shortage;  by definition, a labor shortage is when employers are not able to find enough qualified individuals for a position at a certain rate.  That rate *is* set by the employers.   That's the literal definition of a labor shortage.  Even if it's a shitty rate.   I'm not sure what industries you focus on (or if you cast a wide net);  for high-end food service I have a connection that runs a large-scale operation.  They pay more now than in 2019, and it's in a small suburb, the rate is good for low/medium skill labor.  They cannot find *anyone* qualified, in some cases they've been turned down cold because people *do* believe the government udder is going to continue to be there.   Is that the *entire* reason they can't find anyone? Absolutely not, but there is a labor shortage, and that is a contributing factor.  

The other factor here is the reorganizing of the economy.  Our economist did a write-up on this last week actually;  ~35% of service businesses that closed during the pandemic remain closed at this juncture, and I *believe* 80% of them are not expected to re-open.  That is going to leave a lot of unemployed capital *and* labor that is going to need to reorganize into new ventures.  That could take time.  There are permanent changes that have happened in our economy (orgs finally fucking realizing you don't need to cram everyone into a soulless office every day), lower mass transit, higher rates of home schooling, more order-in, less dine-out, etc.  There's plenty more.  As the economy reorganizes (and truly, continues to reorganize, since it began reorganizing over a year ago) businesses are going to need new skill-sets, or rather more individuals with certain skill-sets, more than are available right now.  We're at a labor force participation rate of ~[61.75% ](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/labor-force-participation-rate), down from a peak of ~63.4%.  Considering where we were, that rally is nuts, *especially* when you consider that above statistic about service businesses.  Consider this; at least *some* of the population has removed itself from the workforce due to stimulus/unemployment.   That could explain a lot of ~1.65% gap pre and post pandemic in participation rate.   *Pre*-Pandemic we would talk to management teams and almost every one said that the main issue they had was finding qualified labor.  Construction, machinery, transports, it was all the same story.   Now look at the start of this paragraph; the workers that are not participating right now are more likely to have come from those service businesses, and may not be qualified (at ANY rate of pay) for the industrial positions available.  

Having said all of that, I do agree that wages in this country for qualified working/middle-class folks are ridiculous.  I'm not talking about the people wanting 15 bucks for serving fries, that's supposed to be a job for teenagers, not someone trying to support a family.  I found [this](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FT_18.07.26_hourlyWage_adjusted.png) to be the most enlightening exhibit regarding wages.  In 55 years, Americans' buying power has only increased 10%.  However, it is worth noting that this was the case pre-Pandemic as well.  I just don't buy that suddenly people are saying ""no, I'm not taking 60 cents on the dollar"" especially coming out of the Pandemic.  Honestly, I think you're giving WAY too much credit to people here.  It's a depressing thought, but I mean that.  I worked as an industrial psychologist for several years, people just have NO clue how much they are actually worth.  They just think/know it's *more* than they make right now.  A few are disgruntled enough to take 60%-70% of what they made pre-pandemic, via stimulus, and sit on their asses.  I think the rest just aren't qualified for this reorganized economy, nor for many of the industrial jobs that were ramping up pre-pandemic.  I actually have a couple calls this week probing on this issue, and your post has definitely given me food for thought; I'm going to see where the analysts come down, perhaps they'll say my idea is completely off base, but I just don't see this being an issue of people suddenly refusing to work for sub-standard wages.

""Volume cratering due to domestic terrorism""?  ""Volume cratering due to day traders""?  I'm really curious.  

My favorite thing to do for work is fundamental analysis, I love figuring out what the 'story' for any company is.  I love figuring out how to operationalize that into a working model, and then tinkering with different scenarios to see what the output is.  It's like getting to solve a jigsaw puzzle every day.  

This market is making me question if it's worth sticking in the field long-term.  It makes ZERO difference what the story is, if it's playing out, if it's even *better*, etc.  You can have 5%-10% drops in a name based on .001% of the daily volume.  Granted, it was like that 10 years ago as well, but it just seems so...prevalent...now.  Ther market itself seems to be getting carried by 15 or 20 names, which have been vaccuuming up smaller companies for a couple decades now...the connection is gone now.

Within a month or two, buying hard disks will be pointless as the only way to keep a ROI on it will be SSDs (already is), and these in turn will also quickly become obsolete in terms of ROI due to the insane amount of storage added to it, making returns plateauing.

That's when you will get a tsunami wave of individuals dumping their hard drive farms in the second hand market, relieving retail demand for storage space and killing prices.

In other words, the new currency has a spike in storage demand now, but given its trajectory vs. the ROI that is achieved it's very likely to lead to quick dumps of the bought storage space to the second hand market as it's already considered 'late' to enter by individuals. Once people realize that for every day that passes they need additional terabytes of space just to stay in the same ROI, they will get off it quickly.

If the network continues growing at the rate that it is, we may see all of this complete before this quarter is over. 

In summary, this is the most profitable currency until the network hits 50 exabytes, in which case it becomes the second most profitable UNLESS EIP 1559 hurts mining in which case it can remain the most profitable for much longer.

7553,gyumuu7,t1_gyuk2oa,"Because I was interested in the new currency, and when I learned about it and went to buy some hardware for it, I found it was all sold out or extremely overpriced. I thought jeez these companies must be making a killing, so I looked into buying stock in those companies. 

I checked out Seagate first since they were strictly HDD but my broker isnt able to clear Seagate shares (Canadian stuff) but I could buy WDC. I went through their history, financials, leadership and learned about their company, and it's pretty stellar. I waited through the earnings call and was surprised that it wasn't mentioned even once, and based on the sideways trading over the past 3 months, there hasn't been a significant reaction from the market yet. Sooner or later, people will learn just how much WDC is making and when that happens they will see the stock is undervalued and they will buy in. If you want to buy in before that happens, now is a good time.",7,2021-05-21 02:10:14
7554,gywcpf7,t1_gyvug19,"The opposite is true - hard drives use very low amounts of power, like 5-7 watts. For reference, gpus use like 100-300 watts. As the network grows, the environmental impact will grow too, but you would need 20 hard drives minimum to equal 1 GPU. Asics for b*tco√Øn are even worse. I did some analysis on this when the netspace was around 5 exabytes and at that time the ratio of power used (ballpark figures  & napkin math of course) was like 10,000:300:1 for b*itco√Øn : Athareum : chia.

Also,you need additional hardware as to make this a decent revenue scheme you need several computers and quite a lot of hard disks. It's not only storage space that's a cost, unless you are talking about making a couple hundred bucks a month.

Given the attention this is getting I suspect it will become unprofitable to all but those with deep pockets soon, just like proof of work has become. It's a natural consequence. Unless you pick a currency at its infancy, trying to jump inboard once it gets hyped is a waste of money. Better trade it than try to earn it. Just my view. Who knows.",1,2021-05-21 06:02:20

Secondly, it doesnt necessarily matter for whom is it most profitable. An at-home farmer that needs to set up a 2k rig and only buys 1k in hard drives might not make back their investment very quick, but if whales that are already established buy the new hard drives then it doesn't matter. A sale is a sale. Lastly, I know 20/TB seems insane right now but thats literally what it was before around april 20th ish. That just speaks to the insane demand of this whole thing. If supply is meeting demand, expect around $20/TB",1,2021-05-21 07:31:08
7565,gywab6i,t1_gyvj18k,Proof of Work is unprofitable for most people because of ASICS and because Proof of Work is most viable for people with access to cheap unlimited electricity. There is a new PoW called randomx that uses CPUs because it rotates the mining algorithm on a regular basis which nullifies ASICS. Proof of Space Time does not suffer from economies of scale like PoW does. The profitability can certainly decrease but major players and home miners should have ROIs that are much closer to each other because they are not using specialized components.

7740,h3ds7mw,t3_o9q22o,"Well, VIAC is my largest stock position by equity, so my thoughts won‚Äôt come as a surprise:

I think the negativity is overblown. They do own some pretty good content. At the end of the day that‚Äôs what matters most. Anyone can get a streaming platform. (With enough money and work, naturally.) 

I originally bought into them right after Viacom and CBS remerged. Though, I had temptations in both singular companies at first. Just didn‚Äôt have enough ‚Äòuhmf.‚Äô 

The fact they are together again peaked my interest the most. I think people underestimate them too much, mainly because you‚Äôre high off Disney and Netflix‚Äôs fumes. I think they‚Äôre a solid company that‚Äôs doubted too much. 

I held through the onslaught it had in 2020. Bought more shares in the process. Sold off half my stake when the rally blasted off unexpectedly. (A bit early but hey, $80-$95 was damn good tendies.) 

After the implosion, bought back my half back, plus some. I intend to hang on to them for quite a while. Definitely very bullish. 

I like IBM quite a bit too. Own them too. A larger position of mine. Similar to VIAC, not loved much and overlooked. I think with the increasing technology advancements they‚Äôll get their fair share of the pie.",5,2021-06-29 08:00:42

While true, the management went through an overhaul in the end of last year with a new CEO and a lot of senior leadership changing, they have been choosing markets to compete in and seem to be succesful currently in doing that.

The company has a 150 year history with a lot of pivoting and their R&D is currently arguably the best it's ever been, their target markets are looking to boom as enterprise 5G is only growing bigger.

It's a great stock to speculate on right now as there is potentially a lot of upside to the company and limited downside... but there is no risk free money in the market",1,2021-06-30 17:49:14

The company doesn't seem to have that much debt so what in the fuck are they doing with the money they raised?

7945,hokdwsh,t1_hoh3x8p,"Companies like Arista Networks and Ciena make networking equipment with 400G ports that can take optical pluggable transceivers. These transceivers contain the sort of optics that Lightwave Logic makes. So these companies would be customers, or customer‚Äôs customers (if they buy their optics from a transceiver integrator like Lumentum or Finisar). Arista makes Ethernet switches which have 400G ports on the front panel. You can plug copper cables into these ports to connect equipment a few meters away. But if you need to go longer, you plug in an optical transceiver to convert to an optical signal. The transceiver is where a LWLG modulator would be. In a way, you can think of the pluggable transceiver as a high-end analog of the adapters that plug into laptops to convert from USB to USB-C or HDMI, etc. Ciena makes transport systems that similarly have ports that our optics would plug into.",7,2021-12-15 05:59:18

Realistically if I had been holding a ton of shares between .20 and $1 and it's at 15 I'm taking some profit here and now even if it's looking like double the current price in a year if all goes right. Not unloading completely, but locking in the post work retirement funds early. I really believe this ticker is flying because they are at the tail end of a long set plan of getting their tech to market. It's been their goal forever and unless they run out of patent runway I believe they are trending strong. 100% correct about patents being expenses not assets, but that logic I feel only applies to monster producing entities. This industry hates to licence anything vs have it in house which is part of why this company has taken so long to get to this point now where they are a few deals away from becoming real players. Up till now it's been theoretical and involvement with foundries brings some level of previously unseen legitimacy to their claims for the past 20 years. Just my opinion! This stock also has a cult religious following and lots of support at various levels that were only seen in this year's run up. It's been pretty resilient in the past few weeks of down days across the market which I think works heavily against trying to time a drop here buying 4DTE puts.

But‚Ä¶spend 10 minutes going through my comment history. LWLG has been my baby for nearly 15 years. 

Smart money appears to be moving in on it. It all started in May when the company gave their first hard guidance on what their commercialization path looked like. 

In terms of this industry being shady‚Ä¶yea you‚Äôre probably right. Luckily management at LWLG is very experienced. I also like the fact that LWLG so far is partnering with USA/European companies. 

The Chairman of the Board/former CEO of LWLG, Tom Zelibor, served as Director of Global Operations, U.S. Strategic Command during 9/11 and oversaw the entire Pacific carrier fleet operations during that time. At one point he had the highest security clearance in the country. AND HE‚ÄôS ON OUR SIDE. 

Terry Turpin, former close advisor to LWLG, was the Chief of Advanced Processing Technologies for the NSA during his tenure. While Terry has since retired, its another clue on the type of people who helped advance LWLG over the years. 

I could keep going‚Ä¶there‚Äôs many impressive people with us.
